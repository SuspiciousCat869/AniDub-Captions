1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,333
- MY NAME'S NINA AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE, ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,708
AT LEAST I WAS, UNTIL
ONE DAY.

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,458
I ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWED
SOMETHING CALLED

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,625
THE CRYSTAL PEARL WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,041
AND MY LIFE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,708
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,833
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

8
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,583
AND THE TEAM OF TWO EXAMINEES
WHO ARE ABLE

9
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,750
TO TRACK IT DOWN FIRST
WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

10
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,041
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,250
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,500
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,625
- HUH?

14
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,958
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,041
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,166
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST IS OVER.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,250
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH OVER
HER UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

18
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,458
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,666
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,250
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,875
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

22
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,333
REALLY?

23
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,375
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

24
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,416
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,208
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THEY MAY BE,

26
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,833
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

27
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,916
THESE TWO
ARE HERE TO PROTECT ME.

28
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,708
- HEY,
I TOLD YOU I WANTED THAT PIECE.

29
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,083
- NO WAY!
THIS ONE IS MINE.

30
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,833
- JUST GIVE IT TO ME NOW.

31
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,708
- I'M SURE THERE'S MORE OF IT.

32
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,041
- YOU GOT THE LAST ONE!

33
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,041
- I REALLY WISH THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD STOP ARGUING FOR ONCE.

34
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,458
YOU'RE BOTH DISTURBING
THE OTHER CUSTOMERS.

35
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,083
- ZERO STARTED IT!
- NINA STARTED IT!

36
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,416
( both grunting )

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,625
- MMMM!

38
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,625
OH, THAT WAS SO DELICIOUS.
MAY I HAVE PLEASE HAVE ANOTHER?

39
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,208
- HEY, GUYS,
I SAID KNOCK IT OFF.

40
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,083
- Zura: ZURA!

41
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,916
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
GET OUTTA HERE!

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,666
- All: YES, SIR.

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,083
- HMM.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN.

44
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,291
- RATHER NONCHALANT
FOR EXAMINEES

45
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,125
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SORCERY
TEST. DON'T YOU AGREE?

46
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,791
- YES, THEY'VE GROWN
TOO RELAXED

47
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,541
WITH
THEIR CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES.

48
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,708
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
FOR ME TO TURN UP THE TENSION

49
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,791
AND SEE HOW THEY RESPOND.

50
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,416
SO SHALL WE PAY THEM A VISIT?
- SURE.

51
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,375
- TO THE HUMAN WORLD, THEN.

52
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,208
( laughing )

53
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:57,208
- AH!  WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS
HELP ME PAY FOR IT?

54
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,958
- YOU BROKE THE STUFF.

55
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,583
- NO, YOU'RE TO BLAME
FOR THIS AS WELL, ZERO.

56
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,833
- HA HA!
YOU GOT OWNED.

57
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,250
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
- ( both groaning )

58
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,666
- WHY DOES IT HAVE TO
BE LIKE THIS?

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,208
ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS EAT SOME CAKE

60
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,125
AND TALK TO THEM
A LITTLE WHILE.

61
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,666
- ( all grunting )

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,166
Zero: NINA!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

63
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,666
- ( all shouting )

64
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,875
- Zero: SAN, FORTE!

65
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,375
- OH, I'M SO AMAZINGLY HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, MY DARLING.

66
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,666
OH, MY ICHII!
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

67
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,708
YOU'RE GONNA TRY
TO STEAL NINA AGAIN.

68
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,916
- WE'RE NOT! WE WERE JUST
ABDUCTED BY SOME WEIRDO.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,041
- WHAT WEIRDO?

70
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,583
- EXCUSE ME, BUT I TAKE OFFENSE
TO YOU CALLING ME A WEIRDO.

71
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,875
( laughing )

72
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,625
YOU MAY ADDRESS ME AS WILL.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL SORCERER.

73
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,750
WHAT'S MORE,

74
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,625
I AM AN INSPECTOR SENT FROM
THE SORCERY TEST HEADQUARTERS.

75
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,333
- AND WHY EXACTLY
DID THEY SEND YOU HERE?

76
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,291
- HEY, WAIT, THE TEST
ISN'T CLOSE TO BEING OVER.

77
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,166
WE HAVE TILL THE END
OF THE YEAR.

78
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,708
- TRUE, YOU STILL HAVE SEVERAL
MONTHS TO COMPLETE YOUR FINALS.

79
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,208
BUT I'VE GATHERED YOU ALL HERE
TODAY TO TAKE A MID-TERM EXAM.

80
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,375
- All: WHAT?!
A MID-TERM EXAM?

81
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,833
- AND, IF FOR ANY
REASON YOU'RE UNABLE

82
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,375
TO PASS THE MID-TERM TODAY,

83
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:25,208
YOU WILL BE DISQUALIFIED.
- NOBODY TOLD US ABOUT THIS.

84
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,666
- THAT'S RIGHT. AND WHAT IS
THIS MID-TERM EXAM ABOUT ANYWAY?

85
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,375
- HMM, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
NINA?

86
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,416
AM I CORRECT IN ASSUMING

87
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,458
THAT YOU SWALLOWED
THE CRYSTAL PEARL?

88
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,041
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

89
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,416
- THEN MAY I PLEASE ASK
FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE?

90
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,000
- WHAT?

91
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,166
- YOU ARE THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART.

92
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,000
- NO WAY!

93
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,166
( grunts )

94
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,791
- THE OBJECTIVE
OF THIS MID-TERM IS SIMPLE.

95
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,000
YOU MUST RETRIEVE NINA FROM ME
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

96
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,708
THE TEAM THAT MANAGES
TO GET HER BACK BY SUNSET

97
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,750
WILL PASS THE MID-TERM EXAM.

98
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,208
THOSE WHO FAIL TO DO SO
WILL BE DISQUALIFIED.

99
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,166
SO GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.
( laughs )

100
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,791
- Both: NINA!

101
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,958
NINA!
- WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

102
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,083
- YEAH, WE'LL ALL FAIL THE TEST
IF WE DON'T GET NINA BACK.

103
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,791
- THEN, I GUESS...
- WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE!

104
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,666
- All: WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
TO GET HER BACK.

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,291
All: WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER!
WE'RE COMING TO HELP TOO!

106
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,791
COUNT US IN!
WAIT!  NINA!

107
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,791
- ( Will laughing )

108
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,625
THIS BUILDING LOOKS ORDINARY
TO THE NAKED EYE,

109
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,541
BUT BARRIERS SURROUND IT
SO THAT NO ONE MAY ENTER.

110
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,416
IN OTHER WORDS,
THIS IS MY FORTIFIED CASTLE.

111
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,416
AND I GUESS THAT MAKES YOU
MY CAPTURED PRINCESS.

112
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,375
SO HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

113
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,875
- YEAH, COULD YOU
REMIND ME AGAIN--

114
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,541
WHY EXACTLY DO I HAVE TO WEAR
THIS RIDICULOUS OUTFIT?

115
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,333
- I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.

116
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,166
IT'S ONLY COSTUME,
BUT IT DID SEEM APPROPRIATE.

117
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,333
THIS IS JUST A PROP TOO.
- LET ME OUTTA HERE!

118
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,583
- JUST SHUT UP.

119
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,000
- WHAT?
DID THAT CAT JUST SPEAK TO ME?

120
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:09,166
- I TOLD YOU TO STOP TALKING.
AND HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A CAT?

121
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,666
MY NAME IS AQUAMARINE

122
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,708
AND I'M WILL'S
FABULOUS APPRENTICE.

123
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,125
- WAIT, THEN THAT MEANS
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ZURA, RIGHT?

124
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,000
- AH, NO DEAR,

125
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,208
I'M A PROFESSIONAL
SORCERER'S HELPER.

126
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,500
THAT THING
IS JUST AN EXAMINEE'S ASSISTANT.

127
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,791
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE HERE ALREADY.

128
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,833
AND SO NOW IT BEGINS.

129
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,833
- ( all panting )
- I FOUND HER, ZURA.

130
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,000
NINA'S IN THAT BUILDING,
I'M SURE OF IT.

131
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,666
- HE'S RIGHT.
I CAN SENSE HER.

132
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,958
I CAN SENSE NINA'S PRESENCE.

133
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,708
I'M COMING!
- ZERO, WAIT.

134
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,125
- NO, DON'T DO IT!
ZERO!

135
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,125
- AHHHH!

136
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,500
- HE'S FORMED A MAGICAL BARRIER
AROUND THE BUILDING.

137
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,541
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT?

138
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,125
- Will: YOU SHOULD'VE REALIZED
IT YOURSELF, ZERO.

139
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,333
- Ichii: INSPECTOR.

140
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,666
- THAT'S IT! I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE A PRO OR NOT.

141
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,750
DO YOU HEAR ME?

142
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,916
- NO, ZERO!
- NO, WAIT!  COME BACK.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,166
ZERO!

144
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,208
- AHHHH!

145
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,250
- I THINK YOU AND I
REALLY NEED TO HAVE A TALK.

146
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,541
- I'M NOT ABOUT TALKING!
I'M ABOUT ACTION.

147
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,375
- Will:
ACTION AGAINST A HOLOGRAM?

148
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,916
WELL, I SUPPOSE I HAVE TO GIVE
YOU AT LEAST A LITTLE CREDIT

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,166
FOR MANAGING TO FIND THIS PLACE
SO QUICKLY.

150
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,541
AND NOW AS I'M SURE
YOU ARE AWARE,

151
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,333
BOTH NINA AND I ARE ON THE
TOP FLOOR OF THIS BUILDING.

152
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,708
TO GET TO US, YOU'LL HAVE TO
KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU

153
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,916
AND USE YOUR ABILITIES

BECAUSE, BELIEVE ME,

156
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,333
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.
( laughs )

157
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,416
- Zero: NO WAY.
- Ichii: LET'S GET STARTED.

158
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,208
- Zura: FIRST WE HAVE TO
BREAK THE BARRIER

159
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,875
THAT'S SURROUNDING THE BUILDING.

160
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,666
- EVERYBODY STAY BACK.
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

LET'S GO.
- YEAH.

164
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,916
- HMM.
THAT WAS MOST IMPRESSIVE.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,833
BUT STILL, I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
THAT YOUR FRIENDS

166
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,500

00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,458
I HAVE PREPARED FOR THEM.

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,375
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

174
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,708
WHY DO SORCERERS
NEED TO TAKE A QUIZ?

175
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,875
- THIS IS A TEST TO
DETERMINE YOUR ABILITY

176
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,125
TO THINK UNDER PRESSURE.

177
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,125
THE QUESTIONS WON'T BE EASY,
SO BE PREPARED.

178
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,791

WHAT TYPE OF DOCTOR
IS MOST HATED?

00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,583
- DENTIST?
- All: OH!

184
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,416
- THAT IS CORRECT.

185
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
WHICH MEANS THE TEAM
OF GOU AND ROKKA

186
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,041
ARE THE FIRST TO PASS THE QUIZ.

192
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,958
- IS IT SHORTCAKE?

193
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,875
- DING DING DING DING.
YOU ARE CORRECT.

194
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,041
TEAM ZERO AND ICHII
HAVE PASSED.

195
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,875

CAN WE EAT NOW?

201
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,375
- DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WAIT?

202
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,500
WE REALLY HAVE TO
FOCUS ON THIS QUIZ.

203
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,416
- AW!

204
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,583

PAN MEANS BREAD IN JAPANESE.

206
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,708
WHAT KIND OF PAN
CAN YOU NOT EAT?

207
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,583
- YES!
THIS IS AN EASY ONE.

208
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:56,458
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

209
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,541
BECAUSE-- BECAUSE IT
CAN'T BE ANYTHING ELSE.

210
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,708
IT JUST HAS TO BE!

211
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,833
- I'LL REPEAT THE QUESTION
ONE MORE TIME.

212
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,583
IN JAPANESE, WHAT KIND OF PAN
CAN YOU NOT EAT?

213
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,416
- FRYING.

214
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,416
- I WANT SOME FRIED CHICKEN,
PLEASE.

215
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,291
- AH!
- ( buzzer sounds )

216
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,666
- THAT IS INCORRECT. THE
CORRECT ANSWER IS FRYING PAN.

217
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,875
- OH, NO! SAN SAID SHE
WANTED TO EAT FRIED CHICKEN.

218
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,791
SHE WASN'T ANSWERING YOU.

219
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,166
- I'M SORRY, BUT THE TWO OF
YOU HAVE BEEN DISQUALIFIED.

220
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,583
- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT, SAN!

221
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,000
- Zero: I HAVE TO SAVE HER.
I HAVE TO.

222
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,791
I DON'T CARE WHAT OBSTACLES
WE HAVE TO OVERCOME.

223
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,000
- GOOD LUCK, ZERO.
PLEASE HURRY.

224
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,083
- ( girl screaming )
- WAS THAT ROKKA'S VOICE?

225
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,083
- LET'S GO!

226
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,083

227
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,833
- WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU!

228
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,208
- JUST LOOK
AT OUR AMAZING MUSCLES!

229
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,958
- AND NOW
FOR THE SECOND CHALLENGE,

230
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,958
YOU MUST TRY
TO DEFEAT THESE MACHO MEN.

231
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,208
- BUT THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH MAGIC.

232
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,041
- THIS TEST WILL DETERMINE

233
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,625
IF YOU TRULY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO CONTINUE.

234
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,208
- TRANSFORM MAGIC! ASSUMING
THE SHAPE OF AN ELEPHANT.

235
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,958
- UM, WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AGAIN?

236
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,833
- DOI!
A MIGHTY ELEPHANT.

237
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,208
- OKAY.

238
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,750
- I DO LOOK LIKE AN
ELEPHANT, DON'T I?

239
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,916
PRETTY DARN IMPRESSIVE,
ISN'T IT?

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,750
- ( all grunting )

241
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,208
- ROKKA,
YOU'RE A BIT OFF THE MARK.

242
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,083
TRY AGAIN, QUICK.

243
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,833
- TA-DA!
- WE'VE GOT YOU NOW.

244
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:33,000
- ( Rokka screaming )

245
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,291
- OH, NO!  DON'T WORRY.
I'LL CATCH YOU, LADY ROKKA.

246
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,083
- OH!

247
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,666
- Will: THE GOU AND ROKKA TEAM
ARE NOW DISQUALIFIED.

248
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,666
- OH, YEAH!
THAT'S RIGHT.  WE RULE!

249
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,416
- ZERO,
THESE GUYS MAY SEEM STUPID,

250
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,958
BUT YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE
WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.

251
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,708
SO BE CAREFUL.
- OH, I CAN HANDLE THEM.

252
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,666
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME, ICHII.

253
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,125
- SURE THING.

254
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,291
- NOW THEN, WHO WANTS
TO PLAY ROUGH?

255
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,291
HAAA!

256
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,041
HERE I COME!

257
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,250
DESTRUCTION MAGIC!

258
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,666
HITTING KNUCKLE!

259
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,041
OH, YEAH.
THAT FELT GOOD.

260
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,500
- WELL DONE!
YOU PASSED THE ROUND.

261
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,833
ZERO AND ICHII, YOU MAY PROCEED
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

262
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,750
- ALL RIGHT!
THEY SHOULD BE HERE IN NO TIME.

263
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,250
- Will: I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT, NINA.

264
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,625
FOR THE TEST
ISN'T OVER QUITE YET.

265
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,583
THERE'S STILL ONE FINAL
CHALLENGE THEY MUST PASS.

266
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,750
AFTER THE MENTAL
AND PHYSICAL OBSTACLES,

267
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,166
A SINGLE TEST REMAINS.

268
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,000
- WHAT'S THAT?

269
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,416
- ( roaring )

270
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,125
- A DRAGON?

271
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,375
- YEAH.
AND A REALLY BIG ONE TOO.

272
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,625
- ( roaring )
- WELL, ZERO AND ICHII,

273
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,916
DO YOU BELIEVE
YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

274
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,916
TO OVERCOME MY THIRD
AND FINAL CHALLENGE?

275
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,041
- ZERO!  ICHII, NO!
- READY?

276
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:15,750
- YEAH.

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
- ( roaring )

278
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,000
- YOU GUYS, BE CAREFUL!

279
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,125
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

280
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,291
- ( Will laughing )

281
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,625
I MUST SAY,

282
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,958
I'M PRETTY DISAPPOINTED
IN THIS YEAR'S EXAMINEES.

283
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,541
- WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

284
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,333
ZERO AND ICHII ARE
AWESOME, OKAY?

285
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,500
- REALLY?
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING?

286
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,791
- I KNOW THAT THEY'LL SUCCEED.

287
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,000
THEY'LL PASS YOUR TEST AND THEN
THEY'LL RESCUE ME, YOU GOT IT?

288
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,625
- I'M NOT SO SURE.
WEREN'T YOU FIGHTING EARLIER?

289
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,333
HONESTLY,

290
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,250
ARE YOU REALLY SO CONFIDENT
THAT THOSE TWO

291
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,416
WILL RISK THEIR LIVES
TO RESCUE SOMEONE

292
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,000
WHO DOES NOTHING
BUT ARGUE WITH THEM?

293
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,625
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT THEY WILL.

294
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,541
- YEAH,
BUT ZERO AND ICHII PROMISED

295
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,541
THAT THEY WOULD BOTH
PROTECT ME.

296
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,041
- I SEE.
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE THE FIGHT.

297
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,083
- SHUT UP!
YOU DON'T KNOW.

298
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,875
I HAVE FAITH IN MY FRIENDS.
THEY'LL SAVE ME.

299
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,083
- HA.  FINE, THEN.

300
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,833
IF YOU'RE SURE THAT YOU'RE
RIGHT, THEN LET'S SEE.

301
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,333
LET'S TEST YOUR TRUST.

302
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:35,750
- BUT, WILL, THAT WAS NOT A
PART OF OUR ORIGINAL PLAN.

303
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,500
- WHAT ARE YOU--

304
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,458
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY NOW?

305
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,000
- ( squeaking )

306
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,125
( thinking )
MY VOICE-- MY VOICE IS GONE.

307
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,791
BUT HOW?

308
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,000
- AND NOW WE'LL FINALLY SEE

309
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,125
IF YOU CAN TRUST YOUR FRIENDS
AS MUCH AS YOU THINK YOU CAN.

310
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:04,083
WELL, ZERO AND ICHII,
NINA IS CALLING TO YOU.

311
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,500
COME TO HER.
TRY TO SAVE HER.

312
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,875
( laughing )

313
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,500
- LET'S GO.
WE HAVE TO FIND HER.

314
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,708
- EVEN IF IT'S A TRAP,
NINA NEEDS OUR HELP!

315
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,250
- ARE YOU OKAY?

316
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,375
- ( grunting )

317
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,875
- NINA?
- Will: SHE CAN'T TALK.

318
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,833
- WHY?
- SHE MADE A PACT WITH ME.

319
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,291
I'VE AGREED TO LET YOU
PASS THE TEST

320
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,166
IN EXCHANGE FOR NINA'S VOICE.
- IT CAN'T BE!

321
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,166
- THE DEAL IS FINAL.
NOW TAKE YOUR FRIEND BACK.

322
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,166
HERE.
- WHAT'RE YOU SAYING?

323
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,083
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT IS IT?

324
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,125
- ( thinking )
IT'S NOT TRUE, YOU GUYS.

325
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,458
I NEVER MADE A DEAL WITH HIM.

326
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,458
- SHE SAW
THAT YOU WERE STRUGGLING

327
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,583
WHEN YOU WERE
BATTLING THE DRAGON,

328
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,791
SO NINA BEGGED ME
TO STOP THE EXAMINATION.

329
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,583
SHE THOUGHT THAT
YOU COULDN'T DEFEAT THE DRAGON,

330
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,416
SO SHE GAVE HER VOICE
IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR LIVES.

331
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,333
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!
I BELIEVE IN BOTH OF YOU.

332
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,125
- SHE REALLY
IS QUITE A SWEET LITTLE GIRL.

333
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,208
THANKS TO HER,
YOU TWO HAVE PASSED.

334
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,416
WELL DONE.
- ( thinking ) IT'S NOT TRUE.

335
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,166
ZERO, ICHII,
HE'S LYING, I SWEAR.

336
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,750
- MAN!
THIS ISN'T GOOD AT ALL.

337
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:26,500
WE MADE A PROMISE TO HER--
TO PROTECT NINA NO MATTER WHAT.

338
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,416
- YEAH, BUT EVEN
IF WE PASS THE TEST,

339
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,083
IF NINA ISN'T SAFE,
IT'S POINTLESS.

340
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,625
- ENOUGH!

341
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,875
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU GET
AWAY WITH THIS, YOU SLIME BAG.

342
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,041
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE HER VOICE BACK ALREADY?

343
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,250
- COME COME, RELAX.

344
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,166
YOU HAVE UNTIL SUNSET
TO RETRIEVE HER VOICE.

345
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,125
AND SINCE
I'M FEELING GENEROUS,

346
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,833
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO OPTIONS
TO CHOOSE FROM.

347
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,458
- WHAT ARE THEY?
- NINA'S VOICE IS RIGHT HERE.

348
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,458
IF YOU LIKE,
I CAN GIVE IT TO YOU NOW

349
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,583
AND WE'LL CALL
THE WHOLE THING OFF.

350
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,083
BUT THEN THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD HAVE TO DROP OUT

351
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,083
OF THE SORCERY TEST FOR GOOD.

352
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,250
SO WHAT WILL IT BE?
SORCERY OR HER?

353
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,250
- Both: THAT'S NOT--
- NOT WHAT?

354
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,416
- ( thinking )
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?

355
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,041
- IT'S YOUR MOVE.
ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH THE TEST

356
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,083
OR GIVE NINA HER VOICE BACK?
TELL ME.

357
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,958
- WELL THEN,
I GUESS WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

358
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,208
WE MADE A PROMISE TO NINA
AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO BREAK IT.

359
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,000
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION.

360
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,583
- YES?
- I GUESS WE--

361
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,000
- WANT BOTH!

362
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,333
- EXCUSE ME?

363
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,333
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HEARD US.

364
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,958
LET'S GO.

365
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,583
- YEAH!
LET'S TAKE THIS GUY DOWN.

366
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,583
DESTRUCTION MAGIC!
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

367
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,375
- MAGIC CANNON!

368
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,541
- DOPPLER CAPSULE!

369
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,083
- I SEE.
YOU'RE PLANNING ON DEFEATING ME

370
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,833
THEN GETTING HER VOICE BACK.

371
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,541
I SUPPOSE THAT COULD BE
AN OPTION AS WELL.

372
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,500
BUT...

373
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,875
YOU'RE TOO WEAK.
- OH, YEAH?

374
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,458
- WE'RE NOT DONE.
DESTRUCTION MAGIC!

375
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,250
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

376
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,750
- ( Will laughing )

377
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,125
- THIS GUY IS REALLY STRONG.
- OF COURSE I AM.

378
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,833
YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT ME.

379
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,333
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE JUST AMATEURS.
I AM A PROFESSIONAL.

380
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,416
- WHAT DO WE DO?

381
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,541
- ZERO, FOCUS YOUR
TECHNIQUES ON ME.

382
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,541
- WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

383
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,875
- IT'LL BE FINE.
I HAVE AN IDEA.

384
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,333
I'LL MAKE IT WORK.
- BUT--

385
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,833
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

386
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,666
- OKAY. JUST DON'T BLAME ME
WHEN IT ALL GOES WRONG.

387
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,875
- FINE.
- LET'S HOPE THIS THING WORKS.

388
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:40,916
- COME ON!

389
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,125
- DESTRUCTION MAGIC!

390
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,875
AHHH!

391
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,041
MAGIC CANNON!

392
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,458
TAKE THAT!

393
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,125
ICHII!
- Will: INSANE.

394
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,041
WHY IN THE WORLD IS ZERO
ATTACKING HIS OWN PARTNER?

395
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,166
- GOTCHA.
YOU FELL FOR IT.

396
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,583
- WHAT?  NO.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

397
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,333
ZERO ISN'T TRYING
TO ATTACK ME.

398
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,250
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THIS IS AN
EXERCISE IN TRUSTING EACH OTHER

399
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,416
AND WORKING TOGETHER.

400
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,541
- OH!
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

401
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,000
THEY MUST'VE SUCKED THE MAGIC
CANNON ATTACK INTO THE CAPSULE

402
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,125
AND CONCENTRATED ITS FORCE
INTO THE SMALL SPACE.

403
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:47,000
THOSE TWO MUST BE MORE
POWERFUL THAN I EVER IMAGINED.

404
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,041
AHHH!

405
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,625
- I'VE GOT IT!
IT'S YOUR VOICE!

406
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,625
- THEY DID IT.

407
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,875
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS BEATEN
BY TWO AMATEURS.

408
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,375
IMPRESSIVE.

409
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,916
- SWALLOW THIS, NINA.

410
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,375
- THAT'S IT.

411
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,833
- MY VOICE, IT'S BACK.

412
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,166
- NINA!
YOU CAN TALK NOW.

413
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,708
- IT'S REALLY BACK.

414
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,375
- I'M GLAD THAT
YOU'RE SAFE, NINA.

415
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,583
- THANK YOU.
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

416
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,666
I ALWAYS BELIEVED.

417
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,375
I NEVER DOUBTED THAT YOU'D
RESCUE ME FOR ONE MINUTE. NEVER.

418
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,458
ZERO!
- DON'T WORRY.

419
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,208
- 'CAUSE WE ALREADY KNEW
THAT YOU HAD FAITH IN US, NINA.

420
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,333
- ZERO, ICHII,
YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME.

421
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,791
- Both: THANK YOU, NINA.

422
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,250
- I UNDERSTAND
THAT IT WAS YOUR STRATEGY.

423
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,791
BUT WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

424
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,250
YOU'VE GOT TO BE THE BIGGEST
FOOLS I'VE EVER SEEN

425
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,375
FOR ATTACKING EACH OTHER
LIKE THAT.

426
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,000
IT DID WORK, THOUGH,
BECAUSE YOU TRUST EACH OTHER.

427
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,916
WITHOUT THAT SPECIAL BOND,
YOUR ATTACK WOULD HAVE FAILED.

428
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,875
AND YOU DEFEATED ME.
SO NOW, ZERO, ICHII,

429
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,791
IT'S MY PLEASURE TO ANNOUNCE

430
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,000
THAT YOU'VE PASSED
THE MID-TERM EXAM.

431
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,750
I'VE NEVER SEEN MAGIC
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

432
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,541
- Zero: REALLY?
- THANKS.

433
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,958
- YOU TWO ARE BOTH
TRULY SKILLED SORCERERS.

434
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,291
AND NOW,
SINCE I'M SUCH AN AMAZING GUY,

435
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,041
I SUPPOSE I'LL ALLOW ALL YOUR
FRIENDS TO PASS THE MID-TERM.

436
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,375
THEY SHOW REAL DETERMINATION.

437
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:22,875
SINCE THEY REFUSE
TO GIVE UP,

438
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,208
I'VE DECIDED TO GIVE THEM
A SECOND CHANCE.

439
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,083
THEIR PERSISTENCE HAS PAID OFF

440
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,041
AND NOW THEY WILL CONTINUE
ON WITH THE FINAL EXAM.

441
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,000
THEIR DREAM OF
BECOMING SORCERERS

442
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,000
IS STILL A POSSIBILITY.

443
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,250
AND JUST LIKE YOU,

444
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,833
YOUR FRIENDS WILL NEVER GIVE UP
ON THEIR DREAM.

445
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,291
THEY'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT
FOR WHAT THEY WANT,

446
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,333
REGARDLESS
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

447
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,375
AND I RESPECT THAT.

448
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,791
I SEE HOW HARD THEY'LL WORK
TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS.

449
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,916
SO I WILL ALLOW THEM
TO PASS THE MID-TERM

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,583
AND CONTINUE WITH THEIR ATTEMPT
TO PASS THE FINAL EXAM.

451
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,416
AND BESIDES, THE MORE
THE MERRIER, I ALWAYS SAY.

452
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,708
SO THAT MEANS ALL THREE TEAMS
WILL REMAIN IN THE COMPETITION.

453
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,833
EVERYONE'S QUALIFIED.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL.

454
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,416
- All: HUH?
- AND THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP.

455
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,000
ADIEU.

456
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,625
- Zero: WILL!

457
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,166
- San: SO DOES THAT MEAN
WE PASSED THE TEST, FO?

458
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,333
- YEAH.
- WE DID IT!

459
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:18,416
NOW I CAN STAY HERE IN THE
HUMAN WORLD WITH MY ICHII.

460
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,708
- San: HEY, NINA?
- WHAT?

461
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,416
- DO YOU WANNA PLAY A GAME?
- All: LET'S DO IT!

462
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,333
- YOU MEAN YOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY
GONNA CONTINUE TO CHASE ME?

463
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:29,166
AFTER ALL OF THIS?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

464
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,000
WE'RE NOT GONNA STOP, EVER!
- WHAT?  EVER?

465
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:38,000
EVER IS SUCH A LONG TIME.
( crying )

466
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:44,791
OKAY, THAT'S IT! SOMEBODY GET
THIS PEARL OUT OF ME ALREADY!

467
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,791
- Ichii: HEY, NINA.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

468
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,708
- Nina: THIS CHALLENGE
WILL TEST YOUR COURAGE.

469
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,166
RUMOR HAS IT THAT IF YOU CONFESS
YOUR LOVE TO YOUR PARTNER,

470
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,791
THEN THE RELATIONSHIP
WILL LAST FOREVER.

471
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,625
- Zero: HEY, WHAT THE
HECK ARE YOU?

472
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,500
- Yakumo: WE'RE GHOSTS!

473
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,000
- Nanase: AND I'LL SCARE YOU SO
MUCH THAT YOU'LL WET YOUR PANTS.

474
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,583
- Nina: NEXT TIME,
ON "SAVE ME LOLLIPOP"...

475
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:41,333
WOW!  TRY TO SAY THAT
THREE TIMES FAST.

476
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:45,125
NOW THAT'S REALLY SCARY.
