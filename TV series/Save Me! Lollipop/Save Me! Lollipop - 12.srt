1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,291
- MY NAME'S NINA AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE, ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:14,000
AT LEAST I WAS,
UNTIL ONE DAY.

3
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,416
I ACCIDENTALLY
SWALLOWED SOMETHING CALLED

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,583
THE CRYSTAL PEARL WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

5
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,000
AND MY LIFE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

6
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,666
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,791
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,541
AND THE TEAM OF TWO EXAMINEES
WHO ARE ABLE

9
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,708
TO TRACK IT DOWN FIRST
WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

10
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,000
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

11
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,208
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,500
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,625
- HUH?

14
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,041
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,000
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE
TO PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

16
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,125
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST IS OVER.

17
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,208
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH OVER
HER UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

18
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,416
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,625
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

20
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,208
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,833
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

22
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,291
REALLY?

23
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,333
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

24
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,375
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

25
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,166
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THEY MAY BE,

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,791
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

27
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,875
THESE TWO
ARE HERE TO PROTECT ME.

28
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,750
- HUH?
- ( gasps )

29
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,791
- Zero: WHO ARE YOU?

30
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,041
- MY NAME IS RIRU.

31
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,500
I'M HERE TO HELP NINA.

32
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU CAME HERE TO HELP ME?

33
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,250
AND BESIDES, HOW DO YOU
EVEN KNOW MY NAME, ANYWAY?

35
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,541
- LET'S SEE.

36
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,916
- WHO ARE YOU? ARE YOU
ANOTHER EXAMINEE?

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,583
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT
WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU

38
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,291
TAKE NINA AWAY FROM US.

39
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,166
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU KIDS?!

40
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,291
DID YOUR PARENTS
NOT TEACH YOU ANY MANNERS?

41
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,416
- A HELPER.

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,791
- I KNEW IT! YOU TWO
MUST BE SORCERERS.

43
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,416
- DON'T GET YOURSELF SO WORKED
UP, SHEESH. LISTEN CAREFULLY.

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,250
WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF
THE SORCERY TEST HEADQUARTERS.

45
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,500
- HERE.
- Both: BUT, THAT'S THE--

46
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,041
- THAT'S THE MEDICINE
TO EXTRACT THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

47
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,541
- YOU MEAN IT?

48
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,916
- WE WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU.
WITH THIS YOU'LL FINALLY BE FREE

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,083
FROM THE DANGEROUS LIFE
YOU'VE BEEN LEADING.

50
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,625
YOU'LL NO LONGER BE TARGETED
BY EXAMINEES.

51
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,083
TAKE THIS AND YOU CAN FINALLY
SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR FRIENDS.

52
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,625
- WHAT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

53
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,250
- Bird: WHAT'S THE HOLD UP?
JUST HURRY AND TAKE IT.

54
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,375
WE CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
TO BRING THIS TO YOU,

55
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,666
SO TAKE THE MEDICINE.

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,375
- ( thinking )
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

57
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,458
IF I TAKE THIS,
I'LL FINALLY BE SAFE.

58
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,541
I WON'T HAVE TO RUN ANYMORE.

59
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,875
BUT I'LL ALSO
HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE

60
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,541
TO ZERO AND ICHII
BEFORE CHRISTMASTIME.

61
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,458
IF I DECIDE
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT,

62
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,833
I'LL NEVER SEE THESE TWO AGAIN.

63
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,750
- WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,
GIRLIE?

64
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,291
ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE THE MEDICINE OR NOT?

65
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,416
- GIVE ME A MINUTE
TO MAKE UP MY MIND.

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,291
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

67
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,666
I'M NOT SO SURE IF TAKING IT
WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

68
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,833
- Forte: IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN I'LL TAKE IT!

69
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,625
- FORTE!
- IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE IT,

70
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,916
THEN HAND IT OVER!

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,625
WELL, ZERO AND ICHII,
IF YOU WANT THIS BACK,

72
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,333
I'LL GLADLY EXCHANGE IT FOR
THE CRYSTAL PEARL. NOW, SAN!

73
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,208
- I GUESS THAT'S MY CUE.
NOW IT'S TIME TO HAVE SOME FUN.

74
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,333
SUMMONING MAGIC!

75
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,958
THIS'LL BE A SPECIAL
SUMMONING OF STEP CAT!

76
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,083
- ( both laughing )

77
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,458
- WHAT DOES SHE HOPE
TO ACCOMPLISH

78
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,208
BY SICKING THAT THING ON US?

79
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,791
- MULTIPLICATION!
- All: MEOW!

80
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,041
- ( both shouting )

81
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,375
- LOOKS LIKE OUR WORK'S
DONE HERE, SAN.  LET'S GO.

82
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,583
- I'M COMING, FO.
HOLD ON!

83
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,250
HEY, NINA, DON'T FORGET
THAT WE'LL TRADE THIS MEDICINE

84
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,250
FOR THE CRYSTAL PEARL!
- ( owl hoots )

85
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,708
- ( thinking ) BUT IS THAT
MEDICINE REALLY NECESSARY?

86
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,666
MAYBE IT'S BETTER FOR THINGS
TO STAY THE WAY THEY ARE.

87
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,625
THE CRYSTAL PEARL WILL COME OUT
ON CHRISTMAS DAY, ANYWAY.

88
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,875
- ICHII, MY LOVE!
I'VE COME FOR YOU, ICHII.

89
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,541
YOU MEAN-SPIRITED CATS!
GET AWAY FROM MY ICHII.

90
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,375
AHH!
- ROKKA?

91
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,416
- PLEASE LET ME HANDLE
THIS SITUATION FOR YOU, ICHII.

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,708
CAN I?
IF SHE TAKES THAT MEDICINE,

93
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,333
THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO PROTECT
NINA ANYMORE, AM I RIGHT?

94
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,625
- HUH?

95
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,541
- IF SO, I'LL GET THAT
MEDICINE BACK,

96
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,208
AND THEN
YOU CAN COME HOME WITH ME!

97
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,333
AND WE'LL LEAVE NINA ALONE
BACK HERE.

98
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,625
THEN WE'LL BE TOGETHER!

99
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,208
- SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD
PLAN, LADY ROKKA.

100
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,000
- Zero: NOT YOU.
- I'M GOU.

101
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,458
- ( owl hooting )

102
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,416
- HEY, HAND OVER THAT
MEDICINE IMMEDIATELY!

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,250
- LIKE THAT'LL HAPPEN.
- JUST GIVE IT TO ME!

104
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,916
YOU GET YOUR BUTTS
BACK HERE RIGHT NOW.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,416
- San and Forte:
CATCH US IF YOU CAN!

106
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,125
- Gou: LADY ROKKA, PLEASE TRY
TO KEEP YOUR COMPOSURE.

107
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,708
- YOU BASTARDS!
- Forte: SHUT UP!

108
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,208
- YOU'RE MAKING THIS
WORSE ON YOURSELF.

109
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,500
- LADY ROKKA!

110
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,416
- JEEZ. THINGS SURE
HAVE GOTTEN PRETTY CRAZY.

111
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,125
- ROKKA'S GOING THROUGH
ALL THAT TROUBLE FOR NOTHING.

112
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:20,166
- HEY, FORTE, SAN,
WE DON'T NEED THAT MEDICINE!

113
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,541
- ( all screaming )

114
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,416
- BUT, ICHII, MY LOVE,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

115
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,458
THAT YOU DON'T NEED
THE MEDICINE? WHAT'S GOING ON?

116
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,375
- WHAT'S THE DEAL, ICHII?

117
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,583
- WE TRAVELED ALL THE WAY HERE
TO BRING YOU THAT MEDICINE.

118
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,125
SO TELL ME WHY YOU THINK
YOU DON'T NEED IT.  CAW!

119
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,958
- BECAUSE
WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT

120
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,333
TO PROTECT NINA UNTIL THE END
OF THE SORCERY EXAM.

121
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,333
- AND WE'RE NOT GONNA
GIVE UP ON HER NOW,

122
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,541
ESPECIALLY WHEN
WE'RE SO CLOSE TO THE END.

123
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,291
- IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU?
- RIGHT, NINA?

124
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,333
- WHAT?
SO DOES THAT MEAN

125
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,041
I'LL BE ABLE TO STAY WITH YOU
GUYS A COUPLE OF DAYS LONGER?

126
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,708
- OH, THAT'S JUST GREAT.
- THEN I'LL TAKE THIS!

127
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,291
- I SURE HOPE
THAT YOU THREE KNOW

128
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,958
WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELVES INTO.

129
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,875
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT
UNTIL THE EXAM IS OVER.

130
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,833
BUT THE REMAINING EXAMINEES
WILL USE THIS TIME TO ATTACK YOU

131
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,875
AND ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE THE
CRYSTAL PEARL. YOU UNDERSTAND?

132
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,666
YOU'VE GOT QUITE THE FIGHT
AHEAD OF YOU.

133
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,291
BUT IF YOU WOULD
JUST TAKE THE MEDICINE,

134
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,541
THIS WHOLE THING WOULD BE OVER
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

135
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,625
- WE KNOW WHAT'S
IN STORE FOR US,

136
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,875
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE UP NOW!

137
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,333
- BUT YOU KNOW,
SHE DOES HAVE A POINT.

138
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,166
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
ICHII?

139
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,041
WE CAN'T GIVE UP ON NINA.
WE HAVE TO KEEP PROTECTING HER.

140
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,291
LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

141
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,250
- FINE THEN, JUST WALK AWAY.
I'M WASHING MY HANDS OF THIS.

142
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,625
YOU'RE HEADED FOR A DISASTER.
I HOPE YOU GUYS KNOW THAT.

143
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,708
- WE'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.
- Zero: THANKS.

144
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,875
- WELL, LET'S JUST SEE IF YOU
GUYS ARE SO COCKY TOMORROW.

145
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,833
- Riru: DON'T WORRY.

146
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,833
I'M SURE THAT SOON SHE WILL.
- HUH?

147
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,125
- I KNOW THE PATH
THAT IS LAID OUT FOR HER.

148
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,666
I KNOW SHE'LL TAKE IT.

149
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,625
- ( Nina sighs )
- Girl: CHRISTMAS IS TOMORROW.

150
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,708
ARE YOU READY?
- THERE YOU ARE, NINA.

151
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,125
DO YOU WANT TO GO SHOPPING
WITH US AFTER SCHOOL TODAY?

152
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,041
I NEED TO FIND
A NEW CELL PHONE STRAP.

153
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,833
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
THAT I CAN GO.

154
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,750
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
TODAY IS DECEMBER 24th.

155
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,833
SO I GUESS
THAT MEANS YOU'RE BUSY.

156
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,166
YOU'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO
THAN TO HANG OUT WITH US, RIGHT?

157
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,458
- HAVE YOU MADE UP
YOUR MIND

158
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,083
WHO YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND
TONIGHT WITH, NINA?

159
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,458
IS IT GOING TO BE ZERO
OR WILL IT BE ICHII?

160
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,958
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT NOW.

161
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,625
- OH, NOW DON'T BE SHY.

162
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,291
- WELL, IF YOU HAVE STUFF
YOU NEED TO DO,

163
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,875
THEN WE WON'T HOLD YOU UP
ANY LONGER.  LATER.

164
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,666
- BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

165
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,333
( thinking )
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, YOU TWO.

166
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,458
TODAY IS THE LAST DAY
I'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND WITH THEM,

167
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,250
THE LAST DAY
OF THE SORCERY TEST.

168
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,791
I DON'T WANT MY TIME WITH ZERO
AND ICHII TO BE OVER ALREADY.

169
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,916
I DON'T WANT THEM TO LEAVE.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,125
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

171
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,375
- I FINALLY FOUND YOU, ICHII!

172
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,458
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN DAYS.

173
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,333
I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE AWAY
FROM YOU THIS LONG AGAIN.

174
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,625
- ROKKA?

175
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,208
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU WEARING
THAT SCHOOL UNIFORM?

176
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,208
- YOU'RE ADORABLE. WHY DON'T
YOU STOP ASKING QUESTIONS

177
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,458
AND JUST TAKE YOUR MEDICINE
ALREADY, NINA?!

178
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,750
- MY MEDICINE?
- TA-DA!

179
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,541
- BUT I DON'T WANT THAT.
- YEAH, I'M SORRY,

180
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,625
BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED IT
ANYMORE, ROKKA.

181
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,541
- I APPRECIATE IT, THOUGH.

182
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,250
- SO YOU WANT TO DO THIS THE
HARD WAY, HUH? THAT'S FINE.

183
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,416
I'LL JUST POUR THIS STUFF
DOWN YOUR THROAT IF I HAVE TO!

184
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,625
GET BACK HERE, NINA!
TAKE IT ALREADY!

185
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,125
- I DON'T WANT TO!
JUST GET OFF ME, ROKKA.

186
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,416
- TAKE YOUR MEDICINE
AND LEAVE MY ICHII ALONE.

187
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,458
- NO WAY! STOP IT, ROKKA!
I'M NOT TAKING IT.

188
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,666
- HEY, GIVE THAT BACK, ICHII.
SHE NEEDS IT.

189
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,791
IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU'LL
LEAVE HER ALONE AND COME BACK--

190
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,333
- COME NOW, LADY ROKKA,
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOUR NAP.

191
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,875
- I'M NOT GOING TO SLEEP
UNTIL SHE TAKES HER MEDICINE

192
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,208
AND LEAVES MY ICHII ALONE!

193
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,333
BECAUSE HE WON'T
HAVE TO PROTECT HER ANYMORE

194
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,083
IF THE CRYSTAL PEARL
ISN'T IN HER BODY.

195
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,666
AND THEN HE CAN
COME BACK HOME WITH ME

196
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,250
AND WE'LL BE TOGETHER
FOREVER AND EVER

197
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,458
AND WE'LL NEVER
SEE NINA AGAIN!

198
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:53,291
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH OF
A BURDEN YOU'VE BEEN ON ICHII?

199
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,500
THINGS WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER
FOR MY LOVE

200
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,125
IF YOU WOULD
JUST TAKE THE STUPID MEDICINE!

201
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,125
QUIT BEING SELFISH
AND TAKE IT ALREADY!

202
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,791
- AM I A BURDEN ON YOU, ICHII?

203
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,333
- OF COURSE NOT.

204
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,083
DON'T LISTEN
TO ANYTHING SHE SAID.

205
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,791
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO
CONTINUE PROTECTING YOU, NINA.

206
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,708
I PROMISE. BUT EVEN
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT,

207
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,791
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

208
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,333
- ICHII.

209
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,250
- I'LL KEEP THE MEDICINE SAFE
EVEN THOUGH YOU WON'T NEED IT.

210
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,375
NOW I HAVE A QUESTION.

211
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,125
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN MEANING TO
ASK YOU THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE.

212
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,458
DOES IT EVER BOTHER YOU THAT
WE'RE WITH YOU ALL THE TIME?

213
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,875
- AH!
YOU DON'T BOTHER ME AT ALL.

214
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,291
( laughing )
- NINA?

215
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,625
- I'M GOING TO THE RESTROOM!

216
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,500
( sighs )
JEEZ, ICHII.

217
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,708
- I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

218
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,916
I'LL KEEP THE MEDICINE SAFE
EVEN THOUGH YOU WON'T NEED IT.

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,166
- MAYBE-- MAYBE ICHII REALLY
DOES HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.

220
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,916
THAT WOULD BE SO AWESOME.

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,333
- Bird: JUDGING BY THE WAY
YOU'RE ACTING,

222
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,041
I ASSUME YOU HAVEN'T
TAKEN IT YET.

223
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,583
- THE CROW.

224
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,791
- HOW INSULTING.
MY NAME'S RUBY, YOU KNOW?

225
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:04,708
- AND WHO ARE YOU?

226
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,375
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN? I'M RIRU.

227
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,958
- OH. ARE YOU OKAY?

228
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,458
- I'M FINE.
I JUST BOTCHED THE LANDING.

229
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,166
- I SEE.

230
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,166
- HURRY UP AND TAKE
THE MEDICINE, LITTLE GIRL.

231
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,500
IT'S DANGEROUS FOR YOU NOT TO.
- I DON'T NEED TO TAKE IT!

232
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,333
BECAUSE ZERO AND ICHII
WILL PROTECT ME.

233
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,625
- WAIT, I SENSE SOMETHING.

234
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,041
SOMETHING COLD IS COMING.

235
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,791
IT'S HERE!

236
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,041
- WHAT ARE THOSE?
- THEY'RE ICE CRYSTALS.

237
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,208
- ARE THEY MAGIC?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

238
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,916
YOU'RE UNDER ATTACK
BY NEW EXAMINEES.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,250
THEY'RE STRONGER
THAN SAN AND FORTE.

240
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,500
AND YOU KNOW
THAT IT'S AGAINST THE RULES

241
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,916
FOR YOU TO BLOCK ANY OF THE
EXAMINEES' ATTACK ON THE PEARL,

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,083
DON'T YOU?

243
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,500
- BUT NINA
WOULD HAVE BEEN BADLY INJURED.

244
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,958
- EXACTLY.
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY HURT.

245
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,125
SO TAKE THE MEDICINE ALREADY,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

246
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,958
- ( thinking )
SHE'S RIGHT.

247
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,791
I'VE BEEN ATTACKED
BY SAN AND FORTE BEFORE,

248
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,875
AND BY ROKKA AND GOU.

249
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,541
BUT THEY'RE NOTHING COMPARED
TO WHAT THOSE NEW EXAMINEES

250
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,833
JUST SHOWED US.

251
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,208
AND THAT WAS JUST A SAMPLE
OF WHAT THEY CAN DO.

252
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,291
BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT THEY WERE GONNA ATTACK US

253
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,666
WITH THOSE ICE CRYSTALS?

254
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,666
- I SAW.
- RIRU CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE.

255
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,291
THE ATTACK AND EVEN
YOU TAKING THE MEDICINE

256
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,666
HAS ALL BEEN FORESEEN.

257
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,625
- NO WAY.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

258
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,666
- HOW ABOUT YOU SHOW HER
A LITTLE FLASH FROM THE FUTURE?

259
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,666
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- WELL, OKAY.

260
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,000
I GUESS I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.

261
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,333
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE READY?

262
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,208
FUTURE PROJECTION MAGIC!

263
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,708
- I'M-- 
I'M ACTUALLY DRINKING IT.

264
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:58,333
- SEE, WE'RE TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

265
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,125
AND IN TIME,
YOU'LL TAKE THE MEDICINE.

266
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,125
- RIRU,
WAS THAT REALLY THE FUTURE?

267
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,208
ARE YOU SURE
I'M GONNA TAKE THE MEDICINE?

268
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,833
- I'M AFRAID SO, NINA.
EVENTUALLY YOU'LL UNDERSTAND

269
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,625
THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING
FOR YOU TO DO.

270
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,625
- WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

271
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,416
JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- ONE MORE THING.

272
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,666
NO ONE WILL PASS
THIS SORCERY TEST.

273
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,291
- CAW!
- AND AFTER THAT,

274
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,916
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL NEVER SEE ZERO
AND ICHII AGAIN.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,750
SORRY.

276
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,583
- ( thinking ) NO WAY.

277
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,500
HOW DO ZERO AND ICHII
FAIL THE TEST?

278
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,166
AND WHY
WILL I NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN?

279
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,250
WHY?

280
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,750
- ( thinking )
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

281
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,375
WHY IS TAKING THE MEDICINE
THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

282
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,500
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

283
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,375
BUT IN THE FUTURE I--

284
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,458
I TOOK IT.

285
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,250
- Zero: HEY, NINA!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

286
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,250
I THOUGHT WE TOLD YOU
NEVER TO LEAVE OUR SIDE?

287
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,416
THE EXAMINEES WHO ATTACK YOU
NOW WILL BE MUCH MORE POWERFUL.

288
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,958
- HUH?

289
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,166
AHH!
- WE'RE COMING, NINA!

290
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,833
- AHHH!

291
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:36,125
DEFENSE MAGIC!

292
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,458
HELP ME OUT, ZERO.
- TAKE THIS!

293
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,416
FIREBALL!

294
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,541
- ARE YOU OKAY?
DID THEY HURT YOU?

295
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,625
- NO, I'M FINE.

296
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,458
- WELL, DAMN. LOOKS LIKE WE
HAVE SOME NEW COMPETITION.

297
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,000
- OH, NO,
LOOK AT MY LOLLIPOP.

298
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,500
- NO WAY. HOW DID THEY BREAK
THROUGH YOUR DEFENSE MAGIC?

299
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,583
- THAT ATTACK
WAS VERY POWERFUL.

300
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,791
I THINK WE'D BETTER PREPARE
OURSELVES FOR THE BATTLE AHEAD.

301
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,750
- I KNOW. I WISH THEY WOULD
JUST SHOW THEIR FACES ALREADY.

302
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,083
BUT I GUESS THAT MAYBE THEY'RE
ALL TOO SCARED TO ENGAGE US

303
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,875
IN CLOSE-QUARTERS COMBAT.

304
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,666
- Boy: GIVE ME A BREAK.
- Boy#2: WE'RE NOT SCARED.

305
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,166
- Girl: HONESTLY,
SHOW US A LITTLE RESPECT.

306
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,375
- LOOK OUT!

307
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,833
- I AM EXAMINEE NUMBER 011.
I AM 11 AND HE IS--

308
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,458
- NUMBER 12.
- OH!

309
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,125
- WE'RE TOMI AND--
- IYO.

310
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,708
- UM, BUT I'M
EXAMINEE NUMBER 012 AND--

311
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,083
- NOW DON'T FORGET ABOUT US.

312
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,625
- EXAMINEES 015 AND 016.

313
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,458
- I'M FIFTEEN AND SHE'S--
- I'M SIXTEEN.

314
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,375
- YEAH, ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
SANTA'S LITTLE HELPERS?

315
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,333
- HOW DARE YOU.
- NICE OUTFIT, TOMI.

316
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,000
- SURE, MAKE FUN OF ME NOW.

317
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,750
BUT IN A FEW MONTHS,
EVERYONE WILL BE WEARING THIS.

318
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,500
I'M A TRENDSETTER,
YOU KNOW?

319
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,958
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'RE HERE
FOR THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

320
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,708
FLAME MAGIC!
- ICE MAGIC.

321
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,791
- HOTTEST BLIZZARD!
- ICE METAL MIST!

322
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,125
- All: ATTACK!

323
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,583
- Zero: ICHII!

324
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,500
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DEFEND
AGAINST ALL OF THEIR ATTACKS.

325
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,833
- HA! AND THIS ISN'T
ANYWHERE NEAR MY FULL POWER.

326
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,416
AHHH!

327
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,208
- ( screaming )

328
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,291
- ICHII, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
TO PROTECT NINA, RIGHT NOW.

329
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,416
- I KNOW.
CHARM CAPSULE!

330
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,916
- AHH!

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,166
- Zura: OH NO! NINA CAN'T
TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS.

332
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,666
WE HAVE TO GET HER OUT OF HARM'S
WAY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

333
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,833
HOLD ON, NINA, WE'RE COMING.
- Ichii: LET'S FALL BACK.

334
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- LISTEN.

335
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,875
WE HAVE TO GET NINA TO SAFETY.
- ALL RIGHT.

336
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,208
- AHHH!

337
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,041
- THEY GOT AWAY.

338
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,875
- NEXT TIME,
WE'LL GET THE PEARL.

339
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,000
- Zero: WHAT?
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

340
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,750
- BE QUIET.
YOU NEED TO TRY TO CALM DOWN.

341
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,625
- BUT YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE NINA DRINK THE MEDICINE.

342
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,875
- I REALLY THINK IT WOULD
BE BETTER IF SHE TAKES IT.

343
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,375
- NO WAY!

344
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,833
- BUT YOU SAW WHAT
JUST HAPPENED.

345
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,666
DIDN'T YOU, ZERO?

346
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,000
AND WHAT IF
THEY ATTACK US AGAIN?

347
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,791
WE CAN'T PROTECT NINA,
NOT AGAINST ALL OF THEM.

348
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,291
WE'RE JUST NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH.

349
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,958
AND IF YOU THINK WE ARE,
THEN YOU'RE WRONG.

350
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,000
EVEN IF WE MANAGE
TO HOLD OFF THE ATTACKS,

351
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,166
SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO WITHSTAND IT.

352
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,041
RUBY WAS RIGHT.

353
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,625
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN PROTECT NINA
FROM FURTHER ATTACKS

354
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,791
IS TO REMOVE THE CRYSTAL PEARL
FROM HER BODY.

355
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,041
ONLY THEN WILL SHE BE SAFE.

356
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,583
THE MORE INTENSE
THE ATTACKS BECOME,

357
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,000
THE GREATER THE RISK THAT
SHE'LL GET SERIOUSLY INJURED.

358
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,291
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
- I DON'T, ICHII.

359
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,708
WE PROMISED THAT WE WOULD
PROTECT NINA, DIDN'T WE?

360
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,791
WE PROMISED THAT WE WOULD
KEEP HER SAFE FROM HARM

361
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,583
UNTIL THE LAST DAY
OF THE SORCERY TEST

362
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,500
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

363
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,375
REMEMBER?
- I KNOW.

364
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,958
YOU'RE AFRAID THAT ONCE
WE POSSESS THE CRYSTAL PEARL,

365
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,750
THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING LEFT
LINKING US TO NINA.

366
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,375
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT?
- AND HOW ABOUT YOU?

367
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,541
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE
WITH HER ANYMORE?

368
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,958
- OF COURSE I DO!

369
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,958
BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PUT HER
IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS

370
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:16,166
JUST SO WE CAN BE WITH HER.
DON'T YOU SEE THAT?

371
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,666
- BUT STILL--

372
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,541
- WHAT IF SOMETHING WERE
TO HAPPEN TO HER?

373
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:23,416
DO YOU WANT THAT
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE?

374
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,083
LISTEN TO ME.

375
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,000
SHE NEEDS TO TAKE THE MEDICINE
SO SHE CAN BE SAFE.

376
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,125
- ICHII.

377
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,708
DAMN IT!

378
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,666
- WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

379
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,250
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO PROTECT HER.

380
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,583
- Nina: NO.

381
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,833
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU TWO.
OKAY?

382
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,083
EVEN IF IT MEANS
I HAVE TO BE IN DANGER.

383
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,166
I DON'T WANT TO BE SEPARATED.

384
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,625
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
STAY WITH ME.

385
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,916
STAY BY MY SIDE
UNTIL THE EXAM IS OVER.

386
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,500
- BUT NINA--
- NINA!

387
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,708
- I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU TWO.

388
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,208
I COULDN'T BEAR IT.
- WE WON'T LEAVE YOUR SIDE!

389
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:13,416
- ZERO!
- OF COURSE WE'LL STAY.

390
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT YOU.
YOU CAN COUNT ON US.

391
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,958
- THEN IT'S SETTLED.

392
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,291
IF THIS
IS WHAT NINA TRULY WANTS,

393
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,583
THEN WE MUST
RESPECT HER WISHES.

394
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,708
WE HAVE TO STAY HERE
AND PROTECT HER

395
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,333
TILL THE VERY END.
AM I RIGHT?

396
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,333
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- ICHII.

397
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,750
ZERO!

398
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,541
- ( Iyo and Tomi laughing ) 

399
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,958
- WE FOUND YOU AGAIN.

400
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,375
- Fifteen: WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

401
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,333
- ( all laughing ) 
- CRAP.

402
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:58,458
- All: HAAA!
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

403
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,708
GET NINA OUT OF HERE.

404
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,083
AHH!

405
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,791
- DAMN IT.

406
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,500
FIREBALL PISTON!

407
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,250
I MISSED!
- Yakumo: WAIT WAIT WAIT!

408
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,666
DON'T HURT MY NINA.

409
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,125
- WHO ARE YOU?

410
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,791
- NANASE?  YAKUMO?
WHAT?

411
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,041
- NINA,
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

412
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,666
I MISSED YOU.
I FINISHED MY TRAINING

413
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,750
AND CAME BACK HERE
TO BE WITH YOU, MY LOVE.

414
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,750
I'VE COME TO PROTECT YOU.

415
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,583
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO?

416
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,208
- YEAH.
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE?

417
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,666
- AH!  DON'T WORRY, NINA.

418
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,750
I'LL BEAT THESE GUYS HANDILY.

419
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:45,583
TA-DA!
( laughing ) 

420
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,291
WAS THAT IMPRESSIVE OR-- 

421
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,458
WHAT THE?
WHY IS IT PITCH BLACK?

422
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,250
DID SOMEONE USE
DARKNESS MAGIC?

423
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,208
- Nanase: I DON'T THINK
THAT'S IT.

424
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,583
- ( grunting )

425
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,208
- YA!

426
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,208
- ( grunts )
- AH!

427
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,625
NINA!
- HYAH!

428
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,208
- AHH!

429
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,625
ZERO!
ZERO, NO!

430
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,791
- IT'S OKAY, NINA.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

431
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,083
- PLEASE, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
PROTECT YOURSELF!

432
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,208
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

433
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,041
- ICHII!
- HEY, NINA, ARE YOU OKAY?

434
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,125
- ( thinking )
WHAT?  AM I OKAY?

435
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,333
ZERO AND ICHII HAVE GOTTEN HURT
MORE TIMES THAN I EVER HAVE,

436
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,166
BUT THEY'RE STILL
ONLY WORRIED ABOUT ME.

437
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,250
- ( Tomi laughing )

438
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,041
AND HERE COMES
OUR BIG FINAL ATTACK!

439
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,958
- COME ON, THAT'S ENOUGH.
STOP IT!

440
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,291
ZERO, ICHII!

441
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,291
JUST STOP!

442
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,791
YOU GUYS?

443
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,250
- I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYONE LAY
A FINGER ON MY BELOVED ICHII.

444
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,875
- HIYA.

445
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,458
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGHT THROUGH US.

446
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,666
- 15: YOU GUYS ARE SO NAIVE.

447
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,416
- AREN'T YOU AWARE OF THE RISK
INVOLVED IN THE SORCERY TEST?

448
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,291
- THE RISK?

449
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,458
I HAVEN'T APPRECIATED
THEIR KINDNESS TOWARDS ME.

450
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,458
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
THEY'VE GOTTEN HURT.

451
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,500
I DON'T WANT
TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEM,

452
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,625
BUT I CAN'T STAND TO WATCH THEM
PUT THEMSELVES IN DANGER

453
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,083
BECAUSE OF ME ANYMORE.

454
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,208
- ( grunting )

455
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,625
- HEY, NINA!
- NINA.

456
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,750
