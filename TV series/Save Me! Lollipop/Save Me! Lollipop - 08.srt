1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,291
- MY NAME'S NINA AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE, ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,625
AT LEAST I WAS,
UNTIL ONE DAY.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,416
I ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWED
SOMETHING CALLED

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,541
THE CRYSTAL PEARL WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,958
AND MY LIFE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,625
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

7
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,750
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

8
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,500
AND THE TEAM OF TWO EXAMINEES
WHO ARE ABLE

9
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,666
TO TRACK IT DOWN FIRST
WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,958
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

11
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,166
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,458
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

13
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,583
- HUH?

14
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,916
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,958
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

16
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,083
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST IS OVER.

17
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,166
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH OVER
HER UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,375
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

19
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,583
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

20
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,166
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,791
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

22
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,250
REALLY?

23
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,291
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

24
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,333
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

25
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,125
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THEY MAY BE,

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,750
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

27
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,833
THESE TWO
ARE HERE TO PROTECT ME.

28
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,041
- Nina: BLUE SKY.

29
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,791
WHITE CLOUDS.

30
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,416
SPARKLING WAVES.

31
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,125
THIS IS GREAT.

32
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,083
- Yakumo:
YOU GOTTA LOVE THE BEACH.

33
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,958
- HEY, DON'T I KNOW YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE?

34
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,458
- HEY, THERE.

35
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,958
- AH! WAIT.

36
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,291
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, YAKUMO?

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,125
- IT'S SO WONDERFUL
TO FINALLY SEE YOU AGAIN, NINA.

38
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,583
THAT SUIT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.
- HERE WE GO.

39
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,250
- YOU'RE HERE TOO, NANASE?

40
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,625
HAVE YOU COME BACK
TO TRY AND GET THE PEARL AGAIN?

41
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,666
- IT'S MY LOVE FOR YOU
THAT'S DRAWN ME HERE!

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,166
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW ME THAT WELL.

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,083
HOW COULD YOU BE
IN LOVE WITH ME?

44
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,291
- THEN HOW ABOUT YOU AND I
TAKE SOME TIME

45
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,208
TO JUST GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
A LITTLE BETTER?

46
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,583
- OH, YEAH, AND WHAT
MAKES YOU THINK

47
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,166
I WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER MINUTE
WITH YOU?

48
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,791
- IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE
ME A CHANCE,

49
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,250
YOU'LL SEE THAT I'M
REALLY A NICE GUY.

50
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,875
- DOUBT IT.

51
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,708
- MY MY MY, YOUNG LADY, YOU'VE
REALLY GOT IT GOING ON.

52
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,125
YOU'RE MOST DEFINITELY
THE CUTEST GIRL

53
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,833
THIS BEACH HAS TO OFFER.

54
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,625
CHECK OUT THOSE LEGS OF YOURS.

55
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,916
AND THOSE BIG BROWN EYES.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,875
AND THOSE CUTE LITTLE BOOBS.
- ARGH!

57
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,750
- NO, SERIOUSLY, YOU COULD USE

58
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,541
A LITTLE BOOST IN THE
BREAST DEPARTMENT.

59
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,708
- SHUT UP!
YOU IDIOT!  PERVERT!

60
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,416
- WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN? I WAS
JUST PROFESSING MY LOVE FOR YOU.

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,833
- MY BREASTS ARE NOT A VALID
TOPIC OF DISCUSSION, YAKUMO.

62
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,458
- OH, YOU'RE EVEN CUTER
WHEN YOU'RE MAD.

63
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,208
- Zero: THAT'S ENOUGH.
- Both: HUH?

64
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,916
- AHH!

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,458
AHHH!  IT'S YOU GUYS.

66
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,416
- WE'VE ALL BEEN STANDING HERE
WATCHING YOU

67
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,625
SHOOT OFF YOUR MOUTH
THIS ENTIRE TIME, YAKUMO.

68
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE US.

69
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,791
- YEAH, BE CAREFUL, NINA.
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY TRUST A GUY

70
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,166
WHO TRIES TO PICK UP ON SOMEONE
AND THEN JUST STANDS AROUND

71
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,791
AND LAUGHS AT THE SHORTCOMINGS
OF HER BUST LINE.

72
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:34,208
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
- ( stammering )

73
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,458
- YOU DISRESPECTFUL PIG!

74
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,041
- Gou: LADY ROKKA, DO NOT
MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH HIM.

75
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,041
- HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
- YEAH, HE'S SUCH A PERVERT.

76
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
ARE DRAGGING MY GOOD NAME

77
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,083
THROUGH THE MUD LIKE THIS.
SHEESH!

78
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,083
- YEAH, SO WHAT?
- JUST CALM DOWN.

79
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,583
WE ALL CAME HERE TO HAVE FUN.
THERE'S NO REASON TO FIGHT.

80
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,583
CAN'T YOU JUST TRY TO GET ALONG?
- Nanase: SHE'S RIGHT.

81
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,041
YOU KNOW,

82
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,416
WE DO HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO
PLAY A GAME OF VOLLEYBALL.

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,791
HOW ABOUT WE SETTLE
OUR DIFFERENCES ON THE COURT?

84
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,875
- All:
YOU WANT US TO PLAY A GAME?

85
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,291
- I'VE ALREADY
DIVIDED EVERYONE INTO TEAMS.

86
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,666
- NANASE.
- WELL, LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

87
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,250
- ZURA, ZURA, ZURA!
THE FIRST MATCH IS ZERO AND NINA

88
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,916
VERSUS NANASE AND YAKUMO.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,916
- COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT, NINA.
- HEY, ICHII MY LOVE,

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,958
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT MY
NEW BIKINI. I JUST GOT IT TODAY.

91
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,375
- ( blows )

92
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,166
LET THE GAMES BEGIN!

93
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,541
- HERE GOES!
- Nanase: COME ON, BRING IT!

94
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,375
YAKUMO!
- GOT IT.

95
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,625
BACK AT YA.

96
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,666
- AH!

97
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,375
- AH!
- NO, NINA.

98
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,125
- NINA!

99
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,375
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

100
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,666
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.

101
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,416
- YOU KNUCKLEHEAD, YOU'VE
DAMAGED MY NINA'S PRECIOUS FACE.

102
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,416
- SHE IS NOT YOUR NINA, JERK.

103
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
- YOU HAVE A LITTLE SCRATCH
ON YOUR CHEEK.

104
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,541
IF YOU WANT I CAN COVER IT
WITH THIS BANDAGE.

105
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,166
- HERE, GIVE IT TO ME.

106
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,333
I'M SORRY, NINA.

107
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,791
- THANK YOU.

108
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,125
- AND BY THE WAY--
- WHAT?

109
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,625
- YOU KNOW,

110
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,708
EVEN THOUGH YOUR FACE GOT
DEMOLISHED BY THAT VOLLEYBALL,

111
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,791
YOU'RE CUTE.
- OH, YOU THINK SO?

112
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,833
- NO, I KNOW SO.

113
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,750
- WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?

114
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,583
- ( blowing )

115
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,125
Zura: AND GAME ON!

116
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,208
- SEE IF YOU CAN HANDLE THIS.

117
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,000
YOU BETTER BE READY, NANASE,

118
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,458
'CAUSE I'M GONNA PUT EVERY
OUNCE OF POWER I'VE GOT

119
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,291
BEHIND THIS SERVE.

120
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,083
- USING MAGIC
IS AGAINST THE RULES.

121
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,125
AHH!

122
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,666
SEE?
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE RULES.

123
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,833
- SO YOU WANNA PLAY DIRTY,
IS THAT IT?

124
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,791
- I SAID NO MAGIC!

125
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,500
- TAKE THIS!
MY SUPER ULTRA DYNAMIC FIREBALL!

126
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,500
- YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
BURST FLAME SHOT!

127
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,666
- Zero: THAT'S NOTHING!

128
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,875
NOW TRY MY FIRE BLADE
ATOMIC SUPER PISTON.

129
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,375
- BIG DEAL.
TAKE THIS!

130
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,541
- HA!
GIVE ME A BREAK.

131
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,166
LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE MY SUPER
DELUXE ULTRA GORGEOUS FIREBALL!

132
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,708
LET'S FINISH THIS!

133
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,583
- ZERO.
- IT'S JUST A SILLY GAME.

134
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,708
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS,
ZERO.

135
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,583
- DESTRUCTION MAGIC!

136
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,375
AHH!

137
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,125
MAGIC CANNON!

138
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
- ZERO, NO!

139
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,916
AHHH!
- NINA!

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,875
- AHHH!

141
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,458
WAY TO GO, ZERO. AND NOW WE
CAN'T EVEN FINISH THE GAME.

142
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,250
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT. NANASE
STARTED THIS FIGHT.

143
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,666
SO BLAME HIM.

144
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,666
- OH MY, THAT ZERO'S WAY
TOO HOTHEADED.

145
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,208
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

146
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,416
- BACK OFF, OKAY?
YOU NEED TO STOP HUGGING ME.

147
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,291
- YOU REALLY ARE ADORABLE
WHEN YOU'RE EMBARRASSED, NINA.

148
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,500
- I'M OUTTA HERE.
- HEY, WAIT.

149
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,666
ZERO!

150
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,416
THERE HE IS.

151
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,583
HOPE YOU LIKE CHOCOLATE.

152
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,708
- I DON'T WANT IT.
- SO WHY ARE YOU SO MAD?

153
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,125
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT. I'M NOT MAD.

154
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,541
AND BESIDES,

155
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,041
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HANGING
OUT WITH YOUR PAL YAKUMO.

156
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,291
- I'D MUCH RATHER HANG OUT
WITH YOU THAN YAKUMO ANY DAY.

157
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,208
- WHATEVER.
I SAW THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT HIM

158
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,250
WHEN HE WAS GIVING YOU
ALL THOSE COMPLIMENTS,

159
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,375
AND WHEN HE PUT THAT BANDAGE
ON YOUR FACE.

160
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,041
- I DON'T EVEN LIKE THAT GUY.

161
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,250
- THEN TAKE
THE STUPID THING OFF.

162
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,250
HOW'S THAT?

163
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,541
- HEY, COME ON.
DON'T BE SO UPSET.

164
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,041
- JUST SHUT UP.
SHUT UP.

165
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,916
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.
- THAT WAS MY ICE CREAM.

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,375
- DON'T BE SO STINGY.

167
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,166
- IT'S JUST THAT--

168
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,833
( thinking )
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO BE NICE.

169
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,833
- IT BOTHERS ME.
- HUH?

170
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,375
- I CAN'T TAKE IT.

171
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,375
WHENEVER I SEE YOU
HANGING OUT WITH THAT GUY,

172
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,833
IT MAKES ME FEEL SO JEALOUS.

173
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,000
- ZERO.

174
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,916
- Ichii:
ZERO!  NINA!

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,958
- HELLO?

176
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,916
- THERE THEY ARE.
SO YOU TWO READY?

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,541
- YEAH, LET'S GO.

178
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,208
- WAIT A MINUTE,
TAKE ME TO DINNER.

179
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,125
OH, MY ICHII,
IT'LL BE SO ROMANTIC.

180
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,583
- THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA,
LADY ROKKA.

181
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,375
I DON'T TRUST THIS ONE.

182
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,625
- OH!
ICHII WILL TREAT ME RIGHT.

183
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,166
- COME ON, KNOCK IT OFF, ROKKA.
- ( Nina thinking ) JEEZ.

184
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,083
- I CAN'T BELIEVE ZERO'S ACTING
LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

185
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,958
A MINUTE AGO, HE WAS LIKE--
- I CAN'T TAKE IT!

186
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,625
WHENEVER I SEE YOU
HANGING OUT WITH HIM,

187
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,166
IT MAKES ME SO JEALOUS.

188
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,791
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

189
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,000
- HEY, ICHII, LET'S EAT!

190
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,500
- ( laughing )
NOW THE FIRST PHASE IS COMPLETE.

191
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,375
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
NANASE?

192
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,500
YOU BETTER NOT BE
UP TO SOMETHING BAD.

193
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,875
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
IF YOU PUT NINA IN DANGER.

194
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,583
- MY PLAN IS A SECRET.
- YOUR WHAT?

195
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,375
- DON'T WORRY.

196
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,500
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW,
WE'LL HAVE THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

197
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,333
- WE WILL?
- JUST TRUST ME.

198
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,875
- ( Nina thinking )
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

199
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,041
EVERYTHING'S SO AWKWARD
BETWEEN ZERO AND ME NOW.

200
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,708
- ( grunting )

201
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,583
WHAT?!

202
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,458
- HEY, TRY TO KEEP IT DOWN
A LITTLE, ZERO.

203
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,250
- ICHII, I'M NOT ZERO!
IT'S-- IT'S ME! CAN'T YOU TELL?

204
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

205
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,458
- I'M NOT ZERO.
I'M NINA.

206
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,458
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,
BUT WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

207
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,416
I LOOKED LIKE THIS.

208
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,791
- WHAT'S ALL THIS YELLING ABOUT?

209
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,166
- OH, NO WAY!

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,958
YOU IDIOT!
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON!

211
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,416
- DUDE, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

212
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,833
I ALWAYS WALK
AROUND THE HOUSE LIKE THIS.

213
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,458
IT'S TOO HOT TO WEAR A SHIRT,
ANYWAY.

214
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,458
- OH, COVER UP, PLEASE!
- WAIT A MINUTE!

215
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,458
- Both: AH! YOU'RE ME!
- SO LET'S SEE--

216
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,583
YOU'RE ZERO
AND YOU'RE NINA?

217
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,583
- SOMEONE TELL ME HOW A THING
LIKE THIS COULD EVEN HAPPEN.

218
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,583
- AND JUST HOW DO WE GET BACK
TO NORMAL?

219
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,708
- JUST CALM DOWN
AND DON'T WORRY.

220
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,625
I'LL FIGURE THIS THING OUT,
OKAY?

221
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,625
- WHAT'S THAT?

222
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,833
- THIS IS MY NEW LAPTOP.

223
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,041
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT
ABOUT YOUR CONDITION IN HERE.

224
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,500
- PLEASE HURRY.

225
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,541
- WELL, IT MIGHT TAKE ME
A LITTLE WHILE.

226
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,875
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
QUITE LIKE THIS BEFORE, SO--

227
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,583
- SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO
UNTIL YOU FIGURE IT OUT?

228
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,666
- I SUPPOSE THE ONLY REAL OPTION
IS THAT YOU PRETEND TO BE ZERO

229
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,416
AND ZERO PRETENDS TO BE YOU
UNTIL I CAN FIX EVERYTHING.

230
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,166
- Both: WHAT?!
- SO I'M NINA?

231
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,375
- AND I'M ZERO?  NO!

232
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,583
- Both: I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.
YOU HAVE TO FIX IT, ICHII.

233
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,208
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
PRETEND TO BE YOU EITHER,

234
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,375
YOU KNOW.

235
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,541
- THERE'S NO USE FIGHTING
ABOUT SOMETHING

236
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,750
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER.
OH, PLEASE, ICHII!

237
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,791
PROMISE ME THAT
YOU'LL DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN

238
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,666
TO FIX THIS THING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

239
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,791
( sobbing )

240
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,750
- ( both giggling )
- HEY, GOOD MORNING, NINA.

241
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,541
- 'MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING.

242
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,958
- YO.
- All: HUH?

243
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,458
WHAT'S WRONG, NINA?

244
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,458
- DON'T EMBARRASS ME.

245
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,291
AND TRY NOT TO FORGET THAT
YOU'RE IN MY BODY FOR NOW, OKAY?

246
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,041
- FINE, BUT YOU BETTER NOT MAKE
ME LOOK LIKE SOME KIND OF SISSY.

247
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,791
- Girls: HEY, NINA.

248
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,583
- WE SHOULD GO GET CHANGED
FOR SWIM CLASS.

249
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,000
- YEAH, WE'D BETTER HURRY UP
OR WE'RE GONNA BE LATE AGAIN.

250
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,500
- SWIM CLASS?
- CHANGE?

251
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,500
NO NO NO!

252
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,750
- THERE YOU ARE, ZERO.

253
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,666
WE'D BETTER GET GOING.

254
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,083
- ( both shouting )

255
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,250
- WHAT'S WRONG, ZERO?

256
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,208
- YEAH, CHILL.

257
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,541
- AH!
NO, DON'T TOUCH ME.

258
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,666
DON'T COME NEAR ME.
AND DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

259
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,083
AHHH!
- NINA, WAIT.

260
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,666
- NINA?

261
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,958
- UH, I MEAN, ZERO.
- THAT'S WEIRD.

262
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,833
- ( moaning )
- All: WHAT ARE YOU DOING, NINA?

263
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,958
- YEAH, WHY ARE YOU
COWERING IN THE CORNER?

264
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,250
- OH, UM, I WAS JUST--

265
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,916
- YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,083
- BACK OFF!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

267
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,875
DON'T TOUCH ME, JUST--

268
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,416
AHH!

269
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,333
- YOU OKAY?

270
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,708
- DO YOU HAVE A NOSEBLEED?
- All: NINA?

271
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,708
- ( Nina moaning )

272
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,041
- All: WAY TO GO!
YOU CAN DO IT.

273
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,000
- OH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, NINA?
I MEAN, ZERO.

274
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,833
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
I COULD BE WORSE OFF, RIGHT?

275
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,208
- Girl: WOW!
SHE IS REALLY FAST.

276
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,625
- GO, NINA!

277
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,750
- ZERO, ZERO, ZERO!
YOU SHOULD REALLY STOP

278
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,041
DRAWING SO MUCH ATTENTION
TO YOURSELF.

279
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,208
JUST LAY LOW.

280
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,125
- HEY, DON'T WORRY. YOU SHOULD
TRY TO RELAX A LITTLE.

281
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,208
- BUT I CAN'T SWIM.

282
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:34,375
- ( laughing )
- ( gasping )

283
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,708
- All: ZERO'S SINKING
LIKE A 10-POUND HAMMER!

284
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,375
- Girl: BUT LOOK AT NINA!

285
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,500
- NINA CAN REALLY SWIM.
SHE IS SO AWESOME.

286
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,458
- Boys: COOL!
SHE'S UNSTOPPABLE.

287
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:49,000
- ARGH!
- HEY, THAT'S THE MEN'S ROOM.

288
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,708
- LET GO OF ME!
- WHAT IS SHE DOING?

289
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,500
NINA'S AWESOME!

290
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,208
SHE'S EATING
WAY BEFORE LUNCH HOUR.

291
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,333
AWESOME!
AND SHE'S SLEEPING DURING CLASS.

292
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,625
NINA'S SO AWESOME!

293
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,583
WHENEVER YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE QUESTION, JUST SAY--

294
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,666
- I DON'T KNOW.
- THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE!

295
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,041
NINA IS SO AWESOME.

296
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:14,333
NINA'S INCREDIBLE.
SHE'S ALL, BAM, BIFF, BONK!

297
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,666
SHE'S INVINCIBLE!
- AHHH!

298
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,500
NINA IS SO AWESOME!

299
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,125
SHE ROCKS!

300
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,750
- ( laughing )

301
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,708
- TODAY MARKS THE BIRTH
OF THE LEGEND OF NINA.

302
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,541
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

303
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,625
THE LEGEND OF NINA?

304
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,041
- YEAH, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

305
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,916
- NINA IS SO INCREDIBLE.
SHE'S AMAZING.

306
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
SHE'S INVINCIBLE.
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!

307
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,541
- I TOLD ZERO HE SHOULD HAVE
KEPT A LOW PROFILE,

308
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,958
BUT NOW THE WHOLE SCHOOL
KEEPS YAPPING ON ABOUT ME.

309
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,750
AHH!
I WANNA SWITCH BACK.

310
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,041
- ACTUALLY, YOU'RE BETTER OFF
STAYING LIKE THIS

311
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,708
UNTIL THE TEST IS OVER.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

312
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,333
- JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
IF ZERO STAYS IN YOUR BODY,

313
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,375
THEN HE CAN FEND OFF
THE EXAMINEES

314
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,000
WHO COME AFTER THE CRYSTAL
PEARL. MAKE SENSE?

315
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,416
SEE, IT'S OUR BEST CHANCE
OF GUARDING NINA.

316
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,750
- YEAH, GOOD IDEA.
- NO, IT ISN'T.

317
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,666
I DON'T WANT TO STAY LIKE THIS
UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

318
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,125
- SHE'S RIGHT. I WANT TO GET
BACK IN MY OWN BODY TOO.

319
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,875
- ICHII, HELP!

320
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,166
- BASED ON WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO PULL UP ON MY LAPTOP,

321
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,291
I THINK YOUR HEARTS
HAVE BEEN SWAPPED.

322
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,958
AND ACCORDING TO THIS HERE, YOU
HAVE TO GET CLOSE TO EACH OTHER

323
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,208
IN ORDER TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS

324
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,041
AND RETURN TO YOUR
NORMAL BODIES.

325
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,333
- WE HAVE TO, UH...
- GET CLOSER?

326
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,875
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

327
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,458
- I'M STILL IN THE WRONG BODY.

328
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,041
- DO YOU THINK
WE NEED TO GET EVEN CLOSER?

329
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,000
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU BACK OFF?
- SHUT UP!

330
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,833
THIS IS THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

331
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,416
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GET ALL UP IN MY FACE, YOU!

332
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,750
- IT'S NANASE!

333
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,916
- WELL, NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE TWO OF YOU

334
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,791
ARE IN A BIT OF A PICKLE,
DOESN'T IT?

335
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,791
- ARE YOU THE ONE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?

336
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,208
- UH-HUH.

337
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,875
THEIR SWITCHEROO WAS COURTESY
OF MY CURSE CARD MAGIC.

338
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,083
AND GOOD LUCK TRYING
TO REVERSE THE SPELL, YOU TWO.

339
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,000
- CURSE CARDS?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

340
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,250
LOOK FAMILIAR?
- IS THAT MY BADGE?

341
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,875
- OH, IT SURE IS.
TRY FLIPPING IT OVER.

342
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,958
- THE CURSE WAS HIDDEN
ON THE BACK.

343
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,375
- SO WHEN YOU HIT NINA
IN THE FACE

344
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,291
DURING THE VOLLEYBALL MATCH,
WAS THAT JUST PART

345
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,125
OF YOUR SECRET PLAN
TO SWITCH THEIR BODIES?

346
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,375
- DING DING.

347
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,125
THIS CARD HAS THE POWER
TO SWITCH THE IDENTITIES

348
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,375
OF THE PERSON WHO WEARS IT

349
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,166
AND THE PERSON
WHO PEELS IT OFF.

350
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,416
CONSIDERING HOW JEALOUS
ZERO ALWAYS GETS,

351
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,625
I JUST KNEW HE'D TAKE THE BAIT

352
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,208
IF HE SAW ONE OF US
PUT IT ON NINA.

353
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
MANAGED TO TRICK US

354
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,333
WITH THAT STUPID PLAN OF YOURS.

355
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,833
- WELL, YOU SURE FELL FOR IT.

356
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,375
NOW LET ME TELL YOU GUYS
THE BEST PART.

357
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,916
WAIT TILL
YOU GET A LOAD OF THIS--

358
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,916
THE SWITCH WILL BE PERMANENT,

359
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,625
IF YOU DON'T REVERSE THE SPELL
WITHIN 24 HOURS, THAT IS.

360
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,541
SO YOU ONLY HAVE
ABOUT 10 MINUTES LEFT.

361
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,958
- WHAT?
JUST 10 MINUTES?

362
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,291
- THAT'S IT!

363
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,000
QUIT SCREWING AROUND AND
SWITCH US BACK RIGHT NOW.

364
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,000
- GLADLY. BUT FIRST
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

365
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,458
HAND OVER THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

366
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,000
AND THEN
THERE'S ONE MORE CONDITION.

367
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:01,125
I WANT ZERO
TO SINCERELY APOLOGIZE TO ME.

368
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,375
- GIVE ME A BREAK!

369
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,458
I CAN PROMISE
THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN, NANASE.

370
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,833
- YOU POSITIVE ABOUT THAT?

371
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,916
WELL, YOU CAN'T AFFORD
TO BE STUBBORN TOO MUCH LONGER.

372
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,333
- OH YEAH? WHY NOT?

373
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,416
- BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE
JUST UNDER EIGHT MINUTES LEFT

374
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,958
TO REVERSE THE SPELL.

375
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,833
AND TO BE HONEST, I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MANAGE IT.

376
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,416
- YOU'D BETTER APOLOGIZE TO HIM.
- YEAH, SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

377
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,791
- I WON'T GIVE YOU
THE SATISFACTION.

378
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,166
- WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS
BE SO HARDHEADED, ZERO?

379
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,625
- I'D RATHER STAY LIKE THIS
FOR THE REST OF MY NATURAL LIFE

380
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,916
THAN HAVE TO ADMIT DEFEAT

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,500
AND APOLOGIZE TO A SNEAKY
BRAT LIKE HIM.

382
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,541
( Nina thinking )
WHAT DO I DO?

383
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,625
I DON'T WANT
TO STAY LIKE THIS FOREVER,

384
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,708
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO
WITH NANASE AND YAKUMO, EITHER.

385
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,375
- NINA.

386
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,541
- ( Zero thinking )
HOW DARE NANASE MAKE NINA CRY?

387
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,875
- YOUR TIME'S ALMOST UP, ZERO.
WHAT'LL IT BE?

388
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,458
ARE YOU GONNA BE THE BIGGER MAN
AND APOLOGIZE ALREADY?

389
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,208
THREE MINUTES LEFT.
- ALL RIGHT.

390
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,250
ALL RIGHT, THEN, NANASE.

391
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,625
I'M ONLY GONNA SAY THIS ONCE,
SO YOU'D BETTER LISTEN.

392
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,125
- OH, FINE.  I'M READY
WHENEVER YOU ARE, ZERO.

393
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,875
- HERE GOES.
- YES?

394
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,875
- YOU GOT ME. I ADMIT YOU
BEAT ME FAIR AND SQUARE.

395
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,041
I'M SORRY.
YOU HAPPY?

396
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,083
- THAT'S THE MOST INSINCERE
APOLOGY I THINK I'VE EVER HEARD.

397
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,291
BUT, OH WELL.

398
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,708
AT LEAST NOW THE CRYSTAL PEARL
IS MINE, ALL MINE.

399
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,958
- ZERO, NO.
- BUT IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY.

400
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,541
WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE
RIGHT NOW.

401
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,625
YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT I'LL
GET US THROUGH THIS SITUATION.

402
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,625
ALL RIGHT?
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME, NINA.

403
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,500
- ZERO.

404
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:35,208
- NOW SWITCH US BACK.
- MY PLEASURE.

405
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,791
OKAY, HERE GOES.

406
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,666
MAGICAL REVERSE!
AHH!

407
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,958
- ALL RIGHT!
- WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL.

408
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,208
- Both: UH, WE'RE NOT.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

409
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,666
- I, UH, MUST HAVE USED
THE WRONG CARD.

410
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,625
GUESS I'LL JUST TRY IT AGAIN.

411
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,958
WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER.

412
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,708
MAGICAL REVERSE. MAGICAL
REVERSE. MAGICAL REVERSE.

413
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,875
- NANASE!
- BUT WHY ISN'T IT WORKING, HUH?

414
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,500
- JUST SWITCH US BACK!

415
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,541
- OOPSIE, I SEEM TO HAVE
FORGOTTEN WHICH CARD I USED.

416
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,500
- Both: WHAT!
ARE YOU KIDDING?

417
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,958
- THEN THAT MEANS
I APOLOGIZED FOR NOTHING.

418
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,500
- WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.

419
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,666
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

420
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,250
CAN'T YOU DO ANYTHING
TO SWITCH US BACK?

421
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,250
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

422
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,333
YOU HAVE TO GET CLOSE
TO EACH OTHER, ZERO.

423
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,125
- WE TRIED THAT ALREADY
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

424
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,000
SO YOU BETTER COME UP
WITH SOMETHING ELSE, AND QUICK,

425
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,791
OR WE'LL BE STUCK LIKE THIS
FOREVER.

426
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,625
- ZERO.
( thinking ) OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

427
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,500
I NEED TO KEEP MY COOL
FOR NINA'S SAKE.

428
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,708
SHE MUST BE A LOT MORE SCARED
THAN I AM RIGHT NOW.

429
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,500
I NEED TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT ONLY MYSELF

430
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,583
AND TAKE NINA'S FEELINGS
INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL.

431
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,041
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

432
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,291
WAIT, I THINK I KNOW WHAT ICHII
MEANS BY "GETTING CLOSE".

433
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,166
- COME OVER HERE, NINA.

434
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,166
FOCUS ALL YOUR THOUGHTS ON ME

435
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,291
AND I'LL FOCUS ALL MINE ON YOU,
GOT IT?

436
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,125
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
ZERO?

437
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,791
THIS ISN'T THE TIME OR THE PLACE
FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

438
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,125
HEY, LET GO OF ME, PLEASE.

439
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,208
- LISTEN TO ME.
WE WERE WRONG.

440
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,875
WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
PHYSICALLY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.

441
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,333
IN ORDER TO SWITCH BACK,

442
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,166
WE HAVE TO BE BONDED TOGETHER
IN FRIENDSHIP.

443
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,208
SO JUST CONCENTRATE ON ME.

444
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,208
AND I'LL CONCENTRATE ALL OF
MY THOUGHTS ON YOU AS WELL.

445
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,541
WE REALLY HAVE TO BE FOCUSED
IF THIS IS GONNA WORK.

446
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,583
ZERO.

447
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,750
- NINA?  NINA?

448
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,083
I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I REALLY DO CARE FOR YOU.

449
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,041
I WILL ALWAYS
CARRY YOU WITH ME

450
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,541
IN MY HEART AND IN MY MIND.

451
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,250
- AND I'LL ALWAYS TRUST YOU
TO BE RIGHT BY MY SIDE,

452
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,791
PROTECTING ME NO MATTER
WHAT DANGER

453
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,208
WE MAY BE UP AGAINST, ZERO.

454
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:55,541
- NINA, JUST PUT YOUR TRUST
IN ME.

455
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,791
I SWEAR,
I'LL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.

456
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,291
- ZERO.
- NINA.

457
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,916
Zero: OUR BODIES AREN'T THE
ONLY THINGS THAT ARE CLOSE.

458
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,708
IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

459
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,000
- Nina: WE SHARE
A MUCH STRONGER CONNECTION

460
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,166
BECAUSE OUR HEARTS
ARE BOUND IN FRIENDSHIP.

461
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,250
- ZERO!
- NINA!

462
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,083
- ZERO?
- NINA?

463
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,333
- IT WORKED.
- Yakumo: NANASE!

464
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,000
YOU HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

465
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,041
WHAT IN THE WORLD
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

466
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,333
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO LEAVE MY NINA ALONE!

467
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,208
NINA, ZERO, ICHII,
I'M SO SORRY.

468
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,708
PLEASE FORGIVE US.

469
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,500
- DON'T EVER LET IT HAPPEN
AGAIN, ALL RIGHT?

470
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,958
- YOU HAVE MY WORD.

471
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,041
I'LL TAKE NANASE HERE
BACK TO TRAINING

472
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,708
AND TEACH HIM SOME MANNERS.
BUT I'LL BE BACK, NINA!

473
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,875
SO WAIT FOR ME.

474
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:55,708
- Nanase: I WON'T GIVE UP
ON THE CRYSTAL PEARL!

475
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,958
- WAIT FOR ME, NINA.
I'LL BE BACK!

476
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,333
I PROMISE
WE'LL BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

477
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,500
- Zero:
WELL, GOOD RIDDANCE TO THEM.

478
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,541
- Both:
YOU'RE SAFE FOR NOW, NINA.

479
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,666
- THANK YOU, ZERO.
LOOKS LIKE YOU SAVED ME AGAIN.

480
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,708
- NO PROBLEM.

481
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,541
I'M JUST GLAD
TO BE BACK TO NORMAL

482
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:14,291
SO I CAN SEE YOUR SMILE AGAIN.
- YEAH, I AM TOO, ZERO.

483
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,416
( Nina thinking )
IT'S GOOD TO SEE HIM SMILING,

484
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,375
'CAUSE WHEN HE'S HAPPY,
I FEEL SAFE AND PROTECTED.

485
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,083
UM, I HEARD YOUR VOICE.

486
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,500
- YEAH,
I COULD HEAR YOU TOO.

487
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:29,000
I GUESS I DID ENJOY BEING YOU
FOR ONE REASON.

488
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,833
- WHY?

489
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,500
- YOUR BOOBS, DUH.

490
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,125
- WHAT A JERK!

491
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,416
PERVERT.
- AH!

492
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
- ( Nina thinking )
MY PRINCE.

493
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,791
I HEARD YOUR VOICE

494
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,833
AND YOUR HEART.

495
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,000
Nina: GO AHEAD, ZERO.
YOU CAN KISS ME.

496
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,708
- NINA?

497
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:27,666
- ALL RIGHT, HERE I COME.
READY?

498
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,000
- I FOUND YOU, ZERO!

499
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,875
- Zero:
HEY, WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

500
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:35,125
- HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
AND WHO IS THAT GIRL, ANYWAY?

501
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:38,083
- Nina: WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M ZERO'S FIANCEE.

502
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,708
NEXT TIME
ON "SAVE ME! LOLLIPOP"...

503
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,541
- Nina: I HATE YOU, ZERO.
- WHAT?
