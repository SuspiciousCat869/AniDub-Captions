1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,500
- Nina: I NEVER REALIZED
WHEN I MET ZERO AND ICHII,

2
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,416
THAT ONE DAY
THE TIME WOULD COME

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,625
WHEN WE WOULD
HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE.

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:22,250
I HAVEN'T APPRECIATED
THEIR KINDNESS TOWARDS ME,

5
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,791
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
THEY'VE GOTTEN HURT.

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,833
I DON'T WANT
TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEM,

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,916
BUT I CAN'T STAND
TO WATCH THEM

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,208
PUT THEMSELVES IN DANGER
BECAUSE OF ME ANYMORE.

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,458
- ( grunting )

10
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,916
- HEY, NINA!
- NINA.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,958
- I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE NOW.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,833
I HOPE YOU TWO
BECOME AMAZING SORCERERS.

13
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,833
- DON'T DO IT!
- NINA!

14
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,208
- THE TEST
IS GONNA BE OVER SOON.

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,375
AND SO IS CHRISTMAS.

16
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,208
AND THAT'S
WHEN OUR SEPARATION BEGINS.

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,666
I'M NINA YAMADA,

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,833
THE GIRL WHO ACCIDENTALLY
SWALLOWED THE CRYSTAL PEARL

19
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,833
AND WAS THROWN INTO THE MIDDLE
OF A MAGICAL SORCERY TEST.

20
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,958
BUT IT'S FINALLY
BEEN TAKEN OUT OF ME.

21
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,083
AND TODAY IS THE LAST DAY
OF THE EXAM-- CHRISTMAS DAY.

22
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,416
- Forte: WHAT'S GOING ON?

23
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,958
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE PEARL,
SAN?

24
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,416
- ( all gasping )
- IT'S SO STRANGE.

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,625
- WHAT'S WRONG?

26
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,166
- Tomi: IF NO ONE WANTS IT,
I'LL TAKE IT.

27
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,583
AHH!

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,875
- Ruby: CAW!

29
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,541
- ( Tomi grunting )
WHAT IS THIS?

30
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,125
IT'S ABSORBING MY POWER.

31
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,833
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

32
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,416
- FIREBALL PISTON!

33
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,000
- OH NO!

34
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,916
THEY ALL FELL DOWN THERE.
LET'S GO.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,625
WE HAVE TO HELP THEM.
HURRY!

36
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,708
- ( thinking )
I GUESS I-- I NEVER KNEW.

37
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,625
THAT THE PEARL I SWALLOWED
THAT DAY

38
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:41,208
WAS CAPABLE OF DOING
SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE THING.

39
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:46,125
I JUST NEVER REALIZED
THAT IT COULD DO ALL OF THIS.

40
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,291
HATSUKA, YOUKA!

41
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,333
- IT'S OKAY.

42
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,500
IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY'RE STILL ALIVE.

43
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,916
I THINK MAYBE THE BLAST
JUST KNOCKED THEM UNCONSCIOUS.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,125
- SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW,
ICHII?

45
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,625
- ( rumbling )

46
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,875
- AH!
- NINA!

47
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,375
HURRY, THIS WAY!

48
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,083
- Forte: ZERO!
- San: YAY!

49
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,583
- IT'S BEGUN.

50
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,666
- ( owl hooting )

51
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,458
- All: AH!

52
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,750
- WHAT IS THAT?

53
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,500
- Will: THE BLACK CRYSTAL PEARL.

54
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,375
- Both: WHAT THE--
- Zero: WHAT'S GOING ON?

55
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,250
- Nina:
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

56
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,500
- I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU THREE.

57
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,041
I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME
TO PAY YOU A VISIT.

58
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,333
- SOMETHING AWFUL HAPPENED
TO THE CRYSTAL PEARL

59
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,750
BECAUSE IT WAS
IN THE HUMAN'S BODY FOR SO LONG.

60
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,875
IT'S BEEN TRANSFORMED
INTO SOMETHING

61
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,333
THAT IS QUITE DANGEROUS.
- BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

62
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,291
- THIS HAS BEEN
A UNIQUE SITUATION.

63
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,333
NORMALLY A PEARL
ABSORBS A SORCERER'S POWER

64
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,791
AND GROWS ALONG WITH HIM
TO BECOME HIS HELPER.

65
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,291
HOWEVER,

66
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,375
THIS CRYSTAL PEARL WAS UNABLE TO
ABSORB ANY MAGICAL ENERGY

67
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,708
AFTER IT ENTERED
THE HUMAN'S BODY.

68
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,375
IT WAS EJECTED
WHILE IT WAS STILL INCOMPLETE.

69
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,541
AND THEREFORE
IT IS NOW ATTEMPTING

70
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,583
TO GROW VERY QUICKLY ON ITS OWN.

71
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,250
- Nina: ON ITS OWN?
- YES, AND IN ORDER TO GROW--

72
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,208
- YOU'RE SAYING THE PEARL
ABSORBED THE POWER

73
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,625
FROM HATSUKA AND YOUKA

74
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,875
AND FROM ALL OF THE OTHER KIDS
IN SCHOOL TOO?

75
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,750
- I'M AFRAID SO.

76
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,250
EVENTUALLY THE BLACK PEARL
WILL ABSORB THE POWER

77
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,625
FROM ALL LIVING CREATURES
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

78
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,625
- UNBELIEVABLE!

79
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,041
- IT WILL NOT STOP

80
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,750
UNTIL THERE IS NOTHING LEFT
FOR IT TO DEVOUR.

81
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,583
- WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING,
GUYS.

82
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,375
WE CAN'T LET THAT BLACK PEARL
KILL EVERYTHING ON EARTH.

83
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,875
- AND YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
LEFT TO STOP IT.

84
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,708
- HOW DO WE DO THAT?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE?

85
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,791
- NO, IT'S NOT.

86
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,958
NOT IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND
FOCUS OUR ATTACKS ON THE PEARL.

87
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,375
- Zero: HEY, ICHII?
- WHAT IS IT?

88
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,833
- TELL ME,
HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU PLANNING

89
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,791
ON GETTING THEM
TO FIGHT TOGETHER?

90
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,416
- Zura: YEAH,
THEY LOOK PRETTY UNCOORDINATED.

91
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,125
- THIS IS SO FUN!
- STAY FOCUSED.

92
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,458
WE NEED TO GET OUR HANDS
ON THAT CRYSTAL PEARL

93
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,416
SO WE CAN PASS THE EXAM.
HUH?

94
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,958
- San: OH NO!  WATCH OUT.

95
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,166
- I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU,
LADY ROKKA.

96
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,666
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

97
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,583
IF ANYTHING
WERE TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

98
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,375
YOUR FATHER
WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME.

99
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,708
- OH! BUT I WANT
TO BE WITH MY ICHII!

100
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,416
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WITHOUT HIM.  WAAA!

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,416
- ( all shouting )

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,291
- NO!

103
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,625
- ( both shouting )

104
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,833
- AH! ZERO, ICHII!

105
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,083
SAN, NO!  FORTE.

106
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,333
ROKKA, GOU!

107
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,083
THAT'S IT.
I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE.

108
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,208
JUST STOP IT!

109
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,291
YOU GUYS,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

110
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,958
ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE
HAS GOT TO STOP, ALL RIGHT?

111
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,791
I CAN'T STAND TO SEE YOU
GET HURT PROTECTING ME.

112
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,875
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS ANYMORE!

113
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,000
PLEASE!
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE SAFE.

114
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,333
- ZERO, YOU READY?
- I GUESS.

115
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,333
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE.

116
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:12,125
I NEVER IMAGINED I'D ENCOUNTER
ANYTHING AS POWERFUL AS THIS.

117
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,875
I THOUGHT WE'D ONLY BE
UP AGAINST THE OTHER EXAMINEES.

118
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,625
WHO WOULD'VE GUESSED
THAT THE MOST POWERFUL OPPONENT

119
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,041
WOULD TURN OUT TO BE
THE CRYSTAL PEARL ITSELF?

120
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,250
I'M SORRY.
- Ichii: FOR WHAT?

121
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,541
- FOR WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

122
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,541
I GUESS
YOU WERE RIGHT AFTER ALL.

123
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,125
- SO DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO IT?

124
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:33,000
- YEAH. NO MATTER HOW HARD IT
MAY BE, I KNOW THAT I CAN DO IT.

125
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,458
- YOU SURE?
- IT IS OUR ONLY CHANCE, ICHII.

126
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,875
- WE HAVE TO DO
WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT NINA.

127
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,083
- BUT ICHII--
- GO AHEAD.

128
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,083
- CHARM CAPSULE!

129
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,666
- HEY, WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT?

130
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,833
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS PLANNING
ON DOING? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

131
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,916
- WE'RE JUST MAKING SURE
YOU'RE SAFE.

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,750
- BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- LISTEN.

133
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,500
NOW THAT THE CRYSTAL PEARL
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED

134
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,333
FROM YOUR BODY, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO BE PART

135
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,666
OF THIS DANGEROUS
SITUATION ANY LONGER.

136
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,000
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR YOU TO BE HANGING AROUND US

137
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,333
BECAUSE THE EXAM
DOESN'T CONCERN YOU ANYMORE.

138
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,958
- BUT ZERO, ICHII,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

139
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,000
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
- IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

140
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,500
YOU NEED TO STAY FAR AWAY
FROM US, NINA.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,125
- NO,
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU!

142
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,958
- YOU'RE JUST IN OUR WAY HERE.
GO AWAY!

143
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,000
- ZERO, ZERO.

144
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,375
- SO LEAVE US ALONE
AND DISAPPEAR.

145
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,083
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT, NINA!
JUST GET OUTTA HERE!

146
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,750
- ZERO?
BUT I-- I DON'T WANT--

147
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,500
I DON'T WANT US
TO EVER BE APART!

148
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,041
- IT'S DONE.
- WE HAD TO DO IT.

149
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,791
IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY.

150
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,625
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO KEEP HER SAFE.

151
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,166
BUT I HATE
BEING WITHOUT HER.

152
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,583
AND IT'S-- IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF
THAT DAMNED BLACK CRYSTAL PEARL.

153
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,125
WE HAVE TO STOP IT.

154
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,125
- OH NO.
OH NO!

155
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,583
- YOU NEED TO STAY
FAR AWAY FROM US, NINA.

156
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,291
- GO AWAY!

157
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,375
- I DON'T WANT US
TO EVER BE APART!

158
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,208
- YOU'RE JUST IN OUR WAY HERE.

159
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,166
AHHH!

160
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,916
MAGIC CANNON!

161
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,375
DAMN IT.
- IT'S NO USE, ZERO.

162
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,500
MAGIC WON'T WORK.
IT ONLY INCREASES ITS POWER.

163
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,875
- THEN JUST WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, ICHII?

164
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,083
- ( crying )

165
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:56,416
ZERO!  ICHII!

166
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,416
- THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO
BE HANGING AROUND

167
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,250
BECAUSE THE EXAM
DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

168
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,541
YOU NEED TO STAY
FAR AWAY FROM US, NINA.

169
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,333
- YOU'RE JUST IN OUR WAY HERE.

170
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,791
- AM I REALLY IN THEIR WAY?

171
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,416
AM I JUST A BURDEN TO THEM?

172
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,083
NO!

173
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,916
ZERO, ICHII!

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,875
NO!

175
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,916
( crying )

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,291
ZERO, ICHII!

177
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,375
- Riru: ARE YOU OKAY?

178
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,750
- BUT AREN'T YOU RIRU?!

179
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,375
CAN YOU HELP ME?

180
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,875
YOU CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE,
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

181
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,041
ARE ZERO AND ICHII
GONNA WIN?

182
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,375
DO YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE GONNA
CAPTURE THE CRYSTAL PEARL?

183
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,333
AND WHAT DID YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU SAID

184
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,291
NO ONE
WAS GONNA PASS THE EXAM

185
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,958
AND THAT I WOULD NEVER GET
TO SEE ZERO AND ICHII AGAIN?

186
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,791
DOES THAT MEAN SOMETHING'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM?

187
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,541
- I DON'T KNOW.

188
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,291
- BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?

189
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,083
YOU DID SAY THAT,
DIDN'T YOU?

190
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,333
- THE FUTURE
ISN'T ALWAYS CLEAR.

191
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,291
AND RIGHT NOW I CAN'T SEE
A DEFINITE OUTCOME.

192
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,958
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

193
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,166
- I CAN'T SAY EXACTLY.

194
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,833
BUT THE FUTURE IS OFTEN
SUBJECT TO CHANGE, NINA.

195
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,000
AND IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHATEVER
YOU DECIDE TO DO NEXT.

196
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:36,458
- YOU MEAN THAT MY DECISIONS
COULD CHANGE THE FUTURE?

197
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,750
- YES.

198
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,958
- ( thinking )
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

199
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,958
THEN WHAT SHOULD I DO?

200
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MY ACTIONS
CAN CHANGE ANYTHING.

201
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,583
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM.

202
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,666
I CAN'T IMAGINE
BEING WITHOUT ZERO AND ICHII.

203
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,791
I WANT TO BE WITH THEM
TO THE VERY END,

204
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,000
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

205
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,083
- ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO DO THAT?

206
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,791
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU GO BACK,
ONLY DANGER AWAITS.

207
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,375
IT'S NOT SAFE
WITH THE TWO OF THEM.

208
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,250
- NO MATTER
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS,

209
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,041
I KNOW THAT I WANT
TO BE WITH MY FRIENDS.

210
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,708
I WANT TO BE BY THEIR SIDE
TO SUPPORT THEM

211
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,708
AS THEY FACE THEIR CHALLENGES.

212
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,791
BECAUSE I WILL ALWAYS HAVE FAITH
IN EVERY FRIEND THAT I HAVE,

213
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,666
NO MATTER WHAT.
AND ALL THAT I WANT RIGHT NOW

214
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,583
IS TO BE WITH THEM.

215
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,208
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION!

216
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,666
- HEY, NINA!

217
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,208
- ( thinking ) THAT'S RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE.

218
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,416
EVEN IF THEY PUSH ME AWAY,

219
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
OR TELL ME
THAT I'M NO USE TO THEM,

220
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,000
I STILL WANT TO BE
WITH MY FRIENDS.

221
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,000
I WANT TO BE
WITH ZERO AND ICHII.

222
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,500
THAT'S ALL I'VE EVER WANTED.

223
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,875
- AHH!

224
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,208
AHHH!
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

225
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,083
- IT'S NOT GONNA WORK!

226
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,750
- AHHH!

227
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,208
- IT'S NO USE.

228
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,208
WE'RE NO MATCH
FOR THE BLACK PEARL.

229
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,916
- WE CAN'T DEFEAT IT.

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,708
- THIS IS TOTALLY CRAZY,
BUT IT'S FOR NINA.

231
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,208
- AHHH!

232
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,291
- OH MAN!
WE HAVEN'T EVEN SCRATCHED IT.

233
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,416
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

234
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,208
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS THING.
WHY'S THIS HAPPENING?

235
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,625
WHY?!

236
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,125
- ZERO, ICHII!

237
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,333
- NINA CAME BACK!
- HUH?

238
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,041
- NINA?
AH!  NINA.

239
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,000
- ZERO!

240
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,833
ICHII!
- Zero: SHE'S BACK.

241
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,625
- BUT NINA--

242
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,208
- ZERO, ICHII.

243
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,000
( laughs )

244
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,166
- Both: SHE'S BACK.

245
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,958
NINA'S BACK.

246
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,916
- ( laughs )

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,666
- Black Pearl: OH, NINA.

248
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,666
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

249
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,000
I THOUGHT WE TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY?

250
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,916
THE CRYSTAL PEARL
IS OUT OF YOUR BODY,

251
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,208
SO THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU ANYMORE.

252
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,541
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET YOURSELF
HURT IF YOU STAY WITH US.

253
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,875
- BUT I CAME BACK
TO HELP YOU GUYS.

254
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,833
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HURT ALREADY
AND YOU'RE GETTING WORN OUT.

255
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,916
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,583
- BUT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
FOR YOU HERE.

257
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,416
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.
- NO, I'M STAYING.

258
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,625
AND I'M NOT LEAVING YOUR SIDE,
GOT IT?

259
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,958
- WHAT?

260
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,791
- JUST BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL PEARL
ISN'T IN MY BODY,

261
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,750
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

262
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,333
YOU TWO GUYS
ARE MY BEST FRIENDS.

263
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,625
AND WE'VE STUCK TOGETHER
THROUGH THIS WHOLE SITUATION.

264
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,791
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU RIGHT NOW,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY.

265
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,041
SURE, WE'VE ARGUED.
AND THERE WERE TIMES

266
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,166
WHEN I WISHED
IT WOULD ALL JUST GO AWAY.

267
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,375
BUT ZERO, ICHII, ZURA,

268
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,041
SAN, FORTE,
GOU, ROKKA,

269
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,166
NANASE AND YAKUMO TOO--

270
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,125
I'VE BECOME ATTACHED
TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM.

271
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,250
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE
WITHOUT THEM.

272
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,666
I JUST WANT
TO STAY BY YOUR SIDE.

273
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,791
I MAY NOT BE A SORCERER,

274
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,750
BUT JUST LIKE YOU'VE PROTECTED
ME, I WANT TO PROTECT YOU NOW.

275
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,291
I WANT TO BE HERE FOR YOU
WHEN YOU NEED ME.

276
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,208
I WON'T LEAVE YOU.

277
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,625
AND EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T HAVE MAGICAL POWERS,

278
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,791
I CARE ABOUT YOU ALL
MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW.

279
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,583
AND I KNOW THAT NO ONE CARES FOR
THEIR FRIENDS MORE THAN I DO.

280
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,750
I'M NEVER GONNA LEAVE YOU,
ZERO AND ICHII.

281
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,541
- I UNDERSTAND.

282
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,666
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
PUSHED YOU AWAY FROM US EARLIER.

283
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,500
- THE THOUGHT OF LOSING YOU
IS JUST TOO MUCH TO HANDLE.

284
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,125
- BUT WE'LL NEVER
DRIVE YOU AWAY AGAIN.  PROMISE.

285
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,250
WE'RE STRONG
WHEN YOU'RE WITH US,

286
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,250
'CAUSE YOUR FEELINGS FOR US
GIVE US STRENGTH.

287
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,250
SO THANK YOU
FOR COMING BACK.

288
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,583
YOU'VE TAUGHT US SO MUCH
ABOUT CARING FOR OTHERS.

289
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,833
THERE'S NO WAY WE WOULD'VE
BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT YOU

290
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,833
ALL THIS TIME IF WE
DIDN'T CARE FOR YOU.

291
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,791
OUR DESIRE TO KEEP YOU SAFE
HAS MADE US STRONG.

292
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,125
- Both: WE'LL PROTECT YOU,
NINA.

293
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,125
WE'LL PROTECT YOU
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

294
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,166
PROMISE.
- I WANT TO DO ALL I CAN.

295
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,375
NOTHING'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN KEEPING MY FRIENDS SAFE

296
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,625
FROM THE BLACK PEARL.

297
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,958
LET'S DO IT!

298
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,541
- Black Pearl: NOT SO FAST.

299
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,208
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

300
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,125
- All: MAGIC CRYSTAL BARRIER!

301
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,208
- WE WON'T LOSE!
- Forte: WE WON'T GIVE UP!

302
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,000
- SAN?
- FORTE?

303
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,125
- I DECIDED THAT I DON'T
REALLY WANT THE PEARL ANYMORE.

304
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,958
- SOME THINGS ARE MORE
IMPORTANT. WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

305
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,500
- Rokka: THAT'S RIGHT!

306
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,083
I DON'T CARE IF I GET
TO BE WITH ICHII OR NOT!

307
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,083
OR EVEN
IF HE GIVES ME ATTENTION.

308
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,791
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT HE'S SAFE FROM HARM.

309
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,500
- LADY ROKKA, I UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL,

310
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,833
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.
- I AGREE.

311
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,666
- YAKUMO?  NANASE?

312
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,000
- ALL I WANNA DO IS PROTECT
THE PERSON I LOVE AS WELL.

313
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,791
RIGHT, NINA?

314
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,833
LET'S DO THIS.
FOR MY PRECIOUS LITTLE NINA.

315
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,541
- All: FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE DEAR TO US!

316
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,958
- Black Pearl: NO!

317
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,583
- Zura: NINA, I NEED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

318
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,250
DO YOU KNOW WHO IT IS NOW?

319
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,375
DO YOU KNOW
WHO WATCHED OVER YOU

320
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,958
AND WHO WANTED TO KEEP YOU SAFE
FROM HARM NO MATTER WHAT?

321
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,375
- I DO.
IT'S MY PARENTS.

322
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,166
'CAUSE THEY NURSED ME
BACK TO HEALTH

323
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,500
WHENEVER I HURT MYSELF.

324
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,625
AND THEY WERE ALWAYS MUCH MORE
WORRIED ABOUT MY WELL-BEING

325
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,916
THAN THEY WERE
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,083
- THEY ALWAYS PROTECTED ME.

327
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,875
- DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO SAVE MY PRECIOUS DAUGHTER.

328
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,041
- BUT STILL, MY MOM AND DAD
WEREN'T ALWAYS THAT STRONG.

329
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,666
THEY HAD TO LEARN
HOW TO CARE FOR ME.

330
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,875
- WHEN I WAS BORN,
THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

331
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,166
- BUT THEY GRADUALLY
BECAME STRONGER

332
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,250
AS THEY LEARNED
FROM DAY TO DAY.

333
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,166
THEY MADE MISTAKES
AND THEY SCOLDED ME.

334
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,583
BUT STILL, THEY DID IT ALL
BECAUSE THEY LOVED ME.

335
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,166
AND THEY RAISED ME
THE BEST WAY THEY KNEW HOW.

336
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,291
THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN PERFECT,
BUT THEY WERE WILLING

337
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,875
TO DO WHATEVER IT TOOK
TO PROTECT THE ONE THEY LOVED.

338
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:27,250
ZERO AND ICHII, I CARE FOR YOU
JUST LIKE THEY CARED FOR ME.

339
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,583
AND ALL OF YOU!
SAN, FORTE,

340
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,875
GOU, ROKKA,

341
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,375
YAKUMO AND NANASE.

342
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,416
I WANT TO SHARE THIS FEELING

343
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,166
AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE DEAR TO ME!

344
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,083
- AND TO HELP EACH OTHER
ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS!

345
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,708
- AND I EVEN WANT TO HELP YOU,
BLACK PEARL.

346
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,833
- ( growls )

347
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,000
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT FRIENDS
AND ENEMIES.

348
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,458
I JUST WANT TO PROTECT
EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD.

349
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,083
- AHHH!
- ZERO!

350
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,416
USE THE MAGIC CANNON!

351
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,958
- TAKE THIS!

352
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,375
- AND NOW, ICHII,
IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL ATTACK.

353
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:20,166
USE YOUR POWER AND SWITCH THE
POLARITY OF THE CRYSTAL.

354
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,375
- ( growls )

355
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:35,625
- COME ON!
THERE'S NO NEED TO BE AFRAID.

356
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,333
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

357
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,750
JUST LOOK AT THE LIGHT,

358
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,791
THE LIGHT
THAT SURROUNDS AND PROTECTS YOU.

359
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,041
THE LIGHT FEELS SO GENTLE
AND WARM, DOESN'T IT?

360
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,541
SO VERY WARM.

361
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,916
- NINA.
- YOU DID IT.

362
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,250
- I'M HAPPY
BECAUSE NOW ALL OF MY FRIENDS

363
00:18:56,333 --> 00:19:00,041
ARE FINALLY SAFE FROM THE POWER
OF THE BLACK CRYSTAL PEARL.

364
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,083
- Will: AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE.

365
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,208
TRUE MAGICAL POWER
IS NOT CREATED

366
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,333
THROUGH DESTRUCTION AND CHAOS.

367
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,583
AND MERELY PASSING A TEST
DOES NOT MAKE YOU A SORCERER.

368
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,958
INSTEAD, THE DESIRE TO PROTECT
WHAT'S PRECIOUS TO YOU

369
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,541
WITHOUT DISTINCTION
OF FRIEND OR FOE

370
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,125
IS WHAT MAGICAL POWER
IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT.

371
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,416
NINA,
YOU MAY NOT BE A TRUE SORCERER,

372
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,666
BUT IN YOUR HEART,

373
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,500
YOU HOLD THE KEY
TO UNLOCK YOUR POTENTIAL.

374
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,875
YOU'VE PROVEN
THAT YOU CARE DEEPLY

375
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,625
FOR ALL YOUR NEW FRIENDS.

376
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,208
CONGRATULATIONS,
ZERO AND ICHII.

377
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,250
WITH YOUR KIND NATURE,
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE ABLE

378
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,166
TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING
YOU WISH.

379
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,000
SAN AND FORTE,

380
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,416
I APPLAUD YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT
FOR EACH OTHER.

381
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,250
GOU, ROKKA, NANASE,
AND YAKUMO AS WELL,

382
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,666
YOU SHOULD ALL BE PROUD.

383
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,041
THE POWER
YOU'VE HELPED TO ACTIVATE

384
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,208
IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
IN THE WORLD.

385
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,875
- Zero: YOU MEAN--
- YOU'VE ALL PASSED THE TEST.

386
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,416
UPON RETURNING HOME,

387
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,583
YOU'LL BE MADE
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

388
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,375
- Rokka: WE DID IT!
- San: YIPPEE.

389
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,333
- NOW WE'RE REAL SORCERERS.

390
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,750
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK
TO THE MAGIC WORLD.

391
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,458
- ( thinking )
ZERO, ICHII,

392
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,375
I'M NOT SAD

393
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,416
BECAUSE YOUR DREAMS
HAVE COME TRUE.

394
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
- NINA!

395
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,958
- ZERO, ICHII!

396
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,083
CONGRATULATIONS.

397
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,625
I HOPE YOU GROW
TO BE WONDERFUL SORCERERS.

398
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,666
I WANT YOU
TO BECOME SO POWERFUL

399
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,125
THAT YOU CAN PROTECT EVERYONE
IN THE UNIVERSE.

400
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,666
- Both: NINA.
- ICHII, THANKS SO MUCH

401
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,250
FOR HELPING ME OUT
WITH ALL OF MY SCHOOLWORK.

402
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,583
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'LL DO AFTER YOU'RE GONE.

403
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,041
I'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL
ALL THE TIME.

404
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,666
ZERO!

405
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,041
THANK YOU
FOR ALWAYS PROTECTING ME

406
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,333
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU WERE UP AGAINST.

407
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,750
IT'LL BE A LOT QUIETER
AROUND HERE AFTER YOU'VE GONE.

408
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,750
ZERO, ICHII!

409
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,666
I'LL NEVER FORGET THE TIME
THAT WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER

410
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,875
AND THE FACT THAT YOU
PROTECTED ME SO BRAVELY.

411
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,666
I'LL NEVER FORGET ALL THE
GOOD TIMES THAT WE SHARED,

412
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,833
LIKE THE TRIP TO THE BEACH
WHERE WE PLAYED VOLLEYBALL

413
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,916
AND THE COURAGE TEST.

414
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,041
I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU GUYS,

415
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,333
NO MATTER HOW PAINFUL
IT MAY BE.

416
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:21,291
BECAUSE YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE MY SWEET PRINCES.

417
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,375
- NINA.
- NINA.

418
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:29,041
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU
FOR CARING ABOUT ME SO MUCH.

419
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,958
- NINA.

420
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,333
- THANK YOU, ZERO AND ICHII.

421
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,708
- Will:
WELL, IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME.

422
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:41,000
IN ONE MINUTE,
THE CLOCK STRIKES MIDNIGHT.

423
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:45,583
WITH THAT COMES THE END
OF THE DAY AND THE TEST.

424
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,000
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF YOU
HERE REMEMBER THIS MOMENT.

425
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,958
THINK OF THIS NOT AS THE END
OF YOUR TRAINING,

426
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,125
BUT THE BEGINNING
OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL LIFE.

427
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,625
- BUT WILL--

428
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,458
- ONE YEAR FROM NOW, I WANT YOU
TO LOOK AT THAT SAME CLOCK

429
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,750
AND BE GLAD THAT YOU PASSED THE
SECOND HALF OF THE FINAL TEST.

430
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,833
IF YOU ALL MAKE IT, THAT IS.

431
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,375
- All: WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

432
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,833
- WELL, IT MEANS YOU PASSED
THE FIRST HALF OF THE TEST.

433
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,916
BUT THERE'S STILL
MORE WORK TO BE DONE.

434
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
- All: WHAT?!
MORE WORK?

435
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,833
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR OBJECTIVE

436
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,458
IS TO GROW THE POOR LITTLE PEARL
THAT NINA HAS SAVED

437
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,000
INTO A FULL-FLEDGED
SORCERER'S HELPER.

438
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:26,083
AND YOU HAVE UNTIL DECEMBER 24th
OF NEXT YEAR TO DO SO.

439
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,666
ALL OF YOU WILL BE INVOLVED
IN THIS PROCESS.

440
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,166
FOR YOU SEE,
YOU MUST HELP NINA

441
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,833
TO BECOME A
PROFESSIONAL SORCERER

442
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,125
JUST AS SHE HAS
HELPED ALL OF YOU.

443
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,875
- All: WHAT?!
ALL OF US?

444
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,791
- SO DOES THAT MEAN
THAT WE GET TO STAY?

445
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,958
WE GET TO SPEND THE ENTIRE YEAR
HERE HELPING NINA?

446
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:48,416
- All: THAT'S SO AWESOME!
WE'LL SPEND THE YEAR WITH NINA.

447
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,416
- Will: EXACTLY.
- ( bell tolling )

448
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,041
- NINA, CONSIDER THIS
MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO YOU.

449
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,583
I HOPE THAT YOU ENJOY IT.

450
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,166
- WILL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

451
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,416
THIS IS THE BEST
CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER.

452
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,625
- OF COURSE.

453
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,000
I'M JUST GLAD
I COULD BRING YOU HAPPINESS.

454
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,250
SO MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU ALL.

455
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,791
BE SURE TO TAKE GOOD CARE
OF THIS LITTLE GUY.

456
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,791
- AND MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU.

457
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,541
AND I PROMISE
I'LL WORK EXTRA HARD

458
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,875
TO DO EVERYTHING
THAT I POSSIBLY CAN

459
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,791
TO PROTECT HIM
UNTIL HE CAN BECOME

460
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,541
A FULL-FLEDGED
SORCERER'S HELPER.

461
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,166
I SWEAR IT.
