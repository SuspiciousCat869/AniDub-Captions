1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,916
- MY NAME'S NINA, AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,125
AT LEAST I WAS,
UNTIL ONE DAY.

3
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,833
I ACCIDENTALLY
SWALLOWED SOMETHING

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,250
CALLED THE CRYSTAL PEARL

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,250
WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,458
AND MY LIFE HASN'T
BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,166
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,916
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,958
AND THE TEAM
OF TWO EXAMINEES

10
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,291
WHO ARE ABLE TO TRACK IT DOWN
FIRST WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

11
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,500
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,375
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

13
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,541
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

14
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,666
- HUH?

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,291
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,416
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,083
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST
IS OVER.

18
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,791
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH
OVER HER

19
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,375
UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

20
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,416
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,416
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,916
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,333
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

24
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,541
REALLY?

25
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,958
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

26
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,375
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

27
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,791
NO MATTER HOW
FEROCIOUS THEY MAY BE

28
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,500
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

29
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,375
THESE TWO ARE HERE
TO PROTECT ME.

30
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,375
( panting, grunting )

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,833
WHY AM I ALWAYS THE ONE
WHO GETS CHASED BY THE BAD GUYS?

32
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,041
WHAT DO THEY WANT FROM ME?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO THEM.

33
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,583
AHH!

34
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,625
AH!  HELP ME!

35
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,708
HELP ME, PLEASE!

36
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,541
- ( alarm sounding )

37
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,208
- YOU BETTER WAKE UP
AND GET READY FOR SCHOOL, NINA.

38
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,291
THE ALARM'S BEEN GOING OFF
FOR LIKE 10 MINUTES ALREADY.

39
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,875
- AHHH!

40
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,000
- ( both grunting )

41
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,875
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

42
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,625
- JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
DOING IN MY ROOM, YOU PERVERT?

43
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,500
- PERVERT?
- GET OUT OF HERE!

44
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,708
DON'T EVER ENTER A GIRL'S ROOM
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

45
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,125
- OW OW OW OW OW!

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,250
- Ichii: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- ICHII, HELP ME.

47
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,458
- SO YOU READY TO GO, NINA?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

48
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,916
- REMEMBER,
WE'RE SWORN TO PROTECT YOU.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,958
STARTING TODAY, WE'LL BE
GOING WITH YOU TO SCHOOL.

50
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,458
- Zura: THAT'S THE DEAL.
- EVERY DAY?

51
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,041
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA TELL HER, ZERO.

52
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,291
- I WAS GOING TO,

53
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,416
BUT SHE STARTED WAILING ON
ME OUT OF NOWHERE.

54
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,916
- YOU BROUGHT THAT ON YOURSELF.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
IN MY BED.

56
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,666
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

57
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,291
- ALL RIGHT,
LEAVE HER ALONE.

58
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,500
NINA, WHEN YOU'RE READY,
LET ME KNOW.

59
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,333
I'LL BE WAITING.
COME ON, ZERO.

60
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,291
- ALL RIGHT, BUT
THIS ISN'T OVER.

61
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,500
- HEY, WAIT!

62
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:41,250
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
ZERO AND ICHII ARE SORCERERS.

63
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,250
THIS IS AWESOME.

64
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SORCERERS.

65
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,833
WAIT TILL I TELL MY FRIENDS.

66
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,875
- YEAH, BUT REMEMBER,
WE ARE STILL IN TRAINING.

67
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,458
- IF THINGS
GO ACCORDING TO PLAN,

68
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,041
WE WON'T BE HERE
FOR MUCH LONGER.

69
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,041
AFTER WE FINISH THE EXAM,
WE'LL BE PROS.

70
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,208
AND THEN I'LL HAVE THE SKILLS
I NEED TO PURSUE MY DREAM.

71
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,666
- BUT EVEN IF YOU
DON'T BECOME PROFESSIONALS,

72
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,500
IT'S STILL REALLY COOL THAT YOU
CAN MAKE CARS FLY AND STUFF.

73
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,750
- YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
AT ALL, DO YOU?

74
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,333
- SOMEONE'S SNAPPY!
AND HERE'S AN IDEA--

75
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,750
TRY NOT BEING SUCH A JERK.
'KAY?

76
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,083
- ( owl hooting )
- Zero: AW, GREAT.

77
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,833
- Ichii: IT'S SAN AND FORTE.

78
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,541
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
- FOCUS, SAN.

79
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,708
WE HAVE TO GET
THAT CRYSTAL PEARL TODAY.

80
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,250
GOT IT?

81
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,666
( playing )

82
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,875
- HEY GUYS, DO YOU KNOW
WHY I'M FLOATING?

83
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,333
- GIVE HER BACK NOW!

84
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:44,250
- DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME.
I WANT TO PLAY.

85
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,583
SUMMONING MAGIC!
AIR FISH!

86
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,333
GO!

87
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,625
- AHHHH!

88
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,291
NO!  DON'T EAT ME.
- NINA!

89
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,625
CHARM CAPSULE!

90
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,833
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
TAKE MY PETS AWAY?

91
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,208
- AHH!

92
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,416
- Ichii: NINA!
- AHHH!

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,708
- NINA!  AHHH!

94
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,791
- ( people shouting )
- Man: WHAT'S THAT?

95
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,750
- I HOPE YOU REALIZE
THIS ISN'T OVER YET!

96
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,500
- San: BYE, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.

97
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,583
- SO THEY'RE GOING
TO COME BACK FOR ME?

98
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,541
- OF COURSE THEY'LL COME
BACK FOR YOU.

99
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,833
- AND THEY'LL KEEP COMING BACK
TILL THE TEST IS OVER.

100
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,541
- BUT THEY WON'T BE
THE ONLY ONES.

101
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,125
THEY WANT THE PEARL.

102
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,708
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE JOKING, ZERO.

103
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,500
DO I REALLY HAVE TO LIVE
LIKE THIS UNTIL CHRISTMAS?

104
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,125
- All: YUP. YEAH. THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH HOW IT GOES.

105
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,916
- GOOD MORNING, NINA.
- HOW ARE YOU?

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,291
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED TO US YESTERDAY.

107
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,041
I ALMOST FREAKED OUT WHEN THAT
CAR FELL OUT OF THE SKY.

108
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,208
- THEY SAID
THAT IT WAS FOR A TV SHOW.

109
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,708
- REALLY?

110
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,916
- WEIRD, HUH?
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL TODAY?

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,666
- OH, I FEEL JUST FINE.
THANKS FOR ASKING, HATSUKA.

112
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,291
( thinking ) I'M THE FURTHEST
THING FROM FINE RIGHT NOW.

113
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,125
BUT AT LEAST I'LL BE ABLE
TO TAKE A BREAK FROM IT ALL

114
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,625
WHILE I'M AT SCHOOL.

115
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,500
- THESE ARE OUR NEW TRANSFER
STUDENTS, ZERO AND ICHII.

116
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:30,750
- AHH! WHAT?
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

117
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,416
- I WANT EVERYBODY
TO DO THEIR BEST

118
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,125
TO MAKE OUR NEW STUDENTS
FEEL AT HOME.

119
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,291
TRANSFERRING INTO A NEW SCHOOL

120
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,750
AFTER THE SEMESTER'S ALREADY
STARTED CAN BE PRETTY DIFFICULT.

121
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,416
AND THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS

122
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,791
IS FINDING A PLACE
FOR THESE BOYS TO SIT.

123
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,416
- IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU,

124
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,541
I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE DESK
HERE BESIDE NINA.

125
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,750
- AND I'LL GLADLY TAKE THIS
OTHER FREE DESK BESIDE NINA,

126
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,750
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH EVERYONE.

127
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,416
- ( all squealing )
- Both: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?!

128
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,166
WHO ARE THESE NEW GUYS?

129
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,375
- ARE YOU LIKE FRIENDS
WITH THEM, NINA?

130
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,791
- YEAH, "FRIENDS" ISN'T QUITE
THE WORD THAT I WOULD USE.

131
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,250
- WHAT ARE YOU HIDING FROM US?

132
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,125
- TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON, NINA.

133
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,833
- WELL, IT'S JUST THAT--
- IT'S LOVE, ISN'T IT?

134
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,666
- YOU NEED TO
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, OKAY?

135
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,833
- AS YOU MAY REMEMBER
FROM OUR LAST TEST--

136
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,333
- Nina: HEY ZERO, ICHII?

137
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,458
WHY'D YOU REGISTER
FOR ALL MY CLASSES?

138
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,166
- WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LET OUR GUARD DOWN.

139
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,833
YOU COULD BE ATTACKED ANYWHERE,
ANYTIME.

140
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,666
- AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE, WE
WON'T LET YOU GET HURT,

141
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,916
SO DON'T WORRY.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,791
- STILL...

143
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,666
THEIR STARES, THEIR STARES.

144
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,750
THEIR STARES, THEIR STARES,
THEIR STARES!

145
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,500
THEY'RE SO PIERCING.

146
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,583
- ( bell tolling )

147
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,875
- AH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

148
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,500
- WE'RE TAKING YOU TO CLASS,
NINA.

149
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,083
- YOU HAVE CHEMISTRY NEXT,
DON'T YOU?

150
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,291
- AH, YEAH.
- THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

151
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,708
- ALL RIGHT, I GUESS
WE'D BETTER TAKE OUR SEATS.

152
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,375
- YEAH, THIS IS A GOOD SPOT.

153
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,208
- I'LL SIT HERE.
- AND I'LL SIT HERE.

154
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,041
- HEY.
- YOU'RE IN OUR SEATS.

155
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,875
- IF YOU DON'T MIND,

156
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,791
WE'D LIKE TO STAY AS CLOSE
AS POSSIBLE TO NINA TODAY.

157
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,458
WE CAN'T HELP IT.

158
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,125
WE'RE DRAWN
TO NINA'S REMARKABLE BEAUTY.

159
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,041
- CAN'T GET ENOUGH.
- Both: WHAT?!

160
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,583
- All: WHAT?! WHAT?!

161
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,250
- Girl: HEY, DID YOU HEAR?

162
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,083
NINA AND THOSE TWO GUYS
ARE GOING OUT.

163
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,333
- I HEARD THEY TRANSFERRED
FROM THEIR OLD SCHOOL

164
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,958
JUST SO THEY COULD BE WITH NINA.
- OHHH!

165
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,833
- SO THAT'S WHY THOSE THREE
ARE ALWAYS TOGETHER.

166
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,000
- HOW DID I GET MYSELF
INTO THIS?!

167
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,250
LEAVE ME ALONE!

168
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,541
- ( all chattering )

169
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,541
- SERIOUSLY, CAN'T YOU
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE TO MYSELF?

170
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,833
I'LL BE OKAY HERE.
- I'M SORRY, NINA,

171
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,833
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON YOU.

172
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,333
- THE WHOLE SCHOOL'S GOSSIPING
ABOUT ME NOW.

173
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,166
- QUIT COMPLAINING.
THIS IS YOUR FAULT

174
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,666
FOR SWALLOWING THE PEARL ANYWAY.
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

175
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,708
IT'S NOT LIKE I ATE IT
ON PURPOSE!

176
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,041
- AND IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT TO BE
HERE GUARDING YOU RIGHT NOW.

177
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,916
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU
DON'T WANT TO PROTECT ME?

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,750
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT, SO DON'T GO
GETTING ALL HUFFY WITH ME, NINA.

179
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,250
IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOU, WE HAVE
TO STAY CLOSE, UNDERSTAND?

180
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,166
- YOU ARE SO BOSSY!

181
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,375
- HEY, NINA.
- NINA, GET BACK HERE.

182
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,333
I'M NOT KIDDING.
NINA!

183
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,291
- Ichii: I GUESS I CAN
UNDERSTAND WHY SHE'S SO UPSET.

184
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,458
IT'S PROBABLY NATURAL FOR HER
TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

185
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,791
SHE'S BEING FOLLOWED AROUND
ALL DAY EVERY DAY

186
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,416
WITHOUT EVEN A MOMENT ALONE.
- YEAH, I GUESS.

187
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,041
BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LEAVE HER ALONE NOW.

188
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,333
SHE'S IN TROUBLE
AND WE HAVE TO PROTECT HER

189
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,541
FROM THE EXAMINEES
AFTER THE PEARL.

190
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,250
WE HAVE TO.

191
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,416
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF 'EM
WHO WOULD HARM NINA

192
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,375
IF GIVEN THE CHANCE
AND REMOVE THE PEARL BY FORCE.

193
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,833
NINA CAN'T USE MAGIC,
SO IF THAT HAPPENS,

194
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,708
SHE WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

195
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,833
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO STAY HERE

196
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,958
AND DEFEND NINA
UNTIL THE MEDICINE'S READY.

197
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,500
I DON'T CARE IF SHE HATES US.

198
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,500
WE HAVE TO KEEP HER SAFE
AT ALL COSTS.

199
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,750
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- YEAH.

200
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,541
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
YOU GUYS?

201
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,875
I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM ME,
DIDN'T I?

202
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,833
PUT ME DOWN.
ZERO, ICHII!

203
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,041
( crying )

204
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,000
- Forte: JUST GREAT.

205
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,083
I GUESS WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
AS LONG AS THOSE GUYS

206
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,083
ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE
ON THE PEARL.

207
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,041
- OH, BOY,
I JUST GOT A GREAT IDEA.

208
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,250
- ARE YOU SURE, SAN?

209
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,541
- MM-HMM.  LEAVE IT TO ME.
THIS'LL BE GREAT.

210
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,291
I'M SURE
IT'LL LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

211
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:09,375
- LOOK GOOD ON ME?
- ( laughing )

212
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,416
I HAVE A QUESTION.

213
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,833
- FIRE AWAY, FO.

214
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,958
- WHAT IS THIS?

215
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,000
- IT'S MY BRILLIANT
DISGUISE FOR YOU.

216
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,500
- I'M DRESSED LIKE A GIRL.
- OF COURSE!

217
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,083
THIS WAY YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO ATTACK NINA

218
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,125
IN THE ONLY PLACE THOSE GUYS
CAN'T GUARD HER--

219
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,916
THE GIRL'S BATHROOM.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,041
- JUST GREAT.
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

221
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,833
I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT. NOBODY'S
GONNA THINK I'M A GIRL!

222
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,708
- Boy: HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

223
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,500
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
SOME NEW CLASSMATES.

224
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,333
AND EVEN BETTER,
THEY'RE BOTH CUTE!

225
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,666
WOW, I THINK I'M IN LOVE.
- THAT'S IT!

226
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,791
LET'S JUST GET THE CRYSTAL PEARL
ALREADY

227
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,125
SO WE CAN HURRY UP
AND GET OUT OF THIS PLACE!

228
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,958
- FO!

229
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,791
- SHUT UP, SAN!
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

230
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,791
- ROGER THAT.
I'M RIGHT ON YOUR TAIL,

231
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,041
BUT LET'S GO
GET THAT CRYSTAL PEARL.

232
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,458
- BACK OFF!

233
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,458
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

234
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,375
- HOW MANY TIMES
ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO TELL YOU?

235
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,041
IF WE'RE GONNA PROTECT YOU,
WE CAN'T BACK OFF.

236
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,041
- I UNDERSTAND,
BUT GIVE ME SOME SPACE.

237
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,166
YOU'VE RUINED MY REPUTATION

238
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,958
AND MADE ME THE GOSSIP
OF THE SCHOOL.

239
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,291
WITH YOU TWO ALWAYS AROUND,
PEOPLE THINK WE'RE GOING OUT.

240
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,500
- WELL, I CAN SEE
HOW THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

241
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,291
I REALLY WISH THERE WAS SOME
OTHER WAY TO DO THIS,

242
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,541
BUT THERE ISN'T.

243
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,458
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS,
NINA.

244
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,291
- YEAH. ANYWAY, THIS IS
FRUSTRATING,

245
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,833
SO CUT ME SOME SLACK.

246
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,250
DON'T-- AH!

247
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,875
- NINA!
- NINA!

248
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,208
ARE YOU OKAY?

249
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,250
ARE YOU OKAY, NINA?
DOES ANYTHING HURT?

250
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,625
- I-- I'M FINE, ICHII.
THANKS FOR ASKING!

251
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,208
OH, MY GOODNESS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

252
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,000
MY HEART IS STILL POUNDING.

253
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,583
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT HE COULD BE--

254
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:13,250
COULD THE ONE WHO PROTECTED ME
IN MY DREAM BE...

255
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,625
ICHII?

256
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,500
- NINA, I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
- ( thinking ) IS IT POSSIBLE?

257
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,291
- All: HEY, NINA!

258
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,541
- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU
AND THOSE TWO GUYS?

259
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,291
- YEAH, HOW WOULD YOU
CLASSIFY YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

260
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,208
- BOYFRIENDS?
- LOVE TRIANGLE?

261
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,625
- DO YOU KNOW
THEIR CELL PHONE NUMBERS?

262
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,125
- DON'T HOLD OUT.
GIVE THEM TO US!

263
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,833
- ( Nina shouting )
- ( Forte laughing )

264
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,833
THIS IS GOING TO BE A WHOLE LOT
EASIER THAN I EXPECTED, SAN.

265
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,791
NOW GIVE US THE PEARL.

266
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,458
- YOU GUYS
ARE SAN AND FORTE!

267
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:45,666
I HAD NO IDEA.

268
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,000
WOW, I REALLY HAD NO IDEA.

269
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,833
- UM, WHAT?

270
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,708
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE A BOY,
FORTE.  I'M SO SORRY.

271
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,166
- I AM A BOY!
YOU WEREN'T MISTAKEN.

272
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,166
THE ONE AND ONLY REASON
I WOULD EVER WEAR A DRESS

273
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,125
IS TO CAPTURE YOU.

274
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,833
GOT IT?!
- All: WHAT?!

275
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,458
YOU'RE A BOY?!
A BOY?!

276
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,666
- Girl: YOU PERVERT!
- AHH!

277
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,625
- All: AHHH!
WHAT THE HECK IS HE THINKING?

278
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,750
COMING IN HERE TRYING
TO PASS HIMSELF OFF AS A GIRL!

279
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,250
- IF I EVER CATCH UP TO HIM,
I SWEAR I'LL END HIS LIFE!

280
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,083
- WAIT!  OH!

281
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,958
- Girl: IT'S ICHII AND ZERO.

282
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,000
- WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

283
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,833
- WHAT TYPE OF GIRLS
DO YOU LIKE?

284
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,166
- DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

285
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,708
- CAN I HAVE
YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER?

286
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,291
- LET'S GET TOGETHER
AND HAVE A PARTY.

287
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,791
PARTY!
- HEY, ZERO,

288
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,833
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
WHILE WE'RE STILL ALIVE.

289
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,583
- WAIT!
- ICHII, ZERO!

290
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,250
- ALL RIGHT. I SHOULD GET OUT
OF HERE WHILE I CAN TOO.

291
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,375
- ( humming )
- AH!

292
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,458
- THAT'S CALLED AN AIR FISH.

293
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,958
IT'S A FISH,
BUT IT'S A CARNIVORE,

294
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,791
SO YOU MIGHT WANT
TO BE CAREFUL

295
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,708
'CAUSE THEY DO EAT PEOPLE
NOW AND AGAIN.

296
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,166
- AHH!
- WANT TO PLAY TAG?

297
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,250
I PROMISE
THAT IT'LL BE A TOTAL BLAST.

298
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,416
AND THOSE STINKY BOYS
AREN'T HERE TO RUIN OUR FUN.

299
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,250
- I DON'T WANT TO PLAY.
AHHH!

300
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,041
PLEASE HELP ME,
ZERO, ICHII!

301
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,708
- Ichii: COME ON, GUYS,
CALM DOWN.  OKAY?

302
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,750
- Girl: WE'LL CALM DOWN
IF YOU STOP RUNNING

303
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,708
AND ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS.
- DO YOU THINK I'M PRETTY?

304
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,250
- DO YOU LIKE BLONDES
OR REDHEADS?

305
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,833
- ARE YOU
IN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP?

306
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,000
- THAT'S A TRICKY QUESTION.

307
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,291
- GIRLS, GET OUT OF MY WAY!
- AHH!

308
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,916
- WOW, THAT WAS GREAT.
YOU'RE SUCH A REBEL, ZERO.

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,833
- I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK
OF ME, JUST GET OUT OF MY WAY.

310
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,041
- Zura: ZERO, LOOK.
- HUH?

311
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,166
- IT'S NINA.
- HUH?

312
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,541
- AHHH!

313
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,791
- AND SAN'S RIGHT BEHIND HER.
MOVE!

314
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,083
- ( grunts )

315
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,041
- ARE YOU HURT?

316
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,833
HE CAN BE A LITTLE ROUGH
SOMETIMES. SORRY.

317
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:01,416
BUT HE'S NOT A BAD PERSON,
NOT REALLY.

318
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,750
ANYWAY,
I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY.

319
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,875
- I FEEL JUST GREAT

320
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,833
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, ICHII.

321
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,458
- All: WE FEEL JUST GREAT!

322
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:17,041
WE FEEL JUST GREAT, ICHII!

323
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:21,708
- PLEASE, SOMEBODY HELP ME!
- San: GO GO GO!

324
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,958
- AHHH!

325
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,375
- GO GO GO!  GET HER.
- Zero: SAN, THAT'S ENOUGH!

326
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,833
WAY TO GO, GENIUS.

327
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,875
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO STAY CLOSE TO US.

328
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,083
- DON'T BE SUCH A JERK!
YOU KNOW I'VE HAD

329
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,083
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
TO DEAL WITH.

330
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,208
- I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES, IDIOT.

331
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,833
- DON'T YOU CALL ME AN IDIOT!
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

332
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,458
WATCH THIS--
IDIOT, IDIOT.

333
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,000
IDIOT, IDIOT, IDIOT!

334
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,583
- THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME
TO BE ARGUING, YOU GUYS.

335
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,291
BEHIND YOU!

336
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,708
- HEY, EVERYONE,
CHECK OUT MY AWESOME NEW FISH.

337
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,583
I HAVE A WHOLE SQUADRON
OF THEM NOW.

338
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,875
AND THEY CAN'T WAIT
TO SINK THEIR TEETH INTO YOU.

339
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,291
GET 'EM, FISHIES.
- ( all humming )

340
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,958
- OH NO, YOU DON'T!

341
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,416
- THERE'S MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

342
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,041
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

343
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,791
- AND HERE'S ANOTHER!

344
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,458
AND ANOTHER!
- ( grunting )

345
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,750
- BUT I'M NOT FINISHED YET.
HERE COME A FEW MORE FISHIES.

346
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,083
- ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?

347
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,250
- San:
I'M PRETTY AWESOME, HUH?

348
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,375
I HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE
IN STORE FOR YOU,

349
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,625
BUT I'M SURE YOU MUST BE TIRED

350
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,708
FROM SHOOTING ALL
THOSE FIREBALLS.

351
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,208
ARE YOU READY BREAK YET?

352
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,208
- IT HASN'T EVEN PHASED ME.
- OKAY.

353
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,208
THEN THIS SHOULDN'T
PHASE YOU EITHER, RIGHT?

354
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,208
TAKE THIS!
- AHH!

355
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:52,208
NINA!  ( grunting )

356
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,458
- OH NO, ZERO!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

357
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,708
- HEY, DON'T WORRY.
IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

358
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,666
- BUT YOU'RE BLEEDING.
- I TOLD YOU, IT'S NOTHING!

359
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,708
- WHY DO YOU TRY SO HARD
TO PROTECT HER, ZERO?

360
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,333
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
IS THE CRYSTAL PEARL ANYWAY.

361
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,458
SO WHY ARE YOU GOING
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE?

362
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,333
- WHAT I DO IS MY BUSINESS.

363
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,958
- BUT STILL, IF YOU JUST
GOT THE PEARL FROM NINA,

364
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,958
THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS

365
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,708
AND GET YOURSELF HURT,
YOU KNOW.

366
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,625
- GEEZ, YOU'RE JUST
WASTING YOUR BREATH THERE, SAN.

367
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,625
I'VE ALREADY DECIDED
THAT I'M GONNA PROTECT HER

368
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,833
AND I WON'T LET HER DOWN.
- BUT, ZERO--

369
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,500
- A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.

370
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,875
- OH, WELL,

371
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,416
I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR ME TO
END OUR LITTLE PLAY DATE

372
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,291
AND DELIVER
THE FINAL BLOW THEN.

373
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,291
GO, AIR FISH!
GO!

374
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,875
- THAT'S IT, SAN.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

375
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,250
DESTRUCTION MAGIC!

376
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,666
AHHHH!

377
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,458
MAGIC CANNON!

378
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:13,333
- ( San laughing )
WOW, THAT WAS GREAT.

379
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,750
BUT NO MATTER
HOW MANY YOU DESTROY,

380
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,375
I CAN ALWAYS MAKE MORE.

381
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,291
- WOW,
YOU ACTUALLY FELL FOR IT.

382
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,500
THIS CURTAIN OF SMOKE
WAS PRETTY USEFUL.

383
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,791
GIVE ME THAT.
THANKS.

384
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,208
- GIVE THAT BACK!

385
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,625
- OH, NO,
I HAVE THE WAND NOW,

386
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,500
SO I'M IN CONTROL, SAN.

387
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,708
AND YOU CAN'T CAUSE
ANY MORE MISCHIEF.

388
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,750
- Forte: THAT WASN'T MISCHIEF.

389
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,666
AND NOW I'LL TAKE THIS BACK.

390
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,583
- FORTE?

391
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,500
- MISCHIEF IMPLIES PLAYFULNESS,
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU

392
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,500
THAT WE'RE BOTH
COMPLETELY SERIOUS.

393
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,750
WE'LL GET THAT PEARL
FROM YOU SOMEHOW.

394
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,750
- YEAH, WORD OF ADVICE--

395
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,625
DON'T EXPECT TO BE
TAKEN SERIOUSLY WEARING THAT.

396
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,458
- JUST SHUT UP, ZERO.

397
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,708
AND PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR THE ONSLAUGHT.

398
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,250
- ALL RIGHT!

399
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,208
TIME FOR ME TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN
AGAIN WITH SUMMONING MAGIC.

400
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,750
READY?

401
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,375
BIG AIR FISH!

402
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,041
ATTACK!
- AHH!

403
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,458
NINA!
- ( playing )

404
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:18,166
HERE COMES THE HEAT.

405
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,833
FLAMES, BURST FORTH!

406
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,541
- AH!
- LOOK OUT.

407
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,916
- ZERO!
- THERE YOU ARE.

408
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,250
- DEFENSE MAGIC,
CRYSTAL BARRIER!

409
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,250
FORTE!

410
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,541
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU DO TO TRY TO STOP US,

411
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,250
WE WILL OVERCOME YOU
AND PROTECT NINA.

412
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,166
I SUMMON DEFENSE MAGIC.

413
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,625
REFLECTING TORNADO!

414
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,083
AHH!

415
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,875
- ( both shouting )

416
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,250
- Forte: YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!

417
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,250
- NINA, LET'S PLAY TOGETHER
AGAIN SOMETIME.

418
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,083
BYE FOR NOW!

419
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,875
- Both:
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, NINA?

420
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,875
- YEAH.  I'M JUST FINE,
BUT I THINK ZERO GOT HURT.

421
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,375
ARE YOU OKAY?

422
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,083
- ICHII, YOU TOOK TOO
LONG TO SHOW UP.

423
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,041
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I THOUGHT YOU'D EASILY

424
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,208
BE ABLE TO HANDLE OPPONENTS
OF THEIR SKILL LEVEL.

425
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,833
GUESS I WAS MISTAKEN.
- ARE YOU OKAY, ZERO?

426
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,583
- LET ME SEE YOUR ARM.

427
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,583
- ( thinking ) ZERO PUT HIS LIFE
ON THE LINE TO PROTECT ME,

428
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,666
AND EVEN HURT HIMSELF TRYING.

429
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,958
HE DID THAT FOR ME.

430
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,625
- AHH!

431
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:50,833
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.

432
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,875
- ( thinking )
ZERO CAN BE REALLY OBNOXIOUS,

433
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,625
BUT DEEP DOWN,
I KNOW HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

434
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,333
- HEY, BE CAREFUL.
THAT HURTS.

435
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,250
OWWWWWW!

436
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,041
- ( Nina thinking )
HA. ZERO.

437
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,750
- NINA, THERE YOU ARE.
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

438
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,500
- YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.
ISN'T IT CRAZY?

439
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,250
THERE WERE ALL THESE EXPLOSIONS.

440
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,000
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
WAS IN A PANIC.

441
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,791
- WE HAD THE FIRE
AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS HERE.

442
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,208
IT WAS TOTALLY CHAOTIC.

443
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,791
- ZERO, I THINK
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

444
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,416
- ( all gasp )
- ( laughing )

445
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,625
- WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?
- NOTHING.

446
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,250
- YOU'RE REALLY GONNA BE
IN SOME HOT WATER LATER, ZERO.

447
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,166
- I'LL PUT YOU IN HOT WATER.

448
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,583
- ( both laughing )

449
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,333
- Nina: I'M HOME!

450
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,208
- GOOD TO SEE YOU HOME, NINA.
- AH!

451
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,916
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU GUYS
TO NEVER ENTER MY ROOM

452
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,250
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

453
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,125
IS THERE ANY REASON
WHY YOU CAN'T RESPECT THAT?

454
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,166
- OH, WELL STARTING TODAY
WE DECIDED

455
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,375
THAT WE SHOULD
LIVE HERE WITH YOU.

456
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,958
- SAY WHAT?

457
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,791
- HA, HA. LOOK, I EXTENDED THIS
CLOSET WITH SOME MAGICAL SPACE

458
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,458
AND MADE A ROOM
FOR ZERO AND ME. SEE?

459
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,791
NOW YOU'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW
THAT WE'RE AROUND.

460
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,791
- BUT WHY?

461
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,291
- BECAUSE WE WANT TO STAY
AS CLOSE TO YOU AS POSSIBLE.

462
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,791
THAT WAY WE'LL ALWAYS BE HERE
TO PROTECT YOU.

463
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,750
- IT'S GREAT.

464
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,791
IT'LL BE JUST LIKE WE'RE
NEIGHBORS WHO SHARE A WALL.

465
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,375
- WE'LL TRY TO STAY
OUT OF YOUR WAY,

466
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,250
BUT HAVING US AROUND
COULD BE PRETTY HANDY TOO.

467
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,208
- WE'LL BE HERE
WHEN YOU NEED US.

468
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,166
SO DON'T WORRY.

469
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,416
- Ichii:
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

470
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,833
OH, AND IT'S OKAY, WE TOOK ALL
YOUR CLOTHES OUT OF THE CLOSET

471
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,750
AND PUT THEM
IN THAT ROOM OVER THERE.

472
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,458
- THIS IS MY NIGHTMARE!

473
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

474
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,333
HOW COULD MY LIFE
GET ANY WORSE?

475
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,208
- Ichii: YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

476
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,333
WE'LL KEEP
THE CLOSET DOOR CLOSED.

477
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,750
- AH!
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

478
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,291
( crying )

479
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,458
MY NAME IS NINA YAMADA.

480
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,958
I'M JUST AN ORDINARY,
AVERAGE STUDENT,

481
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,541
SO WHY DO I HAVE TO DEAL WITH
THIS EVEN WHEN I'M AT SCHOOL?

482
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,500
- Zero: HEY, NINA,
WHERE ARE YOU?

483
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,291
- Ichii: THAT'S STRANGE.
I CAN'T FIND HER ANYWHERE.

484
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:35,208
- Zero: ICHII,
THERE'S A BABY OVER HERE.

485
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,083
- THAT'S A GOOD BABY.
DON'T CRY, OKAY?

486
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,625
- ( crying )

487
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,583
- Nina: NEXT TIME
ON "SAVE ME, LOLLIPOP"...
