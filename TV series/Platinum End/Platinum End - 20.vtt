00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:09.426
Hey, Mirai!

00:00:09.468 --> 00:00:10.886
Can I shoot this guy
with a Red Arrow?

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:12.846
No, Susumu!
Get away from there!

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.098

[gun fires]

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:22.356
Bullets, look out!

[dramatic music]

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:38.705
Professor.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:39.706
[bullet clangs]

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.084
[bullets fire]

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.295
Let's get away from here.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:48.006
[air whooshes]

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.803
Susumu, I'm afraid your
life is beyond saving now.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.100
[arrow clangs]

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.354
Penema, you can have his soul.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.439
I'll be taking his
Arrows and Wings.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.776
I guess it's game over.

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:09.403
Too bad, kid.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.155
[dramatic music]

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.578
[Nakaumi breathes shakily]

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.213
[phone buzzes]

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:38.348
[opening theme music]

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.435
[Yoneda] Put me
on speaker phone.

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:06.603
Professor.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.689
[Temari And Saki] Huh?

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:10.732
Listen to me, everyone.

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.068
Susumu Yuito is dead.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.569
I've taken his Arrows and Wings.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.324
It's unfortunate, but
under the circumstances,

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.660
we'll have to put our
conversation on hold.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.120
Once the world has responded,

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.080
we'll be able to
resume our discussion.

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:26.123
Farewell.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.291
He's the boss now.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.918
This only happened
because we hung around

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.045
while he droned on about
how there's no God.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.424
[Saki] Susumu. [sobs]

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.926
[bird chirps]

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.262
[Nakaumi] Susumu probably
didn't wanna die,

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.098
but it's amazing how easily
people go when it's their time.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.099
You're right.

00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.101
This is reality, though.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.771
Is this your first time
seeing a dead body?

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.357
[Nakaumi] No, I've
seen several others.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.360
Too bad I wasn't the one
who was shot instead.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.695
That brings up a subject

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.572
that I've been meeting
to discuss with you.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.907
Is it true that you're
not the least bit

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.200
worried about dying?

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.494
[Nakaumi] Correct.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.496
In that case, you wouldn't
object if I were to shoot you

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.540
with a White Arrow
sometime in the future?

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.875
[Nakaumi] Correct.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.877
If I were to give you one
of these White Arrows,

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.712
could you then shoot me?

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:18.300
Yes, sir.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.469
I respect you
completely, Professor.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.596
Whatever you would
ask of me, I'd do.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:27.350
In my experience, people are
sometimes driven by a desire

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.978
to assimilate with the
object of their respect

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.605
because they wish
to better understand

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.732
the person they admire.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:37.235
In a few extreme cases, they
fantasize about being reborn

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.154
as the object of their desires.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:42.199
And in their adult state,
they end up killing them.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.325
You understand?

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.659
Yes, of course.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.203
That's something from
one of your books, right?

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.872
[arrow fires]

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.919
And you, my young
friend, are no exception.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.797
I can't let that remote
possibility come to pass.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.173
I'm just being safe.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.760
Hey, Red, if you do become God,

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.054
you'll still let me
keep a Red Arrow, right?

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.182
I mean, I need that
condition to carry over

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.184
from my agreement with Nakaumi.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.728
Miss Yuri, why do you
think you won't be able

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.356
to go on living if you
don't have a Red Arrow?

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.233
Because I'm not confident
I can get anyone

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.692
to like me without one.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.196
All right?

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.573
[Mirai] Fine, I'll
keep the same deal.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.326
Then I'll do everything I
can to support you, Red.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:32.290
And I don't trust that
Professor Yoneda. [grunts]

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:34.751
Hey, Nasse.

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:35.752
What's up?

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.587
What do you think will
happen to all the angels

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.382
--if a God isn't chosen?
--I don't know for sure.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:43.176
But if God disappears, wouldn't
we all disappear as well?

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.219
Doesn't that bother you?

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.762
I thought about it.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.056
And the truth is, if becoming
God would make Mirai happy,

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.266
then that's what I want.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.642
I know this might surprise you,

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.769
but I don't really care
about what happens to me.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.688
[Temari] I've gotta
tell you something, Red.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.065
I'm surprised you
agreed to become God.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.277
I mean, I thought you
and Yellow were a couple.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.487
And from what I understand
as to how this works,

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.907
you'd have to leave her to
become God, wouldn't you?

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.284
That's not really true.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.328
If Mirai became God, he'd
be able to envelop Saki

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.330
in an even greater
love from up in Heaven.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.542
Hmm.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.211
Regardless, the more
important question is

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.422
what are we supposed to do now?

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.717
For now, we can only rely
on Mr. Hoshi and Ms. Yumiki.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.471
The trouble is we
don't know who sent

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:32.267
the self-defense force
helicopters or who shot at us.

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.103
We know it wasn't Miss Yumiki,
since she's been Red Arrowed,

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.188
but who knows about Mr. Hoshi?

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.361
[Saki] I'll try asking
Miss Yumiki about it.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.114
I'll do what I can.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.074
You need to give me a few days.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.958
Yoneda, I can't believe
you're a God candidate.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.084
[Yumiki] Sir.

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.252
What is it?

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.420
[arrow pierces]

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:01.463
We need to talk.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.091
[Hoshi gasps]

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.389
[Angels sing]

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.061
[Angel] We have an emergency,

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.022
because God, God is
beginning to fade away.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.485
More breaking news on
the God candidates.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.571
Of the six contenders who
appeared in Yurakucho District,

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:30.367
one has now been identified
as Professor Gaku Yoneda.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.494
[Yoneda] The identities
of all the God candidates

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.120
have been revealed.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.748
Some of the information is
fact, some of it is fiction.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.084
What an unpleasant
world this is.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.878
[Nakaumi] Yes, I hear what
you're saying, Professor.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.547
It certainly isn't
one I want to live in.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.424
I couldn't agree more, Nakaumi.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.344
What should we do about it?

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.348
[crowd yells]

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.520
[Hoshi] This is an
emergency shelter.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:00.021
Normally, no one
comes down here,

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.315
and there are no
cameras or windows.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:03.608
[Yumiki] Nobody
will think to look

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.193
for God candidates
in the station,

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:08.446
and it's easily accessible
for Hoshi and myself.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.573
[Hoshi] Unfortunately, the
government still intends

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:12.742
to capture all the
God candidates.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.411
We arrested two of the snipers,

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:17.372
but their names and
nationalities are unknown.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.583
And now, the world realizes
that God candidates can be hit

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.335
if they're shot at
from a blind spot.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.004
[Mirai] A blind spot?

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.506
The world's attitude toward
the five of you is critical.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:27.966
For your own safety,

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.427
this matter has to be resolved
as quickly as possible.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.846
You say resolved,
how do we do that?

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.557
We'll have another meeting.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.226
Professor Yoneda said
we'd speak again.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.186
When that happens,
I'll convince him.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.563
To do what?

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.815
The professor agreed,
if there's no God,

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.609
a large number of people
who seek divine salvation

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:47.527
will end up dying.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.404
There must be a
way to avoid that.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.156
Different phrasing would help,

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.407
maybe we can convince him-

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:53.908
It's impossible!

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.827
That chatterbox would just talk
you into agreeing with him.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.579
The entire point of
any scholar's life

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.998
is to prove that their
theories are correct.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.082
I hear you.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.083
--But if we talk--
--It's impossible!

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.585
Don't you get it?

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.545
I've been around people
like him my whole life.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.380
They always they're right.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:08.506
And no matter what you say,

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.300
they never changed their minds.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.386
[Hoshi] I'll help you
convince the professor

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.263
the next time you talk to him.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.681
[Mirai] Why you, Mr. Hoshi?

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.851
Yoneda and I happen
to know each other.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.771
We went to the same high
school when we were growing up.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.898
[Temari and Saki gasp]

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.858
It was the second
day of my term.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:30.653
[door alarm beeps]

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:31.696
[Clerk] Welcome!

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.325
[Hoshi] That guy's in my class.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.368
I should say hello.

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.539
[plastic rustles]

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.582
Wow, he moves fast.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.794
[feet patter on floor]

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.880
[price scanner beeps]

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.424
That'll be 1,000.

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:54.010
Yep, 1,387 yen.

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.011
Exactly right.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.137
Thank you very much.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.517
[door alarm beeps]

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.521
[school bell dings]

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.939
Hey, that hurt!

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.941
Watch where you're going.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.985
[school bell dings]

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:14.948
Sorry, you okay?

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.366
Yeah, it's fine.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.909
I'm the one who wasn't looking.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.787
[Yoneda] Anyway,
hope you're not hurt.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.667
What a nice guy.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.626
Then at gym one day,

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.503
about two weeks into the term.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.922
Okay, next.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.173
On your marks.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.300
Get set.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.302
Next up.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:39.722
On your marks.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:40.849
Get set.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.477
3.1415926535.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.895
He's fast.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:47.564
[Yoneda and Hoshi
breathe deeply]

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.399
Hoshi, six seconds even.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.568
Yoneda, 6.2 seconds.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.612
[Hoshi pants]

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:55.905
--Yoneda.
--Hmm?

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.615
You shouldn't have done that.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:00.118
Done what?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.371
You deliberately slowed your
pace to allow me to win.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.331
I admire how you always
go out of your way

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.333
to avoid upsetting
people around you,

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.585
but this is different.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.504
In that case, I apologize.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.506
It's okay, you don't
need to apologize.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.383
Let's call it a tie.

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.552
You mind if I ask you something?

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.679
I heard you muttering something
while you were running.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.097
What was that?

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.599
It was a number.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.683
Which one?

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:26.561
A number with infinite,
non-repeating decimals.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.189
One that cannot be
expressed as a fraction.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.648
It's very stressful for me

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.567
to do what everybody
else is doing.

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.236
I've learned that filling my
head with irrational numbers

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.571
can calm me down.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.615
Just then I was reciting pi.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:39.991
Hmm.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.576
I've never met someone like you.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.161
Why don't we become friends?

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.621
You wanna be friends?

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.457
I'm sorry, but I can't.

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:48.625
Why not?

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.210
[Yoneda] Well, just
between you and me,

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.712
I actually plan on
quitting school this week.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:53.963
Why would you do that?

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.924
The term just
started 10 days ago.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.092
I know. In elementary
and middle school,

00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.719
I could ditch classes
whenever I wanted,

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:02.597
but high school has
mandatory attendance.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.224
That rule doesn't work for me.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.643
It's more effective
if I study on my own.

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:08.561
You were right last
week when you mentioned

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.480
that I don't wanna
upset those around me.

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.691
But even more than that,
I don't like being upset.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.819
It's easier if I don't
associate with other people.

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:19.405
[Hoshi] I get it that struggling
with interpersonal relationships

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.032
might be a difficult
part of life,

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.409
but in the end, don't
you need friends?

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:24.827
I'm fine, actually.

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.413
The times I enjoy the most
are when I'm doing research

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.374
or creating things by myself,

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.209
but I have to interact
on some level.

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.794
And since I was born human,

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.879
I want to do something
that'll help the world.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.590
How long are you
gonna stand there?

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.717
You do need to come
join the class.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:43.596
And please don't tell anyone

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.390
about what we just discussed.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.308
I wanna quit without
a lot of fuss.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.271
Later on, as you know, his
novel became a best seller.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:54.315
He won two Nobel Prizes
for Literature and Physics.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.859
He's been dubbed the
world's most brilliant man.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.320
He's even received a
National Honor Award.

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:00.655
And he's self-taught?

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.699
He really is quite
amazing, isn't he?

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.244
I believe Yoneda probably
never wanted to become famous.

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.662
In any case,

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.706
I can tell you he tries to
avoid displeasing others.

00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:12.041
So he doesn't like
to upset people.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.627
Is Nakaumi's aversion to
bothering other people

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.088
a result of professor
Yoneda's influence on him?

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.799
If Yoneda hasn't changed,
that could be an advantage.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.677
We would just have to find
a way to use it somehow.

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.098
So you're saying the
way for God candidates

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.684
to avoid becoming God
is actually simple?

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:30.685
Yes.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:33.771
In fact, you could even
call it the only way.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.531
I used to wanna die
just like you do today.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.742
And, naturally, I'm
still prepared to die

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:47.076
if it comes to that.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:50.121
However, my suicidal
tendencies were different.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.915
My desire to experience
death was so strong,

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.293
it simply exceeded my
desire to keep living.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.878
[Nakaumi] To experience death?

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.671
We still don't
understand what happens

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.131
to people after they die.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.759
Human beings are physical
objects in the end.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.552
It's likely we
become nothing at all

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.888
once our bodies turn to dust.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:08.556
But that hasn't been proven yet.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.058
I'm participating
in this exercise

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.268
because I want to know
what happens to people

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.561
when they pass away.

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:16.105
If this God selection
process is genuine,

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.775
and, as God, I could learn
what happens after death,

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:20.318
and tell people about it,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.862
I would gladly
volunteer to become God.

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.823
Wow, Professor,
that's impressive.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.034
You're thinking is totally
different from mine.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.747
I hate to admit, the idea
we experience something

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.166
other than nothingness
after death scares me.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.126
Nothingness would mean
my suffering ends.

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.711
But what if there's a hell

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.755
and my suffering just continues?

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.715
On the other hand,
if there's a heaven,

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.801
I hope it's a truly happy place.

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:46.177
Heaven and hell aren't real.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.971
They were invented to make
people believe in God.

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:51.099
There is a creature
in the afterworld,

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.184
but I can assure
you it isn't God.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.561
Yes, sir, I understand
what you're saying.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.856
But still, I've
seen angels fly off

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.150
carrying what appeared to
be the souls of dead people

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.777
in their arms.

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:05.154
It certainly made it seem
like there's an after life.

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:07.573
What you've seen so far
was only an illusion

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:08.950
the creature was showing us.

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.201
Is that right, Muni?

00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:13.579
The creature absorbs
a certain amount

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:16.207
of the total energy
created by humanity.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.418
Just imagine the
advancements in science

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.795
if we could harness
that energy properly.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:21.921
What do we have instead?

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:24.340
A false heaven, a false God.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:27.218
Avaricious angels created
by that false God.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.638
It would be better if such
things entirely ceased to be.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.973
That's what Muni believes.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.560
When I first met Muni,

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.438
I'd lost all sense of
direction in my life.

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.939
[camera shutter clicks]

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.274
[Reporter 1] Professor Yoneda,
congratulations on winning

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.067
this year's Nobel
Prize in Physics.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.069
Do you have anything you'd
like to share with our viewers?

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.238
[crowd applauds]

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.281
[Reporter 2] How does it feel

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.907
to be appointed a
professor emeritus

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:50.950
at such a young age?

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.827
[Salesman] We can arrange
for a mountain retreat

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.912
so you can bury yourself
in your research.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:58.708
[Yoneda breathes heavily]

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:00.001
[Female Student 1] Is there
someplace we can talk?

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:02.462
I have a question
about today's lecture.

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:03.629
[Female Student 2]
Can we come with you?

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:04.630
[University Staff]
Regarding your TV

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:05.882
and lecture schedule...

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:06.883
[Association
President] Professor,

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:07.884
how about having
a drink with us?

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:11.471
[Yoneda breathing heavily]

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.851
[Yoneda retches]

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:24.442
3.14159265358.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.235
People come see me every day.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.029
People I don't know come see me.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.323
I'm not making any
progress on my research.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:33.659
Awards, ceremonies, banquets,
TV appearances, lectures.

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:34.660
It's hell.

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.037
Absolutely hell.

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.080
I just wanted to help humanity.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.332
Let me do my research.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.836
I have reached my limit.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:47.465
Humanity has broken off into
groups since ancient times.

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.468
It's overwhelming,
I can't escape it.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.844
I have to quit being human.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.304
It's the only way out for me.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.889
So, today, I will die.

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.432
It'll be great.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.893
I'll finally be able to confirm
what happens after death.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.979
[melancholic music]

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.067
At first, I thought
I was hallucinating.

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:07.693
An illusion that had appeared

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.904
due to the acceptance
of my impending death,

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.114
and the pleasure that was
flooding through my brain

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:14.325
as a result of that decision.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:17.578
But, no, it was the
Angel of Destruction.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.164
Tell me something.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.832
What gives you hope to live?

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.544
You want an honest answer?

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:26.045
I have no hope to live.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.964
I'm ready for my life to end.

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:30.883
All I want is to know
what happens after death.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:34.345
Hmm, you have the
capacity, Gaku Yaneda,

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.931
to finally learn the
truth about everything.

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:38.975
The truth?

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.812
I didn't believe
Muni right away.

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:44.355
Presuming she was an illusion,

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.566
I doubted every
word I had heard.

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.027
After speaking with her
for hours at a time,

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.947
I suddenly realized
two months had passed.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.575
Then I saw two young boys
tricked into fighting each other

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.827
by this false selection process.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.245
At that point,

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.622
I felt it was important to
tell everybody the truth.

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.333
Why didn't they understand
the perfectly obvious fact

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.626
that there is no God?

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:07.962
We need the truth.

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.299
Then we can march toward the
future with our eyes wide open.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.758
I agree.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.635
I believe you're absolutely
right, Professor.

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:19.557
The angel who knows
heaven's secrets, Ogaro,

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.767
the Angel of Darkness.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:24.937
Admit it, are you the angel
who possesses special powers,

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.564
or is it one of the others?

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.025
Even if I was in possession
of that information,

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.735
I'd never tell you.

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.361
What's best for
me at this moment

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:34.155
is for my partner to become God.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:37.241
And you are standing
in the way of that.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:40.036
[dramatic music]

00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:44.582
Currently, there are two ways
to prevent a God candidate

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.168
from becoming the creature.

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.962
In each case, they involve
the use of White Arrows.

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:52.340
I've taken a look at
the mechanics of both.

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.175
No matter which
option we choose,

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.135
I'll have to shoot
you with one of these.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.054
Thanks so much, Professor.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:59.347
It would be a great honor to die

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.057
from one of your White Arrows.

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:03.643
That leaves a
strategic decision.

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:06.062
We have to decide
whether I shoot you now,

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:08.189
or wait until it's all over.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.149
Anytime's fine
with me, I'm ready.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.238
You may be fine with
it, but Ogaro is not.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.407
Your angel told me that
making you the creature

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:20.076
was the preferred choice.

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.702
So I'm sure she'd do anything

00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:23.704
to increase the odds
of that happening.

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:27.041
Ogaro, if you insist
you don't know

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.794
or won't tell me which
angel is the special one,

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.922
I'll shoot Nakaumi with this
arrow right here and now.

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:40.596
Fine, but I have one condition.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.474
The White Arrow you
received from Susumu Yuito,

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.185
I want you to give
it to my partner.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.729
Since you shot him with
one of your Red Arrows,

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:51.273
there's no possibility the
boy would use the weapon

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:52.692
to attack you.

00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:55.111
If your plan runs into
some kind of difficulty,

00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:57.738
you can simply recall
the White Arrow.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.906
You're right, of course.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.324
It would be proof of his loyalty

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.451
and there would be no
real risk on my end.

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:04.662
But we'd just be
delaying the inevitable.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.081
I expect nothing from
my current partner.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:08.874
I think that has become clear.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.626
[Yoneda] Then this is
a pointless struggle.

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:13.003
If the creature dies,
so do the angels.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.880
Is this your way of
extending your life

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:16.257
for as long as possible?

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.634
[Ogaro] Not necessarily
through Nakaumi.

00:20:18.676 --> 00:20:22.304
The truth is, I have high
hopes for Mirai Kakehashi.

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.307
It's no wonder
that you are known

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:26.767
as the Angel of Darkness.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:33.107
Now tell me, which angel
possesses special powers?

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.317
I believe it's Nasse.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:36.777
I knew it.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:38.487
What are the special powers?

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:40.990
Nasse has the ability
to physically interact

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:43.784
with her partner,
Mirai Kakehashi.

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.995
Just as humans
cannot touch angels,

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:48.706
angels cannot touch objects
from the human world.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:51.709
However, when Mirai Kakehashi
jumped to his death,

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:55.171
Nasse openly admitted to
catching him with her own hands.

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:57.298
She can also move
people and objects.

00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:00.176
It's not much, but she's the
only one who's capable of it.

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:02.762
I wouldn't call that
power, not much at all.

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:04.221
If any angel found

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:06.140
they were able to directly
interact with their partner,

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.100
they could easily change
that partner's fate.

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:10.686
In fact, Nasse
saved Mirai's life.

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:13.939
Know this, Nasse does not
realize this power is special,

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:17.234
and has no understanding
of how an angel should be.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.320
So tell me, is it
possible for this angel

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.530
to shoot a God
candidate with an Arrow?

00:21:21.572 --> 00:21:23.199
No, it is not.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.200
I see.

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:26.243
[fire crackles]

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.370
Now that I have
this information,

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:31.165
the next step is to
choose a time and place.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.752
[Temari growls]

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:35.753
Damn it!

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:38.506
I hope you all die! [grunts]

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:41.133
Look what they're saying
about Professor Yoneda.

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:43.803
Why is he such a hero
and we're such villains?

00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:46.722
It'd be good if Professor
Yoneda agreed to become God.

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.974
No way that's gonna happen.

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:50.309
He says there is no God,

00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:53.187
and what we have now is
nothing but a creature.

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.648
Well, then, he could become God,

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.358
and tell people he's not God,

00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:59.568
and in fact is only a creature.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.195
I'm presuming the professor

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:03.489
would've already suggested
that if he was down with it.

00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:05.991
I don't know.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.326
What are we doing?

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.120
What are God candidates?

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:13.249
Susumu is dead now as well.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.917
Our numbers keep dwindling.

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:17.795
Are God candidates
destined to die

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:19.839
before a new God is chosen?

00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:25.219
The new national stadium?

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:26.554
[Yoneda] Yes.

00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.430
A location that attracts
attention is ideal,

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:30.391
so that as many
people as possible

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.268
can witness this
piece of history.

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:35.437
I can't just take over a venue
without any advanced notice.

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:37.398
Besides, do you really
think that God candidates

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:39.692
will show up because I
announced a time place?

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:42.236
No, but they want
this selection process

00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.071
to end as soon as possible.

00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:47.449
And to accomplish that,
they will come.
