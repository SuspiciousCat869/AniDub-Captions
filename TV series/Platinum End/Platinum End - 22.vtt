[ominous instrumental music]

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:18.018
The timing of my
strategy is critical.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.395
The last two God candidates
must kill each other

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.190
with White Arrows within
point one-five seconds.

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:25.692
That way, no creature
will be generated.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.909
I've gotta tell you,
professor, I don't get it.

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.410
Let's assume you're right,

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.204
and whoever gets chosen from
the group of God candidates,

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:38.830
becomes the "creature."

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:39.915
What's so wrong with that?

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.001
The simple answer to your
question, young lady,

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.796
is that humans should
decide how humanity ends.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.048
Humans decide how humanity ends?

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.884
I have no idea what
that even means.

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:51.927
I think I do.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.681
Ogaro said God has the
power to end humankind.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.439
But Red said he would
never do such a thing

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.899
if he became God.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.527
You're being hasty.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.529
We haven't yet established
what might happen

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.907
to a person's mind, once
they become the creature.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:16.076
The creature seems
to lack the ability

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:18.078
to communicate with humans.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.665
So far, it hasn't communicated
a single thing to us.

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.875
All we really know about
the creature is this:

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.712
if no-one replaces it through
the God-candidate process,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.299
the current false God
will die in 790 days.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.634
Because of the wall of
silence that exists,

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.887
humans won't even notice
the death of this false God.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.725
This is the first time I've
heard of a 999-day time limit.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.312
So the God selection process
is linked to God's lifespan?

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:44.688
I do know it's true

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.982
that God can't directly
communicate his will

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.900
to human beings.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.902
Muni might be feeding
lies to the professor.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:51.945
What?

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:58.160
Let's begin by discussing
how humanity ends.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.161
S'cuse me?

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.705
It won't be due to
the death of the sun,

00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:04.958
or some catastrophe or freak
weather event here on Earth,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.543
but in the
not-too-distant future,

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:09.880
humanity will experience
an extinction event.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:10.881
What?

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:11.882
What happened to your claim

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.759
that the whole race
would attain immortality

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.719
sometime in the near future?

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:18.972
We're going to acquire
that within 300 years.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:21.683
Either by replacing all but
our minds with machinery,

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:24.770
or by transplanting our
minds into younger bodies.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.313
That's just an old sci-fi trope.

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:27.314
Not true.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:28.523
I've read about it.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.025
It's not fiction.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:32.736
In fact, it could become
reality in the near future.

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.614
Once humans have acquired
the secret to immortality,

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.616
what do you imagine
they'll want next?

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:38.617
Any ideas?

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.370
[small nervous gasps]

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.038
Time itself.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.332
They'll want to transcend
the very concept of time,

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.501
so they can take control of it.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.087
They'll be compelled to
know and see the future.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:53.131
In other words, the
ultimate form of prediction.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.134
And believe me, they'll
eventually achieve it.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.386
However...

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.138
Once the human race has
taken this giant step forward

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.516
and learned everything
the future holds,

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.643
our species will lose all hope.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.022
[small stunned breaths]

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.983
You understand, don't you?

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.986
Once people learn what their
predetermined paths are,

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.073
it will bring about a
feeling of meaninglessness.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:21.034
We'll only be able to
submit to the flow of time.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.203
Even if we try to
change the future,

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:24.454
we'll discover that our attempts

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.207
and their outcomes
are predetermined.

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.376
Humans will lose
the will to live,

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:32.129
followed by a steep
rise in suicides.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.341
In the end, humans
will simply give up.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.968
When all is said and done,

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.011
we will have paid
far too heavy a price

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.972
for scientific progress.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:44.391
Unfortunately, humanity's
inquisitive spirit

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:46.059
can't be stopped.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.979
In the near future,
humanity will lose all hope,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.856
and march towards
its extinction.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:59.114
So Red, are you still okay
with becoming the creature?

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:01.908
Yes, I am.

[small happy gasp]

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.831
Then this can conclude
in only one of two ways.

Either you become the creature
or I find a way to stop you.

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:14.087

possible to talk in private,

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.799
Fine with me.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.176

How about the guest house
where we were staying before?

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.392

[opening theme music]

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.710
[Reporter] The God
candidates have split up

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.128
into two groups.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.714
It appears that Professor
Yoneda and Mirai Kakehashi

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.049
are about to have a
one-on-one conversation.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.178
I'll ask you again.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.431
Will you become a
false God or not?

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.352
Shall I assume you
still intend to?

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.353
Yes.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.397
[Yoneda] Even if it's all a lie?

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.358
Bottom line, even if it's
all fake, like you say,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.402
nobody will want
to kill themselves

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.404
just because I've become God.

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:49.075
However, if nobody steps
up and becomes God,

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.412
some will lose all hope
and end their lives.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:55.457
I want as many people
as possible to live.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.292
I want them to be happy.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.338
This is a goal worthy
of a God candidate.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.173
It's what Mirai
has always wanted,

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.841
and nothing has
changed his mind.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:08.094
Happiness, you say?

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.264
As a human, making
other people happy

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.016
would be your ultimate goal?

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.268
As long as everybody's
brain is different,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.437
happiness will never be
something that can be measured

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.815
simply by dopamine
and adrenaline values.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.485
A person's tendency for
appreciation or resentment,

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.946
impacts their capacity
for happiness.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:28.073
Resentment.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.451
I think the worst thing a
person can do in this world

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.328
is to hate another person.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.246
Nothing good ever comes of it.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.624
It's no good for your
own mind, of course,

00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:39.334
it's no good for others, either.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:45.799
Happiness is an idea based
on personal experience.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.678
One attains it only in
comparison with unhappiness.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.429
I'm aware of that.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.100
But finding your own happiness
by making other people happy,

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.351
isn't a bad thing.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:01.731
And besides, I'm pretty sure
becoming God won't kill me.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.486
As long as I'm alive, I won't
give up on finding happiness

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:07.487
as a human being.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.281
Sorry, but I don't
trust a person

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.158
who says things like that.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.743
He only cares about himself.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.287
I'm cool with that as
long as we have peace.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.873
I don't know how I feel
about a child becoming God

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.208
and looking down on me.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.294
After your experience
with Kakehashi,

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.922
you don't object to him
becoming God, do you?

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.632
I think I might want him to.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:31.261

he talked about happiness

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.971

So we're back here again, huh?

When we were talking earlier,

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.736
you said you wanted as many
people as possible to live,

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.699
at the very least,
one person must die.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.535

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.462
Ms. Yumiki.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.010
[startled gasp]

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.183
[Temari] It didn't pierce him!

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.602
If you defy me,
I have no choice!

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:03.645
Run, Ms. Yumiki!

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.566
Please don't try anything else.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:09.818
Looks like we're stuck.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.028
Hopefully, Red can deal
with this situation.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.783
Are you really
prepared to shoot me?

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.827
It's a simple matter of numbers.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.955
One death is going to be
much better than many.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.206
You can do this, Mirai.

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.458
It's a pointless exercise.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.378
If you shoot, I'll use my
Wings to dodge your Arrow,

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:29.420
so you might as well...

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.548
At least he knows
you're not bluffing.

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:32.799
I'm surprised.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.385
I never imagined you'd fire

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.595
a White Arrow
without hesitation.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.557
Maybe it's because I
heard what you had to say.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:41.975
Well, in that event,

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:44.060
it was worth saying,
wouldn't you agree?

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:46.229
There's a question I
want you to answer.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.022
You said before what's important

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:52.485
to humankind is our future,
but humanity faces extinction.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.112
And what's more,

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.531
it'll happen from too
much scientific progress.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:57.824
If so...

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.659
Why not steer science
in a direction

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.453
that won't cause
the end of humanity?

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.665
Because in the end, humanity
is destined to fall.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:07.625
Listen to me.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.502
The past can't be changed.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:10.420
It's been written.

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.463
So, do you understand that much?

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.465
Sure, that's pretty obvious.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:17.010
It's not a case of
understanding it or not.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:19.804
And once the present goes
by, it becomes the past.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.598
Do you understand that, too?

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.433
Yes, that's obvious as well.

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:26.227
The universe, then, from its
beginning to its very end,

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.354
is a series of
consecutive moments.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.523
It doesn't matter which
moment you focus on,

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.525
when you view it from the
moment that succeeds it,

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.861
it automatically
becomes the past.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:35.904
You follow me?

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.533
He's saying what's
going to happen

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:41.951
is already written because

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:44.370
it'll become the
past in the future?

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.371
No.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.332
He's saying there is
no 'in the future',

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.043
because every predetermined
moment exists simultaneously.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.920
Stop, you're making
my head spin.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.131
Your theory's interesting.

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:57.508
But only God has seen
our beginning and end.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.844
He's the only one
who can confirm it.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.512
That's the limit of
your understanding

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.139
regarding this subject?

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:05.725
Let me see if I can
make it any clearer.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:09.312
The universe is unimaginably
large and complex.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.397
Millions and billions
of years exist

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.107
within the span of a moment.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.734
And captured within that moment

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.570
are an infinite number of
births and extinctions.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:21.741
Your failure to comprehend
that dynamic poses no problem.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.618
The simple truth
of the matter is,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.995
it's been predetermined that
more than a century from now,

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.413
I will be proven right,

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:30.625
and people will come to
embrace this reality.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.127
The predetermined actions
I've chosen to take now,

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.672
are designed to get us
safely to that future.

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.882
That's all fine with me.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.300
Except you're only interested

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.135
in reaching your
own ideal future.

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.304
You talk about things like

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:44.973
'For the world',
'For the future',

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.725
but you're just doing
it for yourself.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.686
All humans only
live for themselves,

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.980
and in the end, you're
really no different.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.442
We try our best to
achieve our ideals.

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:57.986
That's what makes us happy.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:02.156
Your ideal is for
the selection process

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.577
to create no false God,
and for no God to exist.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.247
But that would just
cost too many lives.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:13.584
Ending this with as few lives
lost as possible, is my ideal.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.421
It's also what
would make me happy.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.631
The future is the
product of the present.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.550
It's not predetermined.

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.553
So in order to
seize my own future,

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.722
I must kill you.

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:27.015
Acknowledged.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.267
But you won't be saying
that for much longer.

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:32.645
Because I've done a
little research on you.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.731
This battle's already over.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.484
[startled gasp]

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:39.527
Yoneda!

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:41.612
What's the meaning of this?

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.739
Don't you get it?

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.409
You're being forced
to make a choice here.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.662
Not about what's for
dinner, but who will die.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.622
So let me ask you again.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.000
Will you give up on
becoming a false God?

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.627
Yellow's life hangs
in the balance.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.588
You may find this
method extreme,

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.214
but for now, it's the surest way

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.300
to prevent the birth
of a false God.

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:05.678
And now you have to decide.

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.891
You have 28 seconds
to make up your mind.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:17.065
[intense instrumental music]

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.904
Didn't you say causing
trouble for others

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.114
was the very last
thing you wanted to do?

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:26.699
This is a complete reversal.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:28.868
It seems to me that
killing someone else

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.745
is the most trouble
you can cause for them.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:33.122
Come to think of it, what
happened to killing yourself?

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:36.000
Well, I had to put that
plan on hold for awhile.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.461
There's something I have
to do with the professor.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.254
That's now my top priority.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.342
Kakehashi, you're
running out of time.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:46.677
Fine, then.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.097
I won't become God.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.311
[small nervous/fear gasps]

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.146
[Announcer A] God
candidate Mirai Kakehashi

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.732
has just announced he's
giving up on becoming God.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.567
Assuming no-one else steps up,

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.277
does this mean there
will be no new God?

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.862
[Announcer B] Mirai
Kakehashi says

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.073
he's dropping out of
the race to become God.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:08.741
At the moment,
there's a good chance

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.451
no new God will be chosen.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:11.702
That's no good for me.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:12.703
I had a deal.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.080
There has to be a God.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.208
Smart choice.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.544
What do you think Yellow
will say when she hears this?

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.920
I'm guessing it'll
be something like

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:23.881
'It doesn't matter what happens
to me, just kill Yoneda'.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:24.882
S'cuse me?

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.343
She didn't say that at all.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:31.055
Anyway, Red, I have to say I'm
pretty disappointed in you.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.891
When you said you wouldn't do
anything if you became God,

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.768
I thought that was
a rational response,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.938
that you were someone who was
capable of calm decisions.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.441
But it seems I may
have overestimated you.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.819
A mere 12 minutes
and 49 seconds ago,

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.321
you called your action 'a
simple matter of numbers,'

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.781
and said how killing me

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.992
could ultimately save
millions of lives.

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.327
But now, instead of
becoming a champion

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.620
in defense of humanity,

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.746
you're willing to forsake

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.832
those millions of
lives for Yellow.

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.084
--After all that talk...
--He rolled over for his girl.

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.085
What a jerk.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.503
False God or not,

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:05.089
I'm glad somebody like him
wasn't chosen for the job.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.885
I can tell you this much,
if I were in your position,

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:11.721
I never would have made
such a stupid choice.

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:14.182
As far as you're concerned
in the order of things,

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.766
Yellow's life is
the most precious

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.311
followed by the lives
of millions of others,

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:19.979
followed by me, right?

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:22.815
You're not wrong.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:27.820
Saki Hanakago is the most
important person in my life.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.780
[small surprised breath]

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:33.242
[small happy breath]

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.827
The "most," huh?

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.830
I dislike it when people
mindlessly call someone

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.832
who happens to be close to them

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:43.753
"the most important
person to me."

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:45.838
"Most important" and "soulmate"

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.591
are the desperate
delusions of weak minds.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.343
They're merely illusions.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:53.012
There are more than
7.7 billion people

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.972
currently living on this planet.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.766
And simply because
you're unable to control

00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:58.518
the common animal instinct

00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:59.810
that has compelled
males and females

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.855
to desire one another
since primeval times,

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.650
you've now given up the pursuit
of becoming a false God.

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:06.692
Professor.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:08.986
You're not whole.

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.531
I believe you may be lacking
something as a human.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.283
You have written.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.662
You believe, friendship,
lovers, and companionship

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.914
are just tools used in novels

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.916
to entertain the reading public.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.794
I said "love, friendship,
and companionship."

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:26.003
And that, in general,

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.839
not only do people fail to
acquire them, but when they do,

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.676
they are almost always
betrayed in the end.

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.261
Precisely.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.887
I confess.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:37.682
There was a time when I
felt exactly the same way.

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:38.975
[small startled breath]

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:39.976
You stink!

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:41.686
Don't you ever take a bath?

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:45.481
[Kids] Pigsty, Pigsty, Pigsty.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.024
Right now I'm only 15.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:50.278
Even if I say she's the
one I care about most,

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.863
we may not be together
our whole lives.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:53.864
What?

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.075
But it doesn't make any
sense to reject friendship

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:58.536
and love as simply "illusions."

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.871
You shouldn't say
things like that.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.915
But the reason you do

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:05.001
is because you haven't
interacted with people.

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.545
Because you don't
understand how people feel.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.090
Anybody who's
genuinely been in love

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.883
would never be able to say that.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.304
There's nothing wrong
with the choice I made.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.306
Know what?

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:21.058
Because I love her, it
was the only choice.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.059
Listen to that!

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.312
Hey, Saki, I'm really jealous.

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.688
And you, edgelord,

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.565
I bet you've never
truly loved someone.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:28.566
Shut your mouth!

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:29.609
Touchy!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:31.944
Very impressive.

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:34.155
What a marvelous thing to say.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:36.365
In fact, it's going to
make your next choice

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:37.825
all the more meaningful.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.954
What does he mean,
my next choice?

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.331
It all comes down to this.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.960
Which one of you
is going to die?

00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.045
You or Yellow?

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.797
[fright gasps]

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:59.096
Even if you've given up on the
idea of becoming a false God,

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.892
the bottom line is this: I
can't allow you to leave here.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.353
When this conversation was
ultimately narrowed down

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.021
to just the two of us,

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:08.939
you must have realized
that one of us

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.858
would finally end up
killing the other.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.362
Once again, you have 28 seconds.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:16.947
The challenge is this:

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.158
Will you let my
White Arrow hit you?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.785
Or will you let Yellow be killed

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.120
by Shuji Nakaumi's White Arrow?

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.747
Of course, if you choose to die,

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.749
but then dodge my White Arrow,

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.168
that will be considered
cheating, and in the end,

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.628
Yellow will die.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.297
Hey, Revel!

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:35.174
Tell Mirai I'm alright, and not
to give in to the professor!

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.175
Saki--

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:37.343
Don't do it!

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:38.969
If either you or
Yazeli leave here,

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:40.805
I swear I'll kill everyone.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.098
Do it anyway!

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:43.099
It's alright.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.725
I can't, Saki.

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:48.145
If I have to choose a life,
yours is more important.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:51.065
Our partners should be
entrusted with these matters.

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:58.197
Alright.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.573
Time to begin.

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:06.205
Obviously, the professor
thinks I'll choose to die.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:08.874
That's interesting,

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.627
since my White Arrow
is as powerful as his.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:14.547
In fact, for me, the best
way out of this situation

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:15.965
would actually be to kill him.

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:22.847
If I die here, you'll
guarantee Yellow's safety?

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.183
And Temari?

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:28.018
She says she can't go on living

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.021
unless she gets to
keep her Red Arrow.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.064
I believe that what she's

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:33.899
really looking
for here is money.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.484
I have no objection
to supporting her

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:37.695
so she can live in
the style she wishes.

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.071
What's that?

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:41.824
The professor is willing
to become my sugar daddy?

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.453
This might work out for me,
no matter who ends up winning.

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:48.038
The professor's lying,
and they don't know it.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.915
To prevent the creature
from being created,

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:52.084
all the God candidates must die.

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:53.878
And Red will have to die first.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.212
He's our biggest obstacle.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:58.424
If the professor has to lie
to defeat him, so be it.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.474
Listen, Mirai, don't do this.

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.392
I came here to make you happy,

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:11.520
and one of the necessities
would be for you to stay alive.

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:14.106
You can't find
happiness if you die.

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.441
You have to find happiness

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.485
for the sake of your
dead family, too.

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:19.445
Don't forget, you
picked yourself back up

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.489
even after your family
was taken from you.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.740
So you shouldn't assume

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.700
you'll never be happy
again if Saki dies.

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:30.080
[intense instrumental music]

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.250
Time's almost up.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.253
[Mirai] Know what?

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.839
You can have this one.

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:40.508
Thanks, Mirai.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:43.135
Look at that, a yellow ladybug.

00:21:43.177 --> 00:21:45.429
[Mirai] He's actually the
one who found the clover.

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:48.140
They say ladybugs bless
people with happiness.

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.895
I really want to live!

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:55.898
You've been so upset since
this God business started.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.526
I just wish we could smile
together like this forever.

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:04.156
[intense instrumental music]

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:12.331
The truth is, I love you, Mirai.

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:18.337
I have to put her first.

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:20.381
Saki's life is more important.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:28.764
Time's up.

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:31.767
Nakaumi, if Red flees,
I want you to shoot Yellow.

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:37.189
[ominous instrumental music]

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:54.373
