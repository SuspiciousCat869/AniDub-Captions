WEBVTT

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.012
[Hajime] This thing here

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:15.224
is one of Nagamitsu's
legendary swords.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.600
I've even acquired

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.268
--a Masamune sword.
--I have no money.

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:24.107
At any rate, I cannot
hide how surprised I am.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.401
I was going to shoot
you with a red arrow

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.820
and get you to do
something for me.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.533
However, it looks like
someone beat me to it.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.828
It's amusing, isn't it?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.665
[Hajime laughing]

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:45.379
Now I'm going to need
your full cooperation.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.840
So tell me who it
was who shot you?

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.467
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.221
And besides, I'm bound by
client confidentiality.

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:56.932
[dramatic music]

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:05.107
I'll tell you whatever
you want to know.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.575
[opening theme music]

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.246
[calm music]

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.416
This place is huge.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:47.709
It's really great.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.877
It's quite unique.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.504
A few years ago,
it became popular

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.214
as the chapel among the clouds,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.174
but the owner sold it
for personal reasons.

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:56.301
Hey, I could fly all
over in here [giggles].

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.595
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.847
Try this on, it's for you.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:02.808
You finally finished it.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.017
You're the best.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.060
Thank you.

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.191
There you are.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.234
What are you spacing out on?

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.278
This looked similar to
the park I used to visit

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.280
with my family.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.323
Really?

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:25.205
What's this stuff?

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:26.331
Ah, Saki

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.626
These are the celestial tomes.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.045
They're the memories
of every God and angel,

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:35.048
all the way from heaven's
inception to the present time.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.426
One drop contains more
information than you'd find

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.428
in a thousand books.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.430
You're going to
read all of these?

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.640
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.600
Well, I kind of have to Saki.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.561
I don't know any
more effective way

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.855
if I'm gonna help you
get your own wings.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.233
Thanks Revel.

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:56.236
You can thank me once
you can actually fly.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:57.863
I'll let you get to it.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.240
Mr. Mukaido finished my suit.

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:02.826
I was looking for
somewhere to try it on.

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:03.869
What suit?

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.497
We can start using
this place right away.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.875
[Saki] So, what do you think?

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.419
[upbeat music]

00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.795
[Mr. Mukaido] Oh, perfect.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.213
It's just so cute.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.214
Indeed.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.591
[Nasse] Those things
look like ears.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.009
[Baret] You have a tail too.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.093
She's like a cat!

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.136
Not true.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.431
Just look, this head gear
becomes a stealth shield.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.434
When the so-called
ears fold down,

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.478
they become a goggle
shaped wearable device,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.147
which she can control just
through eye movements.

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.316
I've woven fiber
actuators into the suit

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.692
and electric oscillation is used

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.069
to make it expand and contract.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.490
This helps compensate for Saki's
lack of physical strength.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.867
In order to dissipate as
much of the heat generated

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.327
by the suit as possible,

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.287
the tail keeps the
battery away from the body

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:49.331
and functions as a cooling unit.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.209
Prioritizing efficiency
led to this design,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.211
everything functions logically.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.796
It's ready to go.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.049
Thank you so much.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.258
You've worked so hard.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.259
You're okay with it?

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.260
Oh yeah.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.261
It's really wonderful.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.471
Hey, look up there.

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:06.097
What in the world is that?

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:08.642
It's a red arrow.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:09.684
Saki!

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.480
It's okay.

00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:14.940
It's my arrow.

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:16.942
I can feel it.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.364
However, if it's come
back to me, that means--

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.492
One of the 14 people you shot
with your arrows has died.

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:26.993
That's not all.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:30.121
It means Mukaido is now able
to use that arrow again.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.414
[Mukaido gasping]

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:32.541
Oh no.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.751
Listen Mirai, you
need to come with me.

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.753
--Of course.
--Stay here Saki.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.214
[dramatic music]

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.345
Saki.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.975
[phone ringing]

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.644
Damn it, my wife's not
answering her phone.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.188
If one of the detectives
I shot with an arrow

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.189
has been killed--

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.941
Metropoliman must be involved.

00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:00.777
Yeah, it's possible he
discovered my identity.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.281
There it is.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:07.617
Who's that?

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:08.618
Take care of him Mirai.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.953
Right.

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:11.371
[glass shattering]

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.164
Aya, Nanaka!

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.876
[dramatic music]

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.422
[metal scraping]

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:21.339
Nanaka!

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.008
Damn it.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.759
Aya where are you?

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:29.389
[Mukaido gasping]

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:42.027
[Mukaido screaming]

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.821
[metal scraping]

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.073
Who are you?

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.450
What are you doing here?

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.578
Hilarious, it really worked.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.625
Tell me, are you
also a God candidate?

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.377
[dramatic music]

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:04.883
He has wings.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.010
He did it.

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.387
He fired off a red arrow
without hesitating.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.430
All right!

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.475
Is that guy at God
candidate as well?

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.234
The bait has been set.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.862
The kid is sure to show
up here before long.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:30.158
[Hajime laughing]

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.502
[baby crying]

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.464
[Balta] Hajime
Sokotani, poor and ugly

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.508
since the day he was born,

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:50.679
and as he grew, he got
even poorer and uglier.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.014
[Man] What is wrong
with that kids face?

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.641
It's painful, hideous!

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:55.684
I never should have
given birth to you.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.644
He doesn't have the money
to pay for his lunches.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.646
He can't even afford notebooks.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:02.732
His mom's a sex worker even
though she's ugly as hell.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:09.572
[Balta] His poverty ugliness
peaked in his teenage years.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.573
[Girl] Good morning.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:11.533
Morning.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.660
I can't believe how
much it's been raining.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:16.579
Really, my mom made me
bring a change of socks.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.123
Can you believe it?

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.625
[calm music]

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.675
[Hajime gasping]

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.261
[thunder booming]

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.763
[somber music]

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.532
[Hajime crying]

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.250
I am Balta, a first rank angel.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:06.713
Both appearance and wealth
impact a person's life.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.591
Come on, don't you want
to change this world?

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.512
If you become God, or
rather a God candidate,

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.306
interesting things will happen.

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:18.933
At least that's what my
intuition is telling me.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.022
Tell me.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:29.069
I've always wanted
to talk to a girl,

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.446
but I couldn't do it.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.741
[Balta] Well now
with this, you can.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.494
[somber music]

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:53.635
I've been watching
you since forever.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:56.179
Can I hold your hands?

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:08.900
I want to kiss you, can I?

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.111
Okay.

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:30.672
[somber music]

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.220
[Hajime screaming]

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:44.185
I saw us kissing in
the classroom mirror

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.728
and it creeped me out.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.067
There's no way the real me
could ever attract anyone.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.736
Feels futile.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.739
You've got good instincts.

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.867
It's not instinctual.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:10:59.951
I feel your anguish.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:05.665
Metropon!

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.834
Now, release the hostages.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.420
[people cheering]

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.839
A God candidate
acting as a hero.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:15.550
He is so cool.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.887
I want to be like that.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:22.056
People of Earth,
I am Metropoliman.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.517
It goes without saying that
I am here to preserve peace

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.685
on this planet.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.896
He's so confident.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.773
He's not like me in any way.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.152
I see the potential in you.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.279
Inspiring, isn't he?

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.781
The two of you are
different types of people.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.910
The man inside that
suit is probably blessed

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.286
with lots of money.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.788
A popular and handsome man
who's had people fawning over

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.373
him since he was born.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.209
Handsome?

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.711
Popular?

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:55.673
It's just a hunch, but my
hunches are often correct.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.342
[Metropoliman] I have
already defeated one.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:58.343
That's it!

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.553
I'll be handsome too!

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:04.057
I'll shoot a plastic
surgeon with an arrow,

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.934
and I'll steal money.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.061
I'll be handsome and rich.

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:12.815
Yes, those are the people who
are most popular in the world.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.359
[Metropoliman] To my
eleven challengers,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.819
I realize now that
we're on the same side.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:22.575
Human technology is amazing.

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:23.743
Are you nearly ready?

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:24.786
No.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.955
Not yet.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.957
I won't be ready
until I'm popular

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.960
without using red arrows.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:34.879
[Hajime grunting]

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.341
I want to meet him, but if he
finds out I'm a God candidate,

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:39.342
he'll kill me.

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:40.927
That's an astute analysis.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.931
[Doctor] I'm removing
your bandages now.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.102
[Woman] Thanks
for your business.

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:50.144
Come back soon.

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:51.854
Sure.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.695
[people gasping]

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.993
Wow, is this really me?

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.999
That girl's my type.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.875
She's totally my type.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.212
No, no, she's leaving.

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.633
Can I help you?

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:23.970
Should I hit on her?

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.263
I've never done this before.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:29.434
Excuse me.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:31.811
You said scuzy?

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:34.480
No, it was, tits, its.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.275
Titties?

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.235
Excuse me I have to go.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:44.324
[Hajime crying]

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.998
[Balta] So your communication
skills are the issue, right?

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.250
This isn't working
out the way I thought.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:57.086
Even though I'm handsome now,
I still can't talk to girls.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:13:59.839
Are my lips still an odd shape?

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.382
What else can I do?

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.009
I could get my eyebrows waxed.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.890
What's going on?

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.224
Oh right.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.435
He's got God candidates
cornered at the grand tower

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.228
and he's gonna kill 'em.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.688
He's amazing.

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:18.232
What's that guy doing?

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.650
He's trying to shoot him.

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:22.737
Go on, get him Mr. Poliman.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:25.865
[gun firing]

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.450
He's been shot.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.495
But since he can fly
away, he should be fine.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:36.501
Can't believe there are
two people who dare to defy

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.878
Mr. Poliman.

00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.049
I must find a way.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:46.344
I have to find a way
to protect Mr. Poliman.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.098
In order to help Mr.
Poliman with his mission,

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:53.017
I'll become his servant.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.018
Yeah?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.311
Are you sure?

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:58.564
My intuition says
if he becomes God,

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.441
it would cause the
near extinction

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.943
of life on this planet.

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:02.944
Fine.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:07.115
I don't really care what
happens to this world.

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:09.158
Let it descend into chaos.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.786
I've always felt this way.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:16.833
I want to see the world that
Mr. Poliman will create.

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.336
He's trying to kill all
the other God candidates.

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.880
It would be dangerous
to approach him.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:26.509
Yes, I know that, but--

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.304
[Woman] You're handsome
enough already.

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:32.098
There's nothing left to fix.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.893
Thanks, but boys my age
are very self-conscious

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.019
about their looks.

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.604
You get to spend
your parents money

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.189
however you want, right?

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:43.109
There was a boy like you who
visited me two years ago,

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.944
his parents owned
Joso Industries.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.531
He paid for my silence and said

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.616
he'd kill me if I
ever told anyone.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.369
But I feel the need to
share my secrets with you.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:57.123
I didn't know where to
begin with that teenage boy.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.000
And it seems neither did he.

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:01.002
Then why did he come to you?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.297
Not for what you'd think.

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:07.175
He said, teach me how to
keep my sister's corpse

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:11.179
life-like and beautiful, looking
like she was still alive.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.805
Kind of creepy, right?

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.350
An interesting story.

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.978
My instincts are telling
me before we go forward,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.023
we should examine that
high school students DNA.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.984
The report you got from
that police official

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.652
you shot with a red arrow.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.654
Didn't it say something
about lifting DNA

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.865
from Metropoliman's broken mask?

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.992
If this boy's DNA is a match,

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.869
then we've uncovered
his identity.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:39.582
[Noguchi] Kanade.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.250
[Kanade] What is it Noguchi?

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:44.837
I've been shot with a red
arrow by a guy named Hajime.

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.048
He's a God candidate
who worships you.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.969
The other day I took a
hair from your brush,

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.430
so that he could
examine your DNA.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:58.059
He wants nothing more in this
life than to be your servant.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.561
Please come to the dance
room alone after class.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.230
Excuse me.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.649
[eerie music]

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.826
Someone's already shot her.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.078
That's too bad.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.248
[dramatic music]

00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:21.457
[students shouting]

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:23.000
[Boy] Noguchi,
are you all right?

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.001
[Girl] Get the nurse!

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:26.796
[Student] My god,
I think she's dead.

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.172
[Boy] Why did she fall down?

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.466
[Student] Did anyone
see what happened?

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.135
[eerie music]

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.097
[Hajime] Mr. Kanade?

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:39.016
Hold on, no, you're not him.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:43.104
Correct, I would never expose
myself that carelessly,

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.730
so I sent this guy in my place

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:47.066
and told him to repeat
exactly what I say to him

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:48.901
through earphones.

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.528
I'm observing all of this

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.281
through the cameras
installed in the dance room.

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.658
You already know
what I look like?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.493
[Hajime] No, not until today.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:01.080
I had heard that you were
a perfect handsome boy.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.874
Hey, you wouldn't actually
be standing behind

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.334
one of these mirrors, would you?

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.296
[Hajime] That's impressive.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.631
It's obvious if
you think about it.

00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:13.259
To shoot me with an arrow,
all you'd need to do is install

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.845
a one-way mirror in front
of the existing ones

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.096
and take dead aim.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:20.641
Even someone with wings
wouldn't be able to fly around

00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:23.060
forever in such
a confined space.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.980
I'm guessing you wouldn't want
to be stuck there in person.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:29.191
So you mentioned
becoming my servant.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.735
What did you mean by that?

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.695
[Hajime] Exactly
what it sounds like.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:33.946
I'm your biggest fan,

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.324
and I want to serve
you in some way,

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.200
to help you with your mission.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.577
To kill someone with wings,

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.537
first you need to trap them.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:44.165
A box behind a mirror
would be one way,

00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:47.084
but anyone could
come up with that.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.712
You're not selling
yourself very well.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:53.090
However, you were
able to track me down,

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.967
so I acknowledge that
you're not stupid.

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:58.304
[Hajime] I just got lucky,

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:03.100
or maybe my angel has
really good intuition.

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:04.477
What?

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.020
His angel must be Balta.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:09.148
He's the first rank
angel of intuition.

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:12.610
[Kanade] You want
to become my servant

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.237
without so much as ever
having met me in person.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.364
Is that correct?

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:17.948
[Hajime] Yes.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.201
[Kanade] Well, that's
awfully convenient for me.

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:24.205
[Hajime] I'm telling you I'm
happy to be your servant.

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:26.624
I'm going to prepare a box.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.377
The challenge will be how
to trap God candidates

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.003
inside of it.

00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:33.798
If you can figure that out,
I'll make you my servant.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.967
Yes, I'll do my best for you.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:40.179
I want you to know
you can trust me.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:46.185
[Hajime laughing]

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:50.398
Mr. Poliman, I have,

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.400
I've successfully

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.068
put the bait in the box.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.653
You work quickly.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:59.657
[Hajime] I even got
Mukaido's cell phone number.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:00.658
[Kanade] Really?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.076
Not bad.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.787
May I ask you something, sir?

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.790
I currently have access
to 13 red arrows,

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.875
and I've got one left.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:13.045
Should I shoot the
mother I captured?

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:14.588
He's used up 12 arrows.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.048
Is this guy stupid?

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.967
Just shoot God candidates.

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.593
Yes, of course.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.011
I'll find one.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.972
I don't know about this guy.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:25.224
Can he be of any
actual use to me?

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:26.892
And how much can I trust him?

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:31.439
You have to calm
down Mr. Mukaido.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.108
I am trying to calm
down, I really am.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.484
Why are you blaming yourself

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:37.653
and trying to hurt
yourself Mukaido?

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:40.030
If anything, you should
be directing your blame

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.699
and resentment at me.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.284
None of this would
have happened,

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:46.912
if I hadn't made you an
active God candidate.

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:49.290
I'm the one who took
you up on your offer.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.460
I was convinced I'd be
helping my wife and child.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:54.670
And instead this has happened.

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:56.630
God candidate, what a joke.

00:20:57.465 --> 00:21:00.801
What have I done?

00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:03.429
[Mukaido crying]

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.056
[phone buzzing]

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:10.686
Where the hell are they?

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:13.314
Don't yell into
the phone old dude.

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.066
Minamino theme park.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.485
Go save them.

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:19.653
That is if you actually can.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:22.364
[dramatic music]

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.743
[Mirai] Mr. Mukaido,
I'm coming with you!

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:26.869
[Saki] Me too!

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:29.163
Don't follow me. You'll
just get in my way.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.372
No, wait.

00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:32.208
[Mr. Mukaido] You can't
fight without wings.

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:38.255
I can't focus any longer.

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.924
All of this information.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.884
There's just way
too much to learn.

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:45.846
They're falling endlessly.

00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:47.306
This is heaven?

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:48.349
Revel!

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:50.184
Look after Saki.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.315
[Revel] Left behind again, huh?

00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:59.985
They might not make it back.

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:01.028
What?

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.739
This isn't like the tower.

00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:07.117
Mr. Mukaido's family
has been taken hostage.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:12.122
Even when Mirai was left all
alone, I couldn't step up.

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:14.416
I'm never able to help anyone.

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:21.674
I thought Saki had
overcome her melancholy,

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.300
but she looks the
same way she did

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.511
when she tried to kill herself.

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:28.681
If I had a pair of wings,
I'd be able to help you.

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:31.934
I want us to work together,
so we can achieve our goal

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:33.769
and eventually find happiness.

00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:39.525
I won't let this happen.

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.360
I have to help her somehow.

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:43.654
Hang on Saki, I'll find a way!

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.992
Aya! Nanaka!

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.665
