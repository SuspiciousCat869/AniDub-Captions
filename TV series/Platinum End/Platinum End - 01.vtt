00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.275
[Mirai] Everyone is
born with the goal

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:28.695
of finding happiness
and everyone lives

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.114
with the aim of attaining
even greater happiness.

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:40.123
I wish I was going to
Shuei High with you guys.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.251
Come on, now.
Stop crying.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.293
[Student] I'll see
you tomorrow at three.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.420
Let's do karaoke
during spring break.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.673
We're gonna be best friends
in high school, right?

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.299
[Yatsushiro] Cut it
out, you freak-a-zoid!

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.510
[Suzuki] I'm really
gonna miss you, buddy!

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.988
[bag crinkling]

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:31.216
It's time, to die.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.765
I just wanted to be happy.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:45.022
[air whooshing]

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:52.154
I'm conscious.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.238
What's going on?

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.033
Does it mean I've
already crossed over?

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:00.120
Wait a minute, could Heaven
and Hell actually exist?

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.043
What's that?

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.594
No way, is that an angel?

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.607
Amazing, angels exist.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.318
If this means I'm going to
heaven, I guess that's fine.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.820
Oh, hey, you're awake Mirai.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.447
Glad I made it in time.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.157
What? Made it in time?

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.158
Mhmm.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.077
I caught you before
you hit the ground.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.995
You'd be dead now if I hadn't.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.622
Go on, take a look down there.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:44.623
Excuse me?

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:45.666
Take a close look.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.090
You'll notice there's
no body on the ground

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.466
and no one's making a fuss.

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:55.842
You're right.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.720
Is this reality?

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:01.473
No way.

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:02.891
How am I not dead?

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.184
Oh it's real.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.478
That means I'm the person
who saved your life.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.856
Oh, I guess I should have
said the angel, right?

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:10.899
That's insane.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.110
You shouldn't have interfered.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.319
Just drop me.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:15.821
No way!

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.740
The whole point of my coming
here was to make you happy.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:19.866
Happy?

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.284
Yes, that's right.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.161
Remember the moment
right before you jumped?

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.122
You said you just
wanted to be happy.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.123
No, you're wrong.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.332
I never said that.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.917
You definitely did.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:34.297
Well, regardless, I've
now given up on all that.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.924
It's in the past.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.175
Just let me die.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.512
I don't have
anything to live for.

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:42.639
I haven't, since, since--

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.266
I am aware.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.059
When you were only
seven years old,

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.352
your whole family died.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.521
How did?

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:51.148
And it was soon after that,

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.567
that your aunt and
uncle took you in.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.277
That moment marked
the real beginning

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.529
of your life of pain, didn't it?

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.699
You little brat!

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:03.910
Don't forget who took you in
when you had nowhere to go!

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.787
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm sorry!

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:08.915
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.417
Don't make a sound.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.005
My life became nothing but pain.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.383
I have no family, no friends.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.303
I don't want to go on.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:25.557
Truth is, there's no hope
anywhere in my future.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.184
You're wrong!

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.895
As a special rank angel,
I'm here to give you hope!

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:30.937
[Nasse chuckles]

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.355
Give me hope?

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.356
Yeah!

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.776
[Mirai yells]

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:41.031
I'm offering you hope to
live with freedom or love.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.742
[Mirai] I don't know
what she's talking about.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.702
I just want to be
done with this.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.329
What she's suggesting is stupid.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.330
Oh really?

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.748
You think so?

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.749
Okay, then.

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.167
Let's start with freedom.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.503
Up to this moment, you've
been living as little more

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.046
than a slave.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:59.132
But now you'll be able to go
where you want, when you want.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.342
And then there's love.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.302
Even though you have
no family or friends,

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.346
you'll find that
everyone will adore you.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:05.388
Trust me.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.142
Those are empty promises.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.227
What?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.311
How would you do it?

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.230
How would you give
me those things?

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.190
Freedom or love?

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:18.026
Both of them are
invisible, vague concepts.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.277
Not true.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.987
You can already see one of them.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.783
For example, look
at these wings.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:27.285
They can fly faster than
the human eye can follow

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.578
and can take you anywhere.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.621
That's freedom.

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:30.872
What?

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.916
And then there's
the matter of love.

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:40.590
This is the Angel's arrow.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.384
And you can trust me.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.636
Any man or woman who's
struck by this red arrow

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.346
will fall deeply
in love with you.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.389
Isn't that great?

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:49.474
So choose.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.978
Either these wings
or this red arrow.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.605
Encapsulate the hope
that I can give you.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:56.940
So which one?

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.235
[Mirai] Is this some
supernatural scam?

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.696
Neither one of
those things exist.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.906
That means I can't choose
either one of them.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.658
I might as well
just die instead.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.454
I can't choose between
those two, so give me both.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.914
Huh?

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.457
Then I'll consider it.

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.209
Okay.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.878
Then I'll give you everything.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.422
What? I thought I had to
choose one or the other.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.632
I only phrased it that way
because it's tradition.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:23.633
You'll get both.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:24.634
No, wait.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.219
I don't want either of them.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.387
I want to die!

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.306
--Just leave me alone!
--Here, catch!

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.601
What are these things?

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.603
The wings sprout from
the Angel's Necklace.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.354
The arrow fires
from the Armband.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.272
Now, wait just a--

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:38.273
Sorry.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:39.274
There's no wait.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.151
Those bands can't be removed.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.861
You're serious?

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.654
I'll look crazy
wearing these things!

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.072
Get 'em off.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.450
You don't have to worry.
Nobody can see them on you.

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.285
Oh, that's not exactly true.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:52.287
Other people with
angels will be able to.

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:53.288
What?

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.332
Other people with angels?

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.958
So there are more of you around.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.959
How many?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.127
Oh, a few.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.129
Just until the
new God is chosen.

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.464
The new God?

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.466
We'll talk about
that later, okay?

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.635
How about we give
those bans a whirl.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:07.636
[Mirai] Hold on.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.262
--I still haven't.
--Come on!

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.058
If you fly you'll land
softer. [chuckles]

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.517
Thanks for the advice.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.311
Now will you shut up already?

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:19.189
[Nasse] Try your
wings first, okay?

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.690
So what do I say?

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.400
Come forth, angel wings?

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.114
That was just great!

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.115
They're huge!

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.742
Don't even worry about the size.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.786
Nobody else will ever
know you have them

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.704
and they can't
bump into anything.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.206
So now try flying.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.832
That's easier said than done.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.543
What the heck am
I supposed to do?

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.506
[Mitai yells]

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.928
Oh, he's flying all right.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.349
Can I control it?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.648
[light pretty music]

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.368
Incredible.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.995
This is awesome.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:16.454
It feels amazing.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:20.583
I've dreamed about
flying before.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.336
But that didn't compare to the
reality of actually doing it.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.048
Plus, this isn't a dream.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:31.177
Why am I crying
all of the sudden?

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.856
It's so beautiful.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.983
Hope to live with freedom, huh?

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.068
Well this is freedom for sure.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.408
Everything's so green.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.451
Why is that?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.623
Here, you can have this.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.584
[Saki] Really, are you sure?

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:03.835
[Mirai] Of course I am.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:04.878
You're my friend.

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:08.423
Thanks, Mirai.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.637
Today was my
graduation ceremony.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:19.225
[crickets chirping]

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.438
That was good for
your first time.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.523
You didn't seem to
be scared at all.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.318
I couldn't fly before and
I jumped off a building.

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:29.444
Come on, tell the truth.

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:30.695
Wasn't flying fun?

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.407
Hey, admit it.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:35.825
It was an amazing
experience, right?

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.244
Since you're faster
than the human eye now,

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.246
you can steal anything you want.

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.247
What?

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:42.499
And arrow is amazing too.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.917
Bottom line, if you
shoot someone with it,

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.836
you can make them fall in
love with you just like that.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.379
Tell me something.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.006
Are you sure that
you're an angel?

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.007
Yeah!

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.050
I'm special rank,

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.010
which is higher than
first and second rank.

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.428
All this talk about
controlling minds

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.430
and stealing things,
it makes you sound

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:58.431
more like you're the devil.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.808
How would you know?

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.393
You've never seen an angel
or a devil before today.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.563
And besides, devils
don't even exist.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.148
If they're anywhere to be found,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.526
it would be inside
the hearts of people.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.569
I suppose that's true.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.739
And if that is the case,

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.158
I suppose that would mean
there are devils who moved in

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.744
and took over the hearts of
both your aunt and uncle.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.372
Since they killed
people in the past.

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:23.790
They killed someone?

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.501
They killed your
family years ago

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.503
and made it look like
it was an accident.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.048
What are you talking about?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.050
I have always been watching you.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.636
I know everything there
is to know about you.

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.513
My aunt and my uncle?

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.473
They murdered my family.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.560
Seriously, seriously?

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:53.403
[family laughing]

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:55.321
They made me suffer.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.615
I figured that was
just how it went.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.118
After all, I wasn't
their real child.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.579
I also thought I was
somehow responsible

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.914
for the situation I was in.

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.791
I was just a kid.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.585
I couldn't do anything about it.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:13.298
All of that, torment was
supposed to end today

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.674
with my death.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:17.510
And now you're telling
me they killed my family?

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:18.887
No!

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.305
Do you think I'm lying?

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.764
Check it out.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.642
Why not use your arrow to
confirm what I'm saying?

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:38.865
Damn piece of crap.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.578
[door thuds]

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.996
What's up?

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.831
You're home late. Where have
you been all this time?

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.791
You're creeping me out
just standing there.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:49.918
Anyway, perfect timing.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.127
Go buy me a lighter.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.420
See?

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.797
Your aunt doesn't even
know I'm standing here.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.507
Auntie, listen.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:03.139
I've got something
I want to ask you.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.557
Yeah spill it.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.059
Get to it, Mumbles.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:14.776
Didn't you hear me?

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:16.444
What is it you want, you brat?

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.280
Hey, back off.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.615
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.451
I don't really want you
to fall in love with me,

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:24.494
but here it goes.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.001
You did it!

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.670
Now she'll do
anything you tell her.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.676
You mean that's all it
takes to control someone?

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:40.593
Sorry, Mirai.

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.600
I'm sorry for what happened.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.811
I love you, Mirai, but
my husband insisted.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.646
He said it was the only way.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:52.689
Get off me!

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:56.484
Forgive me, Mirai.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:57.860
Oh, it's working.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.862
This is the power
of the red arrow.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:00.905
Now tell me.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.324
I want the truth.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:06.119
All those years ago,
did you and my uncle,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.079
did you kill my family?

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:10.123
No, no!

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.666
I resisted.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.418
I didn't really want to!

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.253
My husband came
up with the idea.

00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:19.007
I swear, he was the
one who planned it all!

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:21.092
I would never want
to hurt you, Mirai.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.385
Unbelievable.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.429
--I love you too much
--Why would they even think

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.722
of doing such a thing?

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.100
What the hell is all the
screaming and hollering about?

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.351
I'm trying to sleep.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.438
I see you're finally back Mirai.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.356
We have a list of
things for you.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.691
It was his idea!

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.027
My father accumulated a
modest fortune over his life.

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.945
My husband said
we'd get all of it

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.865
if my brother wasn't alive
to inherit his share,

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:45.908
so he rigged the car to blow up!

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.368
[Uncle] Hey, get off me!

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.954
He knew your mother gave my
brother and your sister Akira

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.581
a ride every morning.

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:53.207
[Uncle] What are
you talking about?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.293
This can't be true.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.295
[Akira] Goodbye, Mirai.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.838
I'll see you later.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.341
Don't stick your head out
the window, you got that?

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:02.717
I know. I know.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.718
Is that it?

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.761
The art for your homework?

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.680
You'd better get a move on.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:08.931
Saki's waiting for you.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:09.932
You're right!

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.351
See you all later!

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:13.061
He's always late.

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:16.189
Saki's gonna be really mad.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.025
[explosion booms]

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.825
Dad, mom?

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.079
Akira?

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:34.123
[Uncle] Have you lost
what's left of your mind?

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.958
Why are you telling
him all of this?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.585
Because it's the truth.

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:38.628
Tell me.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.422
Why did you let me live?

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:44.384
That was his idea too.

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:46.094
He told me he had a plan.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:47.720
Shut your mouth, woman.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.847
It was for the insurance.

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.392
They'd pay if we took you in.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.977
How dare you betray
me, you bitch.

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.647
I never liked you
right from the start!

00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:58.940
--Shut up!
--They did it

00:14:58.981 --> 00:14:59.982
just for the money.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.278
--Get off of me!
--My God, you're monsters!

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:06.823
You don't care about anyone.

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:08.950
You should have died instead.

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.785
Get away!

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:11.786
It's true!

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.663
The two of you deserve
capital punishment!

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:14.872
You should both just die!

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.584
[aunt panting]

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.002
[aunt yells]

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.045
You bitch!

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.806
[Uncle whimpers]

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.560
Why did she do that to herself?

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.769
You were very clear.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.020
You said she should die.

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:42.608
You mean the red arrow can
compel people to do that?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.860
Oh yes.

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.361
If they've done something
that merits death

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.863
in order to make amends.

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:49.031
They fall that deeply
in love with you.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.616
Who cares?

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.869
That woman helped her
husband kill your family.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.539
[Uncle] Help me, Mirai!

00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.000
I'll call an ambulance.

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:01.794
It's too late for
that. She's dead.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.463
I know, I'm an angel.

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.047
She's definitely dead.

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:06.048
See?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.800
An angel's already
here to get her.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.063
Just like that?

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.107
Alive a minute
ago, dead the next.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.569
The same as dad, mom, and Akira.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.780
Wiped out in a flash.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:36.996
She's dead.

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:38.956
This is real.

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:40.333
It's not a dream.

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.918
It's not faked.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.086
It's happening here and now.

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:45.463
Right in front of me.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:55.848
I'm here in the real
world and I'm still alive.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:56.849
I'm alive.

00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:58.976
I'm alive.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:00.895
I'm alive!

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.146
Guess what?

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.272
I finished it!

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.273
Oh good.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.942
Can I look at it?

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:06.943
Let me see here.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:09.779
We're all smiling.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.988
We look so happy.

00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:15.284
Mirai, I'm convinced everyone
is born with the goal

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.577
of finding happiness.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.662
And then after that,

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.288
everyone lives with
the aim of attaining

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.082
even greater happiness.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:22.959
I believe this deep in my heart.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.754
So my wish for you is that
you always find happiness

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:27.797
in your life.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:32.468
[Mirai panting]

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.887
[Mirai yells]

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.727
Mirai?

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:53.364
My mother said we live
to find happiness.

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:57.034
After death happiness
is out of reach.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.452
She was obviously right.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.998
And rather than going out to
search for that happiness,

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.249
I tried to kill myself.

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.379
All of that wasted time.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:09.422
What was I doing?

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:13.926
I'm sorry dad, Akira, and mom.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.638
I have to find happiness

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.350
for their sakes as well.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.063
Yes, that's right.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.858
The honest truth is
anyone can find happiness

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.693
regardless of their past.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.737
See?

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.989
To prove it, I came
to make you happy,

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.616
even though I know your history.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.995
Right.

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.163
I get it.

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:44.248
I want to be happy.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.046
My name is Nasse and
I'm your personal angel.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.767
Come on, Mirai.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.143
It's been three days.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:07.396
You haven't used our wings
or arrow in all that time.

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:10.816
Not since you shot the
front desk lady downstairs.

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:13.027
Your uncle seems to think
your aunt went crazy

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.028
and killed herself.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.237
You don't have to worry.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:19.909
See this money?

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.244
It's all I have left for now.

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.247
I'm using the arrows power
to stay in this place.

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.624
Now look.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.584
You said the wings would
allow me to steal anything

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:31.587
and the arrow would allow
me to control minds.

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.214
Is that accurate?

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:34.632
Mhmm.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.634
Okay. But things acquired
through theft or deception

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.927
don't make me happy.

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:41.389
If they did, I'd
be a bad person.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:45.393
I'm fine with more
ordinary happiness.

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.937
Can you define
ordinary happiness?

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.438
Yeah.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.901
Having some place to sleep
and something to eat.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:56.696
Going to school,
working at a company

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.783
and maybe one day falling
in love with someone

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.286
and eventually raising a
happy family with them.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.290
The kind of happiness that I had

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:10.876
back before I lost my family.

00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:13.337
So that's ordinary happiness.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:16.632
Understood.

00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:20.136
Bottom line, my only desire
is for you to be happy.

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:21.220
Look, Nasse.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:24.432
I'm going to need
a chunk of money.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:28.060
I can't keep on living in
a place like this forever.

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.520
Hmm, money?

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:30.771
If that's what you need,

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.106
you should get out there
and kill your uncle

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.733
and all his kids.

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.067
What?

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:37.570
Well of course then all the
money he's been hoarding

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.321
would become your inheritance.

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.282
Don't forget, the
man did adopt you.

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:42.700
But murder them?

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.744
What are you talking
about, Nasse?

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.495
It's just taking
money back from people

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:49.790
who made a fortune by
killing your family. Right?

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.959
The red arrow can
easily kill your uncle,

00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:54.170
who's tormented by his
guilt in the same way

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:55.880
it was able to kill your aunt.

00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:00.092
I don't want him
to die like that.

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:02.511
However, I doubt his
kids have done anything

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:04.472
to merit death as a
way to make amends.

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:07.099
So the red arrow probably
wouldn't kill them.

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:08.350
Now hold on just a minute.

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:10.936
Don't talk about killing
people like it's no big deal.

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:12.605
But there is an easier way.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:15.816
You can just use the white arrow
inside the Angel's armband.

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:17.443
That one I gave you, remember?

00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:19.570
The white arrow?

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:25.367
Shooting someone with
a white arrow is quick.

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.828
It kills them instantly
100% of the time.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.371
It's very accurate.

00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:33.125
An arrow that
instantly kills people?

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:36.128
Why does an angel have
something like that?

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.380
Special rank angels
have the white arrows,

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.007
arrows of peaceful death.

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:43.302
People that are on their way
out are given a painless exit.

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:45.387
And God carries them as well.

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.681
God needs arrows?

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.308
I haven't told you
about that yet.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.309
Oh, sorry.

00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:52.603
I guess I got too caught
up in stopping you

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.271
from killing yourself.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.648
Here's the deal.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:58.234
There are currently 13 God
candidates residing on earth

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:00.653
and each one of them
has a personal angel.

00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:01.654
What?

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.739
Oh yes. It's all
according to plan.

00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:05.616
Each one has been
given wings and arrows

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.452
and one of them will be
chosen to become the new God.

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:09.787
I imagine you'll run into

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.789
some of the other
candidates eventually.

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:12.832
It's inevitable.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.044
In that moment I realized
I started down a journey

00:22:17.086 --> 00:22:20.381
to a destination I
couldn't even imagine.

00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:23.592
The path I was on now
was an outrageous one.

00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:25.052
What?

00:22:25.803 --> 00:22:27.638
Who the hell are you?

00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:31.642
Is that a white arrow?

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:35.646
[Mirai] I had finally
decided to pursue happiness

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:37.231
in my life and just live.

00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:41.235
But now, 13 God candidates?

00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:43.487
[Metropoliman] You only
had a red arrow, huh?

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.325
[Mirai] What's it gonna take
to be chosen as the new God?

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:58.502
