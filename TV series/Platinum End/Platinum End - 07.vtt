00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:10.761
[Misurin] Mr. Poliman
told me if anyone

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.555
with Wings shows up, I
have to stay with them.

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:15.974
So I really don't have a choice.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.351
[Mukaido gasps]

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:18.852
[Mukaido] This isn't good.

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:23.941
--[button clicks]
--[explosion blasting]

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:27.861
--Mr. Mukaido!
--[energizing music]

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.033
--What the hell?
--Is it a terrorist attack?

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:38.080
[Mirai] What just happened?

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:42.084
I thought Metropoliman was
supposed to show up. [gasps]

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:44.878
Mr. Mukaido!

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:49.591
[air whooshing]

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.219
[impact booms]

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:57.015
Mr. Mukaido! Mr.
Mukaido! [panting]

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.393
No. Don't die.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:03.063
Please don't die! [sobbing]

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.148
I don't want anyone else to die.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:10.571
[Mukaido coughing]

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.866
He's alive.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.119
Mr. Mukaido survived.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.662
Hey, isn't that great, Baret?

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.124
Yes, it is, although I was
aware of it right away.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.669
--Mirai, is that you?
--Yes.

00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:29.464
[Mukaido] I'm glad I
wore this blast suit.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.883
I knew there was a
possibility he'd do that,

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.052
but I thought he'd
at least confront me.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.054
He's willing to use more
than just White Arrows

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.264
to kill the God candidates.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.059
[Mirai breathing shakily]

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.061
--You must be happy.
--[Mirai gasps]

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.106
You said you didn't wanna
see anyone else die.

00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:47.149
Isn't that right?

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:49.776
[Mirai] Yes.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.781
[Mukaido] Girl A must have
perished in the blast.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.116
I agree with you.

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:58.243
I don't wanna see
anyone else die, either.

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:05.000
But we can't afford to
display that kind of weakness.

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.502
The real fight is
about to begin.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.463
--What?
--He's here.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.673
[Metropoliman] What's
with the costumes?

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.091
They're actually pretty cute.

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:15.594
Ready to surrender?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:24.811
[opening theme music]

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:54.317
[Mirai] Tell me, how can
you kill people so easily?

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.112
[Metropoliman] Probably
because of these Wings

00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:59.281
and Arrows I've been given.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.450
[Mirai] You know that's
not what I'm asking.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.455
I want to know why you think
it's okay to kill people.

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:09.332
[Mukaido] Mirai.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.418
[Metropoliman] Oh, please.
What are you, a child?

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:15.589
[Metropoliman sighs]

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.299
"It's wrong to kill people."

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.093
"There's nothing more
precious than human life."

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.345
Is that what you want to hear?

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.264
[Mirai] You obviously
know it's wrong.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:26.224
Why do you do it?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.392
[Metropoliman] Oh, I don't know,

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.269
so I can become God, I guess?

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:32.272
To achieve that,
sacrifices have to be made.

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.316
I'm trying to keep it
to a minimum, though.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.942
[Mukaido] You mean
by eliminating

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.277
every other contender?

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.154
[Mirai] What if you're mistaken?

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.698
No one said the last God
candidate left standing

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.283
automatically becomes God.

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:46.286
[Metropoliman] I suppose
that's a possibility,

00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:48.538
but I'm willing
to take that risk.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.081
[Mirai] You killed Girl A.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.958
You used her to kill
middle school girls

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.044
who had nothing to do
with your ambitions.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.670
Do you understand
what it feels like

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.297
to lose a family member?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.090
Do you have the first
idea what it means

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.051
to lose someone
important to you?!

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.303
[menacing music]

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.681
--I do.
--[Mirai gasps]

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.518
It just so happens that
I lost the family member

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.269
I loved the most in this world.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:18.026
So I understand exactly what
it feels like, painfully so.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:19.820
But really, so what?

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.322
[Kanade] So...

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.785
[Mukaido] You're not gonna
be able to persuade him.

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:28.203
[Mirai] I'll have to try harder.

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:29.538
There's gotta be a way.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.539
[Metropoliman] Fine, then.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.332
Today's the last day anyone dies

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.084
unnecessarily because of me.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.503
From now on, I'll only
kill God candidates.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.090
Isn't that what you want?

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.967
We're here in front
of the Grand Tower.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.677
We've been told that
Girl A was present

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.095
when the explosion occurred.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.930
I'm sure they're both fine.

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:48.932
But that was their destination.

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:50.725
[Announcer] Here's an aerial
view of the Grand Tower.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:51.726
The explosion that occurred--

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.354
--Nasse?
--Oh, do you see that figure?

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.274
It's Metropoliman, who was
last seen at Jinbo Stadium!

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.443
--Can you fly?
--Yeah.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.737
I think everything's
in working order.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.197
[Mirai] Good.

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.365
[Mukaido]
But I have no intention

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.034
of ending this by
just taking off.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.369
[Mirai] I figured.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.371
[Mukaido] I don't wanna
let the guy escape.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.831
But even more than that,

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.583
I'd like to avoid getting killed

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.586
and having him take our
Wings and Arrows from us.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.505
If that happens, he really
will brute-force his way

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:21.923
to becoming God.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.550
We have to do whatever it takes

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.510
to shoot him with a Red Arrow.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:26.553
[Mirai] Right.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.389
[Mukaido] I don't understand.

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.766
Why is this guy
still hanging around?

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.977
I'm sure he'd love to
kill more God candidates,

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.021
but it's two on one.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.439
He's not the type to pick fights

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.274
where he's at a disadvantage.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.820
So does he have a plan, or
is he hatching one right now?

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:47.240
[Metropoliman] I don't know what
you two are whispering about,

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.618
but you're both
going to die here.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.661
--Meyza!
--[all gasp]

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.123
Watch my back.

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.125
Gotcha.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.961
[Mukaido]
If he fires his White Arrow,

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:01.379
we'll just fly away.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.548
I'll see if I can trick him.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.383
--Nasse!
--You called?

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.052
[Mukaido] Just checking.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.804
You're sure that Meyza is a
special-rank angel like you?

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.766
--Yep, that's right.
--Nasse, Baret.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.393
--You two watch our backs.
--Right.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.187
[Mukaido] Prepare to
fire your Red Arrow.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.271
[Mirai] Ready.

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:21.691
[Mukaido] Well done.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.444
Now he'll assume I'm the
one with the White Arrow.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.445
[Mirai] What?

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.696
[Mukaido] He sees that Nasse,

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:29.115
who's a special-rank angel,
is floating behind me,

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.451
and I instructed you to
prepare your Red Arrow.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:34.537
That should make it clear who
he needs to be cautious of.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.122
While his attention's
diverted to me,

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.540
hit him with that Arrow.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.042
--Got it.
--You two seem

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.503
to be plotting
something down there.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.255
To head that off, I
think I'm going to

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.634
[Arrow humming]

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.096
kill you first.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.138
[Mukaido] Told you.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.850
How exactly do you
plan to do that?

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.602
Are we gonna fight one-on-one?

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:58.687
[Metropoliman] Oh, please.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.897
I'd never do
anything that risky.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.566
I prepared this instead.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.569
Priming code: ENJER.

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:11.324
You see, I planted a
bomb in another location.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.537
Leaving Girl A on top of the
tower would have been pointless

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.081
if no God candidates
showed up to apprehend her.

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.667
To avoid that, I planted a
bomb so she could threaten

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.169
to blow up another
building in a fit of pique.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.840
Pretty effective against
softies who feel the need

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.342
to save strangers,
don't you think?

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.886
It's one of the buildings
you can see from here.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.682
And if it explodes,
you'll be responsible

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.517
for the precious lives
of the people inside

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.352
who will all be lost.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.897
It comes down to this: either
you'll die, or innocent people

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.525
who have nothing to do
with our conflict will die.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.526
It's one or the other.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:49.571
Hmph. You're lying.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.990
It's nothing but a bluff
you just came up with.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.950
Yeah. He's lying.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.578
[Mirai] How can you
be sure about that?

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.163
Under ordinary circumstances,

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.124
that angel would be skilled
at seeing through lies,

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.584
but the technique
requires being able

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.669
to look at a person's face.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:08.381
I can assure you, it is
the angel who is bluffing.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:09.883
[Metropoliman] I see.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.761
I guess that means you
don't care who dies.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.387
Too bad, old man.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.306
I wouldn't have to press
this activation key

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:17.682
if you'd died in the explosion.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.935
Now innocent people will be
wiped out because of you.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.562
Live with that.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:26.566
All right. I'm pressing it--

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:27.609
[Mukaido] Wait!

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.945
Fine. Don't do it.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.614
[Mirai] Mr. Mukaido.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.407
[Mukaido] But with
this stipulation:

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.659
death comes to only
one of us today.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.621
You intended to kill
one God candidate

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.206
in that explosion earlier,

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.249
so having one less
God candidate around

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.126
should be good enough
for you, shouldn't it?

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.046
--Do you agree?
--Hmm.

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:53.968
Okay, but here's my stipulation.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.720
I get to choose who dies,

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:59.140
and I'm taking the Wings and
Arrows they leave behind.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.558
Those are my conditions.

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:04.604
[helicopter rumbling]

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:05.814
[Demakawa] Demakawa here.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.816
This is Metropoliman's
first appearance

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.776
since the upsetting
incidents at Jinbo Stadium.

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.195
Is he connected to the
Grand Tower explosion?

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.489
Be careful, Mirai
and Mr. Mukaido.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:19.410
--[Metropoliman laughing]
--[tense music begins]

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.662
[Metropoliman] Awesome.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.705
A public execution
suits me just fine!

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:27.252
I'll stick with my
original plan to kill you.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.586
[Mukaido] That figures.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.630
Of course you'd kill
the special-rank first.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.591
[Metropoliman] Your
rank is irrelevant.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.677
It's because you'd be the
more difficult survivor

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:36.761
to deal with.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.054
[Metropoliman]
Tell yourself that.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:39.973
You really just want
another White Arrow.

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:43.810
But I appreciate you
overestimating my abilities.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:46.688
[Mirai] No! I don't
want you to die!

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:47.689
[Mukaido] I know.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.107
[Mirai] Nasse could be right!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:52.110
--Maybe he is lying.
--And if he isn't?

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.904
I'm not just going to let him
kill me without consequences.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:58.032
When he fires his White Arrow,
you shoot your Red Arrow.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.701
It's our only chance.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.120
[Mirai] But...

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.874
[Mukaido] My life is going
to be over soon either way.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.876
[tense music continues]

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:15.300
--[Mirai panting]
--[heartbeat thumping]

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.302
[Mirai] If I don't
figure something out,

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.220
Mr. Mukaido is going to die.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:22.473
I can't let that
happen! [gasping]

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.271
[Metropoliman] The second
you try to fly away,

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.898
I'm pressing the key.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.774
[Mukaido] So if
there's no explosion,

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.151
it'll mean you were bluffing.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.321
Then I guess you're right!

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:40.491
[Mirai screams]

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.703
[Arrow shatters]

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.706
[Metropoliman grunts]

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.334
[Mirai panting]

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.967
[suspenseful music]

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:02.347
[Mirai panting]

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:03.681
[Mukaido] Mirai!

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.683
--Interesting.
--Huh?

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:06.935
Wings and Arrows aren't affected

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.062
by objects from the human world,

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.940
but this was a tool
from another angel.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.901
Even I didn't know they
could be used this way.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.903
What? I'm shocked.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.030
[Metropoliman] Why
are you interfering?

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:25.411
--Don't you care if people die?
--[tense music continues]

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:30.458
[Mirai] I am going to
shoot you with a Red Arrow!

--[tense music ends]
--[thrilling music begins]

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.799
[Mirai shouts]

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.426
[air whooshing]

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.310
[Metropoliman] You're
charging instead of shooting?

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:50.395
Are you dense?

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.439
You're annoying me.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.024
You'll have to die first!

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.236
[Mukaido] Move!

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:01.030
[Arrow shatters]

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:04.617
[tense music]

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.166
[Mirai yells]

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.127
[Metropoliman] That
was impressive.

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:15.837
[Mirai panting]

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.839
Why aren't you flying away?!

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.633
[lasers pulsing]

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.221
Pretty Godly moves for
someone who will never be God.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:30.143
How long do you think you
can keep dodging like this?

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:33.396
[Mirai grunting]

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.440

I...

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.072
I will

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:45.450
shoot you

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.872

[thrilling music continues]

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.294
[Metropoliman] Made you look!

[thrilling music ends]

--[Mirai panting]
--Mirai!

What's happened to him?

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:07.472
Can he really get us out
of here in one piece?

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.975
[wind whistling]

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.644
[Metropoliman] How long do
you intend to keep this up?

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:14.979
It's so lame.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.690
[Meyza chuckles]

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:20.109
You are quite right.
It's pathetic.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.277
You're wrong, Meyza.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:25.073
--It's hella cool.
--[Meyza scoffs]

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.660
[Demakawa] We've been
watching Metropoliman--

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.037
[Saki] Why doesn't
he dodge his attacks

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.663
by flying away from him?

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:34.665
I know he won't shoot him.

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:37.460
If something doesn't change,
Mirai will get killed.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.504
[perilous music begins]

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.256

[Mukaido] What should I do?

00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:00.566
Metropoliman can't
turn his back on me,

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.568
but he can't take
his eyes off Mirai.

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.572
Mirai's desperate
fight moves have served

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.075
to put that creep
on the defensive.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.369
It's a golden opportunity.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.831
While he's distracted,
I have to take him down.

He took off.

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.749
Maybe I should've
aimed for his heart.

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.002
No, his suit was bulletproof,

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:02.795
so it wouldn't have
made any difference.

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.922
--[Mirai coughing]

[Mirai panting]

[Mukaido] Let's go.

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.994
[Demakawa] Metropoliman has
vanished up into the sky,

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:38.039
and the two other mysterious
figures just vanished as well.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.166
In a scenario very
reminiscent of what happened--

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:41.584
Oh, thank goodness.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:42.835
You're both alive.

--Yeah.

What a relief.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:52.053
I was so afraid.

00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:53.971
[Demakawa] His mask
broke, but unfortunately,

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.598
our cameras failed
to capture his face.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.599
It seems as though

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.059
the two figures had
engaged Metropoliman--

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.644
I tried, but I couldn't shoot.

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:04.732
He flinched for a moment
when you opened fire on him.

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.610
But I just couldn't.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:08.736
I couldn't shoot him.

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.532
[somber music]

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:18.329
The way you fought him out there
was really reckless, Mirai.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.623
It's a miracle
you're still alive

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:23.042
after all those close calls.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.044
Or were you acting
that way intentionally

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.130
with the hopes that I'd get
an opportunity to shoot him?

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.052
As if. I just
didn't want to die.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:36.055
So I kept trying to shoot him.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.016
No. That's wrong.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.687
I wasn't carrying out a plan.

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:46.899
Once it started, I
couldn't think anymore.

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:49.777
I'm not up for this.

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.073
I'm not cut out for battle.

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.994
It's a little late for that.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.705
I've never been in a fistfight.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.332
When my aunt and uncle abused me

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:05.501
after I went to live with them,

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.169
I just took the beatings.

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:11.257
No matter what the other
kids said to me at school

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:14.051
or how much they
mocked me, I pretended,

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:18.139
I pretended I couldn't hear,
and I never spoke back to them.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.849
I never retaliated.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.225
Sorry, son, but if you think

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:22.893
that's strength, you're wrong.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.146
I know that.

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.149
It's not a strength.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.775
I know it's a weakness.

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:35.406
I'm afraid to attack
someone 'cause I'm a coward.

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:39.744
Not true. I sure
don't believe that.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:43.164
Yeah. It's because
you're a kind person.

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:44.749
In this world of ours,

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:47.460
people compete
against each other

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:50.087
and work hard to
reach their ideals.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.340
That leads to happiness.

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:53.591
I know all that.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:58.721
But what I'm doing right
now is totally different.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.309
I can't derive any joy if
I'm gonna gain something

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.686
by hurting or
killing someone else!

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:08.814
I can't understand how you
can be happy doing that!

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.983
It's Metropoliman
who's killing people

00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.527
and trying to force his
way into becoming God.

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.030
We're the ones that
are trying to stop him.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.948
So even if we end
up killing him,

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.950
he won't exactly be a victim.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:23.245
Maybe you're right,
but I'm lost.

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.206
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.544
Just why are we doing this?

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.131
To be happy.

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:39.053
Isn't that right?

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:42.390
You're doing it so
everyone can be happy.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:48.896
[soft music]

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:55.194
[Mirai] I received Wings
and Arrows from Nasse,

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:59.198
escaped from hell, and
then I got to be with Saki.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.575
I felt like I had
ascended to heaven.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:04.662
I thought I might
actually find happiness.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:08.624
But the reality is, what
we're doing this time around

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:11.585
is killing each other.

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:17.383
Why the hell won't anybody
let me live a normal life?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.386
Seriously, I'm sick
of all of this!

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.015
Hey, I understand how you
feel, but listen, Mirai.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:27.184
We need to focus on
what just happened.

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.229
Think back, Mirai.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.314
What did you observe
about Metropoliman?

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:34.442
--Mr. Mukaido.
--Huh?

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:35.484
Don't you see?

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.112
Mirai's still upset
about what happened.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.281
I am, too. I've had
enough for one day.

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:43.409
Well, you're obviously
worried about Mirai.

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.035
But all the good
thoughts in the world

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.370
wouldn't have helped
you feel better

00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:49.081
about that life-and-death
struggle you just went through.

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:52.585
I understand. You're both right.

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:54.420
We can pick this
up again tomorrow.

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.298
We made progress.

00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:00.259
Having seen his face this
time is good enough for now.

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.472
[Saki] Was he telling the truth?

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:07.266
Is Mirai really happy
being around me?

00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:12.521
It was close, but
you should be fine.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:14.148
Well, this was a first.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.358
A patient whose head
was grazed by a bullet.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.735
Never treated that before.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.947
I was shot at very close range.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.283
I thought I'd
bulletproofed this suit.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:26.285
That must have been
a difficult job.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:28.329
[Kanade] Thanks for seeing me

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.289
outside your office
hours, Doctor.

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:32.333
[Doctor] It was
no problem at all.

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:34.460
The threat of
another hidden bomb,

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:37.630
my promise not to kill anyone
other than God candidates,

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.298
I lied about all of it.

00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:43.719
Damn it. Who the
hell are those guys?

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:49.141
Did you see that Grand
Tower explosion yesterday?

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:51.393
Crazy, huh? It was so scary.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:55.689
Huh? Hey, he's back.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.316
Huh? Who?

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:00.319
You know, your stalker.

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.408
You know what? I'm going
over there to talk to him.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.744
--No, it's fine.
--Huh? Why do you say that?

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:15.292
I seriously doubt it's true,
but are you dating Kakehashi?

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.544
[Saki] What?

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:18.295
[Maiko] There's a
rumor going around.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.506
Someone said they saw
the two of you together.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.385
No, we're not dating.

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:25.469
Of course not.

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:28.222
I mean, who'd date
Mirai Kakehashi?

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:31.559
--[Saki exhales]
--Hmm?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.435
Yeah, of all people.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:36.397
Me and Mirai together?

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:37.982
I could never fall for him.
