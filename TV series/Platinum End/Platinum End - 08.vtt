WEBVTT

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:10.219
Hey, he's back.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.262
You know, your stalker.

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:15.182
I seriously doubt it's true,

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:17.226
but are you dating Kakehashi?

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.187
What? No, we're not dating.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.106
Yeah, of all people.

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.693
Me and Mirai together?

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.111
I could never fall for him.

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.114
In that case, then you should

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.242
--say something to him.
--It's kind of complicated.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.411
You see, he chased off some
boys from another school

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.247
who were bothering me one time.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.249
So, I don't know quite how to--

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.085
For real? Well, then
that changes everything.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.211
He's not a stalker.

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:46.004
He's more like your bodyguard.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.216
Yeah. I hadn't thought
of it that way.

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:52.219
But you know, that's even
worse, when you think about it.

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.471
He's getting his jollies
hanging around protecting you,

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.223
when you never
even asked him to.

00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:59.268
[Saki] So, what
you're saying is,

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.103
protecting me makes him happy?

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.065
[Revel] What's so
confusing about Saki?

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:07.234
I don't know how she
ended up being chosen.

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:09.444
She seems like a
well-balanced young woman.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.488
How did she lose
all hope to live?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.448
I really don't know.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.450
She wouldn't tell
me when I asked.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.703
So, then why'd you
make her a candidate?

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:22.874
'Cause she tried to
kill herself. [sighs]

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.459
She walked out into
the sea in March,

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.044
when it was still bitterly cold.

00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:30.257
[somber music]

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:39.558
[opening theme music]

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:05.352
[Girl] Goodness, what
happened to your head, Kanade?

00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:07.187
I just slipped on
some stairs and fell.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.814
It's nothing serious,
though, I'm fine.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.440
--Looks hot in those bandages.
--I know.

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:13.235
What? Come on, no way.

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:15.237
Wait a minute.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.406
Could this possibly mean?

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.283
Oh yeah, and I wish for all
ugly girls to disappear.

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:24.413
Rumor has it that
Joso Industries,

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.791
the company Kanade's family
owns, deals in weapons.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.168
Getting a flying suit and
bombing the Grand Tower

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.753
would be easy for him.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.255
Is Kanade Metropoliman?

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.383
What if it turns out he is?

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:38.009
We're not particularly close.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.553
I'm like fish-bait to him.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.181
Just a hanger-on he takes
babe-watching sometimes.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.850
Well, no matter what,

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.185
I'm gonna act like
nothing's changed.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.396
[Mukaido] Since you were
so close to Metropoliman,

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.606
can you describe what
his face looked like?

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.401
Well, uh, he looked
older than me.

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.403
By two or three years, I think.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:59.322
He was pale and had
striking features.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.493
I'd have to say he was
handsome and he smiled at me.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.245
He smiled?

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.913
[Mirai] That's all
I can remember.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.415
I understand.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.041
Do you think you could draw him?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.001
[Mirai] What?

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.002
[Saki] Um?

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.253
Huh?

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:16.423
Sorry to interrupt but I
think that's enough for today.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.675
--Hm?
--[Mukaido sighs]

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.302
I guess you're right.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:21.636
I was hoping for a shortcut,

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.681
but we're gonna have to search
for Metropoliman the hard way.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.224
I'm counting on your help.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.894
Right.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.313
So, then he could be a
high-school student, right?

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.440
If we check out the
high schools one-by-one,

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:34.733
we might get lucky--

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.401
Whoa! You're a very
ambitious person.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.320
Maybe it's because
we have a goal,

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.655
but I think I have fewer
cancer cells every day!

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.449
[Nasse] [giggles]
You may be right!

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:44.409
[Mukaido laughs]

[door hinge squeaking]

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.922
[Saki] Mirai?

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.632
[Mirai gasps]

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.550
You and I need to have a talk.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.303
It has to be tonight.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.640
I want you to sleep in my bed.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.684
[Mirai gasps]

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.145
Huh? Hold on a minute!

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.480
Saki, what's this all about?

00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:15.357
That's a really good idea!

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.776
[Saki] There's something
I really need to tell you.

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:18.777
Huh?

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.321
You don't need to share
a bed just to talk!

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:24.574
True, but I don't think
I'll be able to tell him

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.326
unless we do.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.327
I'd like you both

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.412
to go somewhere else
until the morning.

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:30.705
--What?
--All right!

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.332
Sharing a bed for the first time

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.751
is something special for
a human male and female.

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.920
--Let's go.
--Huh? Wait!

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.964
--Don't get me angry.
--[Revel grunts]

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.717
[Revel] What is Saki thinking?

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.887
[Nasse] I can never tell
what that girl's up to.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.305
[Revel] What? Seriously?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.600
I don't even know when
she's lying to me.

Nanato, did you eat yet?

I'm okay.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.621
What do you go and do every day?

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:14.457
We promised not to keep
secrets from each other.

[inhales sharply]
Even if I told you,

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.337
you wouldn't believe me.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.798
You can't know that
until you tell me.

'Course I do.

[Mukaido] I love you and our
children more than anything.

And because I love you so much,

I'm currently fighting
the forces of evil

who seek to destroy our world.

Am I supposed to believe
you with a straight face

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:51.661
or are you joking? [sighs]

00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:55.415
I'd like you to believe me
with a smile on your face.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.458
Huh?

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.586
I hope you can understand
when I tell you,

every day's a battle.

Did you like that
wall-slap thing?

[Saki] Listen, Mirai.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.659
You need to know. I want to die.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.536
Don't say that.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.497
[Saki] It's okay. I
know how you feel.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:36.957
But, please, just listen.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:39.542
Admitting I want to die

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.045
is the last thing I
should be saying to you.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.672
You've been an
inspiration to me.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.009
[Mirai] I remember.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.804
Listening to you
speak has made me feel

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:53.807
like I have to search
for happiness, as well.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:58.103
[Mirai] After you said that,
I felt like we were allies

--Allies?
--Yeah.

but all I'm doing is
being protected by you.

You're my wings.

I'm literally baggage.

together to save the world.

I want to do everything
I can as a God candidate.

I want to go out and
defend the world,

even if I am a pretty
pathetic fighter.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:38.893
I want to do it for Mukaido
and his kids and the future.

[Saki] You're a
good friend, Mirai.

I wish I could say
the same about myself.

Remember when we were kids?

How our families used
to visit the beach

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.574

Hey everyone! I found
a four-leaf clover!

[Dad] Oh, that means you're
sure to find happiness, Mirai!

[Mirai] Know what?
You can have this one.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.564
[Saki] Really? Are you sure?

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.941
[Mirai] Yeah, you're my
friend, so you should have it.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.944
[gasps] Thanks, Mirai.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.614
Look at that, a yellow ladybug.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.657
He's actually the one
who found the clover.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:37.994
They say ladybugs bless
people with happiness.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.788
You see, Saki, you're
doubly blessed.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.582
A happy yellow ladybug
and a lucky clover.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.584
With those two,
nothing can stop you!

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.753
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.213
--Hey, Mirai.
--Huh?

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.006
I just wanna make sure.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.425
You and I will be
friends forever, right?

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.718
Of course we will.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.429
Then this clover will
always mark our friendship.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.182
Yeah, for you and me.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:04.187
That promise was
everything to me.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.563
It made me happy.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.694
I said we'd be friends forever,
but I broke my promise.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:14.447
Instead of defending
you, I harassed you.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.909
[gasp] Why do you say that?

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.871
[Saki] When your family
died and you were all alone,

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:25.166
not only did I not reach
out, I bullied you.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.751
I went along with the other kids

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.254
and called you Kakehashi Pigsty,

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.006
and when you walked
by, I held my nose.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:33.842
[Boy] You stink!

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.802
[Bully] Don't you
ever take a bath?

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:40.598
[Children] Pigsty, Pigsty,
Pigsty, Pigsty!

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:45.103
[Saki] [sobs] And here I
said we'd be friends forever.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.564
It was so shameful.

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:51.526
[Mirai] Yeah, it was.

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:57.323
[Saki] I went along with
what everyone else was doing,

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:59.450
every time they did it.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.703
I bullied you and tormented you.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.454
It was unforgivable.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.708
I finally reached a day when
I couldn't stand it anymore.

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.209
[Mirai] What day?

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.628
[Saki] The day we graduated
from middle school.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.298
I wanted to go apologize to you.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.842
I thought I'd at least
return your four-leaf clover,

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.093
so I chased after you.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.471
I followed you, but...

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:23.933
[somber music]

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:30.315
I was so scared, I just
wanted to get away.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.693
That was the moment when
Revel made his appearance.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.947
Later, when I learned
you were still alive

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.407
I was so relieved.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:42.952
Since we've been back together

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.371
the things you've said
have stuck in my heart.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.957
[Mirai] I'd rather be bullied

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.709
than be the one
to bully someone.

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:52.921
The only thing I could think was

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.756
you were speaking
directly to me,

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.968
and it finally made me
wonder why I'm even alive.

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.597
I betrayed you.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.728
So, I want you to kill me.

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:18.404
[dramatic music]

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:23.409
Use your white arrow
or even your red one.

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:26.996
Take your revenge and
then be done with me.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.332
Put me out of my misery.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:33.962
I want you to kill
me, Mirai. Please.

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:42.804
[blanket rustling]

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.097
[Saki sighs]

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:45.306
[door rattles]

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.975
--Hey, look there!
--Hm?

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.940
[light beam whooshes]

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.276
Where could they be going?

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:03.241
[wind whistling]

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.994
[Saki] Mirai? [gasps]

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:07.370
[Revel gasps]

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.248
[Saki gasps]

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.916
[gasps] What's he doing?

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:18.006
Mirai, if I want to die,

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.049
you're saying I'll
have to kill myself.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.594
Saki!

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:24.929
--[Saki] Stay back!
--[Revel gasps]

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.768
If you spread your wings
in the sky like that,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.854
the other God
candidates will see you.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:33.855
So, move along.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.815
If you wanna die,
just get on with it.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.066
Nasse!

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.776
He already stopped her
that one time before.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.028
My attitude is,

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.280
if she still wants to
die, just let her go.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:43.948
Looks like you chose badly.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:47.660
[somber music]

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.000
[Saki moans]

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.668
[bonds snapping]

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.254
[somber music]

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.800
--Saki!
--[Saki gasps]

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.011
I was lying.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:09.307
Truth is, I don't want to die.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.976
I really want to live!

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:14.854
I want to be there to
open the door to tomorrow.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.939
I want to help you
and Mr. Mukaido.

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.276
[Saki sobs]

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.905
I'm sorry, Mirai!

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:25.073
I'm so sorry!

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.577
--Can you forgive me?
--[bonds clink]

00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:35.958
You know something?
You're incredible, Mirai.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.252
You say you'd rather
be bullied than bully,

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.046
and that you can't hate people.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:42.632
Things others usually
brush off as lip service.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.510
But you actually
live by those words.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.428
In the presence of
someone like you,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.889
I feel as though I
have to speak the truth

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.558
and the honest truth is that I--

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.228
That's enough.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:56.938
At least let me say this.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:02.068
Please forgive me if you
can and don't send me away.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.778
Let me stay with you!

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:07.949
There's nothing to forgive.

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:13.329
I'm not mad.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.125
[Saki sighs]

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:19.585
Let's do this together.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.506
Just like the time we searched
for that four-leaf clover.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.927
[Saki sighs]

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:30.972
[wings rustling]

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.976
[gentle music]

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:37.353
Thank you, Mirai.

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.980
[Revel] So, right
from the beginning,

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:41.941
you knew Saki was lying
about wanting to die.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.986
Nope. It was a revelation.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:48.739
I think Saki only just
realized how she truly feels.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.992
If anyone was lying
here, it was Mirai.

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:51.993
What?

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.411
Come on now.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:55.371
It's obvious he would have
saved her if she'd fallen.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.126
[Revel] They ended up
sleeping in separate beds.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.127
[Nasse] They sure did.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:05.965
All right, here's
what we've learned

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.092
about Metropoliman so far.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.303
He's between 15 and 20 years old

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:13.806
and he's about 175 centimeters
tall, pale and handsome.

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:16.517
An analysis of
the pieces of mask

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:17.977
he left behind at the tower

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.188
shows his blood
type is B-negative,

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:22.982
and the police don't
have his DNA on file.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.358
You've already seen the records?

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.652
Did you check the
hospital emergency rooms?

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.446
Hey, that's a good idea.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.198
I still have a
private eye available,

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.074
who I shot with a red arrow.

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.201
I'll call him.

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.243
We should also investigate

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:37.038
any surgeons who've died
over the past two days.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:40.374
If it becomes necessary
I can use my red arrow.

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.043
Just let me know if you need it.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.837
What happened to her?

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.131
Mirai, you should draw what
you saw under his mask,

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.424
as soon as you can.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.968
Huh? Uh, sure.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.596
Also, this room is starting
to feel a little cramped.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.806
I think we should
relocate to a larger space

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.975
that'd be a more suitable
base of operations.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.018
Huh?

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.480
This morning, I used
two of my red arrows

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.024
and shot my parents, so
I can live on my own.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.025
[Mirai gasps]

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.027
So anyway, for our new place,

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.654
what do you think about this?

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.072
I know it's a little unusual.

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:14.075
[Mukaido] A church? Gotta
say it doesn't look too bad.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.494
Since it's the entire top
floor of a high-rise condo,

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.829
we wouldn't have to worry
about coming or going.

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.915
--Wow.
--That's beautiful.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.208
The angels are more
excited than we are.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.876
[Nasse] Well, it
is a little cramped

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.044
with all of us in here.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.798
True, at least I'll be
finishing up our costumes soon.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.591
I'm deciding on the
colors and shapes,

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:32.885
so we can easily
recognize each other.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.303
Costumes, huh?

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.225
If I can choose my own color
I'd like it to be yellow.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.685
[Mukaido] Really? Why yellow?

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:45.189
Because I've always felt
it's the color of happiness.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.485
Also, Baret, there's
something I'd like to ask you.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.736
All right.

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:52.655
I'd like a pair
of wings, as well.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:55.116
[everyone gasps]

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.117
[Kanade] He didn't attempt

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.910
to use his white
arrow even once.

00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.912
Of course, to be more
accurate, he couldn't.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:01.747
Unlike the red arrow,
there's no limit

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.333
to the number of times a
white arrow can be used.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.835
Which has to mean,

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:08.838
this guy has a first-rank
angel behind him.

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:11.257
It also means the
idiot who charged at me

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.717
has a special-rank angel.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.218
He could have killed
me with a white arrow,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.846
but tried taking me
alive with a red.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.307
What do you propose we do now?

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:22.476
Well, since I've accumulated
all these red arrows,

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.604
I think I can root
these people out.

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.774
You want to possess
your own pair of wings?

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.192
To do that, you
have to take them

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.111
from a dead God candidate.

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.780
There are several
paths to do that.

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:38.200
The first option is, you can
kill a God candidate yourself.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.327
Second, you can shoot

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.203
a dying God candidate
with a red arrow,

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:44.123
making you first in line to
receive that person's wings.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.917
Third, you can be given
them by a God candidate

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.461
who used methods one or two

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.297
to acquire the wings
in the first place.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.674
The best solution would
be to kill Metropoliman,

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:55.843
then we'd be able to
give his wings to Saki.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.136
In fact, we could take back

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.347
all the wings and
arrows he's acquired.

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:00.931
Yes, that's correct.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.559
And finally, fourth.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.519
If a God candidate
dies from an illness,

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.188
an accident, or suicide,

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:08.481
you can ask the angel

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:09.732
transporting their
body to Heaven,

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.400
to give you their wings.

00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:13.402
Those are all the methods.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.990
In other words, you'll
need to be right by my side

00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:20.201
when my cancer does me in.

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:21.577
Don't joke about that.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:25.373
That's the last thing I'd want.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:27.541
Yes, I want to
defeat Metropoliman.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.168
But I want to be able
to do it together,

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.503
with the two of you.

00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:32.546
I want to be able to
fly like you both do,

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.382
so I can help accomplish that.

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:36.759
Sure, I didn't mean to imply--

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.344
Receiving your
wings after you die

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.304
certainly isn't going
to make me happy

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:43.349
and I don't want to just
be protected, either.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.352
I want us to work together
so we can achieve our goal

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.854
and eventually find happiness.

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:49.897
Saki.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.776
I get the message

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.903
and I'm delighted
to hear you say it.

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:58.989
She's a completely
different person.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.658
Did something happen yesterday?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.243
Sort of, yeah.

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:07.331
I know it's surprising but
maybe this is the real Saki.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.292
[gasps] Listen here!

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:14.171
There's a much easier way for
Saki to acquire her wings.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.214
How?

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:18.384
I just need to become
a first-rank angel.

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.220
Hey, you know,
you're right, Revel.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.389
That is a great idea!

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:24.432
Is it possible?

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:27.393
Baret, I'll bow down
and swallow my pride.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:30.688
Tell me what I must do
to become first-rank.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.899
He's so proud. I can't
believe he's doing this.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:34.942
Revel.

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:38.237
There are no formal
rules or tests

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.030
for an angel to be promoted.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.323
The basic qualification

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:44.285
is that they have to be
exceptional in some way.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:45.327
I see.

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:48.873
What if I were to acquire more
knowledge than you, Baret?

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.002
That would probably work.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.211
What? Really?

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.838
[Saki] But if you did that,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.382
then Baret wouldn't be the
Angel of Knowledge anymore.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:20:59.884
It's not a problem.

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:01.594
I mean, I've already
been demoted once,

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.846
from special-rank to first-rank.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.222
It's more realistic, actually,

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.433
that Revel could advance
from second-rank,

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:08.851
all the way to special-rank.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:11.061
Special-rank? I'll do it!

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.647
Yeah! When you're
special-rank like me,

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.316
you'll even get a white arrow!

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:18.527
[Mirai] So, Saki will
be special-rank, too?

00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:21.489
But it's not guaranteed
to work 100%.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.324
Don't forget,
there are no rules.

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.368
They say it's often
determined by God's whims.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.953
So, good luck, Revel.

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.371
All right!

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.293
Here you go.

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:36.253
It's for taking your medicine.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.255
You're very kind, Nanaka.

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.840
Not as kind as you, Daddy.

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.300
Huh? Why's that?

00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:44.512
'Cause you're making special
clothes for my piano recital.

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.263
Three outfits!

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.265
That's right, and
they're almost done.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.725
I hope you like 'em.

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.685
Thanks. I can't wait.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:54.563
But, I'm too young
for a wedding dress.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:57.525
[Mukaido coughs]

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:58.776
You saw that?

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:01.946
I'm sorry. I went
into your room.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.572
But, Daddy, we don't know

00:22:03.614 --> 00:22:05.908
how big I'm gonna grow up to be.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.327
Shouldn't you wait until
I'm in middle school?

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.957
[Mukaido sighs]

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.209
You know what?

00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:17.503
You're right, sweetie.

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:19.380
Daddy wasn't thinking clearly.

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:21.966
I'm just so excited to see
you grow up and get married,

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.300
I couldn't help myself.

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.886
I got started on your
dress a little bit early.

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:27.972
You're a silly goose.

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:28.973
It's okay, though.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.349
I'll just have to grow up big

00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:32.768
so I can fit into
that dress one day.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.021
And once I'm wearing it,
I'll be the perfect bride.

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:38.649
[Mukaido sighs]

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:43.737
Daddy, you're squeezing
so hard, I can't breathe.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.073
[Aya sobs]

00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:49.451
[somber music]

[door thuds]

[somber music]

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:04.550
[Mukaido sobs]

00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:12.076
Why? Who are you?

00:24:12.326 --> 00:24:14.745
Why are you here?
What do you want?

00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:18.916
