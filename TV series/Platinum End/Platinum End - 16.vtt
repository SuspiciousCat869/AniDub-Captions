[ominous music]

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:13.263
Listen, everyone!

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:16.934
I, Susumu Yuito,
recommend Red to be God.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.936
I saw him with my own two eyes,

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.146
risking his life
without hesitation

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.731
to save millions of people.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.027
He has a clear sense of justice,

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.821
and he had the courage
to take on Metropoliman.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.991
So I think he's definitely the
best candidate for the job!

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.620
Red is my hero.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:38.413
I want him to become God.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.709
I bet you're watching
this, aren't you, Red?

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.588
I've been hoping for a while
that he'd just come out

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.465
and say he wanted to become God,

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:50.342
but even if he
doesn't show himself,

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.427
the other God candidates
could still come forward.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.929
We could get
together and discuss

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.306
who we think is the right
one for the position.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:57.349
[Nasse giggles]

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:58.517
This is insane.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.851
[Nasse] It's a child's solution,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.770
but I don't think
it's a bad idea.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.063
[Revel] It's usually a trap

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:04.856
when someone says
to come forward.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.026
We should get as many people
as possible to go out there,

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.529
look for those God
candidates, and identify them.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.823
We need to choose
that next God soon.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.866
Otherwise, who knows
what could happen?

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:19.538
And we won't be able to
stop worrying about it.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.499
[giggling] I love it.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.876
I totally agree
with you, Susumu.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.461
If he's as nice a
guy as they say,

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.631
then I think Red should
become the next God, too.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:32.217
[Yazeli] So you're
supporting him as well?

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.553
[chuckles] He's a hero
of justice, right?

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:37.055
I'm sure he appreciates
beautiful women.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.891
Tell me, Yazeli, do former
God candidates get any kind

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.476
of special consideration at all

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.395
after a new God has been chosen?

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:45.772
Depends entirely
on the next God.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.442
It's possible he could make
it so that the God candidates

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.028
and the selection process
never even existed.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.571
That's right, I forgot!

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.698
God can do anything
he wants, right?

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.325
This should be interesting.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.788
So the hunt is on to track
down the God candidates.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.963
[opening theme music]

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:36.258
[energizing music begins]

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.509
This is unexpected.

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:40.220
It sounds like this boy
wants you to become God.

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.974
If all the remaining God
candidates get together

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.685
and nominate Mirai,
is the process over?

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:49.312
While it's necessary to
have everyone's support,

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:52.274
it's essential for the
candidate to want to become God.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.402
And of course, you can't
use a Red Arrow on them

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.154
to make them say they do.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.156
But if you threaten to kill
them with a White Arrow

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.033
unless they accept the job and
they give in to your demands,

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.201
then that's fine.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.579
--What? Really?
--Nasse...

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.039
[Nasse] What? Did I say
something out of line?

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.751
--Hold on.
--Huh?

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.462
Even though this boy seems
open about everything,

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.380
there's something
he hasn't mentioned.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.093
The fact is, he
possesses a White Arrow.

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.014
[energizing music continues]

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.725
[Yumiki] Sakura TV has
agreed to assist us.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:27.768
We're ready to go.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.562
Let's move it.

--[phone buzzing]
--Oh, give me just a minute.

This is Iida.

I showed his face on TV,

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.403
so I really need to
apologize right away.

[Staff] Akai, the police are
on their way up to the roof.

without tipping him off.

Listen, uh, Susumu?

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.751
[Susumu] Hmm? What is it?

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:57.506
I was just wondering, why
have you chosen to, uh...

--[energizing music ends]
--[explosion rumbling]

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:08.266
[sighs] I told you to look
for the other God candidates.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.894
Instead, you make a stupid
attempt to capture me.

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:13.313
I gotta tell you, it's
very disappointing.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.232
Hey, make this easy on everybody

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.025
and just do what I said, okay?

[Akai] I, I've never
seen anything like it!

He just vanished.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:31.706
Oh, great. Now everyone knows
about the God candidates.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.417
We're gonna be hunted.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:35.460
This isn't good.

Well, that doesn't
sound too good.

What's the matter?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.182
[Minamikawa] Uh, nothing.

I don't know what this talk
is about God candidates.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.188
It seems crazy.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.108
According to Susumu, Tonma
Rodriguez made women love him

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.694
using a Red Arrow and was
killed by Metropoliman

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.445
using a White Arrow.

[Announcer] Oh, so
that's what happened.

you're a God candidate, too.

[Minamikawa] Was
that guy watching me?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.236
Is he a government
agent or something?

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:46.031
Is it because I was
friends with Kanade?

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.910
[sighs] I'm sure certain
countries would love

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.828
to get their hands
on these people.

Targeted assassinations
would be a breeze with them.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.960
It's obvious to everyone
if God candidates do exist,

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.046
they could immediately
replace nuclear weapons

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.756
as the ultimate deterrent.

Truthfully, Mirai, I wish we
could stay like this forever.

about it online.

all of us down.

on my mind a lot.

what he would've done

in this situation.

He wouldn't run, so
I won't run, either.

I'll stand up and live my life.

happiness lies down that path.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.904
Are you pointing an Arrow at me?

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.449
Tell me, is it Red or White?

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.952
Do I fall in love,
or does it kill me?

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.121
If you remove the Arrow,

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.873
do the feelings of
love then vanish?

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:26.501
[tense music]

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.169
I must tell you,

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.797
we're also making contact
with Saki Hanakago.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.395
Saki!

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.942
She just suddenly came up to me.

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.112
Talk to me, Yumiki.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.155
Have you been shot?

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.325
At this moment, who
do you love the most?

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:10.587
I'm sorry.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:16.134
I can't lie, the one I love
the most is Saki Hanakago.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.595
Impressive.

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:21.556
Yumiki's my loyal subordinate,

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.601
but we also promised to
spend our lives together.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:28.438
Outside of work, we have respect
and trust for one another.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.107
She'll be back to
normal after 33 days.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.692
It's no problem.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.528
This just confirms
Susumu wasn't lying.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.988
[Mirai] You mean
you actually believe

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.865
everything Susumu said?

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.533
Yes, of course.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.785
Much of the world may
not believe him yet,

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.621
but we've been conducting
an investigation

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.039
and gathering evidence.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.335
Be careful. You're
being targeted.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.921
Other nations have
already begun to act,

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.214
and so has this one.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.384
Wait, who in the world are you?

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:04.432
I'm Masaya Hoshi, and
I want to help you.

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:05.767
[Mirai] In what way?

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.853
People haven't identified
you as God candidates yet,

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:11.356
but it's only a matter
of time before they do.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.108
I'm able to protect you.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.362
I understand why
you're being cautious.

00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:22.075
But think about it.

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:24.786
You both can use your
Wings to flee at any point.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.333
The police have been
ordered by the government

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.960
to capture God
candidates wherever

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:33.670
we're able to find them.

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.546
Yumiki was the one
who figured out

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.132
that the two of you were
actually Red and Yellow.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.051
But other than the two of us,

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.844
nobody else on the
investigation knows.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.889
You've gotten this far.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.975
What do you plan to do with us?

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:49.602
--I need your powers.
--Our powers?

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:51.688
I've been given orders

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.898
to track down the
remaining God candidates.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.359
It's obvious to me I'm
going to need your help

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:57.402
to accomplish that.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:03.616
Why should we help you?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:04.867
I mean, think about it.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.953
We have no way of knowing
if you really intend

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.246
to protect these people.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.540
I'll say it again.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:12.875
Investigators and spies
from every country

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.169
in the world are coming for you.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.921
Especially you.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.715
And do you want to know why?

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.592
Because so far,
Red is the only one

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.511
confirmed to have a White Arrow,

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.929
and with that kind of power,

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.973
all manner of scenarios
become possible.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:29.767
You're a lethal weapon.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.270
The world's greatest assassin.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.522
[grim music]

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:38.735
You're a much more attractive
option than nuclear weapons,

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:40.862
and that's why everyone
wants to find you.

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.407
[Mirai breathing shakily]

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.743
The power to kill people
with a flick of your wrist

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.162
could cause a global crisis.

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.955
I want to prevent that.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:52.999
If you're captured, it's over.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.251
Some countries would think
nothing of brainwashing you

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.588
and then turning you into
a robotic killing machine.

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:01.966
And this country would,
too, believe it or not.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:06.846
--[Mirai panting]
--[chilling music]

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.932
[Mirai] A lethal weapon.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:16.856
[Mirai breathing heavily]

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:25.490
I will never become
a weapon. Not ever.

00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:34.957
We have cameras installed
all around here.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.334
Our security's airtight.

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:40.797
I want you both to hole
up here for a while.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:55.770
[phone buzzing]

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:56.854
Hello?

00:14:58.606 --> 00:14:59.607
No, sir.

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.568
I still haven't found them.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:05.696
Understood.

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:09.575
We have to report in, Yumiki.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.702
No, you go ahead.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.538
I want to stay here with Saki.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.125
Ms. Yumiki, please go with him.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.461
[Yumiki] Okay, Ms. Saki.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.672
If you say to go, I will.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.924
I presume this is the
Red Arrow's effect?

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.552
[Yumiki] Destroy the
phones you've been using

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.637
up until now and
use these instead.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.890
They'll keep your call history
and location info secure.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.225
Is this necessary?

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.562
Yumiki is in a state of rapture.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.856
She'll feel better
if you stay here.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:41.691
We won't be back until tonight.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.359
It's safer if you
avoid going out

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:46.237
until we're around to
offer some protection.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.280
[cat meows]

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:49.866
What do you think?

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:50.908
Are they for real?

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.286
It's hard to tell.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.913
But if they wanted
to capture us,

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.707
why would they leave us here?

00:15:57.748 --> 00:16:00.001
I mean, we could walk
right out the door.

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:02.587
--True.
--[cat meowing]

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.338
It's kind of interesting.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.257
When Yumiki was hit
with your Red Arrow,

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.551
Hoshi didn't seem
to be that upset.

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:10.720
It's almost like he
wanted her to be shot.

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.889
Then we'd see his
reaction and trust him.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.849
[cat purring]

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.767
[Saki] I'll admit, when
they first showed up

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.770
and forced us to come
here, I was scared of them.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.481
But I can sense the happy life

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:23.983
that they've built
together in this apartment.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.776
I have to tell you, Mirai,

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.862
I don't think they're
trying to trick us.

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.490
What do you think, Nasse?

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:33.326
Well, I can tell you
that guy wasn't lying.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:35.495
And besides, he might
be able to provide us

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:36.996
with a lot of information.

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.124
[Mirai] I guess so.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.793
I thought you told
me you were going

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.545
to be able to identify
Red and Yellow

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.506
by analyzing the
footage we recovered.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.050
Yumiki can explain
what happened.

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:50.635
The problem's the video.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.802
It's coded to interfere

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.721
with current facial
detection systems.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:55.806
We can't identify
the people on it.

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:58.559
We're being forced to
analyze the images manually.

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.561
I see. Well, keep at it.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.939
[Hoshi] Even so, I wouldn't
be too worried, sir.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.981
Huh?

00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:07.193
None of these people are
targeting government officials.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.280
That was a very
plausible-sounding

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:12.865
excuse you came up with.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:16.244
I cannot allow Ms. Saki to
be placed in harm's way.

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.455
[Hoshi] I've never
seen a look like this

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:21.290
in Yumiki's eyes before.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.626
This is the power of
the God candidates.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:25.795
No wonder they're such targets.

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:28.506
An ability like this
shouldn't exist unchecked.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.758
Nobody should be
allowed to acquire it.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.678
[phone buzzing]

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:34.720
Hoshi here.

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.723
[Hoshi gasps]

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:44.313
We've talked and
decided to help you.

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:47.066
We'll tell you everything,
everything that we know.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.193
--Are you sure?
--Yes.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.987
[Hoshi] I appreciate it.

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:53.990
I was told that a God
candidate was just captured.

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.241
[Mirai and Saki gasp]

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:58.327
I want to find the rest
as quickly as possible.

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:00.371
Give us as much
detail as you can.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.542
--So that's everything.
--Mmm.

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.878
The more we hear about
the candidates' abilities,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.672
the more complicated they sound.

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:12.049
I'll get us something to drink.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.052
[Hoshi] Apparently, only
people who wanted to die

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.847
were chosen to be
God candidates.

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:19.348
This boy has acquired Wings

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.309
that practically
allow him to teleport

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.685
and a White Arrow

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.729
that can kill an unlimited
number of people.

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.273
It's terrifying.

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:30.901
Mirai could become even more
of a danger than I thought.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:34.322
However, he's never shot
anyone with his White Arrow.

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.409
No matter how
desperate the situation

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:42.204
in which he finds himself,
he still values human life.

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.206
I can't let him become a weapon.

00:18:44.248 --> 00:18:46.167
He has his whole
life ahead of him.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.003
So according to
what you told us,

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.547
since Yumiki has now been
shot with a Red Arrow,

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.550
she could actually be given
Wings and Arrows herself?

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.761
That's true, but I'm
not really comfortable

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:57.928
giving her an Arrow.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.889
How do you feel about Wings?

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.350
If she can only be given
them in the 33 days

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:04.268
she's under the effects
of the Red Arrow,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.562
we should use that
time effectively.

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:10.107
And importantly, it would allow
her to interact with angels.

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.567
I would like to see them.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.402
[Revel] She can't go
against Saki's wishes,

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:15.071
but it'd make the search easier.

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:16.197
[Nasse] That's true.

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:19.659
[Saki exhales]

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.701
[Saki] All right.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:32.296
--[Yumiki gasps]
--[celestial music]

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.298
[Yumiki] I can see them!

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.050
Two creatures with Wings!

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.052
Can't you just call us angels?

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.055
Hi, I'm Nasse,
and this is Revel.

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.933
Their names are Nasse and Revel.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.395
[Yumiki gasping]

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.980
That's amazing. It's too bad.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.691
I wish I could see them, too.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:52.942
But we can't waste the Arrows

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:54.902
in the event that
we need them later.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.530
Can I ask the angels a question?

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.823
Sure, go ahead.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.741
They say you can
ask your question.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.245
Exactly who or what are you?

00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:07.832
Sorry, but we can't
reveal that yet.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.625
For now, angels are angels.

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:11.502
They say angels are angels.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:14.797
I see. Sorry about that.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.882
I didn't mean to ask
a stupid question.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.178
Take a look at what our
investigation has turned up.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.139
You're very thorough.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.474
You have quite a
dossier on Metropoliman.

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.563
I have to correct you here.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:32.898
Mimi Yamada was never
a God candidate.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.067
She was given a Red
Arrow by Metropoliman.

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:36.777
[Hoshi] Ah, I see.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.864
[Mirai] Is this the person you
said was captured recently?

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:41.657
[Hoshi] That's right.

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:43.492
She was the first
candidate to surface

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:46.746
after Susumu Yuito's
statement was broadcast.

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:48.497
Her name is Yuri Temari.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.791
She's an unemployed
23-year-old woman.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.669
There are two more
God candidates

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.796
who haven't been located yet.

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:57.548
Wonder who they are.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.259
[Hoshi] We'll begin searching
for them tomorrow morning.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:04.889
The world's experiencing
unprecedented chaos right now:

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.559
wars, famine, abnormal
weather on a global scale.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:11.020
We've reached the point where
the ingenuity of humanity

00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:13.105
simply isn't enough
to fix everything.

00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:15.733
When I become God, I promise
that every single person

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:18.068
on this planet will
find happiness!

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:23.365
--Huh?
--[dramatic music]

00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.075
[Mitsuno gasps]

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.243
[car screeching]

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.120
Wasn't someone there just now?

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:29.622
How'd he disappear?

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.958
[Mirai] Hmm. Doesn't look like
he's a God candidate to me.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:36.253
[Susumu] What do you know
about this person, Mr. Hoshi?

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.671
Mizukiyo Minamikawa.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.090
There was a tweet tagged
with #Godcandidate

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:43.177
that said he suddenly
acquired a cute girlfriend.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:45.346
That's not unusual,
but it is interesting

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.848
that he was Kanade
Uryu's classmate.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.099
Right.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.559
[Mirai] Look at this.

00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:53.395
The Nakaumi brothers are
middle school students.

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:55.606
In the past three months, their
parents, their grandfather,

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.817
and three of their friends
died, one after another.

00:21:57.858 --> 00:22:01.570
[Hoshi] Mmm. Too many people
around them are dying.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.697
--Listen, Ms. Yumiki.
--Yes?

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:08.369
[Saki] I'm thinking you might
need a Red Arrow after all.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.163
[birds chirping]

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.332
You sure you don't
want me to come in?

00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:15.251
[Sayuri] No, I don't
wanna have to go

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:17.211
through a whole
number with my mother.

00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:18.921
Happy to introduce myself.

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:20.714
That would be so embarrassing.

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:21.924
[Minamikawa] Embarrassing?

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.467
Oh, no, I didn't
mean it like that!

00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:24.718
I'm not embarrassed of you!

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.970
I just don't know
how she'd react

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.930
if she found out I
was dating someone.

00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:33.102
Later, boyfriend.

00:22:35.396 --> 00:22:37.481
Boyfriend? All right!

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:39.024
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:41.360
Oh?

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:43.571
[sinister music]

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:47.992
