Nasse, let him go!

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:20.229
What are you doing?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.688
If I run, Saki's dead!

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.023
You aren't running, Mirai!

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.236
If you die, it really
will be all over.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:30.072
I can't go along with that,
even if you're okay with it.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:33.659
Choosing to die is the
same as committing suicide.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.035
You said it yourself, Mirai.

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:37.079
It's the most miserable
way a person can die.

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:42.876
Nasse?

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.880
It appears Muni was
right all along.

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:47.923

--Are you all right?
--It's Nasse!

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.734
[Nasse] I'm really
sorry, Mirai...

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.736
As of this moment

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.947
I've been demoted

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:13.073
to second-rank.

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:22.958
[opening theme music]

[Yazeli] Second-rank?

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:48.669
I'm afraid so.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.504
When your candidate's
about to fail to become God

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:53.965
and then you intervene,
that's the penalty you pay.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.968
[Nasse] My capabilities
have now been restricted.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.179
Because I've been
demoted to second-rank,

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:02.015
I can only give you
a Red Arrow or Wings.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.519
Please choose which of those

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.645
you'd like to keep.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.981
It's either Wings,
or a Red Arrow?

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.026
Without your Wings, you
can't evade Yoneda's attacks.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.070
Give up your Red Arrow.

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:16.988
If I do that, you and Ms. Yumiki

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.157
will immediately lose
your Wings and Arrows.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.159
You need to worry
about yourself!

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.078
You're a God
candidate, you know!

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.830
I don't need to fly anymore.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.167
Nasse, I'll keep my Red Arrow.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:30.961
Very well.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.337
I shall now take the rings

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.172
for both your White
Arrow and Wings.

Sorry, Mirai.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:50.105
Apparently you'll die if
I save you one more time.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.067
[Yoneda] This is working
out better than I thought.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.820
Things can now proceed
according to plan.

00:03:56.862 --> 00:04:00.031
Not only has Red lost the White
Arrow he needs to kill me,

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.117
now he can't even
fly by himself.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.037
Tell me, Nakaumi, have
you killed Yellow?

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.457
No, sir, not yet.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:09.499
Good.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.004
Hoshi, release Red.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:17.507
If you don't do it, I really
will kill Yellow this time.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.011
--What's going on?
--Red's as good as dead.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.805
--If he runs, Yellow will die.
--So that's it.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.056
He hasn't got any choice.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.057
Come on.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.100
Please put me down.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.101
I can't.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.227
You know as well as I do,

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.063
Yoneda will kill you
the moment that happens.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.274
I won't stand there
and watch you die.

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:36.568
[Mirai] Then set me down
and fly off somewhere.

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:39.112
Don't do this.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.447
[Nakaumi] If Red takes off,

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:43.283
I have to shoot Yellow
with my White Arrow.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:44.659
But that won't happen.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.496
The professor is sure to kill
Red in the next few minutes.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.122
What if he doesn't, though?

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.540
I don't need to think.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.126
I just need to follow the
professor's instructions.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.629
All the God candidates
have to die.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.255
I guess at this point,

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.217
all you can do is pray that
Mr. Hoshi puts Red down, right?

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.093
That's not true at all.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.013
The fact of the matter is,
I don't want Red to die,

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.141
even if it means my own death.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.226
I'm jealous.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:12.062
Just how deeply attached
are you two lovebirds?

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.148
However, I don't
want to die, either.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.692
I want to live and be happy.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.361
Mirai feels the same way.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.697
His whole goal in life is
to live and find happiness.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.324
I learned that from him.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:25.700
And if we're in sync on that,

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:29.371
then I assume he must also
have a strong desire to live.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.747
Shut up!

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.583
At this moment, it doesn't
matter if you both want to live!

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.962
Listen, Nakaumi, you can't
take somebody's life.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.088
What are you talking about?

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.340
He's already taken
plenty of lives.

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.509
Those people all wanted to die.

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.636
He hasn't killed anyone
who wants to live.

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.096
Hold on a minute!

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.139
Don't forget, the professor
shot him with a Red Arrow!

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.559
That means, if he's told to
kill somebody, he's gonna do it!

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.185
--He won't.
--What?

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.979
[Saki] If you use a
Red Arrow on someone

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.190
and tell them to die,
they still have to want to.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.401
And since Nakaumi gives
more consideration

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.028
to the lives of others
than to his own,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.363
killing someone
who wants to live

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.615
would be extremely
difficult for him.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.076
That's because
Nakaumi's a kind boy.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.787
In the end, he just
wanted to help people

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.372
who were suffering.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:15.542
He did it by using his Red Arrow
on people who sought death,

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:16.918
and showing them the way.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.253
[Nakaumi] Shut up!

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:20.171
If you don't stop talking,
I'll kill all of you!

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.214
Do it.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.135
Go ahead, kill me, even
though I don't want to die.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.345
Kill me and tell the professor

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.598
you didn't hesitate
to follow his orders.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.517
Then, at the very least,
Mirai won't have to die.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.560
Saki!

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.107
Fine.

Are you ready?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.207
Mirai, think about this.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.002
Even if Saki dies, you'll
eventually get over it.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:00.837
[Nasse gasps]

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.047
Don't make me say it again.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.257
I won't allow Saki to die,

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.343
just because I said
I'd become God.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.012
There's no way I'll ever
be able to find happiness

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.555
if I get Saki killed.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.973
No way at all?

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.350
[Mirai] Absolutely.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.644
All right, then, tell
me this, is dying here

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.938
the thing that would make
you happiest right now?

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.483
No, it wouldn't, not at all.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.444
But Saki dying
would be even worse.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.404
And since I can't
think of a way out,

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.490
it's the better
of my two options.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.159
That's awful.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:33.745
I'm sorry.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.665
The reason I came here
in the first place

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.292
was to make you happy, but
it looks like I failed.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.253
It's all right.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.216
The fact is, I got to experience
happiness lots of times,

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.051
all because you saved my life.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.013
How long are you going to
keep nattering up there?

Don't tell me I have
to start a countdown.

Mr. Hoshi, do you
understand now?

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:58.937
Yes, Mirai.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:27.090
So...

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.471
Goodbye, kid.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.435
[Mirai] I could deflect his

then shoot him with it.

No, that won't work, I
don't have Wings anymore.

I fail to pull it off,

[Announcer] In a surprise move,

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.362
the God candidates who
were dismissed earlier,

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.781
have now returned!

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.078
What's going on here?

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.248
Even though you shot this
boy with a Red Arrow,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.417
Nakaumi can't kill
people who want to live.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:48.379
Yoneda, you've gone to
such extreme lengths

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.881
to avoid interacting
with people.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.424
You appear to lack the ability

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.259
to understand how others feel.

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.805
Professor, I'm sorry.

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.723
I may be capable
of a mutual kill

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.600
to prevent the birth
of the creature,

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:03.978
but I'm not able to eliminate
the other God candidates.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.230
Mutual kill?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.400
They intended to kill
all the God candidates.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.569
Then they were going
to kill each other.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.613
That way, no new
God would be born.

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.409
I expected this.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.996
And I've prepared a plan
for this exact scenario.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.456
To start, I'll be taking back

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.625
that White Arrow
I gave you, Nakaumi.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.880
What's the matter?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.091
--[Mirai gasps]
--Die!

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:36.803
Professor!

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:41.474
What the?

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.393
Nasse, why did you interfere?

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.895
If the professor dies, we win!

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.565
[Woman] Huh, did the professor
almost die just then?

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.441
[Man] He did vanish
for a second.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.110
Then he reappeared
off to the side.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.447
The truth is,

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.741
you don't want the professor
to die, right Mirai?

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.119
Nasse.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.329
Wait a minute, didn't
you say Mirai would die

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:05.540
if you touched a God
candidate to save them?

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:06.583
What's going on?

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.129
[Nasse gasps]

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.469
Mirai, look!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.722
I've been restored
to special-rank!

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.100
I see, the difference
this time is,

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.603
it wasn't Nasse's own God
candidate who was saved.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.147
Which means she got promoted
back to her old rank,

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.857
instead of being
demoted further.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.151
Honestly, it seems like
everything Nasse does

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.736
is unprecedented.

00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.279
Here, you get 'em back.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.072
Your Wings and
White Arrow, Mirai.

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.158
Thanks, but I don't need them.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.661
Amazing, I would've
died just now

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.414
if that angel hadn't
swooped in and saved me.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.541
[Announcer]
Professor Yoneda said

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:49.876
"I would've died just now

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.045
if that angel hadn't
swooped in and saved me."

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.046
What angel?

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:54.631
[Man] So he really
did almost die.

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:55.465
[Woman] By a White Arrow?

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:57.467
--Did Red do it?
--No.

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:58.843
I think it was Ms. Temari.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:04.557
[Yoneda] I guess an angel saved
my life for a second time.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.393
Nakaumi, why did you betray me?

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.521
I didn't, professor.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.732
I still think you're
right about this.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.108
He's telling the truth.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.653
I kinda tricked him into
giving me his White Arrow.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.242
[dramatic music]

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.085
[Saki] Nakaumi?

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:34.587
I can't kill you.

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.172
[Saki] Thank you.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:39.592
[Temari] Get these
things off of me.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.511
All right, she did
it, that was close.

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:43.137
[Yumiki] We need
to get back there.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.889
Hold on, before we go...

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.766
Sorry, but I don't trust you.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.559
So let me hold on
to your White Arrow.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.770
It'll be better for
everyone involved.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.151
I continue to think
you're right, Professor.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.570
But we have to remember
that it's just a thought.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:01.948
An idea.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.992
People still have
freedom of choice.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.952
They can decide how much stock

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.954
they're willing to
put in your theory.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.039
I decided if someone
wanted to live

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.375
then it would be wrong
for me to end their life,

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.419
for someone else's ideas.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.753
[Yoneda] Ever since I identified

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.922
myself as a God candidate,

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:21.342
no, ever since I
gained media exposure,

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:23.553
I've been prepared to die.

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:26.556
You're prepared to die just
'cause people saw your face?

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:27.765
I can't get any followers,

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:31.144
even though I'm always promoting
myself on social media.

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.396
Oh, did you lose female fans?

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:34.480
The professor just wants

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.649
to conduct his
research undisturbed.

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:39.861
Are you saying that's a problem
unique to genius scholars?

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:40.862
Yes, it is.

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.822
[Yoneda] There's no
such thing as a genius.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:43.823
Hm?

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.908
I realize now, I've been a fool.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.872
What you call genius never
describes the person themselves.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.708
It actually refers to the
person's achievements.

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:57.754
It's foolish to assume someone
is capable of something,

00:13:57.795 --> 00:13:59.213
while criticizing them

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.799
for not making the
attempt to follow through.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.259
That's completely true!

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.845
I get pissed off when people
expect me to do something

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.055
just because I can!

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.598
It should be my decision!

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.392
That's actually a valid
interpretation, Temari.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.769
You should remember this.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.438
That which is truly
omnipotent and evil

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.858
doesn't show itself, it's
effective no matter what.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.693
You're kind of
arrogant, professor.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.028
It's hard to agree with you

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.031
when you use phrases
like remember this.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.657
It's just bluster.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.284
It's a manner of
speaking I adopted

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.453
over my years as a
professor emeritus,

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.705
I'm not even aware
when I'm doing it.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.457
A foolish trait of mine.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:37.043
Professor, there's no way
you're a foolish person.

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:38.795
You've achieved
important things!

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.505
That makes you a genius.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:41.798
He's won the Nobel Prizes

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.258
for Literature and
Physics, you know.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.511
And I hear he's about to
win the one for Medicine.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:47.720
I just read that his books

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.680
have sold over a
billion copies so far.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.641
That's proof enough.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.352
[crowd murmuring]

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.775
[Yoneda] I have to admit,
all of you are right.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.111
Because I avoided
interacting with others,

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:05.696
I don't understand
how people feel.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.073
I have no-one to love.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.283
I substituted my
lack of experience,

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.327
with papers on psychology,

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.497
and pretended to understand
what I was talking about.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.916
I am a fool, and also a coward.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:21.838
Obviously, I shouldn't have
gotten involved with you.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:25.258
The way I went about it was
wrong from the beginning.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.884
The false angels before me

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.679
should more appropriately
be called demons.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.265
I never got around
to killing myself.

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:33.850
Muni convinced me I could reveal

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:36.561
the workings of the
God selection process,

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.147
and expose the
truth to humanity.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:41.524
So I became a God candidate.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.109
I couldn't resist
getting involved

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.527
after seeing all of you.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:46.529
Nothing's changed, though.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.781
Now is the time for
humanity to accept the fact

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:51.742
that there is no 'God'
in the traditional sense.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.786
I need that acknowledged...

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.830
That alone will satisfy me.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.418
Then you can do with
me as you see fit.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.378
[Nakaumi] Professor.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:04.755
It's possible that people

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.300
can only find happiness
through others.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.386
Not by comparing
themselves to others.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.305
You say you did
this for yourself,

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:15.308
but ultimately you
did it for humanity.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:18.811
I have Saki, someone
I want to protect.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:22.440
Who I'd give my life to protect,
if it ever came to that.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.901
Far as I'm concerned,
that's happiness.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.198
I just want to say,

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:33.242
I'm sorry for all the
trouble I've caused.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.786
If it's true that happiness
can only be achieved

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:37.330
through other people,

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.248
then it's important that we
never cause trouble for them.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.251
As a result, I really
only have one option left.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.379
I have to kill myself.

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.216
And then you can become
the creature, Red.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:50.801
--What was that?
--He's going to kill himself?

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.929
--No way!
--That makes no sense!

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.597
He can't be serious!

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.973
Professor!

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:58.559
There must be some other
way forward for you here!

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.146
If so, I don't see it.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.649
I was willing to do
anything to prove my theory

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.192
that there is no God.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:09.278
I clung to the idea of
not birthing a creature.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.863
I tried to reach the truth

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.242
by ultimately causing the demise
of all the God candidates.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.536
My obsession with death
was all-consuming.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.706
I was such a fool.

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.917
My life was saved
twice by angels.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.254
I'll become the creature
and do everything I can

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.588
to tell you the truth!

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.257
Let me do this for
you, professor!

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:35.263
If you remember, after
talking it over earlier,

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.432
we did all agree to the idea
of Nakaumi becoming God.

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:39.976
I'm fine with it.

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:41.602
Temari, have you forgotten

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.854
that the professor shot
Nakaumi with a Red Arrow?

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:47.316
Hmm, I thought a person
shot with a Red Arrow

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:49.652
couldn't be forced
to become God.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.737
While Professor Yoneda
maintains his stance

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:53.322
that no God should be birthed,

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.950
Shuji Nakaumi can still
agree to become God

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:58.286
by volunteering to
fill the position.

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.538
In this situation,
the Arrow is irrelevant.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.872
All right, Ogaro!

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.917
That means your partner
Nakaumi's going to become God!

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.085
One thing to remember

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.879
is that God cannot communicate
anything to humans.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.090
Once the selection
process is over

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.092
we can't talk to our partners.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:16.429
Still, some things can
continue to be conveyed

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.139
without direct communication.

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.226
Understand this.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.853
You have the capacity

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:27.106
to eventually discover the
truth about everything.

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.149
[Yoneda] Looking back,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.901
I refuse to believe
Muni was lying to me.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:33.195
I wonder if this is
all part of a plan.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:37.033
Nakaumi, are you sure
you're okay with this?

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.411
Yes.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.959
All right, then
I will become God.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.086
Are you all in agreement?

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.922
--Mm-hm.
--Yes.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:54.717
--I'm onboard.
--Indeed.

00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:59.096
[Announcer] Um, a
decision has been reached.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:03.100
The new God will be
13-year-old Shuji Nakaumi.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.143
[Man] Seriously?

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.520
[Man] A middle-school
kid's going to be God?

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:08.356
--That's not right.
--This sucks!

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.612
[wings flapping]

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:17.782
[suspenseful music]

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:32.380
What's going on, the sky-

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:43.808
--Our Wings have disappeared.
--And our Arrows, too!

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:47.978
Mr. Hoshi and
Ms. Yumiki are frozen.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.772
[Nakaumi] Except for
the God candidates,

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.732
I've erased the
selection process

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:52.858
from everyone's memories.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.658
Look at that, he
really did become God.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.867
He's a creature.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:03.244
Before I continue on,

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:05.830
I have a question for
the assembled candidates.

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.874
Do any of you want to
keep your memories intact

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.167
of the selection process

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.586
and of the experience of
being a God candidate?

00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:17.842
Professor, you'll ensure that
I can lead a life of luxury

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.301
from this point on?

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:21.178
I never go back on my word.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.556
You won't want for
anything in this life.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.057
In that case,

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:27.977
I don't need to remember
this horrifying experience.

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:29.270
Under the circumstances,

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.063
I believe it will be
in my best interest

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:33.232
to retain my memories.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:34.859
And besides, if I
don't keep them,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.819
I won't have any idea
as to what occurred,

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.280
and why I'm
supporting Ms. Temari.

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:41.490
Well then, better hold onto
those memories, professor,

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:43.242
--they're critical!
--Obviously.

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:47.246
As for me, I don't
ever want to forget

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.915
what I learned during
the selection process.

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:52.877
And as regards the dreams
of the dead God candidates,

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:55.588
I'll be wanting to hold
onto them, as well.

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.131
Plus everyone else who died.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.593
I want my memories, too.

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:02.219
It shall be done.

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.138
That is all I have at this time.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.099
Farewell.

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:09.852
[dramatic music]

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:39.757
--Huh, Hoshi?
--Ms. Yumiki.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.843
--What, huh?
--Yoneda?

00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:44.053
I'm right here.

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:45.846
What's happened, where am I?

00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:47.097
It's October 10th?

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:49.099
How did I even
get to this place?

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.726
Uh, and what's this all about?

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:54.104
You are the first assistant

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.940
in the Professor
Emeritus's laboratory

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.108
of the Department of
Biological Sciences

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.195
in Tokyo University's Science
and Engineering department.

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.571
Yeah?

00:22:02.613 --> 00:22:04.907
Well, I guess I'll have to
take your word for that.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.325
I'm a STEM girl?

00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:08.369
At Tokyo University?

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.411
Not bad.

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:16.961
You ready?

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:18.212
Yeah.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.509
[soft music]

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:44.154
So this is Heaven, huh? [groans]

00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:50.202
The creature, I can feel
it's infested my body.

00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:55.249
[closing theme music]
