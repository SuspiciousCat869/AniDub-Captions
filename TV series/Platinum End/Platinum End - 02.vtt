[God] For a long while now,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.406
I've done all I can to make
the human world a better place,

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:35.035
but the time has come for
me to relinquish my throne

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:38.205
to the next human who
will come after me,

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:40.415
to a younger power.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.085
Out all the many
angels here in heaven,

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:47.798
you Glorious 13 I've been chosen
to fulfill this tradition.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.800
As is established custom,

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.010
one that the 13
humans you nurture

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.263
will become the next God.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.224
When your chosen
human becomes God,

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.476
your work as an angel will end,

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:02.062
and you will be rewarded
with a quiet life

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:04.481
at the side of the new deity.

00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:06.275
[Balta] The human
who becomes God

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.151
can acquire anything they want.

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.319
[Luta] It's an impossible task

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.071
for a second-rank angel like me

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.240
who can only grant red arrows.

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:14.533
[Revel] I'll do
whatever it takes

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.661
to make my chosen
human the new God.

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.705
[Nasse] All right,
this is my big chance!

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.666
Maybe I can finally
make Mirai happy.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:26.503
[God] You have 999 days
to fulfill your mission.

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:31.300
Now go, my angels.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:39.099
[opening theme music]

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.357
You're telling me
there are 13 candidates

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.693
and one of them will
become the new God?

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.197
[Mirai laughs]

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.199
It's absolutely true, Mirai.

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.659
[Mirai] Well, I can't deny

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.869
there's an angel hovering
right in front of me,

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.914
so I guess it makes sense
that God exists too.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.377
It's too much to take in.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.839
I can barely even look
after myself on a good day.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.799
I could never become God.

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:39.010
But listen, if someone
else ends up becoming God,

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.346
your wings and arrows
will be taken from you.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.975
If you become God, you get
to use them all you want.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.853
So really, you should do
it for your own happiness.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.105
My happiness? Right.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.153
--My mom used to tell me--
--Huh?

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.907
Everyone is born with the
goal of finding happiness

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.285
and everyone lives with the aim

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.454
of attaining even
greater happiness.

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:07.831
[sad music]

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:09.958
--[child giggling]
--Here we go! Charge! [laughs]

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.837
And what's more, if
you're not happy,

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.881
you can't be truly
pleased for others

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.841
when they find happiness.

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:22.012
But you know, Mirai, that's
not the whole picture.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.805
Unless everyone
around you is happy,

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.057
you can't really enjoy
your own happiness.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:31.188
That's what I truly
believe. [chuckles]

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.901
Happiness for everyone, huh?

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.360
Sounds like a nice mom.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.155
Some people find
joy in comparing

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:42.741
the unhappiness of
others with their own.

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:45.327
I don't need the white
arrow that kills people,

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.163
and I won't need the red arrow

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:50.207
once I make my uncle
turn himself in.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.295
All I want and have ever
wanted is ordinary happiness.

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.632
I'm not interested in being God.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:04:59.883
Mmm? Mm-hmm.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.428
All right, fine. If
that's what you want.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.306
Let's find your uncle and
make him turn himself in.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.642
Then you won't have to be
worrying about money anymore.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.644
But it's already late today.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.688
Besides, the deadline for
admissions is tomorrow.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.315
We could do it after that.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.234
You sure?

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.363
It's reported that comedy
star Tonma Rodriguez

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.782
is romantically involved
with even more women.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:26.326
Three young ladies had
previously been identified

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.162
as maintaining serious
relationships with the star.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.581
Today, two more names
were added to that list.

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:33.375
Here's what
Rodriguez had to say.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.459
--Nasse.
--Huh?

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.169
--Look.
--Huh?

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.088
Yeah, it seems I've suddenly

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.464
become irresistible to women.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.174
It's an angel.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.343
So people can't see him, right?

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.553
Right.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.137
There can only be one reason

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.348
why he's following
this comedian.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.185
This guy Tonma Rodriguez
must be a God candidate.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.938
He has to be one
of the chosen 13.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.025
Yes. As a matter of fact, he
said he loves me the most.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.736
You figure he's
using the red arrow?

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.154
Probably.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.740
Red arrows can be active
on up to 14 people at once.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.951
I mean, they just said
he's dating five women.

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:09.202
If that's true,

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.162
he can still shoot up
to nine more of them.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.623
Does this mean all
the women in the world

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.250
are in love with me now?

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:18.545
If that's true, I feel
like I've become God!

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.213
Hey, I was only joking.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.217
[Man] Why do beautiful women
keep falling for this guy?

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.136
[Mirai] Is there any
way to save them?

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.345
Huh?

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.598
I know we can use these
arrows however we want,

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.017
but some things
should be off limits.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.144
I feel sorry for
those women he shot.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.979
It doesn't seem fair.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.398
Mirai, you're so kind.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.066
Isn't there some way
to protect yourself

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.401
from being shot with an arrow?

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.402
There is.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.403
Didn't I tell you about that

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.405
when I asked if you
wanted wings or arrows?

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:46.406
You did not.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.617
Ah, sorry!

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:49.743
The arrows never miss.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.286
there's one exception
to that rule,

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:53.413
but it only applies
to a lucky few.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.290
The wings are faster
than the arrows.

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:58.376
If you fly away,
arrows can't catch you.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.463
That means ordinary
people can't escape them.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.048
Anyway, don't worry so much.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.177
After 33 days, the effects of
red arrows expire naturally.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.595
But if you were to
shoot them again,

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:10.639
you could keep on
controlling them?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.224
You can only shoot
a person once.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.644
Otherwise, a time limit
would be pointless.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:17.896
I see.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.523
Mr. Rodriguez is using
the power of the arrow

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.443
to make women fall for
him, one after another.

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.071
But it will only
last for 33 days.

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.240
Someone using arrows in this way

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.451
would never be chosen
to be God, right?

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:41.057
[Mirai] Strange.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.810
Apparently they still don't
know why Rodriguez died.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.023
Hey!

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.734
So, uh, good job getting
yourself into that high school.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.736
You must be pretty smart, Mirai.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:54.821
That's not really true.

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:57.740
Aw, don't be so modest.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.326
I wasn't the one who thought
of using the red arrow

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.120
to make your uncle
turn himself in.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.914
You bought a condo with
the money you got back,

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.542
and today, we're going
shopping for your new life.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.503
Isn't this fun? Yahoo! [laughs]

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.757
Uh...

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.887
I mean, the life you
described, a place to sleep,

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.097
food to eat, and going
to school each day,

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.641
it's gradually
becoming a reality.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.895
You're getting closer to
reaching ordinary happiness.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.521
Things are going great!

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.356
That's wonderful, right? Mmm?

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:35.320
--Yeah. I suppose.
--[Nasse gasps]

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.946
I'd feel a whole lot better,

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.907
except for that
comedian's death.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:42.785
[Nasse] I knew he
was thinking of that.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.498
Don't get me wrong, Nasse.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.751
I'm grateful to you for
coming to my rescue.

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.044
I'll be going to high school,

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:53.004
and I can live my life like this

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.048
because of the angel
powers you've given me.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.758
But I'm still worried.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.927
This force is too great
for an ordinary person.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.054
What if I can't control it?

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:03.431
[crowd murmuring]

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:04.432
Huh?

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:05.725
It has been over an hour

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.728
since the Hitotsubashi Branch of
the Yotsuba Tokyo Orion bank

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.773
was taken over by armed
robbers with these demands.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.775
"We will kill one hostage
every five minutes

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:16.152
until we get money and
a getaway helicopter,

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.737
and at this time,
we're approaching

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.405
that first
five-minute deadline."

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.740
We're about to find
out if the criminals

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.200
are true to their
word about shooting-

--[gunshot fires]
--[pedestrians gasping]

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.788
[Woman] Gunshots! I just heard
a gunshot inside the bank.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.208
--Why don't they do something?
--Victims?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.960
Does that mean two
people have died?

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.172
At this moment, the police
appear to be helpless.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.840
They don't want to
escalate the situation

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.592
by taking decisive action.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.721
--What was that?
--Who are you?

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.932
Put your hands where
we can see them!

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:46.975
[Metropoliman] Don't shoot.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.185
I am not your enemy.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.565
I'm here for one reason
only: to deliver justice!

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.442
[Reporter] A person
dressed in full body armor

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:58.403
has suddenly appeared
out of nowhere.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.031
--Who's that guy?
--Isn't that Metropoliman?

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.741
He had a TV show last season.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:06.202
Wait a minute.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.247
Are those wings?

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.291
Uh-huh. A God candidate.

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.127
[Reporter] We can't
tell what he's doing.

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:15.420
It looks like he's trying

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.380
to convince the
police of something.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.756
Look, he's flying!

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.550
[Officer] Huh? Is
this a movie shoot?

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.260
[Officer] What the
hell's going on?

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.848
[Metropoliman] You have
to believe me when I say

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:30.018
I, Metropoliman,
shall defeat evil!

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.853
He shot then with red arrows.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.855
Well, they'll listen to him now.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.481
It's all kinda
silly, but at least

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.859
he's using the wings
and arrows for justice.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.069
[Metropoliman] I see
you're finally prepared

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.863
to let me handle this.

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.406
Thank you, officers.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.408
You won't be sorry.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.743
I'll be right back.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.997
[Robber] How long are you
gonna make us wait here?!

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.999
[Metropoliman] Hold it
right there, evildoer.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.251
You're dealing with me now.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.878
[Robber] Are you
stupid or something?

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.838
You come any closer
and I'll cap ya.

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.094
Hey, are you hard of
hearing? Stay back!

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.723
Asshole.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.060
Die!

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:16.105
[Metropoliman] It's futile.
You're no match for me.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.149
I can move faster than bullets!

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.277
He stopped him.

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:25.073
[Metropoliman] Now
you get it, don't you?

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.533
You never had a
chance against me.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.327
[Robber] Who are you?

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.870
[Metropoliman] Metropoliman.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.663
You need to turn yourself in.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.123

[Man] Huh? I thought
this was over.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.306
[Woman] Did he dodge the bullet?

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:52.725
Quick, use the red arrow.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:55.937
[Metropoliman] That's it! My
rage has reached its peak!

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.313
[Robber] Get out of here!

[Metropoliman] Murderer.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:11.828
Metro-pon!

Now, release the hostages.

[bystanders murmuring]

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.136
He's got both.

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.804
White and red arrows.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.101
We're seeing
movement from inside.

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.103
It appears the hostages
are being released.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:41.816
Oh! Excuse me, but who are you?

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.192
[Metropoliman] Metropoliman.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.987
The attack just now was done
using my killer metropon.

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.990
I have to say, though,
it was a desperate move.

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.326
It happened so fast, I
couldn't control my strength.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:55.580
Control his strength? Those
white arrows kill people.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.623
He was gonna kill
him from the start.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.000
If he can see his target,

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.295
the arrows are gonna
hit 100% of the time.

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.921
White arrows.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.008
Is this God candidate being
tracked by a special-rank angel?

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.927
He utilized the
properties of the arrows

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.013
and put on the most
dramatic display

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:13.473
he could have come up with.

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:16.017
In so doing, he's captured
the hearts of the masses.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.769
He got ahead of us.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:23.191
[Metropoliman] People of
Earth, I am Metropoliman.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:25.151
It goes without
saying that I am here

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.986
to preserve peace
on this planet,

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.780
but I am also a
messenger from Heaven,

I will not hide.

This guy must be crazy.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.429
And what does he mean,
he's defeated one?

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.056
Is he talking about
Mr. Rodriguez?

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.975
Nasse, get away from me now.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.060
--Huh?
--Hurry.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.102
Uh, all right.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.105
[Mirai] I'm
practically advertising

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:06.025
that I'm a God candidate if
my angel hangs around me.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.070
I don't know where these
other God candidates are,

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.696
but I know this much.

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.448
I can't be happy if I'm dead.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.123
12 enemies.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.086
He's talking about the other
God candidates, isn't he?

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.128
Uh-huh.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.673
--Nasse.
--Huh?

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.384
Revoke my status
as a God candidate.

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:32.885
What?

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:35.221
You saved my life, but
now I've changed my mind.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:37.890
I don't wanna die.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.435
I just want to be happy.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.105
I'm sorry.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.942
Revoking your God
candidate status

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:50.736
would mean returning your
wings and arrows, too.

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.239
Don't need 'em. Take 'em back.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.157
That's not the problem.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:58.119
If you return your wings
and arrows, you'll die.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:01.706
What?

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.291
Since I gave them to you

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:04.625
specifically as
your hope to live,

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.210
if you were to throw them away,

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.713
you'd be throwing
your life away.

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.299
The only reason you're
alive right now

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.968
is because you accepted
them as a God candidate.

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.096
[Mirai sighs]

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.139
[Mirai] I see.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.100
God was very clear.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.060
Only those who'd lost
their will to live

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.271
could be considered
for the position.

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:26.897
Or to put it in other words,

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:29.275
people who are
dissatisfied with the world

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:32.320
and really wanna make
an effort to improve it.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.905
I don't care about all
that complicated stuff.

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.782
I was just trying to find out

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:39.410
if my God candidate
status could be revoked.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.329
[Nasse] Sorry.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:46.542
No. I'm the one who's sorry.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:50.963
Let's see.

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.299
Ah, so special-rank angels

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.301
have wings, red arrows,
and white arrows.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.470
First-rank angels
only have red arrows.

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:58.763
[Nasse] No.

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.097
You're right about
special-rank angels,

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.475
but first-rank angels
have red arrows and wings.

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:06.145
Second-rank angels have
either red arrows or wings.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.022
[Mirai] So out of
the 13 chosen angels,

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:11.150
how many special-rank
angels are there?

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.318
[Nasse] Three, probably.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.737
But first-rank angels
sometimes get promoted.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.739
Special-ranks can
be demoted, too,

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:20.034
and first-ranks also sometimes
get demoted to second-rank.

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.746
[Mirai] Regardless,
the biggest thorn

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.206
in Metropoliman's side

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:26.832
is going to be
other God candidates

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.209
who have special-rank angels,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.585
just like he does.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:30.920
What should I do?

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:33.214
He intends to become
God, and he's prepared

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.549
to kill any other candidate
who gets in his way.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.593
He's already killed
that guy Rodriguez.

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:39.762
Mirai?

00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.848
Maybe you should
stay inside for now.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.395
It's a shame, after you got
into high school and all.

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:50.231
Your entrance
ceremony is tomorrow.

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:52.608
[Mirai] Yeah.
Actually, it's today.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.277
[Mirai's Mother] I
believe everyone lives

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:58.239
with the aim of attaining
even greater happiness.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.866
[Mirai] Which means,
whatever the circumstances,

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.243
I should go in the direction

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:05.037
I instinctively believe is
going to be the better one.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.288
[Nasse] Mirai?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.290
I have to pick
the better option.

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:10.209
Am I going to live
in fear of him

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.545
and stay cooped up for
the rest of my life?

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.339
If so, why did Nasse
save me anyway?

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:17.341
Why am I alive now?

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:19.802
[sad music]

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:23.764
I've decided I'm going to class.

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:25.015
Huh?

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.600
I'll never find happiness

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.229
if I stay cooped up inside.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.441
--Right. But--
--It's fine.

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.067
As long as you're not with me,

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:36.819
he won't know I'm
a God candidate.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:41.323
Metropoliman has no right to
keep me from finding happiness.

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:43.701
High school starts tomorrow.

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.287
Everyone thinks I'm only
a student. Just wait.

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:49.123
There'll be surprised to
find out I'm much more.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.209
Once I kill the other 11 chosen,

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.086
they'll have to
worship me as God.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:58.382
That uniform looks terrific.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:01.427
--You think so?
--Oh, yeah.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.053
When I saw that on you,

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.680
there was no
question in my mind.

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:06.307
You belong in high school.

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:07.892
[exhales] Thank you.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.810
Call me if anything comes up.

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:13.272
Just say my name and
I'll fly straight to you.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:14.273
All right, good.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.192
Oh, and when you get to school,

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.862
don't forget to shoot
Saki with your red arrow.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.615
--Huh?
--Saki Hanukkah, silly boy.

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:24.492
Isn't that why you
chose this school,

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:25.493
so you could be around her?

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:26.869
I don't know what you--

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.164
Remember, the red arrow's
effective for 33 days,

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.333
and you can only
shoot somebody once.

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:33.876
So if you want the two of you

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.294
to have a relationship
after that,

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:37.505
you have to make her actually
fall in love with you

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:40.049
before the 33 days runs out.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.634
Because it's Cupid's arrow,

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:44.428
it helps to move things
along in the right direction.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.056
[gentle music]

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:50.476
No, I won't use an arrow
to control her feelings.

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.561
[Nasse] Aw! Why not?

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:55.731
[students chattering]

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.905
[Mirai] I'm an ordinary student

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:05.991
starting an ordinary term
at an ordinary high school.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.952
My next three years start now.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:10.538
[gentle music]

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:17.962
[dramatic music]

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.588
An angel?

00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:22.132
Is it Metropoliman's?

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.384
Okay, calm down now.

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:24.885
Nasse is nowhere near me.

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:27.513
He has no way of knowing
him I'm a God candidate.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.394
I just need to act
natural as I walk past.

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:36.188
[dramatic music]

00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:54.498
[closing theme music]

00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:22.419
[dramatic music]
