you'll be forced to
pay attention to me

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.663

have some effect.

Did I fool him?

I don't even have the
strength to pull the trigger.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.755
Come on, Mirai.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.800
Finish her off.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.844
Do it before she could
threaten anyone else.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.681
Let me watch her and
Metropoliman die.

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:42.475
You've admitted what
we both know, Mukaido.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.602
Even though he's literally
got the upper hand,

your boy is stuck in
place and he can't move.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:50.024
Red hasn't yet worked up
the resolve to kill Fuyuko.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.277
And it looks to me
like he never will.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:57.824
He's loaded his white arrow.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.617
What can he do
from that distance?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.619
He's combined it
because red arrow,

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.329
which allows him to reach Red.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.000
Why hasn't he fired it already?

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.710
What will you do now, Red?

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.966
What's up. You get
ready to kill me?

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.760
Not at all. I'm doing
this to deflect the shot.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.221
--Just shoot her.
--Shut up.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.641
By the way, are you familiar
with the law of inertia?

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:26.394
Shoot her.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.021
As long as you're
holding onto her,

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:30.231
even if one of you
tries to fly away,

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.108
it'll still be one against one.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.320
It doesn't matter
if you don't get it.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.698
The signal.

Now melt.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.007
From the moment he
grabbed her wrist,

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.343
it became a standoff
between her syringes

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.844
and his white arrow.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:00.887
But he's got a problem.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.764
He can't shoot her with an arrow

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.682
and he can't let go of her arm.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.852
Which means when Fuyuko
fires her syringes,

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.897
he'll be forced to use his
free hand to block them.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.523
She has three syringes.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.485
He can't possibly block them
all with just his right hand.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:17.862
So if I distract him and
limit his hand movements,

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.489
it becomes all the more certain

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.866
that one of the
needles will hit home.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.326
The arrow will hit first.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.454
Nooo.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.415

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.253

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:45.807
The white arrow.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:53.815
The arrow I shot at you is
meant for you and only you.

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.483
It's coming back towards me.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.404
It's no use. I can't
block them all in time.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:02.782
If I let go of Fuyuko's hand,
I can get Saki to safety.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:05.702
But if I hold on, she's
going to get hit and die.

--Let's fight.
--Huh?

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.232
Well finally.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:34.900
Don't get ahead of
yourself, mister.

00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:36.235
You won't use your white arrow,

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.279
so you can't even
kill a cockroach.

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:41.824
Like I said before,
you've got it backwards.

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.035
You seem to think
you're exceptional

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.496
and much more dignified
than a common cockroach.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.291
But cockroaches
don't kill people.

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:55.379
And that makes you
lower than a cockroach.

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:56.380
[Nasse giggles]

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:57.882
Interesting justification.

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.216
You're saying you can kill me

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:01.343
because I'm lower
than a cockroach?

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:04.305
Wrong. I have no
intention of killing you.

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.808
Then I don't understand
anything about you.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:11.479
I've been thinking about
the best way to do this.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.480
Ooh?

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.857
First, I'll shoot
you with a red arrow.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.484
Then I'll blindfold you,

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:18.611
put you in prison, reveal
everything to the public

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.905
and let the justice
system deal with you.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:24.033
I feel sorry for you,
but it's the only way.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.451
--[Kanade laughs]
--[soft music]

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:26.494
Oh, really?

00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:29.038
That's the best you can
come up with? Then what?

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:31.332
Are you going to explain
the angels' existence

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:32.416
to everyone?

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.251
How we control people
with red arrows

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:35.586
and kill them with white ones?

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.213
It's ridiculous.

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:40.341
The law can't possibly deal
with such a fantastical concept.

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:43.636
How can you be so thick-headed?

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:45.262
Using a white arrow is quicker

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.014
and less complicated
than your plan.

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:48.641
All you have to do
is aim it and fire.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:49.725
[Mirai] I'm not gonna kill you.

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.268
What?

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.896
My approach will preserve
my own happiness.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.650
The truth is, if any decent
person killed someone,

00:21:57.691 --> 00:21:59.485
their guilty conscience
would torment them

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.362
until the day they died.

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:04.949
In the end, they'd lose that
ability to find happiness.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.493
I won't allow my happiness
to be taken from me

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:08.869
because I was
pressured into killing

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:11.372
something lower
than a cockroach.

00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:12.373
[Nasse laughs]

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.875
Lower than a cockroach.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:17.294
I also realized that as
long as you're alive,

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.630
you're a threat not
just to my happiness,

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:22.299
but to the happiness
of all humanity.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:24.468
I thought there were
just two choices.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.137
Either sacrifice my own
life for thousands of others

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.265
or dirty my hands
by killing you.

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:31.684
But now I realized
there's a third option

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:33.686
for the sake of
my own happiness.

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:36.313
I'll shoot you with a red arrow.

00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:43.153
Okay, fine.

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:46.031
It'll be your red
arrow against my white.

00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:49.076
We'll keep on fighting until
one of us hits the other.

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:53.247
Guys like you who
rely on emotion

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:56.208
and intensity to fight
are the first ones to die.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.501
It's the analytically prudent

00:22:57.543 --> 00:22:59.587
and well-prepared who
survive to the end.

00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:02.715
Do you remember what I told you?

00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:05.426
As I promised.

00:23:05.467 --> 00:23:08.137
Once I've killed you, I'll
be taking that suit too.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:13.183
