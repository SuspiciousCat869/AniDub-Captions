WEBVTT

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.978
The time limit on both
their Wings and Arrows

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.188
have now expired.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.856
They've been returned to Saki.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.692
I'll shoot Mr. Hoshi
with a Red Arrow.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.904
And after that, it can turn
around and shoot Miss Yumiki.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:29.988
[Hoshi] Got it.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.199
At this point, I think
we can trust them.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.451
We shouldn't need
any Arrows now.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:36.453
Well, I'm not so
sure about that.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.081
The news report said that the
police still intend to capture

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.874
the God candidates.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:43.919
Mr. Hoshi, at our next
meeting with Professor Yoneda,

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.462
would you be able to attend

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:47.422
as a representative
of the police?

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.674
Yes.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.384
Together, I think
we can convince him.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:52.219
Right.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.940
[wings flapping]

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:16.368
[opening theme music]

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:42.663
[electronic buzzing]

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.374
Professor?

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.000
[thudding sound]

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.389
Now then, regarding my request,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.100
what progress have
you been able to make?

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.810
Well, you see-

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.604
[thudding sound]

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:12.401
I want you to take this.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.986
When you have a chance,

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:19.074
prioritize using it on powerful
and competent ministers.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.867
[Suzuki] Yes, Professor.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.208
[Yoneda] Both the Metro
and the National Police?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.627
[Suzuki] Yes, the top
officials in both agencies

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.380
had already been
shot with Red Arrows.

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:34.548
Red did that.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.049
I'm not surprised,

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.051
once those snipers attacked
the God candidates,

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.970
it would've been a
natural course of action

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.805
for them to take to
protect themselves.

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:44.015
It's all right, I don't
believe they wanna fight.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.976
I think they just wanna
continue our discussion

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.353
without fear of
being assassinated.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.231
So you need to make
the announcement soon.

00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:53.275
Understood.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.026
[door opening]

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.113
We got word from one of the
Red-Arrowed commissioners.

00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:59.406
[Yumiki] Prime Minister Suzuki

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:02.242
is making an emergency
announcement at 5:00 pm today.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.288
Citizens of Japan,

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.082
the series of events known
as the God selection process

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:13.378
which has caused stir both
here and abroad is very real.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.672
Professor Gaku Yoneda
has asked the government

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:18.258
to provide a safe place for
the God candidates to gather

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.468
for a discussion.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.094
We've talked it over.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.804
After extensive deliberations,

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.389
we decided to grant his request,

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.184
and offer the new national
stadium as a secure venue

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.478
for the God candidates
to hold their meeting.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.898
We're taking this opportunity
to announce that decision.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.442
They want us to meet
at the new stadium?

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.319
The meeting is set
for October 10th

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.237
at one o'clock in the afternoon.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.530
Did he really say October 10th?

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:42.949
That's in five days!

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.160
[Suzuki] As a matter of
prudence, on that day,

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.329
anyone living within a
kilometer of the stadium

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.122
will be asked to evacuate.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.541
Anyone who refuses
to leave voluntarily

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.919
will be forcibly
removed by the police

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.629
and Self-Defense Force.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.880
Is he crazy?

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.507
Why would he announce
where we'll be

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.927
when we were all just
shot at a few days ago?

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.721
Professor Yoneda has also
asked us to broadcast

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.473
the following video message.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.935
I am Gaku Yoneda.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.853
Since the attack on
the God candidates,

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.772
I've been listening to
people here in Japan

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:15.106
and around the world.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.359
I'm pleased to report that
the majority of those people

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.903
seem to agree with me
on the subject of God.

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:22.489
In the modern era, we
have no need of a God,

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:25.492
much less a false God or
creature as I call it.

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:27.744
That is the logical conclusion.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.079
Unfortunately,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.956
as we were discussing this
subject the other day,

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.334
our chat was disrupted and
we were forced to stop.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.170
It's clear to me why someone
would go to the trouble

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.881
of trying to kill all
of the God candidates.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.259
A bullet traveling faster
than the speed of sound

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.177
is something none of us
would be able to dodge

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.929
if we didn't know it was coming.

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.556
However, if it
took even a second

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.349
for every God candidate to die,

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.101
the last one with
breath in his body

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.978
would automatically
become the creature

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.980
and not die at all.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.981
[Temari gasping]

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.775
[suspenseful music]

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.944
Knowing that, I ask
that all governments

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:02.320
not attempt to kill us.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.198
Allow us to handle this
dilemma amongst ourselves.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.951
We will broadcast the
discussion from start to finish

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.745
and reach a conclusion
that will satisfy everyone.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.164
To that end, we'll see
you on October 10th

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.624
at the new national stadium.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.128
So, five days and it's over.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.421
Gotta trust the professor.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.966
Once again, all
citizens are asked

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.552
to stay away from the area
of the new national stadium

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:27.137
on October 10th.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.806
Yoneda shot the Prime
Minister with a Red Arrow.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:30.849
Right.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.184
[Mirai] Tell me something,

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.728
is what Professor
Yoneda was saying

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.646
at the end of his message true?

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.273
It is, Mirai.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:39.232
If all the God candidates

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.067
dropped out of the
running at the same time,

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.570
it would lead to the
result he predicted.

00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:44.988
The last remaining candidate

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.991
would automatically
become the next God.

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:51.077
If that's the case, then
this has to be a trap, right?

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.662
Not really.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.831
I think the professor was just
trying to set up a safe place

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.208
for all of us to
meet as he promised.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.376
[Hoshi] I agree.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.837
Yoneda is just supremely
self-confident.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.339
Yeah, to a fault.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.633
There's no way to
talk to that guy.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.426
[Hoshi] We don't
know that for sure.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:08.178
As his old high
school classmate,

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.680
I intend to try every
approach I can think of.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.600
You really don't get it, do you?

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:15.226
I don't want someone
to become God,

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:19.022
just so I can keep my Red Arrow
and go out and enjoy life.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.399
Unless someone is chosen
and takes over the job,

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.651
there's no way of making it

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:25.695
like the God selection
process never happened.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.238
Am I right, Yazeli?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.074
That is correct.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.826
So, until that takes place,
Professor Yoneda aside,

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.495
no one who used to
be a God candidate

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.455
will be able to find happiness.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:36.498
Probably.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.003
If you ask me,

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:45.840
killing Professor Yoneda
would be our best option.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.385
[ominous music]

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.594
That's no different

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.262
from what Metropoliman
attempted to do.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.431
Up until now, we've
all tried very hard

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.016
not to go down that path.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:58.311
[Mirai] We won't be
able to find happiness.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:00.897
Oh, Mirai.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.526
I couldn't bear that.

is quite precious.

I'm here at the Diet Building,

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.642
where all sessions have
been abruptly suspended.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.102
It's been three days.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:41.563
Despite intense questioning
from the opposition,

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.941
the current administration is
still maintaining its silence.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:49.237
[suspenseful music]

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.951
We can consider these suicides?

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:56.953
[Yoneda] That's right.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.538
It's all part of your efforts

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.749
to help people leave
this life behind.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.459
There's no problem with it.

Don't go out until they
finally pick a God?

You've gotta be kidding me.

get reception in my room.

[Sayuri] Minamikawa?

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.775
I've been so worried!

I couldn't get in touch with you

and you haven't been to school.

I'm sorry, I've developed
feelings for someone.

[Sayuri] What?

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:33.990
You're terrible!

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.158
No, it's not what you think.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.035
And, anyway, it's
not some girl I met.

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.036
It's a guy.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.370
[Sayuri] Excuse me?

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.164
Sorry, this is still
coming out wrong.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.749
I can't explain over the phone.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.334
Can you meet me in the park?

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:45.376
[Sayuri] You mean now?

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.378
Yes, please!

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.214
[Temari grunting]

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.548
Oh, come on.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.592
We should just ignore
the world's response.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.346
I've spend my time online
looking at beauty sites.

00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:59.724
[Mirai] It's 10%.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.351
What?

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.812
That's the percentage of
people who believe in God.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.772
Split across various religions,

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.607
roughly half the
world's population

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.567
used to believe in
some kind of God.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.444
After Professor Yoneda's speech,

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.488
that number's fallen to 10%.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.448
[Temari] Yeah,
what's your point?

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.283
That means after
giving it some thought,

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.285
most people have now
come to the conclusion

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.412
that God doesn't exist.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.207
There have to be some people
who still believe in God.

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.250
Of course.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.462
But even if someone
does become God,

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.881
most people won't recognize
them as a supreme being

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.181
[Saki] Mirai.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.474
Hm?

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.268
Depending on how our
next discussion goes,

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.479
you could very well
end up becoming God.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.149
You haven't changed your
mind about that, have you?

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.653
Mm-mm.

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:58.116
Then, I'd like to talk
to you in private again,

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.909
before we have that discussion.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.585
[Sayuri] So it's Red,
the God candidate, huh?

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.005
[Minamikawa] Yeah, I guess
he's the one who's on my mind.

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.465
All things considered,
you've been through a lot.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.426
[Minamikawa] Mm.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:19.429
I wonder how the God
selection process will go.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.140
The city feels different
than usual, it scares me.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.434
[Minamikawa] It'll be all right.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:25.852
Huh?

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.104
We should be fine
with the new God.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.149
Professor Yoneda's smart,
so he can handle it.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:35.278
As for all the others, everyone
else is kind and empathetic.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.529
I sure hope you're right.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.740
I would be really
upset if it turned out

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.492
I wasn't allowed to see
you again in the new world.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.579
Really, Sayuri?

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.540
[Sayuri] Look, a shooting star!

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:48.583
Yeah?

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.837
Hold on, they're flying
up from the ground,

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.505
and there are two of them.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:58.301
It doesn't matter.
Whatever, make a wish.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.469
Okay.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.930
[gentle music]

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.899
Sayuri, what is
it you wished for?

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:16.444
To tell you the truth, I
wished for world peace.

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.533
Yeah, totally cliche, right?

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.534
How about you?

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.620
Oh, well, I...

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.413
Actually, my wish was

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.792
that you'd allow me
to kiss you tonight.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.173
[Yoneda] How are you
handling the other nations?

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.675
Nothing to worry about there.

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.927
Nobody in the world
wants a Japanese citizen

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.220
to become a false God.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.306
Your explanation was
really effective,

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.767
especially how the first and
last God candidates dying

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:50.311
just a second apart would
result in the last one

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:51.771
becoming the creature.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.398
They've agreed not to interfere.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.569
Professor, I've never
tasted meat this delicious

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.655
in my entire life.

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.740
The meat you're consuming
is a Chateaubriand

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.617
made with Sanda beef.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.829
This tenderly-reared cow was
destined to be eaten by us

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.038
at this dinner tonight,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.624
just as you were fated to
be impressed by the meal,

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.711
while the leader of this country
became a witness to your joy.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:17.588
The most important lesson
to come from this moment is,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.425
everything in the
world is predetermined.

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.926
In accordance with
this providence,

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.762
it is now time for me to
bring everything to an end.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.640
[ominous music]

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.317
[crickets chirping]

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.868
[Mirai] I love this place.

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.787
It's where I came the
day I got my Wings.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.415
[Saki] It's beautiful.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:57.295
It's been six months and so
much has changed forever.

00:13:57.795 --> 00:13:59.172
Not just for us.

00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:00.298
For the whole world.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.594
[crickets chirping]

00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.436
You know what, Mirai?

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.648
I love you.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.151
[gentle music]

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.872
Thank you, Saki.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.752
I'm glad that neither of us...

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.797
I'm glad that
neither of us died.

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:41.881
I'm so glad.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.674
[gentle music]

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.677
[Sariya gasping]

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.684
[Housewife] Good morning.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:54.894
[Boy] See you later.

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:56.938
[Father] Don't
forget your lunch.

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.773
[High School Girl 1]
Today's the day, huh?

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.441
[High School Girl 2]
Professor Yoneda's thing?

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.777
[High School Girl 3] Yeah,
the God candidate meeting.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.700
It's October 10th.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:17.375
We're reporting today from
the new national stadium.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.127
There are just 15
minutes remaining

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.879
before the scheduled
1:00 pm start time.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.923
We're at Shinjuku
Imperial Gardens.

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.466
A lot of broadcast vans

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.468
and foreign media
have gathered here.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.761
[Reporter 1] Hold on, everybody.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.138
Professor Yoneda
has just appeared

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.764
in the middle of the stadium.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:36.978
[dramatic music]

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.400
Professor Yoneda has asked
us to relay this message:

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.193
Prime Minister
Suzuki has held talks

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.778
with the leaders
of other nations.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.405
There is no threat
of a sneak attack.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.781
I ask that you come
to this discussion

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.158
with your minds at ease.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:54.829
Ready?

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.585
[drones buzzing]

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.337
[wings flapping]

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.758
[Reporter 2] Two God
candidates have shown up.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.927
It appears to be Red and Yellow.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:10.928
Wait a minute!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.346
Three more people have shown up.

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:15.224
Does this mean there are
additional God candidates?

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:24.400
Yoneda, do you
remember me by chance?

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:27.445
It's Hoshi.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:29.572
We used to be classmates
in high school.

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.032
I'm currently a police officer,

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:33.868
but, don't worry, I
came here unarmed.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.245
[Yoneda] Five minutes
and eight seconds.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.413
[Hoshi gasping]

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.041
Out of 358 students that year,

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:43.127
you were the only person
I spoke to at any length.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.755
That number is the total
time I spent talking,

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:48.216
13 seconds at the
bottom of the stairs,

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:51.636
and four minutes, 55 seconds
after the 50-meter sprint.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.139
Numbers have a habit
of sticking with me.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.768
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:01.062
This officer's been
shot with a Red Arrow.

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.064
I presume he's here
to do your bidding,

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:04.190
whatever that may be.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.816
[Mirai] You're wrong about that.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.069
For more than a month now,
Mr. Hoshi's been acting

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.862
out of concern
for our wellbeing.

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:12.823
He wanted to express his
opinion to you as a friend.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.868
I shot him with a Red Arrow
so I could give him wings.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.870
[Yoneda] I don't recall
becoming friends.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.290
Yes, you're right.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:24.794
In high school, you avoided
associating with others.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.797
But no matter what, you
were always kind to people.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:30.800
You told me it was because
you didn't want to upset them.

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:32.385
I can't understand why someone

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.845
who is so considerate of
other individual's feelings

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.265
would now abandon the
people who need God.

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:41.018
It would appear that
you've been suffering

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.270
from a misunderstanding.

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.729
I don't like upsetting others

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:46.023
because I don't want anyone
saying something back to me

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.943
in response to becoming upset.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.070
I don't want relationships
with other people.

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:54.073
Come on.

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:57.410
And you're completely wrong
about me being kind to others.

00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.953
I just behaved in a way

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.080
that ensured my discussions
would be very short,

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.416
and wouldn't require any
further their interaction.

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:04.959
As I recall at the time,

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.878
I politely declined your
request to be friends with me.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.881
And yet, that only led to
this obnoxious encounter.

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:13.050
I chose the wrong
approach with you.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.721
Now, I realize I shouldn't
have spoken to anyone.

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.727
[Temari] So, does that
mean it was pointless

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.729
to bring Mr. Hoshi
to this meeting?

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.689
If you don't want
relationships with people,

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.566
why have you gotten
involved here?

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.985
It's like you've become
desperate for something.

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:32.987
Actually, you could
call me desperate.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:35.948
I can't tell you how many times

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.576
I've wished I'd never
won a Nobel Prize.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:42.079
Ever since then, all kinds of
people keep coming up to me.

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:45.291
As a result, I've become more
and more agitated over time.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.292
It got so bad,

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:49.045
I even contemplated
suicide at one point.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.297
But humans are
mysterious creatures.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.549
When they throw one thing
away, they gain another.

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:54.967
It turns out by giving up

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:56.927
on associating with
most of humanity,

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.889
I've finally overcome my
long-term fear of people.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.140
What?

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.518
You mean someone as arrogant
as yourself has anthropophobia?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.728
How'd you beat it?

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:08.314
I came to realize
that other people

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.066
have no control over me.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.943
Because people's
actions in the future

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:16.864
are predetermined from the
start, no one can resist either.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:20.743
Know what that means?

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.162
We should consider what to
do within those parameters,

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.997
then act without hesitation.

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:28.959
We attain happiness by making
that happen before we die.

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:32.922
[Nakaumi] Professor.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:36.133
I'm ashamed that I was simply
trying to kill myself before,

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.302
but now I know there
are things I have to do

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:39.345
with the professor.

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:43.974
Now that I'm prepared
for human interaction,

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.310
I've decided it's time to
stand before the public

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:49.188
and explain my thinking
to the entire world.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.024
I've decided the most
important thing is this,

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:53.275
to make sure

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:55.027
that none of the present
God candidates prevails

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.862
and becomes a false God.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.031
In order to accomplish that,

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:01.409
I must first kill the
three God candidates

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.202
who are present here today.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.954
It's a horrible prospect,

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:06.247
but it's the only certain way

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:09.166
to prevent the creation
of the creature.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.043
If my calculations are correct,

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:13.295
three of the five candidates
must die immediately.

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:15.172
And the remaining two
must kill each other

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.966
with White Arrows.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.342
Of the invited guests,

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:21.220
only Mirai Kakehashi
possesses a White Arrow.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:25.182
So he, Saki Hanakago, and
Yuri Temari must die first.

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.977
Then finally, I
and Shuji Nakaumi,

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:31.230
to whom I've given a White
Arrow, will kill each other.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.232
Shuji Nakaumi will
do as I command,

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.443
since I've already shot
him with a Red Arrow,

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:37.903
and he is predisposed
to accept death

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:39.655
which reassures me
that, in the end,

00:20:39.697 --> 00:20:41.657
we will kill each other.

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:45.119
I declared earlier that if we
all died, even a second apart,

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.079
the last God
candidate to pass away

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:49.457
would automatically
become the creature.

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.417
With that in mind,
no one will imagine

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.628
that I'm planning to kill all
of the God candidates at once.

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.841
The timing of this strategy
is extremely critical,

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.051
but White Arrows are
a creation of a being

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.887
produced by humankind.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.890
Therefore, what are considered
simultaneous deaths,

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.225
are defined by human judgment.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.602
The question then becomes,

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:12.104
how much of a difference is
still considered simultaneous?

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.106
I've already
determined the answer.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:18.694
Shuji Nakaumi shot Suicidal
Person A with a Red Arrow,

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:22.239
then gave that person the
White Arrow I'd given to him.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:26.118
Person A then fired that White
Arrow at Suicidal Person B.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.870
The moment the Arrow was fired,

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.080
I shot my own White
Arrow at Person A.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:35.836
When my Arrow struck Person
A first, Person A died.

00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:39.089
Person B died after being
struck by Person A's White Arrow

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:43.093
when up to .15 seconds had
elapsed after I'd shot Person A.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:46.639
At .16 seconds,
Person B didn't die.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.141
So the last two candidates
must kill each other

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:52.269
with White Arrows
within .15 seconds.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:55.940
If these conditions are met,
no creature will be created.

00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:04.406
[Mirai] Ready?

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.786
I've been thinking this over.

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.329
[Saki] Huh?

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.373
Even if most people
say God isn't real,

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.291
we're not doing this
just for the minority

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.544
who still believe he exists.

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:19.922
There's also the God candidate's
own happiness to consider.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.342
And the professor's
standing in the way of that.

00:22:23.384 --> 00:22:25.970
No matter how hard we try,

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.346
if Professor Yoneda won't agree

00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:29.932
to making one of the God
candidates the new God,

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:34.186
[suspenseful music]

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.941
then he'll have to die.

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:41.986
[suspenseful music]

00:22:42.987 --> 00:22:44.196
[Nasse] Mirai!

00:22:44.238 --> 00:22:47.199
[suspenseful music]

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:55.291
