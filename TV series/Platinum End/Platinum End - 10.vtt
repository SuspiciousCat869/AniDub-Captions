WEBVTT

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:11.678
[Mukaido] Aya! Nanaka!

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:14.181
[angels swooshing]

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:15.182
This is the place.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:16.183
[Nasse] It's a theme park.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:17.184
[Mukaido] Where are they?

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:19.019
Aya! Nanaka!

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:21.772
Metropoliman, I came
just like you wanted.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:22.814
Show me my family!

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.402
[weapon clangs]

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.572
[blade clangs]

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:31.865
[Hajime] Huh.

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:34.201
[Mirai] It's the guy
from outside your house.

00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:37.079
[Mukaido gasps]

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.164
[Mukaido] Aya,
Nanaka! They're alive!

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.334
Aya, Nanaka! I'm up here!

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:45.170
[fist banging]

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.338
It's a one-way mirror.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.090
I'm coming to save you!

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.092
[gasps] Don't go in
there, Mr. Mukaido!

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:52.052
[weapon clangs]

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.095
He went in.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.557
[Hajime laughs]

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.393
Hilarious, oh, I
can't believe it!

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.019
He walked right in.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.855
Hostages certainly
are effective.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.192
But now that he's in
there, he can't get out.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.819
This box has proven to be

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.405
the ultimate God candidate
capturing attraction.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:12.864
How amusing!

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.242
[Mirai] This guy's
connected to Metropoliman?

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:18.078
Well, he would've killed him
if he was a God candidate,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.955
which means he's likely
he's an ordinary human

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:21.748
who's been shot
with a red arrow.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.835
So, my red arrow probably
won't have any effect on him.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.211
But I still have to try.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.339
[Mukaido] Aya, Nanaka!
Are you all right?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.883
Tell me, are you in love

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.177
with any man other
than me right now?

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.263
[Aya] Why would you ask
me that at this moment?

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.681
[Mukaido] Answer the question.

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:39.933
I only love you.

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.103
[Mukaido] Good, you haven't
been shot with a red arrow.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.315
Why is he trying to find
out if she loves him?

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.442
I don't even
understand the word.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.987
Love, love. What is that?

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.363
It's weird.

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:54.781
[Mirai] Hey!

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:55.824
Huh?

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.368
[arrow whooshes]

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.703
White arrow?

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:03.165
[gasps] Mirai's finally
using all his resources.

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:12.883
[opening theme music]

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.428
[Mirai] Release them
right now or I'll shoot!

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.513
I, I thought you were a coward

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.181
who couldn't fire that arrow.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.396
[Hajime sighs]

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.273
[arrow swooshes]

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.316
[wings rustle]

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.278
That was too close!

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.614
[arrow swooshes]

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.826
[Baret] That was a good move.

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.202
You're right.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.413
By letting him see the
white arrow before he fired,

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:08.331
he knew he'd be
able to escape it.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.752
Technically, though, he
did fire his white arrow.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.378
He finally did it!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.464
[Mirai] Mr. Mukaido!
Can you hear me?

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.383
[Mukaido] Yeah, but just barely.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.885
[Mirai] We don't know
where the enemy's hiding,

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.220
so we can't defend
ourselves if they attack.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.139
It's an overwhelming
disadvantage!

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.435
[guns banging]

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:29.478
[Mukaido] No surprise.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.022
[gasps] Where did
you get those guns?

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:36.443
Nanato, hey, what in
the world is going on?

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:37.486
I'm scared.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.363
[Mukaido] I'm sorry you
got dragged into this.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.115
Even if we find a
way out of here,

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:46.536
I can't carry them both
while flying. Damn it!

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.247
At this rate, I'll end
up being a useless father

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.166
and a useless God candidate.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.420
[Kanade] Hajime,
listen to me carefully.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.507
In ten seconds time, get
your angel to follow you

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.051
and make itself seen 20
meters up in the air,

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.136
20 meters north of the house.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.222
[Hajime] Yes sir. Understood.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.307
Um, Mr. Poliman?

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.391
What is it?

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.393
[Hajime] I lured him into
the box like you said.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.312
Now will you make
me your servant?

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.357
[sighs] You did good

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.693
and I'm going to
reward you for it.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:26.368
[angels whoosh]

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.662
[Mirai] An angel! He
is a God candidate.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:29.663
Watch out!

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.873
[angels whoosh]

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.124
[Mirai] Metropoliman.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:42.050
Mr. Poliman's finally made
an appearance. [laughs]

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.969
Thank you for blessing me, sir.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.555
[Mirai] Even though
he's a God candidate,

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.348
Metropoliman shot
him with a red arrow

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.058
instead of killing him.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.434
[Metropoliman] Listen buddy.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.770
This was over the moment
Mukaido entered that box.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.689
How do you want to play this?

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.233
Do you want him to know
what's about to happen

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.360
or should I just shoot him?

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.530
[Mukaido] What's
going on out there?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.491
[Mirai] If Mr. Mukaido gets hit

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.827
with a white arrow, it's over.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.203
[Metropoliman] Get
out of here, kid.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.372
You don't stand a
chance against us.

00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:16.501
You don't actually
intend to fight, do you?

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.128
It's two against one.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.422
The luck you enjoyed
last time won't be enough

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.507
to save you in this situation.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.175
I just said you can skip out.

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.595
You'll be able to prolong
your life if you go.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.180
[Mirai] I don't--

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.473
[Metropoliman] Don't what?

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.809
[Mirai] I don't
want anyone to die.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.186
I won't let that happen.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.647
[tense music]

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.154
[Hajime gasps]

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.488
He went inside.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.408
[Mirai] Mr. Mukaido,
grab your wife

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.035
and fly around inside this box,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.411
faster than the eye can see.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:52.829
I'll do the same with your girl.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.497
[Mukaido] Why inside?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.583
[Mirai] So you can live.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.876
It's the only way all four of us

00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.753
can avoid being killed, hurry!

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:05.550
[Mirai and Mukaido swooshing]

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.928
[Hajime] I can't
see them anymore.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.930
[Metropoliman] They're
dead for sure now.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:13.058
All we have to do is wait for
them to wear themselves out.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.768
They really are idiots.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:18.480
So, why would Mukaido
do such a thing?

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.484
Out of love for his family.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:27.072
[gasps] Love for
family? I don't...

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.451
What's he mean,
love for his family?

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.494
I don't understand!

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:36.498
It's so irritating for
some reason! [sobs]

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:40.418
I mustn't lose my composure
in Mr. Poliman's presence.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.753
[Metropoliman] Didn't
you say my death

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.421
would please you greatly?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.508
And, something about
your partner killing me?

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.051
Well, now it's only
a matter of time

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.220
before that partner
of yours dies.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.888
I find that very amusing.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.265
What's wrong?

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.976
I know angels can't
interfere directly,

00:07:56.017 --> 00:08:01.106
but are you incapable of even
speaking today? [snickers]

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.693
Alright, Hajime, ping me
when they finally stop moving

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.612
and I'll come finish them
off with white arrows.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.489
What? You mean, you're leaving?

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.991
[Metropoliman] Of course.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.076
There's no need for me to stick
around until they collapse.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.704
Plus, I get nervous
being this close to you.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.707
You mean, you think I'd
shoot you with an arrow?

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.627
[Metropoliman] One must
consider every possibility.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.129
I make it a habit
not to hang around

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.505
with other God candidates.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.925
[Hajime] Ah, right as
always, Mr. Poliman.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:31.177
[Metropoliman] Okay,
don't disappoint me.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:35.932
[Mukaido and Mirai swooshing]

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:38.143
[Mukaido] Do you have
a plan of some kind?

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.269
[Mirai] No, I don't.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.062
[Mukaido] What? You don't?

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.064
[Mirai] Staying alive is
the most important thing.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.066
If we're dead, we can't
come up with any plans,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.569
including an escape strategy.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.570
[Mukaido] Well,
you're not wrong.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.155
But to tell you the truth,

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.741
I'm not sure how much
longer I can keep this up.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.701
[Mirai] Then we'd better
come up with something fast,

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.036
while we can still do it.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.623
[weapon clanging]

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.295
How long can they last?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.674
This kid acts impulsively.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.635
He could've saved himself if
he hadn't tried to be a hero.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.557
[weapon clanging]

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:25.023
[Mirai] How long
has it been now?

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.150
I can't tell how
much time has passed.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.902
We can't just keep
flying forever.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.695
We have to stop eventually.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:31.905
What should we do?

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.573
Is there some way we can escape?

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.744
[Nanaka whimpers]

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:44.250
[sighs] It's okay,
don't be scared.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.547
Huh, there is one possibility.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.050
Mr. Mukaido! There might
be a way to escape.

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.678
[upbeat music]

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.932
[gasps] Mr. Poliman, I
just heard one of them say

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.600
there might be a way to escape.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:01.893
Remain calm.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.104
There's no way they
can get out of there.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.814
[Mirai] I'm gonna
tell you what it is.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.607
[Mukaido] Wait, they're
probably listening

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.067
to this conversation.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.610
[Mirai] If that's true,

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.737
then Metropoliman will be able
to block every move we make.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.824
So first, let's leave this box,
so he can't hear us anymore.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.159
That includes your wife
and Nanaka, as well.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:19.160
[Mukaido] I see.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.079
Alright, let's go outside.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.580
[Mirai] I'm right behind you!

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.585
[Mukaido and Mirai swooshing]

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.847
This strategy could
be interesting.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.265
The only way they can truly know

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.350
if all the captives
are still inside,

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:45.061
is by seeing what we,
their angels, do next.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.232
Did, did they really escape?

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.860
I can't tell. They
don't seem to have left.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.778
[chuckles] They're
just keeping quiet

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.405
and pretending they all got out.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:57.490
What a childish strategy.

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.659
Oh, I see what you mean now.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.869
That desperate act was

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.745
just about the only
option they had left.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.664
Exactly right. Listen to me.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.000
No matter what happens,
until we kill them

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.668
don't attempt to do
anything to confirm

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.628
if they're all still inside.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.507
All you have to do
is not open the box.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.550
Yes, sir.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:22.307
[electricity humming]

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:25.351
[floodlights clank]

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.731
Hey, excuse me, Mr. Poliman.

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:30.732
[Metropoliman] What is it?

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:33.234
It's been half a day
since they went inside.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.903
I wanted to check
with you to make sure

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.654
they really are in there, right?

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.740
[Metropoliman] You're starting
to fall for their game.

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.075
This is just what
they want us to think.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.452
Um, I'm sorry!

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:44.370
I really shouldn't have
bothered you with this.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.876
[eerie music]

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.507
Huh? Hm.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.721
Uh, oh no. Mr. Poliman?

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.014
[Metropoliman] Now what?

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.682
[Hajime] I don't see
their angels anymore.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.017
What does that mean?

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.644
[Metropoliman] They're
sending a phony message

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.020
that they're not inside.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.106
Their angels are trying to
make us believe it, as well.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.733
Yes, of course.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.777
I just thought I should
at least report it.

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.906
[Baret] No reaction from Balta.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.783
It's unclear what he's thinking.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.201
Yeah, I see what you mean.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.828
He doesn't seem to
care that we've moved.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.121
We're both right here

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.790
and he's not trying to find us.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.212
[Hajime] [groans] Mr. Poliman?

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.715
[Metropoliman] Again?
What is it now?

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.759
The box is sealed.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.886
It must be hot in there.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.931
They've been flying around
in there this whole time

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.350
without drinking
a drop of water.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:50.561
I mean, it's very
impressive, don't you think?

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.772
They know they'll die
if they stop moving.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.315
They're desperate.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.818
I'm gonna go lie
down for a while.

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:58.820
Only contact me if
they stop moving,

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:01.239
or if there's some other
change in the situation.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.407
You got that?

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:03.449
[Hajime] Yes, sir!

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.371
This guy, Hajime, he's
proven rather useless.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.831
Just like I expected.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.921
[Revel gasping]

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:22.969
My head's about to explode.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.596
[ball clatters]

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.603
[Revel sighs]

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.903
Saki, have you been
up all night waiting?

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.700
They haven't come back yet.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.997
Mr. Mukaido and his
family and Mirai.

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:53.791
You think they're
still alive, right?

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:57.003
If they are, I'm sure they're

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.588
fighting for their
lives right now

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:01.924
and I'm no help.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.259
I can help!

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.969
[Mukaido] You can't
fight without wings!

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.057
There's nothing I
can do to help them.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.061
We'll change that,
Saki, you and I.

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.688
I'll become a first-rank angel.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.192
I know how hard you're trying
and thank you for that.

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.444
But either way, I'm
gonna go see them.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.571
Saki.

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.407
I'll fight even if
I don't have wings.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.742
You can't, Saki!

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.410
You're doing that
same thing again.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:32.080
You've lost confidence
because you feel powerless.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.540
You're about to make
a terrible mistake.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.542
Yes, but if I do nothing...

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:40.797
I know what you mean,
I'm in the same boat.

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.632
If I could become first-rank

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:44.425
I could give you those wings.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.511
I could give you the
hope you're missing.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.056
But I can't because
I'm so powerless.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.724
[ball clatters]

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:52.767
Revel.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:55.645
[Revel] I'm sorry, Saki.

00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:57.438
I want to help you so much.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.856
Um, Revel?

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.863
--Look at your tears.
--[Revel gasps]

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:08.658
What? That's odd.

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:11.327
Angels don't cry like this.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:15.665
According to all the Celestial
Tomes, only humans do.

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:17.959
Only humans can cry for others.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.088
Huh? What is this?

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.137
[Mukaido] Damn, my
vision's gone blurry

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.556
and I'm drifting in and
out of consciousness.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.725
[groans] So, this is the end.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.978
Without some kind of
miracle, we're finished.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:41.232
Aya, Nanaka.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.234
I'm sorry.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:47.905
It's ironic, I ended
up in this situation

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.116
because I clung to an angel.

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:54.537
But in the face of death,
I still turn to God.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.664
What, Revel?

00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.292
[God] Revel.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:00.710
Yes, God?

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:04.130
[God] I see you have shed tears.

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:06.090
[Revel] It's true, I have.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.383
And now that I've done so,

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:10.261
I'm no longer fit
to be an angel.

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.930
[God] This is truly
unprecedented.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:16.767
No angel has managed
this feat before.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:21.314
You are the first angel to
ever shed tears for a human

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.608
and it has transformed you.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:27.737
You have become an angel who
understands human emotions

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:30.114
and is able to
empathize with them.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.867
[Revel] Human emotions?

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:36.329
[God] You are now
a first-rank angel.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.414
You shall henceforth be known as

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:43.211
Revel, the Angel of Emotion.

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:47.256
The Angel of Emotion?

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.551
I've been promoted!

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.930
Here, Saki! Take these!

[uplifting music]

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:02.855
[gasps] Revel!

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.815
Saki, let's go.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.067
Your two friends need help.

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:08.903
Yeah!

--[Nasse gasps]
--[Saki whooshes]

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:15.243
[Nasse] Saki!

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.995
Revel, you pulled it off!

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.038
[Revel laughing]

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.998
[Saki] What's the
situation, Baret?

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.458
Not sure.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.043
Well, hello.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.962
It looks like everyone's
made an appearance.

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.129
Balta!

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.590
Revel, you've been
promoted to first-rank.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.008
Congratulations.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.219
He's always so unpleasant.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.137
You're the Angel of
Intuition, Balta.

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.847
What do you intend to do?

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:40.142
I'll have to check my
intuition and then decide.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.144
That intuition says this.

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:44.188
The new arrival is
a critical link.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.691
In fact, she's the
key to everything.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.026
[everyone gasps]

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.403
[Saki] What does that mean?

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.029
You should take care of business

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.698
and do what you came here for.

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.410
[Saki] Then I better...

00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.079
[arrow zings]

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:06.043
Saki, Metropoliman's probably
shot him with a red arrow.

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.087
You'd be giving yourself away.

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:09.213
It's okay, Saki.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.090
You should go ahead
and shoot him.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:14.135
Just be mindful of the cameras
Metropoliman has set up.

00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:15.177
[Saki sighs]

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:25.479
They must still be in there
invisibly flying around.

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.523
Such desperation.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.150
[Saki] Camera director app, on.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:33.654
[visor clicks]

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:36.490
Huh. I wonder what happens next.

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:41.662
[Saki] Three cameras,
distance 29.2 meters.

00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:45.374
[Hajime] Is it because of
their love for their families?

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.668
[Saki] I'm in a blind
spot here, I'm okay.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.130
[Hajime] These people
are so irritating!

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:52.506
Show yourselves!

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.342
[red arrow whooshes]

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:55.843
[Hajime gasps]

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:56.844
[Saki] I got him.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:57.887
That's perfect!

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.559
I've been shot. But by who?

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.188
Who did this? Who?

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:10.191
[contemplative music]

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:16.238
[Hajime sighs]

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.241
[contemplative music]

00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:20.993
This feeling is taking me over.

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.163
I'm unable to resist it!

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:28.959
I absolutely love that
girl with the cat ears!

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.797
It's true, I love
her! I love her!

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:38.010
But, what about Mr. Poliman?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.807
[grunts] No, I can't betray him.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:46.894
I'm Mr. Poliman's servant,
I love Mr. Poliman!

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.147
I have to be loyal. [screams]

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.858
I'm so torn, Mr.
Poliman! Can you help me?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.819
[Mirai] What's going on?

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.861
Excuse me?

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.159
[Hajime] I am Mr.
Poliman's loyal servant.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.703
But, but,

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:08.582
[sighs] but I just can't
resist that girl.

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:12.211
That girl! My love for
her grows and grows!

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:15.840
[Mirai] I think something's
happening outside, but why?

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.007
All they have to do is wait.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.217
They have an
overwhelming advantage.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.344
I don't understand.

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:21.846
If they were going to
make some kind of move,

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.389
wouldn't it just be to kill us?

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.641
Why the delay? Damn it.

00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:28.185
There must be a way we
can get out of this.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.690
[Mukaido gasping]

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:37.403
[Mukaido] I'm sorry Aya, Nanaka.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.822
This is not how I
expected things to end.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:41.866
I'm blessed.

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:46.412
I get to die surrounded
by the family I love.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.247
There's no greater happiness.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:50.624
Heck, there's even
an old song about it.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:53.419
It goes something like,
"You mustn't die before me,

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.964
even one day later
would be much better."

00:20:57.006 --> 00:21:00.301
I know that's selfish but
you understand, right?

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.261
[Aya] As a matter
of fact, I don't.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.471
You don't, huh?

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.848
Promise me something, seriously.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.224
That might be hard.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.559
I don't have much time left.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.394
I don't know if I
can give up smoking.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.273
--Promise you won't give up.
--Uh?

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:18.068
I want you to
demonstrate to Nanaka

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.653
and to the child I'm carrying

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:23.073
that you're someone who
didn't give up on life.

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:27.161
A man who kept on fighting
until the very end.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:30.873
[Mukaido] [gasps] I'm
not going to die here!

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.833
If my death means
they'll all be killed,

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.710
then I can't die like this.

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:37.755
I'll fight until my last breath
to keep that from happening!

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:42.426
[gentle music]

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:45.054
[Hajime moaning]

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.890
What's going on, Hajime?

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.809
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.644
I thought I was clear.

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.354
I told you to only contact me

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:54.730
if the prisoners stopped moving

00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:56.440
or if anything
important changed.

00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:57.650
So, which is it?

00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:00.486
He's right, I'm messing
this up, big-time.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.363
I'm still Mr. Poliman's servant!

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.366
I have a report.

00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:08.536
The truth is...

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:11.956
[Hajime gasps]

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.582
[Saki shushes]

00:22:13.624 --> 00:22:16.710
[gasps] She's so cute!

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:19.880
[Saki] I have to make him
fall head over heels for me

00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:22.508
and I have to make him
believe I love him back.

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:26.303
[Hajime moaning]

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:30.015
[Metropoliman] What's
the matter now, Hajime?

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:33.936
[Hajime] I love her.

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:36.605
[upbeat music]

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:40.568
Love? I love her?

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:44.321
--This is love.
--[upbeat music]

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:49.368
--Amazing. I'm in love!
--[upbeat music]

00:22:51.412 --> 00:22:56.417
[closing theme music]

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.461
[graphics clanging]
