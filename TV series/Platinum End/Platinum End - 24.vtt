00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:11.595
[ethereal music]

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:13.013
[Nakaumi] So this is heaven?

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:14.640
[Yazeli] You might
want to think of it

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.641
as a parallel dimension,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.852
existing alongside
the human world.

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:21.188
[Ogaro] Time passes at a
slightly slower rate here

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.856
than in the world you came from.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.693
[Nakaumi] I thought it
sounded awfully fishy

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.112
when I was told that
God could actually die.

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:33.492
At any rate, I'm
not feeling well.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.702
The creature has
infested in my body.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.664
And the fact is
I'm just a creature

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.999
wearing Shuji Nakaumi's skin.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.834
An apple that tastes
like an orange

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.837
is merely an orange
wearing an apple's skin.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.631
You sound so God-like, Nakaumi.

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:50.676
Don't say Nakaumi, call him God.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.971
The creature's consciousness
is inside my head.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:57.891
Will it encroach on my body
and my way of thinking too?

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.977
Two consciousnesses
exist within you

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.854
but Shuji Nakaumi's
consciousness will control God

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.108
from now on until
you ultimately merge.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.902
Merge. How long will that take?

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.862
We do not know the
answer to that.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.582
[triumphant music]

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:25.460
[water splashing]

00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:28.880
We preserve all
humans as they appear

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.091
at the moment of their deaths.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.511
[Nakaumi] Can you tell me why
it is necessary to do that?

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:35.929
[Ogaro] I cannot answer that.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.890
We do not know anything
God does not know.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.434
How can you not know?

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.060
[God] Because I created humans.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.355
It is my responsibility to
preserve the end of their lives.

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:48.734
This tradition dates back
to the earliest days.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.569
[Nakaumi] Who are you?

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.113
[God] The God that
entered your body?

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:56.533
[Nakaumi] God? The creature...

00:01:56.575 --> 00:02:00.078
You're telling me it was the
creature that created humans.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.540
That can't be right.
Humans created God.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.377
[God] That may be correct, too.

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:11.465
I was created as well.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.926
And once I was created,
I created the humans.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.304
[Nakaumi] What are you
talking about, creature?

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:19.473
[God] You heard correctly.

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:22.684
I do not know what
created me either.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.603
[Ogaro] God, is
something the matter?

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:29.024
No. I'm just a little tired.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:31.151
Could you leave
me alone, please?

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.153
As you are attendant, I
shall will remain here.

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.364
The other angels may all leave.

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:40.327
[Nakaumi] If the
angels don't know

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.412
anything God doesn't know,

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:44.831
then I'll have to figure
it out for myself.

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:49.378
That way, at the very least,
I can tell Professor Yoneda

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.215
which came first, the
creature or the humans.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.348
[Red Arrow chiming]

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.936
[Yoneda] Temari. Are you
watching for a reaction?

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:06.937
[Temari] I'm looking professor,

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:09.606
but I have to report:
Nothing's happening.

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.191
Since you don't confide in me,

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.526
I don't have the slightest idea

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:13.944
what it is you're researching.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.237
[Yoneda] You may not see it

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.864
but I can assure you
it's what you wanted.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.075
[Temari] Excuse
me? What I wanted?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.077
Love?

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.453
[Yoneda] Exactly.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.788
[Temari] I'm right?

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.040
[Yoneda] Yes. I have
to say I'm surprised,

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.126
considering your obsession
with material things,

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.253
I thought greed
would be your focus.

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:35.048
It's true when I was poor,
all I could think about

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.008
was how to get a lot
of brand name products.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.760
But now that I have
a good paying job,

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:41.847
everything's different. These
days building up the balance

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.224
in my savings account
is what makes me happy.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.768
[Yoneda] Hmm.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.730
That's not unusual,
considering human psychology.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.400
As the world has
had its memory wiped

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.277
of the God selection process,

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.988
and things have returned
to how they once were,

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.281
I think it was very considerate

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.950
of Nakaumi to let me
keep my Red Arrow.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.828
Since he was willing
to leave it behind,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.913
I have no choice,
but to analyze it.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.249
Could I ask you something?

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.250
[Temari] Sure.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.002
Do you have any memory
of the time between

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.463
leaving your old job and
coming to work with me?

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.089
--Nope.
--[whimsical music]

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.175
You should undergo a full
examination at some point.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.635
But I'm not experiencing
any problems, so why?

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:21.887
There's no guarantee you

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.805
don't have brain
damage or a tumor.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.807
If you wait too long to
discover such a thing

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.392
it'll be too late to treat.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.019
Well, when you
put it that way...

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.061
Under the circumstances,

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.105
I should examine every
last inch of you.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.648
Wait a minute!

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.275
You're not entertaining dirty
thoughts are you, professor?

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.277
Of course not! What
do you take me for?

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.072
What I have in mind is
making you my Guinea pig.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.241
Otherwise I have no
interest to interact

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.743
with another person's body.

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.370
Professor?

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:51.541
Why do I have these sensors
stuck on every part of my body?

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.294
I thought you were just
examining my brain?

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.046
Let's begin Naoi.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.088
[Naoi] Yes, sir.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.218
[Red Arrow humming]

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.095
[gasps] Huh? Her heart
rate suddenly increased.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.182
What's going on with
her hormone output?

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.101
[Yoneda] All of
her levels exceed

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.062
the range of standard values.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.688
This proves she's in love.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.274
It must be because I used
my Red Arrow on her,

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.319
and I still don't
know how it works.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.905
This is serious. According
to my calculations

00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:24.783
you need to be hospitalized
for 33 days, young lady.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.159
What? No! No way.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.329
I wanna stay right here in
the lab with you, professor.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.497
It'll be right.

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.374
I'll come by and
visit you every day.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.792
You mean it? You promise?

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.877
Of course I do.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.505
I promise to observe
you and gather data.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.093
[male student] Hey Mirai,
I hear you got a job.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:44.261
[Mirai] Yep.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.262
[male student]
Where you working?

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.263
[Mirai] At a flower shop.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.181
What made you pick that?

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.141
[Saki] We've decided to
run a flower shop together

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.142
in the future.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.769
[Both] Wha--?

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.230
[Saki] A flower shop that
sells four-leaf clovers.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:57.524
Does that mean you two
plan to like you married

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.525
or something?

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:00.026
[Saki] Mhm.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.778
Are you serious? I'm just
finding out you two are dating

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.989
and here you are
ready to tie the knot!

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.740
I wanted to be true to myself,

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.618
and work to toward my
goals while I was at it.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.329
Oh... I can tell you're
really serious about this.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.165
I'm envious, I hope I can
find true love one day.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.959
Hey Maiko, you want to go out?

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.294
Ew! Why would I date you?

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.379
Well, we're not seeing anyone--

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:20.463
[Maiko] We're not compatible!

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.340
[male student] It was
just a suggestion.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.135
No scar. I'm grateful for that.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.178
Thank God. It just went away.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.143
[Yoneda] Congratulations
on being discharged Temari.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.353
[Temari] Thanks. I feel
like I've just gotten over

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.855
a bout of love sickness.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:39.441
You seem to be back to normal.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.193
Unfortunately I failed
to find out anything

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.404
that would tell me how
those Red Arrows work.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.325
[bird cawing]

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.243
Nakaumi.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.833
Send Meyza in next.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.003
[Father] We appreciate
the fact that you're here,

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:01.630
but you really didn't
need to come see us.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.964
We already knew.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.216
Yes, that's right. We were
so sure of your intentions.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.969
We almost jumped the gun and
proposed the marriage ourselves

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:10.180
[Mirai] Really? Well.
There was no need for that.

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.599
I'm sure that your parents
are happy about this union,

00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:14.309
looking down on it from heaven.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.187
Right.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.647
[Saki] Okay.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.607
I believe that gets the
formalities out of the way.

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:21.816
[Father] It looks
to us like the rest

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.401
is up to you youngsters, huh?

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.444
[Saki] Guess so.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.907
I told you not to wear a
suit. It was a huge tip off.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.825
[Mirai] I wanted to wear it.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.620
[Saki] Let's stop by the
market and pick up some things.

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.246
I'll make us dinner.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.248
[Mirai] Saki, aren't you tired?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.917
[Saki] I wanna make dinner.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.085
[Mirai sighs]

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.419
[woman on television]
The question is,

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.629
what makes you happy?

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.047
[man on television] For me?

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.299
Happy is staying healthy
and going to work every day.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.801
Happiness is becoming rich.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:51.012
You dummy don't you know that
money can't buy happiness?

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.597
What kind of question is that?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.391
Eating tasty food, obviously.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.809
What makes me happy?

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.435
I'll tell you I've
thought about it a lot

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.437
but I really don't
have a good answer.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:00.730
[Man] When I'm with my family.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.066
[Woman] Loving someone
and being loved in return.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:04.067
[Saki] Here you go.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.277
So what makes you happy?

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.071
You know that's bad
chopstick etiquette.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.864
Oh, come on, answer
the question.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.282
Seriously?

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.951
Yes.

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:17.163
Hmm. The meaning
of life, I guess.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.873
Happiness is the
meaning of life?

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.167
I'm not sure I
understand your logic.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.506
I think everyone
wonders at some point

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:27.716
why they're were born,

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:31.928
or more importantly,
what they're living for.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.930
I don't claim to have of
the answer for anybody,

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.516
but I think the
reason we're born,

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.143
is to find happiness.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.687
My earliest memories of my
mother explaining that to me.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.356
And I don't think I've ever
changed my mind about it.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.693
Of course, part of
the process involves

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.195
trying to make those
around me happy as well,

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.447
not just myself.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.950
[Saki] Wouldn't it be nice
if the people around you

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:57.454
automatically became happy
whenever you were happy?

00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.414
[Mirai] Yeah.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.500
So what about you, Saki?

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.752
What makes you happy?

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.295
God's protection.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.671
What? You mean that?

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.465
[Saki] At the end of the process

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.092
we could have ended up
in a pretty bad place.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.928
Instead we witnessed
Nakaumi ascend to heaven.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.513
If we hadn't been
saved by the angels,

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.515
we wouldn't be happy right now.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.516
[Mirai] I guess you're right.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.809
[Saki] And because of that,

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.937
I pray to God every single day.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.814
I pray to God for peace on earth

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:27.358
so that everyone has
a chance at happiness.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.029
Maybe I'll start doing that too.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.824
[Saki] Alrighty. Last question.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:35.825
[Mirai] There's more?

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:37.035
Of course, I haven't asked you

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.370
the most important question yet.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.207
Tell me Mirai Kakehashi, when
do you feel the happiest?

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.833
You just wanna make me say it.

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:46.544
It sounds like you figured
it out, so tell me,

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.505
is it when you're eating
a delicious meal cooked

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.631
by your fiance?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.426
Okay. I'll be serious.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.720
As long as I can
get a little sappy.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:56.763
Um, go on.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.518
[Mirai] You know what
makes me feel the happiest?

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.269
When I see you smiling, Saki.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:11.778
[Saki] Mirai...

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.571
Can I stay over tonight?

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.405
[Mirai] Nope. Not allowed.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.282
We only met with
your parents today.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.534
[Saki] Why not?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:18.993
Isn't it okay now that
we've talked to them?

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.412
I'll give 'em a call, I'm
sure they'll be fine with it.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.081
[Mirai] Absolutely not.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.417
That just leaves Nasse.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.460
Yes.

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:31.589
[Nakaumi] Before we talk,
I wanna ask you something.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.049
[God] What is it?

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.634
[Nakaumi] During
this election process

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.428
I heard Nasse was an
exceptional angel.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.597
The only one capable
of touching humans,

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.642
and the one who had a major
impact on the encounters.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.770
Tell me why this special-rank
angel is so exceptional.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.064
Who exactly is Nasse?

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:51.067
[God] When I descended to earth,

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.319
before any life should
have existed on it,

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:57.448
I found a tiny life form
there. That presence was Nasse.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.535
I do not know what kind
of life form it was,

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.037
whether a microorganism
or bacteria,

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:06.457
but regardless Nasse
entered my body.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.502
I removed this intruder
as quickly as I could.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:13.464
If Nasse ended up possessing
some tiny fraction of my cells

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.009
due to this encounter,
I hoped it would compel

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.469
this life form to act
in God's interest.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.848
But alas, it would seem
Nasse understood nothing.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.476
[bell tolling]

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.646
[hopeful music]

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.273
[Mirai] I swear
love and support you

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.942
from this day forward,
for better or worse,

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.694
in sickness and in health,

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.655
for richer or poorer,
till death do us part.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.698
[Saki] As do I.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:43.161
I'm so happy, I could
die at this very moment.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.579
Yeah. Me too.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.582
[gasps]

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.667
She said she could
die this very moment.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.045
That's just a sign
of how happy she is.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:54.672
In that case. It's finally
over. I'm satisfied.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.466
Huh?

00:11:56.507 --> 00:12:00.678
Nasse, what do you
mean it's finally over?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.264
[Ogaro] God is calling
for you, Nasse.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:04.641
What for?

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.726
He apparently has a question
for special-rank angels.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:07.769
Huh?

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.318
You're asking what I was
before I became an angel?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.361
It's a mystery.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.987
But now that I am an angel,

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.948
I listen to Saki
pray to you every day

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.909
to protect the world and help
everyone find their happiness.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.745
Mirai said he might
start doing that as well.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:27.622
Lately, my lord,
it seems as though

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.123
you have something on your mind.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.709
All the angels are beside
themselves with worry.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.295
We're concerned that you might
be feeling so down right now,

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:35.880
you might not want
to be God anymore.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.340
[Ogaro] Nasse.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.345
[Nasse] Oh, sorry.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.305
We all wish you
the best of luck.

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:46.975
Are the angels telling
me to focus my attention

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:50.103
on the human world and
act more like a God?

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:53.022
You do not need to pay
any he to what Nasse says.

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.149
[Nakaumi] After all this,

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.776
I can't believe
the God candidates

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.988
still worship Shuji Nakaumi
as their Lord and master.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.576
Okay Saki. I'm
gonna take off now

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.412
and make our stores
very first delivery.

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.664
Great. Be careful out there.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.546
[Nakaumi] How much time has
passed in the human world?

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:18.548
[Ogaro] It has been
six years and one day

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:21.342
since Shuji Nakaumi became God.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:24.804
[Nakaumi] Six years. I was
told time passed more quickly

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:27.473
in the human world,
but that is...

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:33.688
[Yoneda] I've
developed the ability

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.023
to keep it suspended in space.

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:36.024
--But still--
--[Temari] Sir?

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.483
There's a delivery
that came for you

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:38.818
and it's huge and heavy.

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.405
I think it's from
your married friends.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.406
Married friends?

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.074
[Temari] I wonder what it is?

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.618
I guess we won't know
until we open it.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.995
Oh, wow!

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:52.248
These flowers are beautiful!
There's an enclosure card.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.376
So you have got
friends after all!

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:57.879
I was beginning to wonder.
When did you meet them?

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:01.674
Well, what kind of relationship

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.760
do you have with the Kakehashis?

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:05.386
[Yoneda] I don't
have any friends.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:08.014
If an association must
be made between us,

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.891
I'd say we were fellow soldiers.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.603
I had no idea you'd ever
served. In what war?

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:14.896
What a bother.

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:17.899
Now I'm forced to somehow
return the gesture.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.693
And this is why I dislike
associating with people.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.321
It cost me valuable
time in my research.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.822
Did I just see you smile?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.700
No, I haven't smiled in years.

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:30.703
[Nakaumi] I see. So
Nasse say was right.

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:31.913
What about the others?

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.418
[Foreman] Nakaumi! Break time!

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.461
Right!

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.047
[Yumiki] Reporting.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:43.841
You called from me,
assistant commissioner?

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.218
Yes. Do you have an update?

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.013
This section is confusing to me.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.849
Which part? Oh yeah, that.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.310
I don't understand
what it means either.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:55.645
Thanks. You're a big help.

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.940
[Nakaumi] I'm glad
everyone seems happy,

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.566
but it's distraction.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.361
I should be looking at
people who want to die.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.197
[echoing popping]

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.411
[somber ethereal music]

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:17.959
How many humans are committing
suicide at this very moment?

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.710
Even without my assistance,

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.880
people who truly want
to die keep dying.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.841
I was like the
frog and the well.

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:27.051
Shuji Nakaumi was only looking

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.262
at the handful of
people around him

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:30.763
who said they wanted to die.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.891
Looking at the
entirety of the world

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.726
makes me wanna save humanity.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:38.813
I see the disparities
of the world I created.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.398
What is this place?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.733
Some people live
in towers so tall

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.610
they look down on the clouds,

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.779
while others sit on the
ground as they starve,

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.573
because they have no homes.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.534
Some people eat
whatever they please

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.411
then throw away the leftovers.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.956
Some people don't even have a
single cup of water to drink.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.749
Some people control the weak.

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.794
Some people have their
lives taken by others.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.882
And alongside it all,

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:08.718
there are the millions of
people who pray to God.

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:12.513
This is the world
I've inherited?

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.432
What was the previous God doing?

00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:17.185
[God] Watching.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:20.813
God's responsibility is
to create life on Earth.

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:23.774
Life multiplies, even
without intervention,

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.902
so there is no need
to do anything.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.572
[Nakaumi] No need
to do anything?

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:30.865
So you just stand by

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.242
and let the humans
handle the challenge?

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.952
Is that the right choice?

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.580
If so, there is
no need for a God.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:41.250
No, this God is a false
God to begin with.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.793
It's in the professor's book.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.838
God is imaginary and
has no physical form.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.007
So there's no way of
knowing if he dies.

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.968
As long as people believe
in God, He will not die.

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.430
It's not as though
Shuji Nakaumi became God

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:55.973
because he wanted to.

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:58.893
He was just a middle school
student who wanted to die.

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:03.648
My death would cause
problems for heaven,

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.608
but it would alert
the professor.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.611
The Red Arrow I allowed
him to keep would vanish.

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:10.696
That would tell him
the creature is gone.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.824
[Ogaro] Are you all right?

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.867
I'm fine.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.954
But I've learned
something important.

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.958
I must quickly find a way
to tell the professor.

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.962
I need you to gather
the first-rank angels.

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.255
[Ogaro] There are
thousands of them.

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:28.839
[Nakaumi] Then gather
the angels chosen

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.591
for the God selection process

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.177
except for Muni,
Meyza, and Nasse.

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.220
[Ogaro] Very well.

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:37.431
Penema. Baret. Revel.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.893
[Nakaumi] Now there's no one
around to try and stop me.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.061
[ominous ethereal music]

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.146
[God] Do not do
this. It is wrong.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:48.025
[Revel] No way...

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.111
[Penema] What the- Hey, Revel?

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.488
[Baret gasps]

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.073
[screaming]

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.908
[Ogaro] The angels are
vanishing. What's happening?

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:57.702
Wait a minute.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.913
[foreboding humming]

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.082
Oh no...

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.209
The moment I turned
my back on him.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.919
God killed Himself!

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.212
This never would've happened

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:11.048
if he had merged completely
with the old God!

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.259
I tried to keep a
close eye on him,

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.845
but Shuji Nakaumi's
will was strong enough

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.138
to delay their fusion.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.640
I can't believe it...

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.100
Heaven is done for.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.936
[Ogaro bellowing]

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:31.485
Congrats Muni, you've
successfully destroyed heaven.

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:32.528
Yes.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.199
Guess I'm gonna vanish
too, no way around it.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.161
Bye-bye.

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.290
[Yoneda] The Red Arrow.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.333
It vanished!

00:18:47.001 --> 00:18:47.918
[Saki] Our flowers.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.961
Huh?

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.090
[woman screams]

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.550
My baby!

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.969
She was right here a minute
ago! Has anyone seen her?

00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:58.012
Huh? Mari-

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.890
[Man] Those girls
just disappeared.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:01.932
Both of them!

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:07.563
[somber ethereal music]

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:13.986
[Temari] This is impossible.

00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:16.155
All life forms on the
planet are vanishing

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.365
starting with the youngest!

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.743
[Yoneda] The Red Arrow vanished.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.120
The angels are gone as well.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.373
Could this be a
message from Nakaumi?

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.210
Don't be afraid.

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:35.591
Ogaro said God has always had
the power to end humanity.

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:38.803
Does... does that
mean we're already...?

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.847
Probably, since that's
what Nakaumi chose to do.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.141
Saki.

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.104
Yes, Mirai?

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.148
Death comes to everyone.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.776
It's just sooner
than we thought.

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.362
If Nasse and Revel hadn't
been there to save us,

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.197
we would've perished
a long time ago.

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:02.368
So I'm grateful.
Because they rescued us,

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.829
we were able to find
so much happiness.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.123
[Saki] True.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.210
[Mirai] And losing the
one I loved before I died

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.587
would've been
unbelievably painful.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.966
If I get to die at the
same moment as you,

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.636
then I'm happy.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.310
[Saki] Me too.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:32.148
[tense ethereal music]

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.035
[Mirai] Thank you,

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:46.746
Nasse.

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:52.168
[Yoneda] There was
an entity in heaven

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:55.045
who could create and
destroy all life on earth.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.630
That was God.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:59.049
That must be what
Nakaumi is telling me.

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:02.303
The question is,
was my theory wrong?

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.847
No, I'm right.

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.015
I'm sure of it.

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:07.600
No matter what anyone says

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:10.644
God was created by
human imagination.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:13.522
--[gasps]
--Profess--

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.734
[Yoneda] If the creature
can eradicate all life,

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.653
then heaven, the angels,
and the creature itself

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:22.156
are humanity destroying weapons.

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:23.657
The creature's goal in the end

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.660
must be to totally
wipe out our species.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:29.747
It's far more realistic
to think of it that way.

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:33.417
The one mistake in my
theory is its organization.

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.503
No. Its energy.

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:38.506
Precisely! The science of it!

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:41.091
The science I had
yet to discover.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.427
The identity of the creature.

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:46.514
[glasses shattering]

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.985
[dramatic ethereal chorus]

00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:45.239
