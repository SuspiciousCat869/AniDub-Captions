00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:10.636
Minister Suzuki,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.803
please don't do anything

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.138
that would injure
the God candidates

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.973
or put their lives at risk.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.642
We're attempting to
capture them now,

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.770
in order to protect the
safety of the people.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:22.189
The helicopters were not
dispatched to attack them,

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.690
only to secure them.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.859
Don't tell me you believe

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.904
in all this God selection
nonsense, Professor.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:29.988
What's happening right now

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.908
is a bona-fide God selection
process, Prime Minister.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.911
And this time, they
aren't even bothering

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.412
to hide their faces.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.457
I can assure you, they have no
intention of harming anyone.

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.668
[Suzuki] Do you have
any better evidence?

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.002
Set your watch, Prime Minister.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.004
I'll prove it to
you within 24 hours.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.840
For now, attacking those
people is out of the question.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.260
If anything, you should
really be protecting them.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.011

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.975
Wow, cool.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.435
Look at all those helicopters,
they're flying right next to us.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.438
I'm gonna use my Red Arrow
on the people inside.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.439
Wait, Susumu.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.482
Huh?

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.734
All we have to do is relocate.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.278
Oh, yeah, you're right.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.862
We all need to split up.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.073
Let's head to
locations B through F.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.074
Okay!

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:15.492
--Got it.
--[bodies whoosh]

[Man] There's a God candidate
above the TV station

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:42.519
in Roppongi?

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.147
In Shiodome, Daiba,
and Shibuya, as well.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.565
[Man] They're here, too!

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.358
There's one above us.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.403

[helicopter blades whirring]

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:02.581
What's up?

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.624
Why are they leaving?

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.502
[phone vibrating]

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:08.545
Ms. Yumiki?

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.757
[Yumiki] Prime Minister
Suzuki has ordered

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.675
the helicopters to withdraw.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.469
Apparently, they've
called off their attempts

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.511
to capture you.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.514
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.976
[drone blades whirring]

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.198
Everyone, please listen to us.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.992
We five candidates will each
announce what we plan to do

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.078
in the event we become God.

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:44.414
The final God candidate
has been in touch with us,

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:47.000
and says he won't show
himself unless we do this.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:51.838
All right, then, let's begin.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:59.846
[opening theme music]

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.641
[Boy] What the hell?

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.226
Isn't that Kakehashi?

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.644
And Hanakago!

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:30.937
[Female] Come on, no way!

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.481
[Female] They're
both God candidates?

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.316
[Male] Two of 'em in our class?

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.151
You knew, didn't you, Maiko?

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:37.736
Oh, please.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.696
[Maiko sighs]

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.072
[Man] The five God candidates

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.284
who vanished from Yurakucho
District have now reappeared,

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:46.870
hovering over
various TV stations.

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:50.665
Each one will outline what they
would do if they became God.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.084
The entire country,
no, the entire world,

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.294
will be watching them.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:56.713
[drone blades whirring]

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.048
Should I begin now?

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.050
Well, then, let's see.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.636
If I became God,
I'd create a world

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.262
where anybody who wanted to die,

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.264
could do so painlessly
at any time,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.682
and be commended for it.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.226
Huh?

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.227
Suicide?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.228
[Man] Commended?

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.188
[Woman] What?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.231
I'm on board.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.318
I'd die right now if I knew
I could die painlessly.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.320
Better than causing
trouble for others.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.367
I've gotta say, that
boy's got some good ideas.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.495
[Yoneda sighs]

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.121
From my point of view,

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.791
an ideal world is one where
people don't have to work.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.877
A world where everybody
leads a fun, easy life.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.463
Robots and AI would do
all the work for us.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.299
Not having to work sounds
like a pretty good deal.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.676
You're probably
asking yourselves,

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:45.136
"But how would people
get so much money?"

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.764
In other words, how
would everybody be rich?

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.307
I don't know the answer to that,

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.935
so I want someone who can
figure it out to become God,

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:52.936
instead of me.

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:53.937
[crowd giggles]

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.313
She doesn't even
wanna become God.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.816
Is this the best the God
candidates have to offer?

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:01.236
No kidding, I mean, are any
of them taking this seriously?

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.530
So this is what I've decided.

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:05.031
It'd be nice to live in a world

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.158
where I could just
play with my friends.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.995
Where I didn't have to go
to school, cram for tests,

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.997
and be made fun of
on the internet.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.248
No kidding.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.166
You say one wrong
word on social media

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.585
and suddenly you're a target.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.378
That's a trade-off
for technology.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.922
Phones are way too
essential these days.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.133
I certainly wouldn't
wanna be without one.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.509
[foot tapping]

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.595
They're all addressing
modern-day issues,

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.347
but their thinking is
too narrow and shallow.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.515
The real question everybody

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.225
should be addressing is simple,

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:35.312
what should humanity
aim for, going forward?

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.022
But now that my life's changed,

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.982
I don't care about
all that anymore.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.276
Being a God candidate
is exciting enough.

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.986
I like it a lot.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.237
I feel really alive.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.656
Every day is a new adventure.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.242
I think if everyone could
experience this excitement,

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.953
the world would be way more
fun than it is right now.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.455
So here's my suggestion.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.081
I think it would spice things up

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.876
if everyone on the planet was
given their own White Arrow!

00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:58.835
[Woman] A what?

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.211
[Man] Did he say White Arrows?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.422
Wait, aren't those the
ones that kill people?

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:03.632
That'd be hella crazy.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.716
What's wrong with him?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.430
[drone blades whirring]

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.186
This whole transformation
happened so suddenly.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.313
I've been spending a
lot of time thinking

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.816
about what I'd do
if I became God

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.819
but I still don't
have an answer.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.489
I hope for a world
where everyone can smile

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.116
where they can all
experience true happiness

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.451
and the warmth of love.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.666
[Yoneda] That just leaves Red.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.709
I believe his angel
is special-rank.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.131
If I were to become God,

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:50.470
I wouldn't do anything.

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.431
[suspenseful music]

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.646
Let's go back to location A.

[Akai gasps]

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.484
[Akai] The God candidates
have just now return

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.277
to Yurakucho District.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.363
All right, the five
of us have spoken up.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.324
Your partner can
come join us now.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:13.493
[man gasps]

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.744
Red is definitely the leader.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.455
He has the intense
sincerity of a young man.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.458
I must be careful not
to betray that passion.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.502
The real question I'm
confronted with is,

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:23.753
can I convince them?

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.717
Let's go, Muni.

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.051
[Muni] Hmm.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:31.553
Professor Yoneda,
where are you going?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.725
I'm off to the
Yurakucho District.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:37.726
Huh?

[suspenseful music]

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.407
[Mirai] This man is the
final God candidate.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:54.743
Professor Yoneda?

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:55.910
Huh?

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.579
Huh? Seriously?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.122
Whoa, it's really him!

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.498
Wait, who is he?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.918
This is amazing, Professor,
I've read all your books!

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.295
[Yoneda] One second.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.671
[All] Huh?

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.548
In one second, light can travel

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.301
around the earth 7 1/2 times.

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:14.512
Have any of you
candidates given it a try?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.014
I have.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.141
I've tested how many times I
can travel around the earth

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.392
in one second.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.311
How many laps do you
think I completed?

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.230
You should try it sometime,

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.567
if you do, you'll realize
one second is infinite.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:28.568
[Nakaumi sighs]

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.028
[Man] Isn't that
Professor Yoneda?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.029
[Man] What?

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.030
Hey, you're right!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.364
[Woman] Is he a God candidate?

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.034
[Man] Well, he must be,
if he's up there, right?

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.368
There's no question.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.454
That's definitely
Professor Yoneda.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.540
Nobel Prize winner and
National Honor recipient.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.918
He's often said to be
the world's smartest man.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.796
And now Professor Gaku
Yoneda has been revealed

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.380
as a God candidate.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:54.177
That is correct, I am
Professor Gaku Yoneda.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.012
I am also a God candidate,

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.347
I've come here
today to declare

00:09:57.388 --> 00:10:01.518
that this God selection
process is absolutely genuine.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.395
[suspenseful music]

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.398
[Suzuki] The professor
himself is a God candidate?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.610
So this is what he meant when
he told me he'd prove it.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.446
Quite a surprise.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.449
[Man] That's incredible!

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.993
[Man] Professor Yoneda
is a God candidate!

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.411
[Man] They should
just vote him in.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.288
[Man] That settles that then!

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.791
[Yoneda] I trust the five
of you aren't planning

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:28.044
to surround me like
these drones, are you?

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.588
Don't worry, we just
wanna talk things over.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.549
Yes, in fact we
should talk it over.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.634
Humans are quite
capable of talking

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.554
and it would be the best
option for everyone.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:40.431
Good then, let's go
have a nice, quiet chat.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.058
That won't be necessary.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.602
In fact, I'd prefer
to do this in public.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.480
I want the world to understand
what's happening right now.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.650
What I'm about to say next
is only a theory of mine.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.652
However, I've given it
quite a bit of thought,

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.612
and I believe it to be correct.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.824
Judge for yourselves
whether or not you agree.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.450
First off, I have to warn you,

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.661
you're missing something
very important.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.538
You might even say
you're being deceived

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.455
in this whole process.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.707
And interestingly,

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.209
Metropoliman seemed
to have understood it.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:09.627
Deceived by who?

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.087
What are you talking about?

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.006
I know this may come as a shock,

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:15.508
but Metropoliman
didn't believe in God.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.261
[Metropoliman] How do
you get people to believe

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.471
in something as
unrealistic as God?

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.516
You're saying God doesn't exist?

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.102
You misunderstand,
He does, currently.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:31.482
But he's not the God the
world imagines Him to be.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:35.111
In fact, he's a fake God.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:41.201
[humming]

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.332
[suspenseful music]

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:56.549
Red, you said you wouldn't do
anything if you became God.

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.635
Exactly why is that?

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:00.637
To promote independence.

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:03.097
People need to stand
on their own two feet.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.350
If one of us was to become God

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.936
and changed people's
lives from up in Heaven,

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:11.105
it'd be nothing but an
invisible dictatorship.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:12.398
[Yoneda] Exactly.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.734
And the world doesn't
need a God like that.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.986
Could you explain that
in layman's terms?

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.571
You want it simplified, huh?

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:22.533
Then let me ask the five of
you, no, all of humanity.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.203
Tell me which of
these came first,

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.205
humans or God?

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:28.373
Humans, right?

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.541
No, God made humans.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.709
Maybe not.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.710
It's God, right?

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.671
The story is that
God was here first,

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:36.589
and then he created
Adam and Eve.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.592
That's a myth humans made
up to explain things.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:43.304
The universe was formed
about 13.8 billion years ago.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.891
The earth was born
4.6 billion years ago.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.518
Water formed on the planet,

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:51.187
and microorganisms
began to appear.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:54.941
They evolved into fish,
amphibians, and reptiles.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.651
Then, mankind was born.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.948
Eventually, humans learned
to hunt and grow crops.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.659
Soon after, they started
praying to the heavens

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.996
to provide more food
during the lean times.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.956
Eventually, humans invented God

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.000
to be the object
of their prayers.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.420
Everything I've said so far
is more than just my theory.

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.630
It's accepted historical fact.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.549
Did you understand that?

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.009
We're following so far.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.969
I guess so, more or less.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.138
You said we're being
deceived, I don't understand.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:27.348
Could you hurry up
and get to that part.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.225
Nowadays, things have advanced.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.352
Humans perform
surgical procedures

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:32.353
and gene manipulation,

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.605
all of which were once
considered sacrilegious,

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.817
and we've even set
foot in outer space.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:40.695
It's impossible to believe
God exists in Heaven.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:44.824
I probably shouldn't be
telling the whole world

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.701
that God doesn't exist.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.495
And, certainly, I cannot
deny that teachings based

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.248
in religion and mythology
have improved humanity.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.168
Questioning their
faith does nothing

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:57.211
but aggravate true believers.

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.840
In my writings, I've
denied the existence

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.467
of spirits and souls.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:05.970
Things that can't be proven
through scientific observation.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.972
But since becoming
a God candidate,

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.766
I've been told about
God's existence

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:11.809
and even interacted with angels.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.228
Honestly, at first I
doubted my own eyes,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.564
but I've come to
believe it's the truth.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.443
And since it's the
truth, I have no choice.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.070
Angels fly around
in front of me,

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.906
so I must acknowledge
God's existence.

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:26.908
However, I've arrived
at the conclusion

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.702
that what has created them is
nothing more than energy born

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.662
from the human imagination.

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:34.457
I believe it's an energy
that strongly desires them

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:35.917
as objects for prayers.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.836
And the logical extension
of that desire is

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.797
to create an all-powerful entity

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:43.049
we've come to refer to as God.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:45.218
Humanity has produced
a creature designed

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.845
to be worshiped and glorified.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.639
When he says a creature,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.433
does he mean like a
beast, or monster?

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:55.019
[Yoneda] This entity
is a man-made creation.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.854
A false spirit who draws energy

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.065
from people who believe in God.

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:02.151
As the number of true believers
has decreased over time,

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.903
so has His energy,

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.531
pushing Him to the brink
of disappearing entirely.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.867
So, He deceived even the angels

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.954
and began the God
selection process.

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:15.706
To prevent Himself
from disappearing?

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.166
That's correct.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:19.335
So far, it's all gone
according to plan,

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:20.837
with the God selection process

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.922
now being broadcast worldwide.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:25.341
Once a candidate is
chosen to become God,

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.761
many people will once more
believe that God exists.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.263
What I'm trying to say is

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:33.933
that the age of praying to
God has now come to an end.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:34.934
[Mirai groans]

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.352
[suspenseful music]

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:37.728
We should be screaming for help

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.565
from somebody here on
earth, not from God.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:41.899
When we encounter problems,

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.193
we should work on coming
up with solutions,

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.779
not getting on our
knees and praying.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.532
Rather than repenting and
begging God for forgiveness,

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.118
we should surrender
and pay for our crimes.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.203
Human knowledge,
science, and medicine

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.330
will someday overcome
all the challenges

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.374
that make us vulnerable
as a species.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.625
In the near future,

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:02.170
that will even make
immortality possible.

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.714
What's important to humanity
are the opportunities

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:07.925
that continually lie before
us, and to always be focused

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.803
on the positive advances we
can accomplish as a species,

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.722
while living here
in the present.

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:15.057
We should finally
say, there is no God.

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:17.894
Those of us chosen to be God
candidates should lead the way

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:18.978
to this enlightenment.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.605
It should be clear to all,

this world doesn't
need God anymore.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.628
We don't have a
complete understanding

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:44.629
of their abilities.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.005
Don't take your eyes off them.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.048
[Man] Roger that.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.592
[Man] Roger.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:50.885
[Man] Roger.

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:52.386
[Man] Roger.

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.013
[Man]
Roger.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.056
[Man] Roger.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.643
So what we have here is a
spirit that's been formed

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:02.480
by human prayer and angels
who simply exist to be used

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.023
by a weakened God.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:07.193
My angel Muni seeks the
destruction of this false Heaven

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.819
that produces nothing.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.030
The destruction of Heaven?

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.866
[Revel] Human prayer
and manipulated angels.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.077
That's an interesting idea, huh?

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.870
What's the problem, Revel?

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.706
It just occurred to me that
the Origin of Heaven states

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.626
that God is supported
by human prayer.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:24.877
I'm surprised, Nasse,

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.837
every special-rank
angel should know that.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.048
Acting innocently without
getting bogged down

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.802
in details is what's always
made Nasse special-rank.

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:34.679
That's useless in games
like this, though.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.806
It means you can't
strategize properly.

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:37.848
Hey, everybody,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.101
you're making me sound
like some kind of idiot.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.273
[Yoneda] Muni, I understand
what your goal is,

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:46.899
but you have to consider this.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:50.945
There may be an angel among the
other 12 who will interfere.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.321
[Muni] Mm.

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:55.032
[Yoneda] And what will that
angel's special power be?

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:59.078
Muni's answer was "Mm,"
which meant I don't know.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.705
So which one is it?

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.124
The special-rank angel who
appears to know nothing,

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:06.502
or another angel who actually
knows Heaven's secrets?

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.753
Either way.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.505
You're right.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.674
I do think it's strange
to be choosing a God

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.926
from among the ranks of humans.

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.220
However, that's a
secondary concern.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.848
Saying that God doesn't
exist at all is reckless.

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:19.849
Exactly!

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.059
I mean, wouldn't a
God who'd been created

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.103
by human prayer still
be completely real

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.605
to the believers?

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:28.399
Besides, there are all kinds
of gods around the world.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:31.902
I have to say, I still think
we need a God in our lives.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.529
Yeah, right!

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:36.073
We need Him, but I don't
think He actually exists.

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:37.074
Huh?

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.367
Wait, how does that work?

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:41.078
Well, you see, I think
he's like Santa Claus.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.080
When we were children,
we believed in him.

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.499
We were told, if we were
good, he'd bring us toys.

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:46.959
But when we got older,

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.045
we realized he was
made up, not real.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.964
But it was more hopeful and
inspiring to believe in him.

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:53.424
God's the same.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.134
I don't think it's ever a
bad thing to pray to a God,

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.553
no matter who or
what they may be.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.305
But what does it accomplish?

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:00.556
After all, in the end,

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.767
there's nobody there
to answer your prayers.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.560
He doesn't have to exist.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:05.936
As long as we believe.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.521
I think people will be fine,

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.149
as long as each of us
keeps a God in our hearts.

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:12.526
So if none of us has
to actually become God,

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.028
I'd be okay with that.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.530
It's what God represents
that's important.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:17.573
[Mirai] Saki.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.118
Well, I never believed
in God to begin with,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.329
so nothing I've heard
today will change that.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.373
And after hearing
Professor Yoneda's theory,

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:28.376
I bet most people won't
believe he exists, either.

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:31.962
[wings whooshing]

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.506
I think the Professor's right

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.800
and this exercise is pointless.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.677
[Temari groans] What
does that mean?

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:39.303
After all this,
you're bailing on us

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:41.138
and you won't
accept the position?

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.098
I guess so.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.016
What do you care, Ms. Temari?

00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:46.018
You only want somebody
else to become God

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.978
so you can keep your Red Arrows.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.605
But don't you remember
what Ogaro said?

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:50.940
There are no options here.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.233
At the end of this process,

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:54.568
one of the six candidates
has to become God.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.778
Tell me something, Professor.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.862
Do you know of a way

00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:59.073
where one of us doesn't
have to become God?

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.574
Yes, I've deduced a method.

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.911
You don't want any of the powers
that come with the job, right?

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:07.665
I guess not, except
for this one thing.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:11.544
No matter what else happens,
I really need my Red Arrow.

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.837
I can't live without it!

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.547
It's given me a new life!

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:15.798
I don't care who becomes God

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.800
as long as they don't
take that away from me!

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:18.843
I'm begging you!

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.639
Professor Yoneda, let me ask.

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:26.058
Aren't there people out
there who believe in God,

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.060
depend on Him, and
see Him as a source

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.812
of hope and salvation?

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.230
I'm sure there are,

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.607
but they only
account for about .1%

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.276
of the Earth's population.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.444
I may be off a little,

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.988
but doesn't that come to
around 7 million or so?

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.281
That's an awful lot of people.

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:43.200
What happens to them if there's
no God, all of a sudden?

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.495
They won't have God to
blame for their problems.

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:49.415
They won't be able to repent
and ask His forgiveness.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.500
They'll find praying
to Him changes nothing.

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:53.377
They won't have anything
they can rely on,

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:55.880
or the strength to solve
their problems on their own.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:58.799
If that happens, I'm guessing
they'd probably lose all hope

00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.593
and kill themselves.

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:01.802
If there are people out there

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:03.429
who can't adjust
to the new reality,

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.848
I guess that's just how it goes.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.600
A wave of suicides?

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.185
And that's just how it goes?

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:12.855
[suspenseful music]

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:13.981
Just how it goes.

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:16.567
I won't allow it.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:21.113
In order to prevent that,
I'm willing to become God.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:24.158
[suspenseful music]

00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:29.914

found his motivation.

Are you sure?

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.210
It's a pretty big step.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.670
I thought you wanted
to just find happiness

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:38.631
for yourself here in this life.

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:40.049
Red will now become God?

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.842
Isn't it too late?

00:21:41.884 --> 00:21:44.261
No one would agree
to such a thing.

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.055
Well, I guess Ms. Temari would.

Didn't you say you'd become
God if no one else would?

[Nakaumi] After hearing
Professor Yoneda,

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:54.897
I've changed my mind.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.149
If I took the job now,
it would be two-faced,

00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:58.734
and undermine his position.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.986
Given the choice, I'd
still rather kill myself.
