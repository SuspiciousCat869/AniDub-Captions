WEBVTT

00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:10.844
My White against your Red.

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:12.888
It'll be a nice, fair fight.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.557
One on one, you and me.
Agreed?

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.185
Agreed.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:20.395
You're looking for
a nice, fair fight?

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.564
That doesn't sound like you.

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:23.732
Fine.

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:26.818
In that case, how 'bout we
both establish some rules?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.529
Huh?

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.655
Don't do it, Red!

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.199
Ignore whatever he suggests!

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.868
We can do it your way,
if you prefer.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.036
My way?

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.288
I don't feel like
suggesting the terms,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.957
since your friend
doesn't trust me.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.542
So you decide.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.381
We stop running and take turns

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.383
firing Arrows at one another.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:50.259
Huh?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.886
You want us to plant our
feet within firing range

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:55.055
and take potshots at each other?

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.099
That's right.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.142
One of us shoots while
the other one dodges?

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.894
We take turns and
close the distance

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.814
at every successful dodge?

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:04.856
Exactly.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:09.069
For an idiot, that's
not a bad idea.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.075
Our angels can still
cover our backs, right?

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:17.327
Absolutely, since
there's no telling

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.912
where your underling
actually went,

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:20.539
or what he might be up to.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.083
[Kanade] I'd say the same
goes for your walking dead,

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.126
and that she-cat.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.046
[pained grunt]

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.172
Red, please...

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.882
If you can somehow
incapacitate him

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.217
with one of your Red Arrows,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.761
I'm willing to step in
and deal the final blow.

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.683
You and I have entirely
different ideas about this.

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:42.394
Not killing him is something
that would make you happy.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.147
But for me, killing him
with my own two hands

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.107
would give me
great satisfaction.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.900
I doubt you'd
understand, though.

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.570
No, I do.

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:52.696
Enough already!

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:54.364
Let's get started.

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:55.782
I just want to say,

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.200
I don't believe it's necessary

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.119
to have this confrontation here.

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:02.205
Keep your opinions to yourself.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.248
Fine.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.751
Careful, Mirai.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.128
It's White against Red.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.923
A nice, fair fight, if
he sticks to the rules.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:14.468
One thing, Red.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.887
We have to decide
who attacks first.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:20.098
Heads, it's me, tails, it's you.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.017
Fine, whatever you want.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.898
[startled gasp]

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:28.940
Sneak attack!

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.610
I was just warming up.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:43.121
[opening theme music]

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.248
Okay, now it's your turn.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.333
You want to come closer?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.835
Five meters should be fine.

00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:13.670
Get ready and take your shot.

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:22.554
[stunned breath]

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.473
You parried instead of flying!

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.016
Of course.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.602
There's no point if I just fly
away to avoid your attacks.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.228
Did I misunderstand?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.397
Doesn't 'plant our
feet' mean no flying,

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.441
so we can settle this?

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:35.442
Come on now.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.819
Didn't that even occur to you?

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.864
Why did you even suggest
the rule in the first place?

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:42.407
Or did you think you
were the only one

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.326
who'd be able to deflect Arrows?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.828
Don't underestimate me.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.456
There's nothing you
can do that I can't.

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:52.334
There's no department in
which I'm inferior to you.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.461
Do you understand
what that means?

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.046
Challenging me is useless.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.464
There isn't a human
who can beat me,

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.466
not you, or anybody like you.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:01.927
You...

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.513
You think you've already
become God, don't you?

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.349
God?

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.312
The Lord God.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:16.274
I like the sound of that.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.113
The Lord God.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.161
Oh, wow!

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.496
Thank you, brother!

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:31.331
You remembered the
promise you made!

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:32.916
Of course.

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.461
My research team came up with
a biological breakthrough.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.129
These flowers will never wilt.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.632
They'll stay beautiful
like this forever.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.634
[happy giggles]

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.094
Fantastic.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.641
It's so pretty in here.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.518
It's like a dream.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.311
I'm so happy!

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.354
[Kanade] You like it?

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:55.438
It's the best!

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.734
It's amazing, you always
make my wishes come true.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.819
You're my God.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.820
Your God?

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.446
Really?

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.699
In that case, Rea, you're my
beautiful, adorable angel.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.992
[quick giggle]

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.160
Beautiful things
make people happy.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.539
But those things don't
necessarily happen by accident.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.416
Things like these
flowers can be created

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.126
if you have enough money.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.336
In Rea's case, her body
and mind are beautiful

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.672
because she was born
into a wealthy family,

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:23.466
and grew up surrounded by
things that made her happy.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.679
She's been untouched by the
filth that exists in this world.

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.557
Our relationship is
beautiful as well.

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.559
A wealthy person's
refined environment

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.519
makes them a refined person.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.146
They are given the very best,

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.981
they receive the best education,

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.191
and they become
even more beautiful.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.571
But they must be protected
from the ugliness

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.615
which comes from
poverty and filth

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.408
in order to maintain
that beauty.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.453
The saying "It's okay to be poor

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:55.081
"as long as your heart is
true" is pure sophistry.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.752
Poverty creates
only filthy things.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.421
It taints the body
and fouls the mind.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.717
That which is ugly can
only produce ugliness.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.762
Humans love beauty
and beautiful things.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.972
That's how we truly feel.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:15.435
Brother.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.436
Hm?

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.021
What is it?

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:20.231
I have something good
to tell you about.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:25.612
Yesterday, a boy told me
he has feelings for me.

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:26.655
[surprise gasp]

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.239
And you know what?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.617
I'm actually thinking
about going out with him.

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:31.660
[small giggle]

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.661
[horrified gasp]

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.287
She'll be tainted!

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.831
It's too easy to stray
from the right path.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.542
I'm the one who's refined
Rea's beauty up to now.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:40.794
What'll happen to our perfect

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.587
and beautiful
sibling relationship?

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.007
What's the matter?

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.427
I can't allow it.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.013
You're too young.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.516
Huh?

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.226
[intimidating breath]

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.853
[fright breath]

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.024
But Brother...

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.026
He's a very nice person.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.654
I mean, if you met him,
I'm sure you'd like him.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:09.698
I was right.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.075
Everything's already
falling apart!

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.203
Stop, Rea!

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:16.955
Let go!

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:18.665
Rea...

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.043
Please try to understand.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.213
No... No!

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.214
[Kanade] Rea!

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.215
No!

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.258
Let me go!

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.520
[thud]

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:53.658
Rea!

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.535
Are you alright?

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:56.578
Rea!

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.620
Rea...

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.541
Huh?

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.668
What is it?

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.669
I feel totally fine.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.885
Oh, I feel dizzy.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.727
Rea?

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.023
I think she's got a
cerebral contusion!

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.192
Shit, I've got to
call an ambulance!

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.741
I need to, but, if
she were to die,

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.160
no-one would be
able to defile her.

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.370
She'd be young and
beautiful forever.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:48.213
[somber instrumental music]

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.604
The contents of your coffin
will never be exposed.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:06.773
You'll be beautiful forever

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.400
Unsoiled forever.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.654
14 years old forever.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.991
[sniffling]

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:24.707
Even so, I'd rather she
was still here, alive.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.882
Maybe, the best way
forward is to join Rea.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.720
You are the heir
to an incredibly

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.722
wealthy business conglomerate.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.392
A person who is true
to his own desires.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:47.480
You are sad because you have
lost someone important to you.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.941
There is only one way
you can see her again.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.070
You must become God,

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:57.282
so you have the power to turn
your loved one into an angel.

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.910
My goal is clear.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.245
No matter what...

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.958
I will become God!

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:12.672
I don't have all day.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:13.965
It's your turn next.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.300
Let's finish this up.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:21.472
[murmurs of crowd]

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.765
[Man A] Look, it's Metropoliman.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:23.975
He's fighting again.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.810
[Woman] What an
elaborate production.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:27.729
They spent a fortune
on the special effects.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:28.688
[Man] No, no, no, it's for real.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.481
Just like at the
stadium and the tower.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:31.858
[Woman] How are
we able to see it?

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.484
[Man B] It's being
streamed online.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.819
[Man C] Why are
they censoring it?

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:37.488
[Man D] So we can't
figure out the location.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.657
They're still at
the amusement park!

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:40.783
Piece of cake!

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.630
[Revel] They're closing
in on each other.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:54.672
[Baret] Right.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.674
There's less than 20
meters between them.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.761
[Revel] Any closer and
someone's sure to get hit.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:00.803
Mirai...

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.891
If we keep closing the
distance like this,

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.935
it'll become a contest
of reaction speed.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.436
What's the hold-up?

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:09.729
It's your turn.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.689
It doesn't matter
what you do, though.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.399
I will become God.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.400
[Mirai] No way.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.945
I won't let there be a
world where you're God.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.571
Why are you so pessimistic?

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:19.989
Sure, you'll be dead,

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:22.492
but the world might
become a better place.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:23.910
Like hell it will!

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:27.705
It'll change, but there's no
way it'll be for the better.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.290
You want divine power

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.834
just so you can satisfy
your own desires.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.461
You're not concerned
in the least

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.588
about what's best for the world.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.881
You know what?

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.174
That's where you're
wrong, old man.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.842
The truth is, I did think about

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.844
what would make the
world a better place.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.389
But I stopped when I
realized it was hopeless.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.307
I could never convince
enough people to agree

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.059
on what needed to happen.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.103
On top of which, how do
you get them to believe

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:52.313
in something as
unrealistic as God?

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.149
Or even in the angels we
see flying around here.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.902
We don't really know for
sure that they are angels.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:00.905
They could be nothing but
a mirage, or super weapons,

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.116
or extraterrestrials, who knows?

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:06.160
The fact is, only the
chosen can see them,

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.246
and know that they
possess special powers.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.539
[Man B] Angels?

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.249
[Man C] What's he
babbling about?

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.001
Alright, about time.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.919
Might as well get it all out.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.587
Everyone needs to
know about this,

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.673
and he's the perfect spokesman.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:20.967
[Hoshi] Do we know
their location yet?

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.302
[Member A] We're working on it.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.928
There are multiple
layers of security

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.346
we're trying to break through.

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:29.142
What do you think's
going on here?

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:31.728
From what we saw at the
stadium and the Grand Tower,

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.188
this Metropoliman character
seems to be the mastermind

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.025
behind this entire
series of incidents.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.360
What's he trying to achieve?

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.404
First God, now angels.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:42.822
There must be a hidden message

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.741
somewhere within this footage.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.246
I was chosen as a
God-candidate by my angel,

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.707
for reasons I don't
really understand.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.834
But she saw something in
me that intrigued her,

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:57.378
so I must deserve these powers.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.546
If you're like the rest of us,

00:13:58.588 --> 00:13:59.797
you must have lost all hope

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.424
over something
important in your life.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.217
What hope did your
angel offer you?

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.178
[startled gasp]

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:07.889
As if I'd ever tell
you that, you idiot!

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.350
If you're trying to distract
so Red can shoot me,

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.602
you're doing a decent
job for a she-cat.

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:15.813
But you can shut up now
'cause I'm going to kill you.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.024
She wasn't trying
to distract you.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.443
She simply asked
out of kindness.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.904
I'm fighting fairly,
as I said I would.

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.740
Let's see if you can defend
fairly against this Arrow,

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:26.908
from this distance!

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.914
He was just able to parry it.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:35.208
It was a pretty aggressive shot.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.834
Blocking it must have hurt.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.711
Red, don't let him provoke you!

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.380
He'll cheat and
break all the rules!

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:43.591
There's no reason for
you to fight fairly!

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.385
What are you talking about?

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:47.512
I stood my ground, as agreed.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:48.888
So now, according to the rules,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.642
you need to deflect
my Arrow, right, Red?

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.520
Can I do that from
this distance?

00:14:55.561 --> 00:15:00.108
If you use your Wings, or
move your feet, you lose.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.360
He's too close to react in time.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.570
But it might be easier
to read his movements

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.072
from this distance.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.156
I'm ready for him.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.491
Wait.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.535
Before you shoot,
tell me something.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.036
I don't actually
want to become God.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.996
And I have no idea
what kind of world

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:16.124
would be best for people
to live in, either.

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:18.918
So what's your plan?

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.545
What kind of world
would you create

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.630
for the people who
live on this planet?

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.633
I mean, if the world wouldn't
become a terrible place.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.135
Don't do this, Yellow!

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.554
Exactly what are
you saying, she-cat?

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.222
Are you asking me to spare you

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.767
in exchange for standing aside
and letting me become God?

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:38.104
Or are you trying to make a
deal to save your beloved Red?

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.480
You can't reach him.

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.482
He has no respect for life.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.276
He's killed numerous
people already.

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.778
And he can't become God
without paying for that.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.781
That's true.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.616
Don't act so high and mighty.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.285
No matter how many
people I kill,

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.579
every one of them is
deserving of death.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.122
It's divine punishment.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.540
Justice served.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.709
If God exists, of course.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.086
If an absolute entity who
stands above all others

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.338
is really in charge
of the universe,

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.383
then I'm simply best suited
to occupy that position.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.886
If you agree, you
should kneel before me.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.181
You're so full of yourself.

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:16.100
Nice try.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:21.063
Apparently you were trying to
fake a gap in your defenses.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:22.190
But it won't work.

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.733
I know how you think.

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:26.110
And I'm starting to
understand you, as well.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.237
You really believe
you're the chosen one.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.156
It's more than a
personal opinion.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.824
I am special.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.784
There's no such
thing as 'special'.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.704
Among humans, there's
no superior or inferior!

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.832
Are you one of those guys?

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.167
One of the "have-nots"

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.169
who never received
a proper education,

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.129
with no friends, like Hajime?

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.049
Looks like I'm right.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.800
You can't accept
that I've been chosen

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.219
because you're stupid.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.514
You grew up in a
terrible environment.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:58.184
You never had any opportunities,
or exposure to nice things.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:01.646
The lower classes don't
understand exceptional souls.

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.982
You're exactly like Hajime.

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.151
No wonder you annoy me so much.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.152
Alright, then.

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.363
You're so eager to know
how I'll run things

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:11.656
when I'm in charge?

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.617
Before I kill you, let
me give you a preview.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.203
Once I'm God,

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.830
everything in this twisted
world will be different!

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.833
I'll eliminate disparities
in every society.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.169
I'll eliminate poverty
and inequality.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.420
I'll create a world

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.881
where everyone can
live a life of luxury!

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.219
[applause]

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:34.554
Is he serious?

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.764
He'd make everybody equal?

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:37.807
What?

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.186
[stunned breaths]

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.146
Don't be so surprised.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:45.940
It's a simple process.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.526
I would just need to get
rid of people like Hajime.

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.237
They're parasites
living of our taxes.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.197
I'd make it a priority
to purge the world

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.616
of all the trash who
lead carefree lives,

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.868
while depending on
welfare, donations,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.870
and the work of volunteers.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.832
What are you talking about?

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:05.042
I'm saying the wealth
gap would vanish

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.253
once poor people
are exterminated.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.005
It's unjust to force the wealthy

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:11.215
to provide endless
resources to the poor

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:14.302
and feed them all without
getting anything in return.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:17.054
Equality means no-one
gets special treatment.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:20.224
The shameless people who
receive pity and charity

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.852
in the name of equality,
should all die.

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:23.853
[murmurs of confusion]

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:24.895
What?

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:26.147
How awful!

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:27.523
Wait, is he serious?

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:28.816
That's discrimination!

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:32.361
That's your plan for the world?

00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:34.780
Can he do that?

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.282
He can.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.159
Several conditions
have to be met,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.911
but if he becomes God,
then it's possible.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:41.912
That's right.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.205
If I become God.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.627
Regardless of the
circumstances of one's birth,

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:49.879
everyone has the
right to happiness.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.880
Yeah!

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.757
They have that right,
but not the ability!

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.301
Instead, some of them
cling to the legs of others

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.053
and drag those people down!

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:58.679
For those forced
to assist strangers

00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:00.264
to whom they have no connection,

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.266
your words are empty platitudes!

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.561
The excuses of an idiot
brainwashed by false morality!

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.229
You...

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.899
You don't have the
right to take away

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.735
people's potential
for happiness.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:16.947
Why? Because a small percentage
are able to rise out of poverty?

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:18.949
It's not very likely.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.328
People born into
wealthy families

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.372
have a much better chance
of finding physical

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.415
and emotional fulfillment
in their lives.

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:28.292
It's a simple equation.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:30.586
Beautiful people make
beautiful people.

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:33.255
Ugly pigs make ugly pigs.

00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:34.882
I'm tired of living in a world

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.300
where you can't speak the truth

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:39.345
unless you do it behind
some kind of mask.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.888
Do you understand?

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.515
Hajime's a good example.

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:45.226
Because he was born
to inferior parents,

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:47.269
he was forced to
live an ugly life.

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:51.273
Even after he acquired a Red
Arrow, he was still an idiot.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.192
Ultimately, in his
search for acceptance,

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:57.029
he longed for beauty and got
all that cosmetic surgery done.

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.823
It made me want to puke!

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.200
Nothing disgusts me
more than cockroaches

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.077
trying to lift themselves up!

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.662
So even if they're wealthy,

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.997
I'll be eliminating
the ugly, as well.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.334
I once asked a
friend what he'd want

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.294
if he could be granted
any wish at all.

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.754
He didn't hesitate.

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.215
He said, "I'd want
to be obscenely rich.

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:17.299
"Oh, and one other thing,

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:20.177
"I'd want all ugly
girls to disappear."

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:21.178
There you have it.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.764
That's how people truly feel.

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:26.100
It's, it's Kanade!

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.478
A planet full of only
beautiful people,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.355
where everyone is wealthy.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.357
That's the world I want.

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:34.567
Sounds good!

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:36.026
Are you stupid?

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:38.028
Looks like I'm a dead woman.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.363
[Customer] I say
'Well put, God!'

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:40.990
Do we get to choose?

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:43.200
Get rid of my wife!

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.244
No wonder Meyza chose
him as her candidate.

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.203
He's pretty extreme.

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:50.249
We'll need servants, though.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.835
So even if they're lower-class,
if they're good-looking,

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.712
we'll keep 'em around as slaves.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.339
She-Cat...

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:00.342
If I become God, I'll
let you lick my boots.

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:02.762
Actually, you can
do that right now.

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:03.804
Come on over.

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.307
You bastard!

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.559
A world without
inequality, my ass.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.561
Everything you have to say is...

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.521
Shut your mouth, old man.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:14.648
Hurry up and die already.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.650
Have you finished
giving your speech?

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.531
Five meters.

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:24.241
It's my turn.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.869
Well, now, you've taken on
a much more serious tone.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:29.246
You can come closer if you want.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.373
This is as close
as we agreed to.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:32.666
Five meters.

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.293
Although I never
expected from the start

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:36.796
that you'd honor any
of those agreements.

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:40.299
Yeah, but you will,
because you're so stupid.

00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:41.342
Mirai...

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.804
What seems to be
the problem, Red?

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:48.265
Did you just realize that you're
going to lose if you shoot?

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:51.310
You see, the moment you
fire your Red Arrow,

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:53.479
I'm gonna fire my White.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.314
[small nervous breaths]

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:57.483
Even if he's struck
by the Red Arrow,

00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:00.277
his White Arrow will
be lethal when it hits.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:01.779
Once you fire off your Arrow,

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.739
you won't have time
to prepare another one

00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:05.658
if you want to deflect mine.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:08.202
That means you'll have to
use your Wings to escape,

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:09.662
if you want to live.

00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:12.414
But using your Wings would
be cheating, wouldn't it?

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.667
You'd be breaking your
own rule if you did.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.585
It would put you
in a moral bind.

00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:19.505
You, you're the one

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:22.049
who's done plenty of
underhanded things.

00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:24.343
You've acknowledged it's
Red's turn to shoot.

00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:26.846
Firing your own Arrow
would be underhanded.

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.639
And why is that, exactly?

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.933
Did I suggest I would
be shooting first?

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:33.269
The rules were: One
shoots an Arrow,

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.020
the other one gets to respond.

00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:37.106
Deflecting isn't
the only defense.

00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:38.107
There were no restrictions

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:39.817
on how quickly either contestant

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.402
could fire that second Arrow.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:45.155
As long as I don't shoot first,
I'm still obeying the rules.

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:48.325
Of course you could flee,
which would allow Red to win.

00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.410
I'd be fine with that.

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.580
I seriously doubt
you'll stand your ground

00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:55.124
and let yourself be
hit with his Red Arrow.

00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:56.750
Are you still talking?

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:59.712
Go stick your feet in a
coffin and shut up already!

00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:01.171
I said I wouldn't run.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.299
Don't make me say it again.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.092
I won't run, either.

00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:07.219
I already decided I wouldn't.

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:10.514
And I won't do
anything underhanded.

00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:12.391
It's unlike you to
stick to the rules,

00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:13.684
but if you're saying
you'll fight fairly,

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:15.477
I'm pleased to hear it.

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:18.147
In that case, let's hurry
up and settle this quickly.

00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:19.732
Go on and shoot me.

00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:21.859
I'm sure you're trying to
come up with a way to win

00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:23.611
without using your Wings.

00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:25.446
But you can't, can you...

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.948
Actually I'm not
thinking about that.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.242
What I am thinking is...

00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:34.413
Am I fighting the real
Metropoliman, or someone else?

00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:35.581
[stunned breath]

00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:36.707
What?

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:42.129
What the hell would
make you ask that now?

00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:43.380
I've got a White
Arrow in my hand

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.424
and I'm pointing it at you.

00:23:45.466 --> 00:23:46.383
Red!

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:49.803
I'm 99% sure that's
Metropoliman!

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:51.055
I know you are.

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.557
But that's not 100%, is it?

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:56.185
And if it's not 100%,
we might have a problem.

00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:02.691
[happy giggles]

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:04.401
What's he doing?

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:05.861
Is he stalling for time?

00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:08.405
No.

00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.783
He pretends he's
not sure of himself.

00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:13.452
But he's always actually...

00:24:13.494 --> 00:24:17.247
[intense instrumental music]
