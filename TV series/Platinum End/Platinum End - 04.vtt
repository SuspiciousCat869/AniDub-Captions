WEBVTT

00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:09.968
[Demakawa] What are
we about to witness

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.178
here at Jinbo Stadium?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.389
Well, Sakura TV will broadcast
the whole thing live!

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.018
--Bingo.
--He's here!

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.229
He's arrived exactly on time!

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.606
--It's Metropoliman!
--[heroic music begins]

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:25.526
[audience cheering]

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.239
--What the hell?
--Who are those guys?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.823
[Woman] Where'd they come from?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.825
Two mysterious figures
have suddenly appeared!

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.454
That's unbelievable! It's
Metro Blue and Yellow!

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.249
[Demakawa] In a
stunning development,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.209
Metro Blue and Yellow have
now joined Metropoliman

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:44.211
in the skies above the stadium!

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:46.672
--Look, Mirai.
--Yeah.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.799
They have Wings and Red Arrows.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.134
Only first-rank angels
or higher have both.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:54.346
[gasps] Do they
intend to shoot him?

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.847
Are they going to fight?

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.184
I don't get it.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.270
Why isn't he
activating his Wings?

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.273
--Mirai!
--[Arrow crackling]

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:12.114
[heroic music continues]

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.910
The Arrow can't get
through! [gasps]

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.872
--[Arrow crackling]
--[heroic music drops off]

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.374
[Blue] Damn.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.084
[Mirai] He's already been
hit by a different Red Arrow.

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:27.254
[Revel] Whoever that is must've
been shot by Metropoliman.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:29.881
Huh? Oh, now it makes sense.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.508
[Blue] Humans who get
hit and controlled

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.719
by a Red Arrow can't
be hit by a new Arrow

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.679
until 33 days have elapsed.

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.514
[Yellow] So it's not
the real Metropoliman

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.932
in that suit, right?

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.392
[Blue] Yeah, he's a ringer.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.935
[Yellow] Come to think of it,

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:43.937
when he arrived, it
looked more like he fell

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.732
out of the sky rather
than flew down.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.692
[Blue] [sighs] Of course.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:50.485
He must have dropped him here.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.987
[Yellow] But you know what?

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.781
There's no guarantee he
isn't a God candidate, too.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.158
Don't let your guard down.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.701
--Gotcha.
--[microphone squeals]

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:00.329
I don't know what you
two are talking about.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.331
--I am Metropoli--
--You can cut the act!

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.541
You're just an impostor
being paid to say that!

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:05.959
Just a decoy!

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.004
I challenge the real
Metropoliman to show himself!

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:15.302
[opening theme music]

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.725
[helicopters rumbling]

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.643
[Man] What the hell
is going on here?

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.228
[Woman] There are
three heroes now?

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.272
[Man] I thought they were
supposed to be working together.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.481
[Woman] It sounds like they
don't trust each other.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.608
[Man] So are they
enemies or allies?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.318
You think it's true?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.987
That's not the real Metropoliman

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.280
standing out there on the field?

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.614
[Masayoshi] That's
what they said,

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.616
but we have no way
of knowing for sure.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.285
[Demakawa] Blue and
Yellow are obviously two

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.120
of the challengers he invited
to come meet with him.

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:08.039
The question is, are
they allies or enemies?

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.916
We'll have to keep
watching to find out.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.460
[Mirai] I was going to
shoot him with a Red Arrow

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.504
if I saw the opportunity,
but that's off the table.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.674
--Tabuchi.
--Don't say my name!

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.593
I didn't want to
bring this up before,

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.596
but if we die here, will
you have any regrets?

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.181
[Yellow] None at all.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:27.267
I wouldn't wanna live in a world
where that shit-heel is our God.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.019
I guess I won't have to, though.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.271
If he actually becomes
God, it'll mean I'm dead.

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:33.315
[Blue] Pretty much.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.900
Get out here, Metropoliman!

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:38.069
We walked right into your
trap, just like you planned.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.697
But nothing's going to happen
until you show yourself!

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.158
Are we gonna fight,
or are we gonna talk?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.451
[audience cheering]

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:45.452
[Yellow] Well put, Hatakeyama!

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:48.079
We can do this!

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.372
[Blue] We're ready.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.082
It's time to turn
our lives around.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.419
--Yeah!
--We did it!

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.089
We're all going
to college! Yeah!

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.510
[students cheering]

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.679
If I get rejected, I'm
going to kill myself.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:10.477
That was the plan,
but... [breathes shakily]

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:15.315
--[Tabuchi sobbing]
--[somber music]

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.320
Wait a minute, I know you.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:21.571
What's the matter?

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.490
I can't find a
college to accept me.

00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:25.784
I have no prospects.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.954
My life is over. [weeping]

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.625
[Hatakeyama] I
know how you feel.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.171
[Tabuchi] I got turned
down just the other day.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.382
There's no place left to try.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:43.176
Yeah, but that's
just one rejection.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.970
I've failed three times now.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.680
I want to die.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.516
--Really?
--Yeah, really.

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:53.520
If so, I have some drugs
that can help you out.

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:54.521
Huh?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.985
[unsettling music]

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.404
[Hatakeyama retching]

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.449
This wasn't how it was supposed
to be. [breathing raggedly]

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.368
Right up until the
moment I killed myself,

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.245
I was planning to have a blast.

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:11.955
How can you enjoy yourself

00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:14.374
when you know
you're about to die?

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.793
--[Tabuchi gasps]
--[Hatakeyama sighs]

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.504
Huh? Oh!

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.506
[heavenly music]

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.175
Are those angels?

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.388
[Tabuchi] Hope to live? God?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.181
Are you kidding me?!

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.143
This is amazing!

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.395
I can't believe this
is actually happening!

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.443
[Hatakeyama] We can
make this work for us!

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.777
We understand the
law and government

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.030
a million times better
than the average idiot!

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.281
[Tabuchi] You're right!

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.452
Tabuchi, I promise,
if I become God,

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.454
I'll make sure you're happy
for the rest of your life!

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.205
Hatakeyama, if I become God,

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.125
I'll make sure you're
happy, too! [sobs]

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.544
[Blue] We can do this!

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.630
We can take this guy down!

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.215
[Yellow] We pretty much
know what you're thinking.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.217
[Blue] You can't shoot
Arrows while flying faster

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.469
than the eye can see.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.554
In other words, you
have to show yourself

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:10.847
in order to fire them.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.849
That makes you vulnerable.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.517
To avoid putting
yourself in danger,

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.020
you're using this guy as
bait so you can appear

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.272
behind any God
candidate who shows up

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.899
and shoot them
with a White Arrow,

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:23.610
which would mean one less
competitor to deal with.

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:24.903
But after shooting an Arrow,

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.613
you have to wait at
least two seconds

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:28.239
before firing another one.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.492
So what do you do when you're
facing off two guys, buddy?

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:34.037
The truth is, you can't
kill both of us at once!

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:36.331
[Demakawa] Arrows?
God candidates?

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:37.666
What's he talking about?

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:38.875
[Masayoshi] Beats me.

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.294
[Blue] On top of that,

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.089
your Arrow's range
is 31.6 meters.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.423
In order to shoot someone

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.800
who's standing on
the pitcher's mound,

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:50.637
you have to fire at them from
somewhere inside the field.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:53.598
That's why you chose this
place: for the easy escape.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.643
However, that works out
great for us as well!

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.104
We don't have to fear
being shot from the stands!

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.356
--Are they fighting for real?
--No way!

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.274
They have a lot of information.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.526
You're right.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.278
I didn't even know about
that 31.6 meter thing.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.532
We only have an approximate
idea of how it all works.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:11.533
[audience cheering]

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.119
--All right!
--Yeah! Go at it!

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.498
[Blue] What are you
gonna do, Metropoliman?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.461
[helicopters rumbling]

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.339
--Hello, gentlemen.
--[all gasp]

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.675
--I'm the real Metropoliman.
--[audience clamoring]

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.260
[Demakawa] What a show, folks!

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.680
The real Metropoliman has now
appeared on the jumbotron!

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:35.640
[Metropoliman] In case
anyone out there is confused,

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.308
I can assure you
that I'm the one

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.686
and only authentic Metropoliman.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.396
What you saw on
television yesterday

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.897
was someone else in the suit,

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.774
and you two are more
or less correct.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.317
You're on the right track.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.736
[Yellow] He's screwing with us.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.320
[Metropoliman] I'll
tell you this much.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.989
First, the guy
standing on the mound

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.533
is an ordinary human I
shot with a Red Arrow.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.744
He can't fly or fire Arrows,

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.787
so you don't need to
be concerned about him.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.957
[Blue] I thought you weren't
going to run or hide!

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.208
[Metropoliman] You're also right

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.127
about why I chose
this baseball field.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.504
But there is one area
you're mistaken about.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.925
The Arrows. They got it wrong.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.385
[Metropoliman] Since
the Red and White Arrows

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.679
are separate objects, if
I ready both together,

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.557
it takes a third of a second
to fire off the two rounds.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.393
Sorry, but I won't need
two seconds between them.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.939
I don't think I can sneak in
behind the two of you, either.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.649
Not when you're
standing back-to-back

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:27.567
and looking all around.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.152
It would become an endless loop

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.612
of appearing and disappearing,

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.739
trying to get the
drop on each other.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:37.452
I don't feel like doing
anything that lame, so bye-bye.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:38.828
--[audience chattering]
--Where'd he go?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.747
[Woman] Why do they
keep talking about--

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:41.956
[Woman] What happens now?

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.792
[Yellow] Guess he's
not gonna show.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.044
[Blue] Then there's only
one thing left to do.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.589
If we scare you that much,
you'd better run for it!

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.633
All we have to do now
is interrogate this guy

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:52.634
to get info on you!

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.010
It was pretty careless of you

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.429
to leave evidence like
this behind, Metropoliman!

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.555
--Come on, Yellow.
--Wait!

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.644
--It's a child!
--[audience gasping]

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:05.605
A young girl's
floating in midair!

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:06.648
Please wait!

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.485
[Mira] She has an angel!

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.403
Let me join with the two of you!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.780
I'm scared of Metropoliman.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.990
I think he's going to shoot
me with a White Arrow!

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.493
[fake Metropoliman straining]

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:19.828
I have Wings instead of Arrows,

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.621
so I don't know
how useful I'll be

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:24.207
if he decides to
attack you, but please!

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.834
[Yellow] What should we do?

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.044
It's possible she's being
mind-controlled as well.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.213
It could be part of
Metropoliman's plan.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.631
[Blue exhales]

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.967
I wanted to die because
kids bully me every day.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.593
But now that I've got my Wings,

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.595
I'm just starting
to have some fun.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.973
I don't want
Metropoliman to kill me.

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.015
Being bullied, huh?

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.228
After my family died, I
mostly got ignored a lot.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.857
--Huh?
--[Saki sighs]

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.733
What's wrong, Saki?

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:51.901
--[audience chattering]
--Is it a magic trick?

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.487
--There aren't any wires.
--How's she doing that?

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.533
[Chiyo whimpering]

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.745
--Okay, fine.
--[Chiyo gasps]

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.914
If you'll agree to let us
shoot you with a Red Arrow,

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.291
we'll take you with us.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.794
Shoot me. Go ahead.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.672
[Blue] Ready? Raise your
hands and come closer.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:16.676
--Okay.
--[grim music]

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:20.722
--[air whooshing]
--[fabric flapping]

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:21.848
[Blue and Yellow] Metropoliman!

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.101
--Too slow.
--[Chiyo screams]

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.938
[all gasp]

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.565
What are you guys doing?

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.901
This is what happens
when you hesitate.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.527
Mr. Metropoliman!

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.154
[Metropoliman] You have
to shoot God candidates

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.281
as soon as they appear.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:39.908
[Blue] Take this!

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.701
[Metropoliman] Like I said,
you idiots are too slow.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.870
You're waiting around
for inspiration to hit.

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:46.789
Now it's two on two.
I'm disappointed.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.541
I shouldn't have
gotten my hopes up.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.543
You're starting to annoy me now.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:51.669
Get out of here.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.630
Otherwise, I'll get
rid of you, as well.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.841
[Man] Why does he keep
appearing and disappearing?

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.344
[Woman] I have no idea
what they're doing.

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.845
[Blue] He's evened the odds.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.347
[Yellow] What should we do?

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:05.141
For 33 days, that girl
will do anything he says.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.727
The saving grace is
that she only has Wings.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.147
[Blue] Hey, you're right.

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:13.942
Isn't this situation the
opportunity we were looking for?

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.235
We can still do this.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.153
Now's the time!

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:18.988
Does anyone wanna side with us?

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.950
I know there are more God
candidates here in the stadium.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:24.202
I'm asking you to stand
up and be counted!

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.120
Like us, there
must be some of you

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.957
who don't live in a world
where this monster is God!

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.625
Join us in our
fight against him.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.503
We'll defeat
Metropoliman together!

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.755
But know this: we'll
only accept those

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.757
willing to be shot
with our Red Arrows.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.760
This will only work if
we operate as a team.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.136
[Woman] What's he talking about?

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.763
[Man] Are they saying
Metropoliman is God?

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:45.556
[Woman] What is going on?

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.101
Blue is calling for
reinforcements from the crowd.

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:50.770
Does that mean there's more
of these guys out here?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:56.943
[helicopters rumbling]

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.569
[Blue] Aren't any
of you brave enough?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.863
[Yellow] This is our
chance to take him down!

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.616
I know there's strength in
numbers, but what if they fail?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:06.953
Yeah. We can't reveal ourselves
under these circumstances.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.246
Especially if it means we have

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.206
to let them shoot
us with Red Arrows.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.960
[Green] We'll join you.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.004
[all gasp]

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.214
[Demakawa] Unbelievable!

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.425
Metro Green and Pink
have suddenly appeared

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.427
in the outfield stands!

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:23.970
[Yellow] I knew we
weren't the only ones

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.805
who wanted to
defeat Metropoliman!

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:28.391
[Blue] Look. They're
wearing suits like ours.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.316

--[wind whooshing]
--[helicopters rumbling]

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.196
[Demakawa] There's been
an unexpected development

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.698
here at Jinbo Stadium.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.075
Metropoliman, who invited
his 11 challengers

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.828
to come and talk, has
vanished with a flying girl.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.622
His disappearance has
left Metro Blue, Yellow,

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.042
and the fake Metropoliman
behind in the stadium.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:56.252
And now Metro Green
and Pink have appeared

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:57.879
in the outfield stands.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.049
[Blue] Are we sure those
two are God candidates?

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.383
[Yellow] If you wanna join us,

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.010
we have to shoot
you with Red Arrows.

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.011
Do you agree to that?

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:06.262
[Green] We understand.

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.431
[Pink] We only have
Arrows, not Wings.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:09.974
Is that still okay?

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.893
[Yellow] Of course!
You're welcome to join us.

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:12.935
[Blue] No Wings, huh?

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.604
All right, let's go shoot them.

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:15.897
I'm going over to the stands.

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.399
--Back me up, all right?
--Gotcha.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.318
[Demakawa] Blue and
Yellow are on the move.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.694
Apparently, they're on their way

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.363
to meet up with Green and Pink.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:25.990
[Arrows crackling]

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.742
[Blue] All right, I
was able to shoot them,

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.243
so they weren't
being controlled.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.536
[Yellow] Just Arrows, though,

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:33.289
so all we got were guys
with second-rank angels.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:36.626
[Blue] The weaker someone is,
the more they want allies.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.670
[audience cheering]

[Masayoshi whooping]

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.841
Nobody expected this to happen

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:44.884
after Metropoliman announced

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.095
that he wanted to talk
to his 11 challengers.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:51.057
Right now, we still don't know
if they're enemies or allies,

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:54.894
but the Super Civilization
Squad Metro Five have assembled!

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.730
[audience cheering]

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:58.981
[Blue] That makes four of us

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:00.566
who have access to Red Arrows.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.068
We have an advantage in numbers.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.486
[Yellow, Green, and Pink] Yeah!

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.029
You know, Mirai...

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:10.118
[Mirai] If we joined them,
Saki and I would make six.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.537
That's half of the
remaining 12 candidates.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.914
[Yellow] Let's see you
summon your Arrows.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.124
[Pink] Arrows, huh?

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.959
[Green] Sorry, can't
take orders from you.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.086
Attention, please, everyone!

--[exciting music]
--[Chiyo giggles]

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.048
Mr. Poliman is here
and he would like

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.925
to make a very
important announcement!

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.555
--What the hell?
--I must confess, everyone.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:34.976
I, Metropoliman, am not
actually Metropoliman.

--[all gasp]
--[tense music]

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:40.982
[Blue] What?

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.861
[Metropoliman] Seriously,
you guys are so stupid.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.990
[Arrows crackling]

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.159
The real Metropoliman's
right here.

[Yellow] Hatakeyama!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:59.333
[Metropoliman] Like I
said, you're too slow.

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.794
[Arrow crackling]

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.130
[body thuds]

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:10.011
--[Mirai gasps]
--[chilling music]

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.437
Wait a minute. Are
those guys really dead?

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.189
No way. It's a performance!

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.232
[Man] This can't be
good. He's not moving.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:26.027
[Man] Nice, Metropon!
What's your next trick?

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:28.988
[Mirai] He killed him.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.450
[Arrows shattering]

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:36.787
[Pink] Huh? I liked Mr.
Blue up until a second ago.

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.039
Now he's dead.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.083
[Green] Strange, but I
don't feel sad at all.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.170
[Yellow] So Mr. Poliman,
may I ask you a question?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.630
[Metropoliman] Huh? What is it?

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.964
[Yellow] I thought
the Metropoliman

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.758
on the screen was the real one.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.426
What exactly's going on here?

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.053
[Metropoliman] The
guy you see is a human

00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:54.180
I'm controlling
with my Red Arrow.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.598
Huh? What's he talking about?

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:57.975
[Metropoliman] We
simply switched places

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.602
when you went to
the outfield stands

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.812
to shoot Pink and
Green with your Arrows.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.815
Everyone's attention was
on you, so it was easy.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.069
Anyway, you and Blue are way
too scared of Red Arrows.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.654
[Yellow] What?

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.280
[Metropoliman] You were so
scared, you made a little girl

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.866
and even Green and
Pink raise their hands.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.827
You knew the girl was a God
candidate since she had Wings,

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.497
but you needed to confirm
that the other two had Arrows.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.666
Green and Pink are actually
just regular humans

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.209
under my control.

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:26.003
They're pawns I
placed on the board.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.380
[Yellow] What?

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.590
[Green and Pink]
Thanks for playing!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.217
[Yellow] There's no
way regular humans

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.636
would voluntarily get involved
in something so dangerous.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.263
And we were able to shoot them!

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:36.847
[Metropoliman]
Let me remind you:

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.892
it's possible to control people
without using Red Arrows.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.185
[Yellow] You can do that?

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.853
[Metropoliman] Want
me to teach you how?

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.730
[Yellow] Yes! Please!

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:48.484
[Metropoliman] The
answer is money.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.446
They're just part-timers
working at a local hero show,

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:55.658
though I did pay them an
awful lot of cash for the gig.

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.119
Huh? Excuse me, angel.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.163
Why are you trying to just
casually sneak out of here?

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:02.331
Nice try.

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:03.916
Those Wings and that Red Arrow

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.835
you gave him are mine by right.

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.336
So I'll be taking them.

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.715
[sinister music]

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.102
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it!

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.105
He got the Wings and the Arrows.

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.356
They were passed to him.

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:30.359
[Metropoliman] Now, then,
you two did your job,

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:31.527
so you can leave.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.362
--Huh?
--Thanks! See ya!

00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:34.572
[Mirai] This is bad.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.198
So far, everything's
gone exactly

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.159
as Metropoliman planned it.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.119
He lured three God
candidates to him.

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.164
He killed one with a White Arrow

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.124
and shot the other
two with Red Arrows.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.669
It was naive of me to
think I'd get a chance

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.296
to shoot him with a Red Arrow.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:51.547
He's too crafty.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:53.466
I don't stand a
chance against him.

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:56.135
If I'm not careful,
he'll kill me.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.471
For now, I should just
focus on not revealing

00:18:58.512 --> 00:18:59.764
that I'm a God candidate.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:06.020
--Look. What's going on?
--Huh? [gasps]

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.025
[Metropoliman] It's now time
for the second act to begin!

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.320
[audience cheering]

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:16.197
[Yellow] Uh, what
are these things?

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:17.198
Are those handcuffs?

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.742
Maybe he's gonna show
off an escape trick.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.369
Hey, what's up? Half
the players left.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.953
He said it's the second act.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.622
He must have something
up his sleeve.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.540
[Metropoliman] Let's
start with you, Yellow.

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.709
It's true you've been
hit by my Red Arrow,

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.711
but in spite of that,
there appear to be limits

00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:32.588
to what I can make you do.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.298
[Yellow] Oh, no, Mr.
Poliman, not true.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.175
I'll do anything you tell me to.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.260
--Yeah.
--Really?

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.681
--What if I told you to die?
--Die?

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.557
It would be different
if you'd done something

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:46.185
to me that merited death,
but you haven't, have you?

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.270
[Yellow] Not that I recall.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.189
[Arrow crackling]

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.400
[Metropoliman] So if
I were to do this...

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:53.359
[Yellow] What's going on?!

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.860
No, no, no! Please
don't point that at me!

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.278
[Metropoliman] See?
You're trying to fly away.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.447
There are limits to
the Red Arrow's power.

00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:00.866
[Yellow] Wait. This
is a joke, right?

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.371
[Metropoliman] I'm
clearly not joking.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:08.457
--No! [screaming]
--[Chiyo shrieking]

00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:12.336
--Wait, wait! Don't do this!
--It hurts! It hurts!

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:17.383
[Yellow] Somebody
help me! [screams]

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:19.635
[solemn music]

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:24.473
[Chiyo whimpering]

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.237
[Chiyo gasps]

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:41.824
--Is he really dead?
--I thought this was a show.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:42.992
[Woman] Isn't
Metropoliman supposed

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:44.285
to be a hero of justice?

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.328
You think Mirai
will be all right?

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.413
Huh? What do you mean?

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:48.873
That young girl is next.

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.709
I hope he doesn't try to
be a hero and stop him.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:52.793
Oh, yeah, right.

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:55.212
--No! Help me, someone!
--[menacing music]

00:20:55.254 --> 00:21:00.259
Mommy! Mommy, I'm
scared! [whimpering]

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.845
Don't let him hurt me!

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:06.432
Is she acting, 'cause
she's really freaking out!

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.267
--Yellow's not moving!
--Oh, no!

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.520
[Mirai] What should I do?

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:13.105
What can I do?

00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:16.317
I could prepare my Red Arrow
and fly faster than he can see.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:18.444
That won't work.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.279
And if he flees
before I shoot him,

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.281
I'd only be revealing
that I'm a God candidate.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.241
Then he'll hunt me
down and kill me!

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.328
I can't die.

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:30.539
After all this, I can't die!

00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:33.292
Think, Mirai! There
must be another way.

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:36.921
Please don't do this!

00:21:39.173 --> 00:21:41.926
[Metropoliman] Huh? What do
you mean, "please don't"?

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.260
Unless you have a suggestion

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.470
that would make me want to stop,

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.846
you're wasting your breath.

00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:48.307
You second-rank angels
are such idiots.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.144
I admit, though,
it would be amusing

00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:54.313
to watch you beg for her life.

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:55.564
Go on, do it!

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:58.108
Someone, please!

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.527
Please help her, anyone!

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.570
She's just a little girl.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:04.365
I'm begging you, don't
let her be killed!

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.326
Please, she doesn't
deserve this!

00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:09.787
[Metropoliman] [laughs]
I knew you could do it.

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.915
[Chiyo screaming]

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:14.583
That's it, keep screaming.

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:16.335
Beg for your lives!

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:18.546
All you cowardly God candidates,

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:20.506
are you going to
let this child die?

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.175
[Saki] Don't.

00:22:23.217 --> 00:22:24.760
[Jami] He's going to kill her
if you don't do something!

00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:27.763
--What is it, Saki?
--No. Don't do this.

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:30.182
[Jami] She's just 10
years old! Please!

00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:32.726
Someone help us!
She's a little girl!

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:35.354
She deserves to grow
up and have a life!

00:22:35.396 --> 00:22:39.191
--It's not fair!
--[Chiyo screaming]

00:22:39.233 --> 00:22:40.985
Make him stop this!

[closing theme music begins]

00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:21.377
[machinery whirring]
