00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:15.057
[Saki] Joso Academy student
Mizukiyo Minamikawa.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.226
You were friends
with Kanade Uryu,

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.727
also known as Metropoliman.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.939
No! I'm no threat!

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.148
Please, don't kill me!

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.149
I won't let on!

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.068
I won't tell anyone!

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.486
[Saki] He can see Arrows?

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:28.946
Is he a God candidate?

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.280
What's going on here?

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:33.075
First Kanade, then
Susumu, and now you two?

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.159
[Mirai] Interesting.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.954
He knows Metropoliman's
true identity.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.080
Why aren't you fleeing?

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.081
Flee to where?

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.958
I don't have a set of Wings!

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.668
[Saki] So your angel
is second-rank?

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.086
What are you talking about?

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.963
I'm not second-rank
or even third-rank!

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.256
I don't know what's
going on anymore!

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.298
--Red Arrow.
--Yeah.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:53.011
--[Minamikawa gasps]
--[body thuds]

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.975
--You're a God candidate?
--Yes.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.894
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.313
[Mirai] You're our
ally for 33 days.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.607
That's right. I'm your ally.

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.819
If his angel is second-rank,
you know what that means.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.406
Yeah. There's still a
special-rank angel out there.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:14.533
The Nakaumi brothers are next.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:15.993
Their home is right over there.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:20.205
[Shuji] There's no question
in your mind, Big Brother?

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.959
[Osamu] Nope. Mom and
Dad, and Grandpa, too.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.169
Who would ever guess my
little bro's a God candidate

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.338
who made them all
kill themselves?

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.590
[Shuji] It wasn't that hard.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.009
All I did was
grant their wishes.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.094
Fine. Now I don't
wanna live anymore.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.095
Look around.

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:36.597
I'm sick and tired
of seeing people

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.599
enjoying the misery of others.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.100
I just wanna check out.

00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:41.518
[Shuji] You'd better be sure.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.686
It's not the kind of thing

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:44.354
where you get to
change your mind.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:45.981
Once it's done, it's done.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.024
[Osamu] I know.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.234
I just don't see any
future for myself.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.444
[Shuji] All right, then.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:53.572
I guess this is
goodbye, Big Brother.

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.824
[foreboding music]

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.120
[Shuji gasps]

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.043
Another God candidate?

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:15.177
[opening theme theme]

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:42.848
[Osamu] Who the... Who
the hell are you guys?

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.225
You can't just barge
in here like this.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.144
Huh? It's Ogaro!

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.854
The Angel of Darkness.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.148
The only angel who knows
the secret side of Heaven

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.109
and isn't interested in
becoming special-rank.

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.111
Wait, I don't understand.

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:58.488
--Exactly who's your angel?
--What?

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.949
I thought you said
he was second-rank.

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.951
--Well, actually...
--That's odd.

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.328
The remaining angel
should be special-rank.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.122
[Nasse] That would have
to be Muni, I would think.

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:08.498
[Mirai] Where's your angel?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.708
All right, fine!

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.918
I'm not a God
candidate. I'm sorry!

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.295
I thought you were
going to kill me earlier

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.547
if I didn't say
I was, so I lied.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.090
[Revel gasps]

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.301
And here I thought
we'd finally identified

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.886
all the God candidates.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.888
[sputters] One thing, though!

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.182
I know Metropoliman's
real identity.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.559
I'm sure I can be
useful somehow.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.269
[Shuji] Metropoliman.

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.521
Wait a minute! Who the
hell are you people?

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.607
You just go barging
into strangers' homes?

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.317
Hold on, Big Brother.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.736
You're Red and
Yellow, aren't you?

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.071
I see you're not disguising
yourselves today.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.575
I'm glad you're here.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.036
You can eliminate us
whenever you're ready.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.538
Use your White Arrow
on me and my brother.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.582
Or you can even
use your Red Arrow.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.795
These Red Arrows are
interesting, aren't they?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:58.215
If you use one of them to
shoot somebody who wants to die

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.217
and you tell them to
go ahead and do it,

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.177
they'll instantly
kill themselves.

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.596
They're wish-granting
arrows of hope.

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:08.517
It simply depends on how much
that person wants to die.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.519
Our grandpa is a good example.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.187
He was put on a
ventilator and said

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.439
he was in terrible
pain all the time.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.275
So as a test, I shot
him with a Red Arrow

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.236
and gave him permission to go.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.237
It's all right.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.655
You can die now.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.574
And just like that, he
immediately removed his mask

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.368
and died peacefully.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.204
It was a dignified
and merciful death.

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:30.872
I thought I'd done a good thing.

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.417
My dad never said
he wanted to die,

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.753
but something
unexpected happened.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.380
My mom hooked up
with a younger man,

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.423
and they ended up
getting divorced.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.259
He stopped going to work.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.593
He just sat at home and stared

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.846
at a mug on the table every day.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.389
I couldn't stand
it, so I shot him

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.266
with a Red Arrow and said:

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.308
Do you wanna die?

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:52.644
Yes, son, I do.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.230
[Shuji] The next day,
his body was found

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.857
floating in the river.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.818
After that, you shot your
mom with a Red Arrow.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.278
[Shuji] How'd you
figure that out?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.071
I'm impressed.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:06.283
These Red Arrows are a lot
more powerful than I realized.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.243
If I shoot someone
who's causing me trouble

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:11.371
and tell them to die, they turn
around and kill themselves.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.457
As she lay dying,
my mom apologized

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.293
for abandoning our family.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.253
And since he said he
wanted to die with her,

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:19.629
I shot her boyfriend, too.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.298
But he didn't kill himself.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.216
He did apologize, though.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:26.094
I've found that the louder
people are about wanting to die,

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.054
the more likely it
is that they're lying

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.098
and are really just
looking for attention.

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:34.269
The Arrow just reveals
how contemptible they are.

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.646
Because of that, I've
learned how to identify

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:39.357
the people out there
who really want to die,

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.484
and I've been giving
them the push they need.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.280
What you've been doing is wrong.

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:46.907
[Shuji] You think so?

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.867
In Japan, the number-one
cause of death

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.162
in people between 15
and 39 is suicide.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.622
And that's just the ones
who have the courage

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.081
to go through with it.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.958
There are lots of people
living shitty lives

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.128
who want to die but don't
have the guts to end it all.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.505
When I first received
my Wings and Arrow,

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:06.134
I thought they would finally
give me the hope to live.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:09.346
But almost immediately,
I realized they wouldn't.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.474
The only things that
motivate people to live

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.726
are their basest desires.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.853
My angel didn't deny it.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.773
--Isn't that right, Ogaro?
--Yes.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.901
Wings and Arrows are just
vehicles for human desire?

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.945
Sounds like the
Angel of Darkness.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:25.987
Sure does.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.364
[Shuji] So instead of using them

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:31.201
to fulfill my own desires, I
help people who want to die.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.370
[Mirai] Helping people
commit suicide is a crime.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.330
[Shuji] What? Really?

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.332
You mean you didn't know that?

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.542
[Shuji]
Okay. I'll stop doing it.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.336
I've already helped
a lot of people.

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.713
One thing, though.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.341
Let me help my
brother kill himself.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.552
Then I'll kill myself,
and it'll be over.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.179
--That's right.
--No way!

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.348
[Shuji] Don't interfere.
You're being a nuisance.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.558
[Mirai] Stop it.
Please don't do this.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.185
[Shuji] All right,
then. I won't.

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.563
But only if you give me a good
reason not to kill myself.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:03.149
It's people like you, who
think they have all the answers

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:06.403
and run around preventing
suicides, that I hate the most.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:09.781
I can get that helping someone
kill themselves is a crime.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.242
But if committing suicide
isn't against the law,

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.244
people are free to do it.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.746
After all, it's their
life they're ending.

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:19.582
Only humans choose
to commit suicide.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.377
Suicide is the most
human of deaths.

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.129
It also happens to be

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.381
the most miserable
death you can choose.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.550
[Shuji] Only according
to your standards.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.343
To my standards?

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.595
Well, maybe you're
right about that.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.348
I don't want you to
suffer a miserable death.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.559
I'd prefer you
live and be happy.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.436
That's why I'm
determined to stop you.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.146
[Shuji] All you've
talked about so far

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.772
is your own personal desire.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.858
And while you might
find the act miserable,

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.401
I think it's noble.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.028
If you want to convince me,

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.030
then give me a more
logical explanation.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.615
--No!
--Hm?

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:53.658
No, no, no!

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.870
This isn't about laws or
standards or even logic.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.205
There are people who'd
be sad if you died!

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.082
That's enough
reason not to do it.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.752
[Shuji] Who's the
closest person to me?

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:04.753
My brother, right?

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.838
And he's here, rooting me on.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.799
Believe me, nobody will
be sad about me dying.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.551
All right, then what
about your friends?

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.220
[Shuji] [sighs] I don't
have a single one at school.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.639
It doesn't surprise me
that you feel that way.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.433
But that's not the reality.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.060
You may think you
don't have friends,

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.395
but I bet there are people
who try to be friendly to you

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.439
and do care about you.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.524
That's how Kanade Uryu was.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.568
You know, the guy
who was Metropoliman?

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:32.655
Officially, he's gone off to
study in England this semester.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.116
But I know he was
killed in that stand-off

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.326
at the amusement park.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:38.828
The girls at school loved him,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.872
but he looked down on everyone.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:44.417
He didn't have girlfriends, or
any friends, for that matter.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.836
He probably even thought
I was disgusting.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.046
But whenever I said I wanted

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.048
to check out the
cute girls at school,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.424
he was happy to go with me.

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:54.302
In fact, he went with
me a bunch of times.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.221
Even though, as I look back,

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.265
I don't think he ever
considered me a real friend.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.601
When Metropoliman died,
most folks were glad.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.854
I didn't know one person
who was upset about it.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:08.149
Not at first, or so I thought.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.734
Except I was really sad.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.528
I cried all the time.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:12.946
[Shuji gasps]

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.949
Even though we weren't real
friends, he was nice to me.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.659
He spent time with me.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.744
We talked a lot, you know?

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.580
And he must've realized
I knew who he was.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.165
That's clear to me now.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.292
But still, it's only
because of Kanade

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.461
that I ever got a
chance to date Sayuri.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.214
Wait, that's it!

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.091
If you find a girl
you're attracted to,

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.759
you won't want to die anymore!

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:37.387
Have you tried dating?

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.849
Oh, sorry. What I'm
trying to say is,

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.059
there's someone out there
who could care about you,

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.103
someone who'd be
sad if you died,

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.605
especially if you
committed suicide.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.816
And then, to be
perfectly honest,

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.776
it's really such a bother.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.570
[Shuji] [gasps] A bother?

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.196
You can't just
carry on like normal

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:57.532
if one of your classmates
kills themselves.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.118
Even if it doesn't make
you sad, it brings you down

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.620
and makes you think about
the person all the time.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.581
You become uneasy and anxious.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.207
You may say it's
nobody's business,

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:09.294
but it leaves its mark
on people's hearts.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.962
What's that if
it's not a bother?

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.382
[Shuji sighs]

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.092
[Shuji] I have to
say, I'm impressed.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.595
That's the first time someone's
convinced me, even a little.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.555
Yeah? Really?

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.348
I think people who
kill themselves

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.559
are too self-involved
to consider the effect

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.145
their act is going
to have on others.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:30.565
It's never good to be
a bother to society.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:33.026
Since I don't want
to become a nuisance,

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.069
I guess I have to
rethink my position.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.031
All right, fine.

00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:40.575
In that case, I won't help
my brother kill himself.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.660
--Huh?
--Sorry, big bro.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.370
You'll have to find a
way to kill yourself

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.706
that causes as little
trouble as possible.

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:48.458
Not just that.

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:50.335
I'll have to find a
way to kill myself

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.630
without becoming a
bother, either. [munching]

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.633
Anyway, that's
what I've decided.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:12:00.595
It's time for you all to
leave now. [crunching]

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.597
We still need your help, though.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.183
The candidates have to
choose the next God.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.602
Like it or not, you're
part of that process.

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.271
I don't care who
becomes the next God.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:13.483
You may not care, but your
approval still matters.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:14.651
Procedure demands it.

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.277
That's right.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:17.987
Unless, of course, you've
already killed yourself.

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:21.449
The next God isn't gonna
be chosen any time soon.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.701
I'm sure I'll be dead
before that occurs.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:27.038
Wrong. We're all in a
race against time here.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.665
We've all been targeted.

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.834
Japan and other nations
want to use us as weapons.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:35.255
There's one more God candidate
we haven't identified.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.756
We need to find that person

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.716
before a government swoops in.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.593
If such a thing were to occur,

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.680
the individual could be
killed in the attempt.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.556
If you refuse to come with us,

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:46.849
you'll be throwing
a monkey wrench

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.768
into this whole operation.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.895
[Shuji sighs]

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:51.896
All right.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.856
I'll go with you,
but I'm not going

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.692
to change my mind
about killing myself.

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:58.236
As long as God's chosen
while I'm still alive,

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.445
you'll have my approval.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.864
--Is that good enough?
--Yes.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:05.326
Fine, just as long as all I
have to do is be a witness.

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.079
[Shuji crunching]

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.872
[Mirai] Let me introduce you.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.709
Mr. Hoshi and Ms. Yumiki
are both police officers

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.878
who have betrayed their
organization to help us.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.632
--Welcome.
--[Shuji gasping]

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:20.675
Have a seat, boys.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.093
Make yourselves at home.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.638
Would you like a soft
drink, or maybe tea?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.765
We have cookies too,
if you're hungry.

Shuji Nakaumi.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.758
I can't see these angels,

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:02.759
Yes, it is.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.469
I see they're all here.

--You can't see them, right?

In addition, Susumu Yuito.

First-rank angel, Penema.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.812
Since calling for the
world to choose a God,

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.147
he hasn't shown himself.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.940
We have no idea where he is.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.401
[Susumu sighs]

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:21.736
What's the deal?

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.946
We haven't found any
new God candidates yet.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:24.989
You have to be patient.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.783
It's the calm before the storm.

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:28.993
The same thing happens
in games all the time.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.620
Lastly, there's the candidate

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.622
the police captured,
Yuri Temari.

00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:34.624
Her second-rank angel is Yazeli.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:35.958
After graduating from college,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.961
she began working at
a major ad agency.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:41.297
She attempted suicide twice.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.091
In April, her social
media showed her

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.718
taking lavish, exotic vacations.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.595
People were very puzzled.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.180
I can't take it anymore!

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.140
Not having a phone
is just impossible.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:53.142
I think I'm going to die.

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:55.603
Hey, security guard,
I'm going crazy!

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.356
I'm suffering from
phone withdrawal!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:14:59.774
You're under police protection.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.651
You have to try and be patient.

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:02.985
[Temari] You're
the one who told me

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:04.862
to get taken into
custody, Yazeli!

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.572
The search for all
the God candidates

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.408
is quickly picking up speed.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:10.993
It's better than being
hunted down and killed.

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:14.372
This just leaves one candidate
we haven't identified yet.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.582
And they're with Muni,
a special-rank angel?

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:17.583
That's right.

What's the matter?

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.924
Update: I'm thinking
about changing schools

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.427
--and then killing myself.
--[Mirai and Saki gasp]

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:28.761
Just wanted to make sure.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.347
As long as you're the only
ones who know about it,

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.224
it won't be a problem, right?

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.767
Hold on, that's not exactly-

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.227
No, you can't do that, Nakaumi!

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.187
Now that we know
you, if you die,

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:39.814
we'd be the ones to feel bad.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:43.484
He's right. Your death would
be upsetting to all of us.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:47.280
You see? Your opinion of
suicide still remains negative.

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:49.031
I'm saying it
should be considered

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.867
a wiser, more positive choice.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:53.035
Then why not go
ahead and become God,

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:55.663
so you can make suicide a
desirable option for everyone?

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.207
[Mirai] Don't say that,
Nasse. That's terrible.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.001
What did she just say?

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:01.794
That Nakaumi should become God

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.005
and make suicide a
good thing for humans.

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.466
--That sounds like a plan.
--What?

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.968
I'm not gonna fall
for that trick.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.888
I'd lose the ability
to die if I became God.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.974
Besides, it would be a
completely selfish move.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:17.810
I don't have any foolish
desires to change the world

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.228
to suit my point of view.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.897
Why are they foolish desires?

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:23.065
Because they're
embarrassingly human.

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:25.276
It's really no different

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.237
than the selfish
desires of my parents.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.866
And the truth is, I'm the
product of that selfish desire.

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:33.868
Nobody chooses to be born.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.871
It comes from the parents'
desire to have children.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.873
Actually, it's not even that.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.041
It's really the byproduct

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:42.668
of their pursuit
of sexual pleasure.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.504
My mother abandoned
us because she wanted

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.005
to be with a younger man.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.049
It was easy for her to leave.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.675
After all, she
only plopped us out

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:51.469
because she'd had
her fun with Father.

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.429
Please don't describe
it like that.

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.723
Fine. It is
disgusting, isn't it?

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:58.643
People say they love each other
and then breed like rabbits.

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.937
It's the vile desire of humans.

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:02.897
We're really nothing
more than the result

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.483
of worldly passions
fueled by desire.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.735
[somber music]

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:12.907
You could also say we're alive
because of those desires.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.992
We want to eat tasty food.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.286
We want to be close
to the person we love.

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:19.163
We want to be
happy in this life.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.958
These are wonderful
desires that we all have.

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:23.543
They're goals for life.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.336
They bring us hope.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.505
I completely understand
why you ended up

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.924
feeling the way you
do about your mother.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.677
However, maybe it's better
to control those desires

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.929
so they don't make
others unhappy.

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.847
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier,

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:37.890
and it stuck with me.

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.892
Your wish not to
inconvenience others

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.519
is a wonderful type of desire.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.313
You could easily go.

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:46.107
After all, you have Wings.

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.942
You could shoot us
with a Red Arrow

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:50.611
and force us all to
accept your suicide.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:53.197
But if you don't mind,
until a new God is chosen

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:57.159
and this chaos is finally
over, I'd like you to help us.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.995
[Shuji sighs]

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.122
[Osamu] Shuji,
maybe you don't have

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:04.250
to die right away, at least
not for the time being.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.589
[Shuji breathing shakily]

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.425
[water splashing]

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:20.766
[Shuji] Okay.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.351
Hey, all right!

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.026
Thank you. Let's work as a team.

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:42.038
What did Susumu say
in that broadcast?

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.581
That you're all to
meet and discuss

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:44.999
who the next God will be?

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.167
Right.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.961
We were able to talk
honestly with Nakaumi,

00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:51.839
so we should be able to do
the same thing with everyone.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:56.052
Got it. I'll support
whatever you want to do.

00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:57.094
[both gasp]

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.600
With that in mind, how do we
locate the final God candidate?

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.609
[Akai] I had trouble believing
God candidates were real,

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.235
but half the world
is now starting

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:15.071
to accept their existence.

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.031
That's probably because
governments have not only

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:20.242
endorsed the idea, but are
actively searching for them.

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:22.912
--Oh, wow! Look at that!
--The God candidates!

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:24.622
[gasps] Huh?

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:29.627
--[Akai panting]
--[crowd chattering]

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.174
[Saki] Hopefully, word of this

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:37.259
will spread on social media.

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:40.221
[Mirai] Then whoever's out
there will definitely find us.

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:43.474
We've come forward
today in order to talk.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.476
We don't want to fight.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.061
In order to end this chaos,

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.063
all the God candidates
should get together

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:51.524
and have an open and
civil discussion.

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:54.235
We must ensure that our
decision is unanimous

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.529
and doesn't make anyone suffer

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.155
or make anyone unhappy.

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:01.659
[Saki] Red.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:05.454
--[crowd murmuring]
--[ominous music]

00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:06.956
[Mirai] Welcome, Susumu Yuito.

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:09.250
I've been waiting for you
to make an appearance, Red.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:10.251
We finally meet.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.253
I do like what
you've been saying,

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.922
but I don't know if
you're really you.

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:19.677
[Mirai] Yellow, don't move.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:20.845
[Saki] Be careful.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.722
He's the strongest God
candidate at the moment.

00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:24.932
[Mirai] If you want to confirm
my identity, shoot at me.

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.934
You can come closer if you want.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:27.977
Really?

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:32.314
Hey, it really is you!

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:34.358
Oh, wow, I'm so excited!

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.902
Can we do that again?
Can we, huh?

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.154
Come on, come on!

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.906
[Mirai] If you believe me,
then let's go someplace

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:43.159
where we won't be
seen so we can talk.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.035
[Susumu] Yeah,
totally! Let's go.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.789
--[crowd gasps]
--Where'd they go?

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:52.126
Oh, so that's what
you look like.

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.211
You know what?

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.088
I'm really kinda glad you
decided to show me your faces.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.089
[Mirai] Just to be sure,

00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.758
you have a White
Arrow, don't you?

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.092
[Susumu] Mm-hmm.

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:02.803
I'm sure this boy also
wants to choose a God.

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.307
--You want to work with us?
--Huh?

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:09.894
[thoughtful music]

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.312
Oh, I see!

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:13.522
To get the last candidate
to come forward, right?

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:15.733
This is exactly what I
was hoping would happen!

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.026
It makes me so happy!

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.068
Take this.

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.988
It's a way to
contact us directly.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:24.492
I'm not going to insist that
we do everything together,

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:26.994
but we need to be able
to reach each other

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:28.329
at any time of the day.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.997
That's great! Thanks a lot.

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:34.168
We've now assembled four
of the five God candidates

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.545
whose identities we're aware of.

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:39.006
Right. Now we need
to contact Temari.

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:48.724
It's important that no one
notices you talking to us.

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.935
--Uh.
--What is it?

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:53.229
She's acting kinda strange.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.272
Is she talking to
her angel again?

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.233
Just between you and
me, I can't keep up

00:21:57.274 --> 00:22:00.402
with this "God and angels are
supposed to be real" crap.

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:03.280
I think it's a trick. [grumbles]

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:05.366
So that's the plan.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:07.785
--What do you think?
--Interesting.

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:09.787
All the known God
candidates gather together

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.330
and issue an invitation.

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:13.833
[Mirai] Together, the five
of us will openly reach out

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:16.043
to the final God
candidate in a place

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.629
where the whole world
will be able to see us.

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:20.256
Once that person knows we want

00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:22.216
to choose the next
God peacefully,

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:24.301
it'll be easier for
them to come forward.

00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:26.512
Once we've gone to
all that trouble,

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:28.389
we've really put
them on the spot,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.975
and they'll become a nuisance
if they don't cooperate.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.768
[Temari] Once the final
God candidate responds

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.478
to the invitation,
we'll sit down

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.814
and discuss choosing
the next God.

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:38.440
That's a good idea.

00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:39.483
But how am I supposed to escape

00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:41.443
from this so-called
protective custody?

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:44.280
I could barely figure out
how to do my old office job!

00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.907
I was hopeless. Can
I really do this?

00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:49.326
[perilous music]

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:54.874
[closing theme music]
