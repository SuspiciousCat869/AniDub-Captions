The body is a male
in his late teens.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.430
The techs just finished
collecting his prints,

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:15.307
blood, and DNA samples.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.936
His suit appeared to be using
converted military technology.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.395
He couldn't have
put this together

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.106
without access to an
awful lot of money.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.442
We need to identify him quickly

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.861
before someone intervenes.

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:30.489
That goes for those other
God candidates, as well.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.995
[opening theme music]

[melancholy music begins]

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:25.062
There's nothing more
we can do here, Mirai.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.397
Let's go home.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.150
You're exhausted. You really
need to get some sleep.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.195
--I wonder what they'd think.
--Who?

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.239
[Mirai] His wife and daughter.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.158
How would they react
if they found out

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.701
Mr. Mukaido killed someone?

00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:44.998
And on top of that, that the
two of us helped him do it?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.209
I'm sure Ms. Aya
would understand.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.920
She knew how Mr. Mukaido
felt better than anyone.

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.090
She'd know in her heart
that we were assisting him

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.884
in achieving exactly
what he wanted.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.135
Is that true?

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:02.265
If it were me, I'd try
to stop a family member

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.809
from killing another person.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.560
And if someone helped
them to do that,

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:06.895
I'd never have
anything more to do-

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.814
You shouldn't be
thinking like that!

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.649
The bottom line is,
what Mukaido did

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.777
saved every single living
person in the world.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.987
And you didn't do
anything wrong, either.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.950
In the end, you made
the right choice.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.785
The brave choice.

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.120
No matter the circumstances,

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.205
you always find a
way to get through.

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:26.707
You find the strength
within yourself

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.084
to be kind to everyone.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:30.293
That's who you are.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.796
Even if the entire world
ended up blaming you,

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:34.423
I'd still be on your side.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.426
I'll always support
you, no matter what.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.262
[melancholy music fades]

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:44.099
Nasse, Revel, the Red
Arrow that hit Saki.

00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.767
Is there a way to nullify it?

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.770
Well, you can just wait
for 33 days to pass.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.732
Or you can take her
somewhere and kill her!

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.234
I guess I'll just
have to wait 33 days.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.153
[Saki] Am I so
difficult to talk to?

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.196
Uh, oh, no, not at all.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.198
But the Red Arrow's
affecting you.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.576
The Red Arrow has
nothing to do with it.

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.995
I liked you before
you hit me with it.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.663
And fighting alongside you,

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.665
the feeling's only
grown stronger.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.584
And as of right this minute,

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.711
I love you more
than I ever have.

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.045
[gentle music]

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.631
[Nasse giggles]

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:17.716
Okay, I get it.

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.634
You shot me with
a Red Arrow once,

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.136
so I know what it's like.

00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:23.847
You blurt out words you'd
never even dream of saying.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:28.477
And you find that you've
lost all control of yourself.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.937
I'm saying what I'm saying
even though I know that.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.272
All of that.

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:35.525
Right! Saki has always
liked you a lot, Mirai.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:37.360
All you need to do
is respond to her.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.821
That's what Red
Arrows are all about.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.074
Besides, Arrows
aren't everything.

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:47.204
Mr. Mukaido certainly didn't
shoot me with a Red Arrow,

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.289
but I liked him from the start,

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.416
simply for the person he was.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.668
I think what Mr. Mukaido
did for his family

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.505
was the definition
of true justice.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:00.008
Was there something about
Mr. Mukaido you didn't like?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.051
Not at all.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:03.804
Mr. Mukaido was a true hero.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.223
[Nasse] Interesting.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.434
Mirai approved of killing a
person for the first time.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:12.103
All this violence
was upsetting to him.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.481
He wanted the process
to be peaceful.

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:17.108
So Saki, I didn't
say anything before

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.611
because I didn't want
to upset Mr. Mukaido,

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.323
but Metropoliman had been
shot with a Red Arrow.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.491
What?

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:27.327
I don't know if he
ordered someone to do it

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.745
or what went on.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.831
But then who shot him?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:35.168
Well, I guess it had to have
been another God candidate.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.797
After he was killed,
his Wings and the rings

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.382
for his Arrows flew
off somewhere,

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.884
as did that Red Arrow.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.470
Presumably, they went
back to whoever shot him.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.307
Apparently, it didn't
occur to Revel's group

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.643
that we might be
working together.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.312
Penema and I get
along strangely well.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.356
My instincts tell me
we were either friends

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.441
or brothers in a previous life.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.361
Or perhaps we
could've been lovers.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:04.531
I didn't know angels were
aware of their own past lives.

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.199
I have to tell you something.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.286
I'm surprised I got so
many Arrows and Wings.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.788
I especially like
the White Arrows.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.789
Just look at 'em.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.791
They're so shiny and pretty.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.585
Thank you, Balta.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.586
Without your help,

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.422
I'd never have known
Metropoliman's true identity.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.757
Ah, I'm just disappointed

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.760
that Hajime here became
a victim of all this.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.971
But since I got to see
the fascinating show

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.599
I was expecting, I'm satisfied.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.685
[chuckles] So Hajime died
without ever knowing anything

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:34.936
about the bigger picture?

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:35.979
Afraid so.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.648
It was going to be easier
for him to go his own way

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.484
if he wasn't loaded down
with extraneous knowledge.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.820
That battle would
never have taken place

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.531
if it hadn't been for
Hajime's involvement.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.741
You're right.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.701
Anyway, I should head
up to Heaven now.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.079
Give my regards to Penema.

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.539
--I will!
--Good luck.

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:58.752
Bye-bye.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.004
That's great.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:03.465
People really get to go
to Heaven when they die.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.133
What if you're mean, though?

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.594
I wonder if Metropoliman
ended up there, too.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.350
This is the last time
we'll see 'em for a while.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.561
We'd seem unhinged if we
stalked them over summer break.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.730
They already think
that you're unhinged.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.023
The word's gotten out

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:22.025
that you're completely
girl-crazy, my friend.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.693
Really? That's ridiculous!

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:24.945
They don't know me at all.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.821
I'm in complete
control of myself.

It's nothing like that cheap
one he used to wear at first.

You've improved it so much.

Kanade, can I have this place

and all this equipment
when you die?

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.534
Yeah, of course.

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:58.038
And also, I'm gonna want
Red's White Arrow as well.

Absolutely.

If you end up fighting him
again sometime in the future,

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.421
you have to make sure you
take the guy out for good.

You can't run away, even if
you're at a disadvantage.

I promise I won't.

I'll kill him for you by
demonstrating my superiority.

I promise.

gone to Heaven,

'cause there doesn't
seem to be a Hell.

Mmm. Tastes good.

Maybe you know.

Do you think Mirai is
a big fan of curry?

He is, right?

I mean, there's no way
he doesn't like curry.

Honestly, is it that much fun
for you, cooking for Mirai?

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:51.382
Of course. I mean, after
all, I do like him.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.052
It would make me so
happy if he enjoyed it.

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:55.804
I'm kinda nervous, though.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:59.182
I don't know what I'm going to
do if he says it tastes bad.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:00.225
Huh?

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:06.022
So, Saki currently has three
sets of Wings and Arrows,

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.440
including her own.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.692
And my situation hasn't changed,

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.027
which leaves four other groups

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.737
still active on
the playing field.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.407
That means Metropoliman's
four Wings, four Reds,

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.576
and one White all
went to one of them.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.371
Someone out there has as
many as you two combined,

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:24.124
or very likely, they
have even more than that.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:28.211
Yeah. What happens if their
angel is special-rank?

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.799
If it turns out I have to
face two White Arrows...

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.886
I sure hope the owner is
nothing like Metropoliman.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.766
What would Mr. Mukaido have
done in this situation?

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.065
[door clicks]

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.567
Are you in here?

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.443
I made some curry for us.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.865
You okay, Mirai?

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.841
[Saki sighs softly]

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:26.519
--Mr. Mukaido.
--[Saki exhales]

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.529
[birds twittering]

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.703
Good morning! Did you
have a good sleep?

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.998
Uh, yeah. Where's
Nasse and Revel?

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.374
Don't know.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.668
Maybe they're being considerate
and giving us space.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.170
What?

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.088
I figure you must be hungry.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.965
Why don't we eat together?

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:58.176
[tender music]

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.431
--[Mirai exhales]
--[Saki gasps]

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:07.602
Too spicy? I'm sorry,
I like really spicy curry.

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:08.645
It's fine.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.564
It's just that
it's the first time

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.776
I've actually eaten with
someone since I lost my family.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.320
Ever since that time,

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:19.864
everything I've eaten has
been pretty much flavorless.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:25.662
But all of a sudden, sitting
here, I can taste this curry.

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:28.748
I'm telling you,
it tastes so good.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.841
[celestial music]

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.053
All six of us are
now in attendance.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.894
Only half of the original
God candidates still remain.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.230
With that in mind, let
us begin our meeting.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:59.112
[suspenseful music]

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:02.240
So what is it we're going
to discuss at this meeting?

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.450
Are we trying to figure out
each other's intentions?

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.912
[Revel] Penema, the
first-rank Angel of Games.

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:08.913
[Ogaro] Not at all.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.373
It's customary to hold a meeting

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.583
once half the candidates
have been eliminated.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.918
[Penema] Are there
specific subjects,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.753
or is it a general discussion?

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:19.173
It's important to keep the
lines of communication open.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.925
It's unlikely that
things will keep going

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.678
as well as they have
up to this point.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.763
[Revel] Yazeli,
the Angel of Truth.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.557
A self-proclaimed
second-rank angel.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:29.225
What are you talking about?

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.269
I believe there are
no more God candidates

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.314
who are willing to kill the
others in order to become God,

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.898
which is a relief.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.317
I'd be interested to know,

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:41.154
is anyone's partner genuinely
trying to become God?

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:43.364
[solemn music]

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.077
My partner is currently
spending each day

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:51.414
indulging in every
imaginable luxury.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.249
--[Temari sneezes]
--[waves swishing]

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.667
Now, what could've
brought that on?

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.544
I'm naked, but how
could I catch something

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.213
in a warm place like this?

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:00.882
I wonder if anybody's
jealous of me

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.634
after checking out
my latest Insta post.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:08.389
Oh, have they finally
identified Metropoliman? [gasps]

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.142
I, for one, am happy
Poliman is dead at last!

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.561
Now I just need some
kind soul to become God

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:15.355
who won't confiscate
my Red Arrow

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:17.106
so I can spend the
rest of my days

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.983
living in the lap of luxury.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.651
[laughs] I'm not surprised.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.320
Humans always start
acting selfishly

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:23.946
the moment they attain power.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.656
I told her to stop
making Insta posts

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.825
so people don't find out
she's a God candidate,

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.619
but she won't listen.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.120
If these are the
type of candidates

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.872
in the running, at this
rate, it looks to me

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.625
like a God will never be chosen.

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:37.502
Hey, don't think like that.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.629
There's no need to
be so pessimistic.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.422
My partner's not
just sitting around.

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:44.133
--He's being proactive.
--Really?

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:47.136
We have a little over
800 days remaining.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:50.181
You think one of those six
will have stepped up by then?

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.766
I think we're gonna
be in for a game

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.768
that's very interesting.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.019
Very well.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.146
I suggest we keep a
particularly close eye

00:14:57.188 --> 00:15:00.149
on the partner of Penema,
the Angel of Games.

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:03.027

--Are we all in the shot?

--How about now?
--Say cheese!

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:12.286

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.414
Huh?

[Susumu] Hey! I'm
a God candidate!

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.177
[Saki] If I remember right,
you used to like sandwiches,

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.178
didn't you, Mirai?

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.721
Especially egg salad?

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.056
[Mirai] What? I did?

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.350
On a kindergarten
field trip one time,

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.227
you gave me one of the
egg salad sandwiches

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.855
your mother made when I
said they looked good.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:42.525
Before I knew it, I'd
eaten both mine and yours.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.026
Oh, that's right,
I do remember you

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.403
eating all my sandwiches.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.281
Hey, you finally smiled.

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:50.992
You've been so upset since
this God business started.

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:56.038
I just wish we could smile
together like this forever.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.416
Wait, maybe that
means I'm the one

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.376
who always liked
sandwiches so much.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:04.172
--Mm-hmm.
--Mirai! Saki!

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.423
It's a God candidate!

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.967
Another one's finally
appeared. Come on!

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.888
[Reporter] This is
quite a surprise.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.389
The whole world's
talking about you

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.599
on social media right now.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.434
Who are you, exactly?

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.269
--I remember him.
--Yeah.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.439
He was with Metropoliman
at the amusement park.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.066
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.235
My name is Susumu Yuito.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.821
I'm an ordinary boy, and
I'm in the sixth grade.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:31.073
That is, I used to be ordinary.

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:33.576
That changed when
I became a God candidate.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.329
He was in one of
Mr. Mukaido's photographs,

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.123
the ones he had taken
at Jinbo Stadium.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:43.127
I'm not lying, I'm telling
you the honest truth. See?

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.962
What the? Oh, my!

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.507
He's flying! He's really flying!

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:50.801
Okay, I know
Metropoliman's gone,

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.262
but isn't the boy in danger
by revealing his face?

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:55.139
What if this boy is the one

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.600
who shot Metropoliman
with the Red Arrow?

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.060
Yes.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:02.355
That could make him the most
dangerous God candidate of all,

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:05.858
especially if he's inherited
all those Wings and Arrows.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.777
[ominous music]

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:10.196
I was minding my own
business when I was chosen

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.615
to become a God
candidate one day.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:15.993
I don't really want to become
God or anything, you know?

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:17.954
You probably aren't
aware, but I'm the one

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.790
who posted Metropoliman's
defeat the other day.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:22.625
You uploaded that?

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.670
That boy goes to grade
school 17 in district 12.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.088
We can be over
there in 10 minutes.

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:28.756
Start a media blackout.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.132
Secure the boy immediately.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.635
We'll see if he is
what he claims to be.

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:34.887
[Hoshi] He's making his move.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.973
[Reporter] Susumu,
can you explain

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.599
how you became a God candidate

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.601
and what this whole
thing is about?

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:45.690
Well, uh, I was told the
current God wants to retire,

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:48.317
so he got the angels
together and asked them

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:51.279
to go out and find some
people to become the next God.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:55.157
He got 13 angels to
look for 13 candidates.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:56.701
He had them search in Tokyo

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.495
because it's the most densely
populated city in the world

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.914
and because lots of people
there want to kill themselves,

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:04.041
even though their lives
aren't all that bad.

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.544
And people who are unhappy
with the way things are

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.129
make good God candidates

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.922
because they wanna
change the world.

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:13.009
I'm sorry I can't
explain it better.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.512
But the bottom line is,
13 candidates got drafted,

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:19.390
and one of 'em will be
chosen to be the new God.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:20.891
Another thing you
should know is,

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.561
only God candidates
can see angels.

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.272
My angel, Penema,
looks like this.

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.315
Pretty cool, huh?

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:29.775
That angel, what's his rank?

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:32.194
--He's first-rank.
--Huh.

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:34.363
I have to ask, Susumu,
from what you said,

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:36.949
does that mean you also
wanted to kill yourself?

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:39.285
No, I wasn't into
that idea at all.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:41.787
I was just an ordinary
grade school student.

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:44.040
I always got along fine
with the other students,

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:47.084
in class, at lunch,
even at recess.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.670
One thing, though, I was part
of the second-class group

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.839
of students who
didn't have phones.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.008
I mean, I got along
fine at the school,

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.218
but I didn't really
have any close friends.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.387
Everyone was busy
doing their own thing.

00:18:58.429 --> 00:18:59.847
Since both of my parents worked,

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.350
I'd be all by myself until
around 7:00 at night.

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:04.060
I'd get bored,
and after a while,

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:07.396
TV, comics, and video
games weren't fun anymore.

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:08.731
I suppose I could've studied,

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.775
but I didn't really
feel like it.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.818
There wasn't anything I
wanted to be when I grew up.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.322
That was years away,
so I wasn't worried about it.

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.782
I would've been fine
living like that

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.492
until I was all grown up.

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.327
I was happy that my
parents were raising me

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.663
to live a perfectly normal life.

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:26.290
I guess the thing is
that I was just...

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.000
I think I was kind of lonely.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:31.962
[pensive music]

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.756
Then one night,
my parents forgot

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.175
to put away the sleeping
pills they always took.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.804
I was just gonna play around
them when all of a sudden...

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:42.056
--Hey!
--[Susumu gasps]

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.475
You can take those, but
they're not gonna kill you.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.852
That's the moment when
my angel appeared.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:51.816
He told me his name was
Penema, the Angel of Games.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.443
Um, you know, like
the kind you play.

00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:56.195
He told me he
really loves games,

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.614
and then he gave me a
Red Arrow and Wings.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:01.534
I can shoot up to 14
people with my Red Arrows.

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:02.785
Shooting someone with an Arrow

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.537
makes 'em like me a whole lot.

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:07.456
Once I do that, they'll
play with me anytime I want.

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:10.668
You take this Arrow,
and you go shoot people?

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.462
And then after that,
you're much more popular?

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:15.840
--Is that what you're saying?
--That's right.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:18.134
Since then, going to
school's been kinda fun.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:21.762
Hey! Susumu, you're
one of my best friends.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.723
You can use my
phone if you want.

00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:26.934
[Susumu] It was great.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.687
I was using my Wings
and Arrow every day.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:32.898
But then on the news, I
saw that guy Metropoliman

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.734
and heard his challenge.

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:36.736
[Metropoliman] I have
already defeated one.

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:38.904
I will not run and
I will not hide.

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:41.031
To the remaining 11, I say...

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:43.159
Come take me on, if you dare!

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.411
He's gonna find me and kill me!

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.704
This is no good.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.414
It isn't fun at all.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.166
Why does this always happen?

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:52.877
Someone like him shows up
and then gets in my way.

00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:56.172
There are White Arrows, too,

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.132
and they can be
used to kill people.

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.384
In fact, that's exactly
what Metropoliman used

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.845
when he killed four of
the other God candidates.

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.347
He's telling them
about White Arrows.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:06.557
He's revealing too much.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.684
What's the problem?
He's telling the truth.

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.854
Around them, Balta, the Angel
of Intuition, showed up.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:14.440
He knew the human inside
Metropoliman's disguise

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.192
and helped me to shoot
him with a Red Arrow.

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:17.443
It was pretty easy.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:18.778
Wait a minute, Susumu.

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:21.238
That means you know
Metropoliman's true identity!

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.615
So who is he?

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:26.869
I don't think I really
wanna answer that one.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.746
Anyway, after
Metropoliman killed

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.624
those other four God candidates,
he ended up fighting Red!

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:35.920
And then, I gotta tell you
the truth, it was super fun!

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:39.089
I'd never felt so excited
before in my whole life!

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:42.051
It was nothing like comics
or TV or video games.

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:44.553
It was a real fight
with real people!

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:46.722
For the first time in my life,

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.724
I felt like I was a
part of something!

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.684
I was jumping out of my skin!

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.978
--[reporter stammering]
--Ms. Akai!

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.939
Huh? Oh, right.

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:56.982
Susumu, is that everything

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:58.901
you wanted the people
out there to know?

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.986
Oh. Well, no.

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.905
Like I said before,
we're in the middle

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:04.448
of choosing the next God.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.158
I don't know how
the process works.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.743
I just know that including me,

00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:09.995
there are six God
candidates left.

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:13.290
So I think the whole
world should know

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:15.042
what the remaining God
candidates are like

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:17.086
and choose one of
them to take over.

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:18.587
Here's what I say.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.257
Why shouldn't we all have
a part in what happens?

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:23.050
Everyone out there in the world,

00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:25.886
please listen to me and go
find the God candidates!

00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:28.389
Then we'll be able to choose
the next God together!

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.141
This kid is crazy. Completely.

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:32.601
I think you're right.

00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:36.105
He just called for everybody
on the planet to track us down.

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:38.315
[twisted music]

00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:42.236
Personally,

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.865
if the choice was up to me,

00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.575
I'd want Red to become God.

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:55.040
