makes it even better.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:44.959
Looks like we have an ally

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.128
who's been hit with
Saki's red arrow.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.340
So now it's four against four.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.134
What do you say Metropoliman?

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:56.096
How about we settle
this once and for all.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.515
That won't happen. Mr Mukaido,

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.350
speaking as the
newly anointed angel

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.644
who understands human emotions

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.979
I can tell you Metropoliman
is only willing to fight

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.607
when he has an
overwhelming advantage.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:08.983
Its true,

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.611
and having fewer advanced
angels does put me at risk.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:14.614
That's all the more reason
for the dastardly Metropoliman

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.199
not to fight.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:19.202
Both sides should stand
down and settle this later.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.203
Revel

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.621
If you call them names,

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.623
don't you risk provoking
him to attack us.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.709
Now that rebel is
the Angel of emotion.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.837
I think he can understand
Saki's feelings

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.630
because he's always around her.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:33.591
But he doesn't understand
Metropoliman's emotions.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:34.717
And I can tell that

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:37.137
he's now evaluating
Mr Mukaido's feelings.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.681
Mr Mukaido is
running out of time.

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:42.058
I want to help him settle
things here and now.

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.772
That's it. I'm taking my
family to a safe place.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.023
Don't be ridiculous.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.025
There are no safe places.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.318
That's fine.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.361
Go ahead.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.322
We'll wait for you.

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.617
We wouldn't be able to battle
all out with them here anyway.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.660
I see.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:01.744
He intends to fight

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.627
[eerie music plays]

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.673
[wings whoosh]

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.053
What is this place?

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.430
Don't worry.

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.265
We've taken security
measures. You'll be safe here.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.184
Nanaka will join you soon.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.226
Wait,

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.980
I don't understand what exactly
are you fighting against?

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.692
Metropoliman appears to be evil

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:36.446
and he plans to rule over all
of humanity as a dictator.

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:37.447
Your husband has helped

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:38.865
to assemble a force
to fight for the

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.117
future of civilization.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.619
Is that what you're doing?

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.872
In my case

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:48.541
I think I'm being
punished by God.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:49.876
What?

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.837
It sounds strange, but
I'm atoning for my sins.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.341
I feel like God is somehow
testing me to find out

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.469
if I'm worthy of being
allowed to continue living.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.183
He's testing you?

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:11.689
Saki.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.399
There's something
I want to tell you.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.071
I wanna blow some people
away with this thing

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:19.864
That's Ryuji Bakumatsu,

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:23.201
the ex-Self Defense Force guy
who made off with an arsenal.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.869
I heard that a
bunch of explosives

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.747
on three nine millimeter guns
went missing after I left.

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:30.541
Was that your
doing Metropoliman?

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:34.254
I'm locked and loaded with
a Type 87 5.56 mm rifle,

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.839
two 12.7 mm heavy machine guns,

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.342
and an 84 mm recoilless rifle!

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.177
Hey, quit babbling. Will you?

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:42.804
You want me to shut him up?

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.138
I can give him a downer.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.266
What are you, a junkie?

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.809
How rude.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.061
I happen to specialize in the
development of bio weapons.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.021
So don't you go
calling me a junky

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.025
[wings flapping]

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.860
Nanaka let's go

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:58.903
Okay.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.905
Mirai, I have a
message from Revel

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.658
[shocked gasp]

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.913
Got it. I'll be ready
when that happens.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.790
Okay, let's go see your mom.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.084
Daddy

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:17.422
[wings flapping]

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.589
{Nanaka sobs}

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:26.848
Go on now.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.352
Their one goal in
fighting me is to kill me.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.980
But neither Mukaido's
bullets nor Hajime's swords

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.149
can pierce my upgraded suit.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.943
So the main threat is the
guy with the White Arrow.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.237
But for some reason
I can't fathom,

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.947
he doesn't want to kill people.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.366
That gives me an advantage.

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:48.578
Cat-Girls angel only recently
got promoted to first-rank,

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.913
so she has no weapons.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:52.832
Everyone on my side
is a lethal warrior

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.792
who's itching to kill someone.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.878
It'll be a crushing victory.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.797
In the end, it's always
people who kill people

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.842
[wings flapping]

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.594
Okay? Shall we begin?

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.389
By the way, I'd like
to ask you something.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.975
Are you really prepared to
kill these ordinary people?

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.770
I've shot with red arrows
and assembled here.

00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:15.021
Nice try.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.773
There's nothing
ordinary about them.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:20.193
Excuse me. I don't understand.

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:22.028
Am I not allowed to kill them?

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.533
Let me ask you something.
If I told you to kill them,

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.952
could you actually do it.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.871
For you? I'd kill them.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:35.041
The person I was before
I fell in love with you

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.168
might have eventually
been able to kill someone

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.795
out of desperation.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.922
But I'm different now.

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.632
Now, now that I've met you,

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:46.677
I feel the joy of living
coursing through my entire body.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.179
And

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:52.517
No matter who it is, if you
want me to, I can kill them.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.896
My life has value only when
it is used in service to you.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.900
This man truly is interesting.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.986
Red arrows are very
effective on this human

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:04.987
You're, right.

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.989
He'd really kill someone for me.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:09.867
I'm more convinced than ever.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.582
To ensure humanity's future.

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:28.052
You can kill metropoliman.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.264
Saki

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.730
We're forced to kill
him before he kills us.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.233
But....

I won't tell you to
use your white arrow.

You know what this
means? Don't you Red?,

I'm sorry for dragging
you into this.

I'd do anything for you.

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:24.609
I love him so much. I
can't look him in the eye.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.068
Unlike the rest of the time.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.404
He seems so dependable
when he's fighting.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.406
I do anything for Mirai.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.991
I'm sorry Aya

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.994
but it was necessary in order
for us to fight together.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:37.121
Let's finish with this
guy once and for all

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.164
[all] right,

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.127
what the hell do they
think they're doing?

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.338
You really are pretty
stupid. Aren't you?

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.840
Our Red Arrows can't
pierce them anymore.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.176
That means, if we want to
take their wings and arrows,

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.637
we're gonna have to
kill each of them

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.847
Exactly what I
expected them to do.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.224
All right,

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.142
now you're the only one
vulnerable to a red arrow.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.229
In that case, I won't get
involved until the endgame.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.271
If you want me,

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.190
you'll have to beat
the other three first.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:06.776
In other words, I still
control the field.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.152
What's the stop you from fleeing

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.196
the instant you're
at a disadvantage.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.117
I won't run.

Huh?

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.037
That sounded sincere.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.705
He's not lying.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.165

Taking them down is
an even bigger kick!

biggest kick of all.

in slow-motion.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:18.598
God candidates fight
with Arrows and Wings.

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:20.057
Ready? Come on.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.184
Alright..

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:24.729
How about my 84 mm
recoilless rifle?

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.356
Get hit by this and there'll
be nothing left of you

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.199
Got him!

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.124
Can't hit me!

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.251
Arrows and Wings

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.420
can't be hit by objects
from the human world.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.256
But Arrows can
affect other Arrows

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:55.217
And likewise wings can
affect other wings.

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.929
A person's set of
Wings work fine

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.306
if they're unimpeded.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.932
But if two people
use their Wings

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.726
to restrain someone's
attached pair,

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.770
that person can't fly anymore.

00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:09.649
What's going on? I can't move

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:12.943
En garde.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.513
My right arm!

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.682
Oh my God, he cut off my arm!

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:44.225
If you hurry to a doctor,

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.518
you can get it reattached

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:55.319
[Fuyuko laughing]

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:58.447
They did it

00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:00.074
I'm impressed Revel.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.784
You are more
knowledgeable than I am

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:04.370
and your assessment was perfect.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.080
I don't know about that.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.374
I was always the
angel of trickery.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:11.252
I came up with that plan because
I acquired new knowledge.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.796
Things are just starting.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.049
Saki.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:18.759
I'm sorry Mirai

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.761
I'm just.

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.265
I know, let's do our best.

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:29.812
Fuyuko I'm thinking it's
time for a new approach.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.021
Indeed.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:40.197
You wanna guess what
this little number does

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.867
I call it Fuyuko's
Special Virus.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:46.287
Its the strongest virus that
has ever existed in history.

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:47.788
I created it by repeatedly

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.416
recombining a white
blood cell base.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:51.834
What!

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:53.544
The best part about this hybrid

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.338
is that it causes
severe immunodeficiency.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.466
And since I developed
it to be airborne,

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:00.593
it's incredibly infectious.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.389
Watch as it does its thing

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.158
Look, mousie is absorbing
all the pathogens

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.951
and bacteria in the air!

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:29.455
Its going through
hell, isn't it?

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:32.958
[Fuyuko laughs maniacally]

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:37.213
Understand. If I
set this baby loose,

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.381
millions of people will die.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:42.593
It would be an act of bio
terrorism on an unprecedented

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.220
scale.

00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:47.348
Oh, just thinking about it
has got me so turned on!

00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:50.684
There are only two ways
to spread this baby.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:53.938
It goes airborne. When the
switch is pressed or when I die,

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.564
there's a chip
embedded in my heart.

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:59.276
And I'm the only one who
could keep it from going off.

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:01.695
These people are totally insane.

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:03.948
Oh my. From the
looks on your faces.

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:06.283
I can see you don't
want me to activate it.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:08.369
Okay, fine.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.329
I'll consider your concerns.

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:13.499
But only if you
accept my conditions,

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:16.377
I want to test my new
drug that melts people.

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:18.379
And I want you to
be my Guinea pigs.

00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:20.297
Melts?

00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:22.466
Yes

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:23.551
Can you imagine?

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:26.136
I can't wait to try
it out on a human!

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:28.055
I wanna watch some
person melt away

00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.640
into a steaming pile of mush!

00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:31.892
I wanna try it out so bad!

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:37.356
Red, I've decided you'll
be her first guinea pig.

00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:40.484
land on that ferris wheel
and stow your wings.

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.361
What I learned from
fighting you guys

00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:45.573
is that taking hostages is
the most effective tactic.

00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:47.408
And the more
hostages, the better.

00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:51.954
You said you weren't
going to kill anyone

00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:54.206
besides God candidates.

00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:56.458
I'm telling you that
naive nature of yours

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.459
is so irritating.

00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:59.003
Lies don't mean anything

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.422
when you're trying to kill
each other, you idiot.

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:02.965
As long as you four die,

00:23:03.007 --> 00:23:06.135
I won't have to kill anyone
except other God candidates.

00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:14.560
So the deal is

00:23:14.602 --> 00:23:16.645
either the four of us die here

00:23:16.687 --> 00:23:19.023
or millions of other
people will die instead.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.251
