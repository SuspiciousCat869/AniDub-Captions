No.

Can't anybody help?

Don't do it, you two!

[both gasping]

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.204

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.346
[Jami] Please,
won't anybody help?

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.890
You don't want to rush
into this without a plan.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.933
You'd be exposed
as a God candidate.

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:23.769
Listen, Mirai.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.312
We have to be careful.

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:26.396
She's right.

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:29.191
--[Mirai sighing]
--[Chiyo screaming and crying]

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.361
[Mirai] But if we don't
help her, she won't make it.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.362
Wait, though.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.031
If she fails to lure
out any God candidates,

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.033
he won't kill her
right here and now.

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:41.536
At the very least, she's
his ally for 33 days.

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.038
Well now, what's this?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.581
Another angel, huh?

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:48.168
Not who I was looking
for, but that's okay.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.211
You're pretty cute.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.004
I wonder who you belong to.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:53.548
I've gotta say, though,
my own angel is sexier.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.175
You should know
you're not gonna be

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:57.928
luring out any more God
candidates with that girl.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.222
Then she's of no
further use to me.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.933
[Arrow humming]

--[body thudding]
--[cuffs rattling]

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.980
What happened?

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.649
She collapsed all of a sudden.

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.401
[Woman] She's not moving.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.402
[Demakawa] Unbelievable.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.654
Did he just kill that
girl using his Metropon?

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.323
[Man] I feel sick.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.076
How disappointing.

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:22.411
My goal there was to reduce

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.496
the number of candidates
by at least one.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.666
Hey, just between you and me,

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.001
what exactly do you
mean by disappointing?

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.796
As long as it's not
my own God candidate

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:35.215
who's been eliminated,
I barely feel anything

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.425
when humans die.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.634
Although I must admit,

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.594
I think your death
would please me greatly.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.972
I guess that makes sense.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:44.224
You want your own
candidate to become God.

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.393
In that case, you
should be thanking me

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.311
for taking these three
out of the running.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.604
Truth of the matter is,

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.232
I don't care if my candidate
becomes God or not.

00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:53.859
I just want him to be happy.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.610
You're not making any sense.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.280
Man, you angels are so weird.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.614
[Nasse giggling]

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.950
And you're standing in
the way of that happiness.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.286
Nasse...

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.662
What are you doing?

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:07.831
Gee, that's tough.

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.500
But regardless, the next
God is going to be me.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:13.086
--Nah, totally not happening.
--Huh?

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:16.214
Truth is, if you get close,
I'll have my partner kill you.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.302
So even though you're
all cute and childlike,

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:21.887
you're special-rank?

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.306
Maybe it's my cuteness
that makes me so special.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.432
What do you think?

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.268
All God candidates!

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.312
It's time for you to go home!

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:33.523
Blend in with the people
leaving and act normal.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:34.566
Let's go, Mirai.

Gotta fly!

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.411
Now, then.

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:50.207
Hand over those
Wings and that Arrow.

[rings clanging]

[rain pattering]

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.906
I couldn't do a damn thing.

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.116
The responsibility lies with us.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.160
We angels stopped you.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:30.330
Mirai, don't feel guilty
over what happened.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.207
It wasn't your fault at all.

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.960
But I just hate
that Metropoliman.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.965
I never knew Saki was
capable of hating people.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.342
By now, it must be clear

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.135
that the three
people he murdered

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.929
were law-abiding citizens.

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.514
The police will get involved.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.476
So will the police be
able to arrest him?

[Revel humming negatively]

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.187
They wouldn't even
have a chance.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.356
Don't forget, he's
got Wings and Arrows.

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.984
And on top of that, he'd
be able to outsmart them.

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.822
Are we left with killing him?

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.408
--[Nasse gasping]
--[Saki Gasping]

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.617
It'd be impossible.

I'm not capable.

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:11.997
I just couldn't.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.584
I'm not even capable
of hating anyone.

you all right, dear?

Are you having fun, Mirai?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.011
Of course, Dad.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.387
You guys are the best.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:30.223
Nothing in the world is more
important than family time.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.558
You're right.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.143
I discovered I'm at my happiest

when I get to spend my
days off with you guys.

[Mirai] Dad?

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:39.482
[Mirai's dad humming
questioningly]

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.817
You know how mom always says

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.986
all people are born
to find happiness?

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.404
You think that's true?

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.489
Oh, she just says
that out of habit.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:47.490
Don't worry about it.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.034
That's not what I meant.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.452
It's just, I'm happy now,

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:53.622
but how in the world can
I stay happy forever?

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:57.250
I can't figure out how to make
everyone else around me happy.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.794
How to stay happy
forever, you say?

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.713
Well, the first step
is to convince yourself

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.048
that you're happy.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.382
You have to convince yourself?

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.759
That's a silly answer.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.760
You think so?

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.428
I was pretty serious.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.263
That wouldn't make
everyone happy.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.766
And anyway, sometimes you
can't convince yourself

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:13.808
that you're happy.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.395
[Mirai's Dad] Mirai, tell me.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.065
What is the worst thing
you think a person can do?

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.317
That's a hard one.

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:23.443
Murder?

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.819
[Mirai's dad laughing]

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.113
Yeah, I'd say that's
definitely not okay.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.615
But that's pretty obvious,

00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.867
I mean, there are laws
against that kind of thing.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.286
I'm talking about something
you should you never do,

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.538
even though there's
no law against it.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.540
I don't know, Dad, what is it?

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.961
I think the worst thing a
person can do in this world

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.671
is to hate another person.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.839
Nothing good ever comes of it.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.050
It's no good for your
own mind, of course,

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.511
and it's no good
for others, either.

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:50.470
[Mirai sighing]

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:52.097
[kids giggling]

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.432
[Akira] Who wants to go first?

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.559
You know things 'cause
you're an adult, Dad.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:57.435
What do you mean?

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.354
You told me I
shouldn't kill people,

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:00.480
and more important than that,

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:01.856
I shouldn't hate them, either.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.149
Am I right?

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.360
I feel like hearing
that made me grow up.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:06.695
Oh, you're all grown up?

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:07.946
That was quick.

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.531
[both laughing]

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.574
Well, I'm glad you understand.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.369
Because it's simple to say,
but extremely hard to do.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.080
Seems like we've been
saying it for years.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.915
If we could just
stop hating others,

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.875
there'd be fewer
wars and conflicts.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.712
And that would mean fewer
sad and disappointed people.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.505
Maybe then, we'd get
closer to everyone

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.383
being as happy as your
mom says they want to be.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.468
Listen up, Mirai.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.721
No one's telling you
to kill Metropoliman.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.514
We're just saying
things won't improve

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.725
if you leave them as they are.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.059
[Nasse] What Revel is proposing

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:40.145
isn't going to
change Mirai's mind.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.563
He doesn't believe
killing someone

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.523
can set him on the
road to happiness.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.150
And nothing we say to him

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.818
is going to convince
him otherwise.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.404
[Saki sighing]

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.740
We need allies.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:52.741
[Revel humming questioningly]

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:53.908
After today, most God candidates

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.911
are probably scared to
death of Metropoliman.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.706
So maybe we could do what
Metro Blue was proposing.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.583
How about joining
forces with some of the

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.918
remaining candidates,
for mutual protection?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.920
Sounds like a pretty
good plan to me.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:08.506
[all gasping]

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.507

--Get behind me!
--[hand thumping]

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:13.428
[Mirai gasping]
Is that a God candidate?

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.307
[Man] Go ahead and shoot
me with a Red Arrow.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.934
It'll prove to you that
I'm not being controlled.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.853
And then you'll be
able to command me

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.189
to tell you everything
that I'm really thinking.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.150
--[fist thumping]
--Shoot me!

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.610
Why are you waiting?

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.570
What if I'm being
controlled by Metropoliman?

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.030
He's got a point.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.239
Just a minute.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.575
I don't think you really
need to shoot him.

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:38.953
And actually, it would be
much better if you didn't.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.207
This person isn't trying
to lie to you, right?

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.625
[Man gasping]

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.376
[rain pattering]

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.342
[intense musical sting]

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.010
[Revel] If Nasse
says he isn't lying,

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.137
then believe me, he isn't.

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.515
That being the case,
like Nasse says,

00:09:58.556 --> 00:09:59.808
it's better not to shoot him.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.352
Shooting him would force
him to tell us the truth,

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:04.270
but in the end, he'd
also just conform

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.814
to whatever we say or do.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.400
I believe Nasse's
telling the truth.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.444
So do I.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:12.862
I appreciate it.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:15.490
I don't have a lot of time left.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:18.118
What do you mean by
not a lot of time left?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:22.497
[sighs] I have
late-stage cancer.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:23.498
That's what.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.707
[both gasping]

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:27.085
It's spread everywhere,
and it's terminal.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.047
The doctors told me I
had three months to live.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.591
And then, almost exactly
three months later,

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.970
an angel appeared before me.

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:38.596
I was absolutely
certain it had come

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.723
to escort me to the afterlife.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:46.437
You mean you didn't come
here to take me away?

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.772
Not really.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.732
But it sounds like you've
lost all hope to live.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.277
I'm done.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.279
The truth is,

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:58.158
for better or worse, I've
reached the end of my life.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.910
All humans die eventually.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.704
There's no escape.

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.539
I understand.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:07.834
However, I read once
in an ancient tome

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.044
that those who have had
their lives taken from them

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.006
and have accepted death
can become even stronger

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:15.800
than those who have
lost all hope to live.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.468
What are you saying?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.679
I'm suggesting to you
that I can give you

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:20.638
another shot at life.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.016
[Man gasping]

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:26.269
If you become God before
you succumb to your illness,

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.479
your life will be saved.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.191
In fact, you'll live for
thousands of years after that.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.486
I have a family, you know.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.572
My greatest concern is
what will happen to them

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.115
in the future.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:43.077
With a wife and child,
and another on the way,

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.747
I'd have a chance to provide
for them their whole lives.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:48.917
[Man breathing shakily]

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.759
[Man sobbing]

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.681
I jumped at the chance.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:07.685
But I found out it wasn't
as easy as it sounded.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:11.397
They have 999 days to choose
one of the 13 candidates

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.191
to become God.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:16.736
And now you have Metropoliman
eliminating the competition.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:20.365
It would be a miracle
if I lasted 999 days.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.951
There's no way I'm getting
chosen while I'm still alive,

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.120
so I decided to stop
getting treatment.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.581
Instead, I started plotting
what I could accomplish

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:29.999
with my Wings and Arrow.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.960
That's when I came
up with a plan.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:34.712
I used my Red Arrow
on rich people

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.965
and had them give me
over 200 million yen

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:40.510
to pass on to the wife and
children I'd be leaving behind.

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:43.888
A thief like me doesn't deserve
to be the Supreme Being.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.350
A selfish man who only thinks
of himself shouldn't be God.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.143
Hey, that's not true at all!

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.146
In fact, that's the right way
to use your Wings and Arrow.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.774
You just want your family
to be safe and happy.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.859
Why is that wrong?

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.030
Well, wrong or not, what
I did has consequences.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.991
I stole that money
in exchange for

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.867
giving up the chance
to become God.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:09.664
After that, I started
thinking about what I could do

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.416
while I was still alive

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:14.419
to ensure the future
happiness of my children.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.421
The most urgent
thing is to make sure

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:19.465
a monster like Metropoliman
never becomes God.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.136
To prevent a disaster
like that from happening,

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:26.139
I'm trying to meet as many
God candidates as possible

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.434
and form an alliance
with them to defeat him.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.603
To that end, I'm determined
to identify each of them

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.606
and decide which one is
worthy of becoming God.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.025
To find the other candidates,

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:40.194
I shot private eyes and
psychologists with Red Arrows

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.238
until I hit the 14 person limit.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.490
I then sent them to the stadium.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.826
They reported back that
a few people behaved

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.870
like they could see
Angels and Arrows.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.040
Mirai Kakehashi.

00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:53.499
Saki Hanakago.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:54.834
You could see them.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.586
[both gasping]

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:58.838
Now that I've taken
myself out of the running,

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.799
I can look at others with
a clear and impartial eye.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.927
When I saw the pictures of
you in that report, I thought,

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.389
"These two are good."

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.599
[both gasping]

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.434
So let me ask.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:14.228
Are either of you
intent on becoming God?

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.229
[Mirai gasping]

No, I don't really want the job.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:22.904
Neither do I.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.281
[Mukaido humming in approval]

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:26.741
I hear you both.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.076
That's good.

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:31.454
I can't imagine any decent
person wanting to become God.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:32.872
I'm willing to help you,

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.666
but only if you agree
to one condition.

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.043
And what's that?

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:39.462
You'd have to continue
your treatments.

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:40.713
Fight to the end.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.048
Don't give up on life.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.634
[Man gasping]

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:47.512
I think it's selfish of you
to say you're okay with dying.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.891
Consider the feelings of the
family you'll leave behind.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:15:00.066
--Okay, I agree.
--[Mirai gasping]

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:03.569
Bottom line, I want to live as
many days as I possibly can.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.612
Right!

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.702
[rain pattering]

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:14.705
[Arrow humming]

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.915
What's the most effective way

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.126
to use these three
Wings and Arrows?

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.460
Red Arrows don't allow you

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.546
to tell someone to
kill themselves.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.549
You can't tell someone
to commit murder, either.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.551
That means I have
to be very careful

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.302
in my use of the White Arrow.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:31.973
It's the only thing I have
that can kill someone else.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:37.019
However, what if someone starts
out urgently wanting to die?

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.398
Or even wanting to kill someone?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.027
[Man] My Angel's name is Baret.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:47.780
She's also known as
the Angel of Knowledge.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.949
--Baret?
--An educated angel.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.201
One that has acquired all
the knowledge of the heavens

from angels, God,
and personal history.

But also, who was demoted from
special-rank to first-rank

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.918
for constantly flaunting
that knowledge.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.922
From his boasts, I think
Metropoliman's angel is Meyza.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.925
I've gotta say, though,
my own angel is sexier.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.510
He was proud of that.

[Mukaido] Meyza, known
as the Angel of Greed.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.099
According to Baret,
Meyza shot from unranked

to special-rank.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:19.604
She has no idea exactly
how that happened.

By the way, could you
tell us your name?

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:40.041
When you say "plan," are you
saying you design clothes?

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:41.042
[Mukaido] That's right.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.043
Take a look.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:45.171
[Saki] Oh, what are these?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.964
[Mukaido] Costume ideas.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.174
They're for protection.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:51.219
We should conceal our
identities, like Metropoliman.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.012
If we're gonna take this guy on,

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.181
we need to be
ready for anything.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.808
And these suits are
designed for that.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.394
[both chuckling]

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.855
Let's hold another
strategy meeting tomorrow.

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.401
If I don't show up, you
can assume I'm dead.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:09.695
See, there you go again.

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.030
I'm just joking.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.031
See you later.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.408
[wings flapping]

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.035
[Saki] He's an odd person.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.288
Yeah, but it seems like
he might be dependable.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.831
The strongest ones among us

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.542
are those who are
prepared to die.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.630
Those who are prepared to die.

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:37.223
[birds chirping]

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.725
[bell ringing]

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.062
[Teacher] That's it
for today, everyone.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.898
[bell ringing]

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:48.734
See you all tomorrow.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.115
--[students chattering]
--Kanade!

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:55.074
[Kanade humming questioningly]

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.285
Wanna do some
babe-watching again?

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.452
I suppose.

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:00.121
Do you have some place in mind?

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:02.456
Let's go check out the
middle school today!

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.959
Being the chairman of
the board's grandson,

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.128
you get to go wherever you like.

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:09.880
[arrow thudding]

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.216
[Sayuri sighing]

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.302
Oh, man, Sayuri's so cute.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.512
She's three years younger
than us, isn't she?

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.264
[Kanade] Girls her
age are the prettiest.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.266
Their bodies and minds are pure.

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.852
Well, still, I wish I
could date a girl like her.

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:24.645
Listen, if you'd
be willing to die

00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:26.188
in order to sleep with her,

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.482
I could make her fall
head over heels for you.

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:29.692
[Minamikawa] Seriously?

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.319
Here's the catch.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.113
You'd definitely die for
real after the experience.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.740
That's a little extreme.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:41.912
--[bow twanging]
--[arrow thudding]

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.289
[Sayuri gasping]

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:44.915
[Kanade humming thoughtfully]

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.543
[Kanade] Minamikawa, if you
could have any wish come true,

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.712
anything at all, what
would you wish for?

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:52.089
Seriously, anything at all?

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.716
Uh...

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:54.967
I guess it'd be money.

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:56.469
I'd wanna be obscenely rich.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.554
--[Kanade] Wrong answer.
--Excuse me?

00:18:58.596 --> 00:18:59.930
Think bigger.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.308
Something that would
affect the whole world.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.477
[Minamikawa] Well then,
how about getting rid of

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.812
all the nuclear
weapons on the planet?

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.814
[Kanade] All right,
that's more like it.

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.776
Oh yeah, and I'd wish for
all ugly girls to disappear.

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:14.445
Huh?

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.198
I approve of those wishes.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:18.282
[Minamikawa] One other thing.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:20.493
I'd wish for all men
more handsome than me

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:21.827
to disappear as well.

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:22.828
That's no good.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.205
That would kill me.

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.748
Oh yeah, sorry.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.791
Tell me, Kanade.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.126
What is it you'd wish for?

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.920
[Kanade] Well, let's see.

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:33.130
Not for something that
could realistically happen,

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.507
like someone dying.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.801
If I could have
any wish granted,

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.387
I'd want something unimaginable.

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:42.181
[wind howling]

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.269
Something like
bringing back the dead.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:50.690
Your little sister?

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.444
[wind howling]

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.447
What?

00:19:58.489 --> 00:19:59.865
Aw, man, they all left.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:04.620
[footsteps tapping]

--[hand tapping]
--[wind howling]

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.335
In archery, there
are close-range

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:12.837
and long-range targets.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.214
Close-range ones
are 28 meters away

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.216
and long-range ones
are 60 meters away.

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.551
Did you know that?

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:19.593
Huh?

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:25.224
[Kanade] The Arrow's
range is 31.6 meters.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.854
Targets farther than
that are a problem.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.816
[Arrows clanging]

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:37.445
By merging two Arrows, I
can easily reach 60 meters.

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:40.114
If I combine three, I
could reach over 90.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.866
[Minamikawa] What are
you doing out there?

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.033
Nothing.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.076
Let's go.

I brought flowers.

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:18.152
Happy birthday.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:27.286
[Mukaido] Our priority
is contacting this boy.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:30.331
He's the other God candidate
I found that the stadium.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:31.957
[both gasping]

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:36.086
Unfortunately, he flew away and
I wasn't able to follow him.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.838
[Saki] Minus
Metropoliman and us,

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.256
plus the ones he's eliminated,

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.675
there should be five
God candidates left.

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:43.302
[Mirai] One is that
boy in the photo,

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:45.054
so there are four left to find.

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.138
[Mukaido] We should
watch for people

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.306
who suddenly come into wealth

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:50.434
or become popular
in an unnatural way.

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:52.061
If you come across
someone who exhibits

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:54.313
any other signs of
unusual behavior,

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:57.358
it's highly likely
they'll be God candidates.

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.909
three of her classmates
two years ago?

00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:09.328
[Reporter] We have
this breaking news.

What's believed to be a
declaration of criminal intent

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.375
written by fugitive Girl A has
been released to the public.

00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.334
The note reads-

00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:17.461
[Saki] What is this?

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:18.462
What did I just say?

00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:20.339
Unusual behavior.

00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:21.966
How did that girl escape?

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.259
She even left a note.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.511
[Reporter] According to the
TMPD, Girl A was being held-

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:27.137
Wings and Arrows.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.473
Can they be given to humans
who aren't God candidates?

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:30.474
Yes.

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:32.017
But only with conditions.

00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:36.397
Metropoliman could have
given them to that girl?

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:38.607
Yeah, but weren't her three
earlier murder victims

00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:40.484
stabbed to death with a knife?

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.403
Hey, if she's gotten
hold of a knife,

00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:44.947
she won't need a White Arrow.

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:46.991
And if she now has Wings,

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.576
she can kidnap anybody

00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:50.786
and it will be nearly
impossible to catch her.
