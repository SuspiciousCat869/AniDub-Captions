[Mirai] I'm an ordinary student

at an ordinary high school.

[eerie music]

An angel?

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:29.488
Is it Metropoliman's?

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.489
Okay, calm down.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.157
Nasse is nowhere near me.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.701
He has no way of knowing
I'm a God candidate.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.540
I just need to act
natural as I walk past.

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:50.592
Too late.

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:53.595
Nice try, but you
reacted to seeing me.

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.389
You're sweating bullets.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.100
I didn't know a God
candidate was so close by.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.018
What seems to be the problem?

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.687
Why are you so nervous?

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.439
This isn't your first time
seeing an angel, is it?

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.441
No. But that has to mean...

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.277
Who is it that you're with?

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.071
I'm attached to a student
who attends this school

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.240
who's standing right behind you.

[Mirai gasps]

[Mirai] Saki?

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.162
Mirai, is that you?

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.165
[Mirai exhales shakily]

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.875
[Mirai] I don't believe this.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.087
Saki shot me with a Red Arrow.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.923
She's a God candidate, too.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.467
[Revel] Good. Now he's
madly in love with her.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.305
Even though I've been shot,
I'm aware of what happened.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:39.141
But since I had feelings
for Saki, nothing's changed.

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.605
Truth is, I like you.

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.232
I love you, Saki!

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:54.239
[opening theme music]

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:23.203
I love you. I've
always loved you!

[gentle music]

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.125
Saki? What is it?

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.169
I don't get it! Why
do you look so down?

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.965
Why are you making that
sad face? Talk to me!

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.800
You know I'll do
anything for you.

00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:40.095
[Revel] Saki. Do what
I told you to do.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.057
Mirai, tell me.
Do you have Wings?

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.058
Saki...

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.060
Mmm. It's true.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.271
Good. As I suspected.

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.857
Do you remember where I live?

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.775
Of course! I love you!

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.402
[Saki] My room's
on the third floor.

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:56.987
You can come in
through the window.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.573
Make sure no one sees you,
and wait there for me.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.074
Yeah? You're sure?

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.451
[Saki] I'll come meet you there

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.911
right after the
entrance ceremony.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:05.954
All right.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.290
I'll be waiting. See you then!

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.918
I love you, Saki!
I love you so much!

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.259
You really have to wonder
what his angel is up to.

00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.094
She's nowhere to be seen.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.638
Well, it does make it
more convenient for us.

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.900

[Mirai] I can't believe
I'm here in Saki's room,

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.333
waiting for her to
come and join me.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:54.878
Saki. She's all I can think
about all of a sudden.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:00.383
I'm feeling so happy.

I can't even express
how much I love you.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:14.940
Looks like we're both
in the same homeroom.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.149
[gasps] Are you sure?

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.570
Hmm. The Red Arrow
seems to be working.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:23.782
Because of that, he'll answer
any question you ask him.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.158
That's good for us.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.202
At this point, ask
him if his angel

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:28.829
is first-rank or second-rank.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.207
What rank is your angel, Mirai?

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.583
Special-rank, I think.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:37.379
Special-rank? Saki, ask
him if he has White Arrows.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.297
Does that mean you
have White Arrows?

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.258
Yeah. I said I didn't
want them, though-

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.343
Hold on there, mister!
Are you Metropoliman?

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.762
What? Absolutely not!

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:49.182
[Revel] Yeah. I guess that
would be too good to be true.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:52.352
No, wait. It's better
that he isn't that guy.

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.439
--Hmm. [exhales]
--Huh?

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:59.025
Listen to me carefully.
This is important.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.611
Saki has no Wings and
can't dodge Arrows.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.406
I want you to act
as Saki's Wings.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.533
--Her Wings?
--Yes.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:09.411
Some of the God
candidates are dangerous.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.454
I want to protect Saki.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.373
Saki...

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:14.541
Of course I'll do it.

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:17.502
I will! I will be Saki's Wings.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.129
That's good.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.381
There's no telling when
you might have to swoop in.

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.592
You should practice
flying with her.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.968
Yeah, but how?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.845
You need to start
by touching hands.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.851
[Mirai] Are you sure?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.066

Her hand is so small
and soft and warm.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.993
Now connect both armbands.

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.536
They serve as a lifeline.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.422
That won't come undone unless
both of you will it to.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.424
Now get behind her
and hold onto her.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.468
How do you mean? Oh!

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.804
It's like we're dancing.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.475

together all the time.

You can tell me
what's bothering you.

Thank you, Mirai,

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:16.871

I can handle on my own.

Good, I'm glad.

You had a successful
flight. That's encouraging.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:42.522

be such a weakness anymore.

[Mirai] Metropoliman News?

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:51.322
Yes. My angel says I should
try to keep tabs on him.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.574
Right, Revel?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.909
It appears Metropoliman
apprehended a slasher.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.996
He's appearing on
Sakura TV at 6:00 pm.

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.539
We'd better watch.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.751
Metropoliman's our biggest
cause for concern at the moment.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.086
Let me explain why I'm worried.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.130
In the past, the
new God was chosen

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.673
after an impartial evaluation

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.384
of each candidate's
personality and behavior.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.595
But Metropoliman disagrees.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.513
To draw out the
other candidates,

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.600
Metropoliman's been posing
as a hero of justice.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.310
In the process, he's
been winning over

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.729
the media, the public,
and the police.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.773
He intends to kill
the other candidates

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.816
so that he can become God.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.568
That kind of thinking
doesn't befit

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.737
a person competing
for that position.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:34.574
Someone needs to make sure
his plan fails. It's critical.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:38.453
His angel is special-rank,
which means he has White Arrows.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.581
Before long, Saki
will be in his sights.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.458
What? No!

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.211
I can't let Saki die. I can't!

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.588
I'll deal with it.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.592
I'll go to Sakura
TV and stop him.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.969
[Revel] You could be putting
yourself in great danger.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.931
I'm prepared to do
whatever it takes.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.432
And by that, you mean?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.018
Sacrificing myself!

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.646
I'm willing to die
to protect Saki.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.273
[Nasse] Don't do that!

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:08.566
[Mirai] Nasse.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.235
You were late and I got worried,

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.612
so I came out here to find you.

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.781
You're not thinking
clearly, Mirai.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.241
Tch.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.492
Revel's been manipulating you

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.994
because you let Saki hit
you with a Red Arrow.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.663
Wrong game plan!

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:24.499
It's fine. I'm happy to do this.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:26.960
[Revel] Special-rank is reserved

00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:29.587
for angels who have an
exceptional quality.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.840
In Nasse's case, it's purity.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.467
She could be my most
challenging opponent.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.427
But if I look at it another way,

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.639
she could end up being
the easiest to manipulate.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.558
Even if you go
there and see him,

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.852
do you think Metropoliman will
even bother talking to you?

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.770
I don't know.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.731
You might end up trying
to kill each other.

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.275
If the current
owner passes away,

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.735
Wings and Arrows can be
transferred to someone else.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.863
--Huh? Nobody said that.
--It's true.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.073
So if you were to die somehow,

00:10:57.115 --> 00:11:00.034
your Wings and Arrows could
be transferred to Saki.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.035
Or this.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.829
If Metropoliman were to die,

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:05.248
you could take his
Wings and Arrows

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.167
and be free to
give yours to Saki.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:11.045
Revel must be hoping one of
these scenarios takes place.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:14.632
You've lost the ability to
think about this rationally

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.093
because of the
Red Arrow's power.

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.720
--Even so.
--Mirai.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:20.847
Don't go.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:22.807
Excuse me?

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.726
It's the last thing
you should do.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:25.768
[Mirai] Right.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.564
--[Nasse giggles]
--[Revel groans]

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.900
Well, fine. I thought
it was a plan

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.068
that would ultimately
solve a lot of problems.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.279
My bad. Sorry about that.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:39.699
Revel, this is why people call
you the Angel of Trickery.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.076
Couldn't they call me
a strategist instead?

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.787
You're still second-rank
because you're not that smart.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.082
Bottom line, all 12
angels are trying

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.043
to make their chosen
human the next God,

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.545
and there's no telling
what methods they'll use.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.672
That's right, just like you.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.675
Regardless, since we're in
this situation, I believe

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.053
it would be in our best
interests to work together.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.095
How would that be?

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.096
What? Wait.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.057
You really expect
me to work with him?

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:06.684
The guy who tried to
send me off to my death?!

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.270
There's no telling what
you'll try to do to Saki

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:11.189
once the power of
the Arrow wears off.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.400
Mirai wouldn't ever
do anything to Saki.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:17.111
After all, he's had feelings
for her his whole life.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.404
Nasse!

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:19.572
What? Really?

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:23.326
Even more reason to use
his Red Arrow on her.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.369
Except he won't.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.204
And even if he did,

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.331
he would never do
anything inappropriate.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.999
He loves her too much for that.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.710
You can at least believe
that about him, right?

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.382
Your argument does have merit.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:40.551
But in that case, I expect
you to trust me, as well.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.886
We're fine with that.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.931
Now, hold on a
minute. I'm not sold.

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.307
It'll be all right.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.810
Angels aren't allowed to
harm the God candidates.

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.813
But what's more important
is, Saki needs Wings.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:54.232
For Saki's sake, it's fine.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.942
If it allows me to protect her

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.902
and we can then both
be happy together,

00:12:57.944 --> 00:12:58.987
I'll do anything.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.366
The Arrow's power is amazing.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.410
He doesn't usually
say stuff like that.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:12.000
[Mirai] What? You
want me to live here?

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:12.959
Well, of course I do.

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.919
It's the only way to do the job

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.963
if you're protecting Saki.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.465
All right. I guess I don't mind.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.635
--Okay with you?
--Yeah.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.345
Until a new God is chosen.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.808
[Mirai] Oh, Saki!

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.896
--[sirens wailing]
--[cars whooshing]

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.401
[Officer] Stop the vehicle!

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:42.822
Pull over to the curb and
keep your hands on the wheel!

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.700
[criminal snickers]

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.827
[wheels screeching]

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:48.911
Serves ya right!

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:53.041
Huh?! What the hell?

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:55.460
[heroic music]

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.132
[Officer] What happened
to all that attitude

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.633
you had earlier?

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.595
I'm sorry, officer. I surrender.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:08.890
--[reporters clamoring]
--Great job, Metropoliman.

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.058
First, you stopped the slasher.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.268
Today, you caught the
dealer who sold him drugs,

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.104
and you did it all without
causing any casualties.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.899
[Metropoliman] It was the
right thing to do. Farewell.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.528
[Reporter] When will
we see you again?

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.947
Um, live from the scene,

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.700
that was Metropoliman,
a hero of few words.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.748
Ugh, these criminals
are a distraction.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.750
They're not the ones I want!

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:39.462
I really just need to kill the
other 11 candidates, right?

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:44.050
Yes. I believe that's the
most comprehensive solution.

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.927
And the most effective.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:48.513
[Kanade] It's already
been over a month.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.640
[Metropoliman] To the
remaining 11, I say:

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.850
come take me on, if you dare!

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.852
No one's come for me yet.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.147
Instead, I've become
a tabloid hero.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.816
Look at all this coverage.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.068
If things don't change

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.737
and this ends up sending
me straight to Hell,

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.156
I'm not going to be laughing.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:11.160
The other 11. Do you think
they're that scared of me?

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.621
They're probably afraid
of getting killed.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.792
[Kanade] Afraid of
getting killed, huh?

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.336
In that case...

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:25.508
[suspenseful music]

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.551
[Revel] Hmm.

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:31.264
[Nasse] See?

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:32.515
He hasn't changed,

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:35.059
even though the Arrow's
effects have worn off.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:38.020
I told you tying him up
wouldn't be necessary.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:39.814
[Revel] Well, better
safe than sorry.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:42.150
[Saki] I apologize. Sorry.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:46.988
Hmm. It seems Mirai does have
genuine feelings for Saki.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:48.781
He can't even stop blushing.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.993
I'm glad you shot me, Saki.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:56.956
I got to tell you how I
feel and then act on it.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.958
It helped me realize
how important it is

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.209
to be upfront and honest.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.920
Not to mention, of course,

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.214
I experienced the joy of
being together with you.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.760
All that, but you won't
tell her you love her?

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.179
Give me a break, will you?

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.599
I think someone
like Metropoliman

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.810
who threatens our happiness
is unfit to become God.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.228
I agree with you.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.023
God's always been the one who
leads people to happiness.

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.609
He should never be the one
who threatens to destroy it.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.237
Metropoliman can't be allowed
to interfere with our lives.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.449
That goes for my happiness
and Saki's as well.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:35.661
Or more specifically, my desire
to find happiness with Saki.

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:36.704
Mirai.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.791
Listening to you
speak has made me feel

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.002
like I have to search
for happiness, as well.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.755
Exactly. We'll both
be happy together.

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:47.840
What? Oh, um, sorry, Mirai.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.134
I didn't mean it would be
with you in particular.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.136
Huh? Uh, of course!

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.179
Right, right.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.015
Is that Arrow still
affecting you?

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.642

[smartphones buzzing]

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.484
Both phones. Does that mean...

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:07.818
Yeah.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.112
--I knew it.
--A live broadcast?

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.034
Hope he doesn't say
anything stupid this time.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.664
We will now play the video
that was sent in to us.

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:22.041
[Metropoliman] Good
evening. I am Metropoliman.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:25.002
Or rather, I am the hero
wearing the Metropoliman suit.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.587
To my 11 challengers,

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.215
I realize now that
we're on the same side.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:30.591
I considered you enemies before,

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.386
but in many ways, we
are kindred spirits.

00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:35.471
--Huh?
--What? Excuse me?

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.223
[Metropoliman] I'm looking
for a peaceful resolution

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.599
to our differences.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:41.060
Let's get together
and talk things out.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.853
Talk what things out?

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.147
He must think we're
stupid or something.

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:47.233
It's obviously a trap.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.193
[Metropoliman] I propose
we all meet at 3:00 pm

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.946
the day after tomorrow
to discuss the situation.

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:55.157
I've reserved Jinbo Stadium,
and I'll be waiting for you.

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.326
That's the whole thing.

00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:01.122
He's invited the others to
establish a peaceful alliance.

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.748
Now, what's that all about?

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.042
And why'd he pick Jinbo Stadium?

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.086
It doesn't have a roof.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.714
Candidates with Wings
could show up at any time.

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.257
Then flee at any time.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:14.844
He's making it as accessible
as he can so people attend.

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:15.886
You're right.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.722
He's probably assuming
lots of people will come

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.098
just to see what happens.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.475
He wants candidates to
think they'll blend in

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:25.104
so they won't be identifiable
in the middle of the crowd.

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.565
You're right. He set up a trap.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.276
Day after tomorrow is
too short a notice.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.902
Candidates without
Wings couldn't--

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.155
[Revel] They're all in
Japan. It's not an issue.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.114
Huh?

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.159
Oh, Nasse, did you
forget to tell the boy?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.995
Uh, you mean the
statistical conundrum

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.497
that even though this
country is fairly prosperous,

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.291
a lot of people commit suicide?

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.584
That one?

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.377
Yeah, that's right,
something like that.

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:50.755
You figure if we go,

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.466
Metropoliman will attack
us with White Arrows?

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:55.343
I think that's his
primary mission.

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:58.179
I agree, I can't believe
he'll just talk to us.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.473
A stadium's an odd
place for a chat.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:02.099
[Mirai] Hmm.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.560
Mirai, you're not thinking
about going, are you?

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.814
I'm sure someone will broadcast
it live on television.

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.776
I believe our best option
is to stay here and watch.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.611
[Mirai] Hmm.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.995
--[thrilling music begins]
--[helicopter rumbling]

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.499
The question is,
what are we about

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.334
to witness on the
ground at Jinbo Stadium?

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.170
Sakura TV is here to bring
you the whole thing live.

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.714
I, Demakawa, and the
leading self-proclaimed

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:37.301
Metropoliman analyst, Mr.
Masayoshi, are in place.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:38.969
We will both be
walking you through

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.597
this exclusive
broadcast as it happens.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:42.973
[Mirai] I see angels.

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:47.186
There are definitely
other God candidates here.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.023
I wonder how many
are already here.

00:19:51.065 --> 00:19:53.401
[Metropoliman] Let's get
together and talk things out.

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.988
[Mirai] I doubt he's planning
to talk anything out.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.031
Mirai.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.036
Don't look up. It's
a real giveaway.

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.079
Right.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.379
You shouldn't react to things
only God candidates can see.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:14.880
That's what Revel had said.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.050
You're actually planning to go,

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:19.844
even though it's
probably a trap?

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.221
I'll be extra cautious
because it's a trap.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:24.390
And I might just pick
up something useful

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:25.891
while I'm there.

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:28.018
You'll be exposing yourself,
but if you insist on going,

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.563
you shouldn't react to things
only God candidates can see.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:32.440
Also, you may have
to leave quicker

00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.066
than the human eye
can follow, so--

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.276
I'm aware.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:37.445
I promise I won't do
anything unnecessary

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:39.864
that might draw
attention to myself.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.116
However, if I have
the opportunity

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.826
to shoot him with a Red Arrow...

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:48.372
[drones whirring]

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.459
It's all right.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.295
It's only natural to look up
at the helicopters and drones.

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:56.297
They're broadcasting
everyone on TV.

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:57.798
He's probably
scanning the images

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.092
to try and identify his targets.

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:03.804
We just have to blend in and
be two faces in the crowd.

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.598
Right, and while
discussing these topics,

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:07.808
we definitely need to
keep our voices down.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.226
Yeah.

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.103
[Demakawa] The crowd
is eagerly anticipating

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:12.521
the arrival of Metropoliman.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:13.939
Will there be a confrontation

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:15.649
between him and the
11 other challengers,

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.652
whom he once referred
to as his enemies?

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:19.695
Saki.

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:22.281
Everyone here is on high alert.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.284
As an indication of just
how high, it's the police,

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:28.746
rather than security guards,
who are monitoring the event.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.915
Okay, it's nearly 3:00 pm,

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.167
the meeting time
set by Metropoliman.

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:36.295
Ten!

00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:38.339
--Nine! Eight! Seven!
--A countdown has begun

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.717
--inside the stadium.
--Six! Five! Four!

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:45.054
Three! Two! One!

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:47.473
[air whooshing]

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:48.891
Bingo.

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.268
[Demakawa] He's here! He's
arrived exactly on time!

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:56.440
--It's Metropoliman!
--[crowd roaring]

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.945
--What the hell?
--Who are those guys?

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.488
[Audience Member]
Where'd they come from?

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.490
Two mysterious figures
have suddenly appeared!

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:05.574
That's unbelievable!

00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:07.952
It's Metro Blue and Yellow!

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.704
[Demakawa] In a
stunning development,

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:13.374
Metro Blue and Yellow have
now joined Metropoliman

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:15.292
in the skies above the stadium!

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.794
--Look, Mirai.
--Yeah.

00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:19.964
They have Wings and Red Arrows.

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:22.424
Only first-rank angels
or higher have both.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:25.302
Do they intend to shoot him?

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:26.720
Are they going to fight?

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:32.351
I don't get it. Why isn't
he activating his Wings?

00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:33.394
[Saki] Mirai!

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:40.442
[thrilling music continues]

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:49.243
[Mirai] The Red Arrow
can't pierce his armor!

00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:54.290
--[thrilling music drops off]
--[closing theme music begins]

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.168
[machinery whirring]
