WEBVTT

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:09.676
What is it?

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:11.303
She's acting kind of strange.

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.430
Is she talking to
her angel again?

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:14.848
[Temari] Really? Oh, I want!

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.100
What in the heck.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.268
Problem?

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.479
She's talking to
herself again, as usual.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.522
[body thuds]

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.273
What's happening?

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:24.399
That doesn't look good.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.361
What's wrong, Temari? Answer me.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:32.157
You know, she's tried to
commit suicide twice before.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.367
Listen up.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:34.910
Temari's exhibiting
odd behavior.

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:36.703
Tanaka, Yoshinaga, Kimura.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.914
You have permission
to enter the room.

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.165
Be very careful.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.166
[All] Roger.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.752
[ominous music]

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:48.090
What's the matter
ma'am, talk to us.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.802
[ominous music]

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.811
[energy whining]

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.151
Ugh.

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:11.989
I want to get out of here.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.574
Will you help me?

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.450
[All] Of course, Miss Yuri.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.213
[opening theme music]

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:49.795
What's happening in there.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.129
Is she trying to escape?

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.255
Report in immediately!

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.256
Sir?

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:54.424
It's all right.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:55.676
All of the doors are locked

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.636
and can't be open
from the inside.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:59.471
The windows are tempered glass.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.723
Everyone fortify
the main entrance.

00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:07.521
Ah!

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.856
There's a whole army
of them down there.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.733
How many red arrows have I got?

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.068
Just six left.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.278
Dammit, that's
not nearly enough.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.488
This way, Miss Yuri.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:18.740
Don't move.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.701
Their guns are trained on you.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.744
No telling if they'd
really open fire,

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:23.912
but don't pursue her.

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:24.913
We're tracking her.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.289
She's entering guest bedroom E

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.916
on the second floor with Tanaka.

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.672
[gun firing]

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:36.425
What the hell is he doing?

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.051
Show external cameras.

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.306
[Hoshi] I'm counting
on you, Tanaka.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.851
[gun firing]

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.770
[glass breaking]

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.275
They took out the
whole window frame.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.152
We have to secure Temari.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.987
Go find her.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.905
Teams B to G, approach
from the south!

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.116
Teams H to K, circle
around the north!

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:06.538
[cape fluttering]

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:10.333
There she is, flank
her from both sides!

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.253
--Ugh!
--We've got her!

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.254
She's been secured!

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.464
Quit struggling, lady!

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.466
restrain her right
hand and cover her eyes

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.508
or she'll shoot you.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.890
[Tanaka laughs]

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:25.891
[All] Tanaka?

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.350
Dammit, we've been tricked.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.685
It looks like she may have

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:29.978
escaped through
the main entrance.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.022
I'm sorry, sir.
She outsmarted us.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.983
[Hoshi] Good work, Tanaka.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:44.159
[panting]

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:48.830
[Temari] I'll tell you.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.999
Wigs sure come in handy
at moments like this.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.626
Lucky me.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.971
Are you Susumu?

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.014
[Susumu] Yep.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.976
This is Mirai
Kakehashi, AKA Red.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.230
And Saki Hanakago, AKA Yellow.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.023
Red, huh?

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:18.151
I have to say, you're
cuter than I expected.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.196
Now, since everything
went according to plan,

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.906
give me my reward for escaping.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.618
Here are the wings
you were promised.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.042
[wings unfurling]

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.424
These things rule.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.053
I gotta say, I feel
like a real angel, now.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.014
Let's go, before
anybody shows up.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.351
I'm gonna take off now guys.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.436
What? You're not coming with us.

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.021
It's a complicated situation.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.399
I have a white arrow, which
is a little bit scary.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.276
Not everybody trusts
me like Red does.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.531
[air whooshing]

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.034
Prime Minister
Suzuki has requested

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.911
a series of summits
next week with China,

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.122
Russia and The United States.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.123
Red for God!

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.125
Susumu's our savior.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.418
How are they our saviors?

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.087
Now's the time to entrust
our futures to them.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.172
People die every time a
God candidate shows up.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.884
My family was at the
Grand Tower explosion.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.218
Ugh, this is so plain.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.095
Don't you have any
nicer outfits than this?

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.014
Huh?

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.640
[Temari] Oh, hello everybody.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.269
[Temari sighs]

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.937
Including Susumu Yuito,

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.065
we've now identified five
of the six God candidates.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.526
The chaos out there
is getting worse.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:42.861
We have to hurry.

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.738
[Hoshi] Under the
circumstances before

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.489
contacting the final candidate.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.117
We should choose who
want to become God.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.452
Susumu made it clear,

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:53.246
he believes the best candidate
for the job would be Red.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.749
Miss Temari, you support
that choice right?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.750
[Temari] I guess so.

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.043
It really does make sense.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.171
with Mirai's philosophy, he's
practically a God already

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.842
[Nakaumi] Practically a God?

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.260
God almighty.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.303
Oh my God.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.512
Good God.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.514
I'm so sick of people carelessly

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.434
throwing the word God
around all the time.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.437
It makes me just want
to disappear already.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.689
You're a God candidate
and an edge Lord.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.899
Second year?

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:22.317
[Nakaumi] First year.

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.778
I have to say, I get
what you mean though.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.696
[Temari] People just
love to use the word God,

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.365
but what is God anyway?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.492
I can't quite pin it down.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.912
[Nakaumi] Ogaro, I'd like
to know more about God.

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.914
I don't see how
we can become God.

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:37.916
If we don't know
anything about him.

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:38.917
I understand.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.126
I'll tell you what I can.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.586
Hold on.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.129
If you say too much here,
you're going to get demoted.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.756
With the five of
them acting together,

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.508
you don't want your
partner to miss the chance

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.968
to get his wings.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.303
[Nakaumi] I don't care
what rank my angel is.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.097
I need a proper explanation.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.556
Oh, very well then.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:57.310
I will answer the question
you are most curious about.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:59.354
[Ogaro] First, God
can make it as though

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:00.772
the selection process
never happened.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:01.940
[all gasp]

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:03.191
[Ogaro] On top of that.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.235
God can let former
God candidates

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.320
keep their wings and
all their arrows.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.738
Are you serious?

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.324
That means I could stay
on easy street forever!

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.575
Another thing,

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.161
God has access to all
the white and red arrows

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:18.540
without any limits
whatsoever about their usage.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.918
Bottom line, control
over people is absolute.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.213
Humanity itself could be ended
if it should come to that.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.215
That is the power of God.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.383
Are you serious?

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.801
End humanity?

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:30.927
No way.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:32.345
What's the matter?

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.180
What did the angel say?

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:37.350
Doesn't matter, none of
it bodes well for humans.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.394
Let's not forget that
humans are creatures

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:41.146
who live in the
shadow of heaven.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.066
What are you guys talking about?

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.028
Hold on, that depends
on your outlook.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:51.573
It's why we need a suitable
human to become the next God.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.659
Someone who can lead humanity
in a positive direction.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.411
Right? That's very important.

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.621
Since God can kill
anyone with a white arrow

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.999
or correct someone's
behavior with a red arrow.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.292
It works like this.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.169
One of the six
remaining God candidates

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.336
becomes the new God.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.380
That being will then
leave the planet

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:10.425
and watch over humanity
from heaven with the angels.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.261
You mean that person's not
allowed to stay on earth?

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.638
What type of existence
will they have?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.059
[Ogaro] They will create
their ideal world from heaven.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.437
And then they will be
worshiped by humans as God.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.024
Forget it.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.026
You can take me out of
the running, my friend.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:29.861
I wanna have fun while
I'm in this world

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.988
and lead a life of luxury.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.865
Even if God can
create a good world.

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.409
What's the point if you
don't get to enjoy it?

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.452
Don't worry, I won't allow you

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.245
to become the new
God, Miss Saki.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:42.248
I can't imagine living
in a world without you.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.666
Wait, is that the only option?

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.169
I don't want you to
go away either, Mirai.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.839
I chose to live for one reason.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.092
To find happiness
here in this world.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.260
Me too.

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:57.639
I'm sure Susumu feels
the same way as well.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.312
Alright then,
shall I become God?

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.321
Shuji?

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:16.282
I'm not exactly
attached to this world

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.159
and you want to
live a happy life

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.912
if you have a choice, isn't
that right, big brother?

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.206
I changed the world
so you'd be able to.

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.292
But we all know that's
never gonna happen.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.129
The other candidates won't
agree to making me God.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.507
I'd be tempted to
create a world where

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.301
those who truly wanna die
would have that option.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.262
I'd want to reach
out and help them.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.721
I'd be fine with that.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.640
They'd need to have
a really good reason

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.684
but I understand how that feels.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.310
Now, promise me
you won't take away

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.938
my red arrow when
you become God, okay?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.314
That's all you care about?

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.526
Well, I don't care about that.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.903
[Mirai] Hold on. We can't
let anyone keep their arrows

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.738
or help people kill themselves.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.574
What and why not?

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.326
Because having wings and
arrows changes the rules.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:03.538
[Temari] Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.957
Listen, when Nasse gave
me my wings and arrows

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.376
that gave me the
hope to keep living.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.086
Once I was given
that opportunity

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.754
I decided to try to be happy.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.756
[Mirai] So as far
as I'm concerned,

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.675
my wings and arrows
are what saved me

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.511
from my previous circumstances.

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.347
Once a new God's in place,
there's no future path for me

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:24.559
unless I can find happiness
without relying on them.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.187
That's easy for you to say
you've already recovered

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.980
and attained some
self confidence.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.231
That's right.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.941
Maybe some of us
still can't live

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.401
without the power of the arrows.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.612
We need them to be happy.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.573
I'm not recovered
or self confident.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.617
Alright, then how about this?

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.369
I'll take them from the ones
who say they don't need them

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.955
and let the ones who still
rely on them keep theirs.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.625
If they use them in
ways I don't approve of,

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:49.959
I'll take them back

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.337
and use a red arrow to
correct their behavior.

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:53.755
And I'll change the world.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:55.590
Going forward,
suicide will become

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.342
something that's acceptable.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:58.760
[Mirai] You don't get it.

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:01.554
Encouraging people to commit
suicide isn't helping them.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.557
People need goals and
also hope for the future.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.851
You help them by providing
those kinds of things.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.647
[sighs]

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:12.398
If you're gonna complain
about everything

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.277
why not just step up
and become God yourself?

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:19.864
[Susumu] Excuse me.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.574
Yes, Susumu?

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:22.867
I've been listening
this whole time

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.828
and it sounds to me like
things aren't going very well.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.039
So why don't we
put it to a vote?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.083
Whoever gets the majority
automatically steps

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:32.335
into the position and
becomes the next God.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.630
If you're good with that, swear
you'll abide by the result.

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.382
Okay, I will.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.424
I swear.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.260
I do, too.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.013
Alright then, I swear.

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:45.765
[Susumu] Very well,
then let's vote.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.434
Those in favor of us five
choosing Nakaumi for God,

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.395
including Nakaumi.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.437
Aye.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.064
I'm changing my pick from Red.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.691
Me too.

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:55.692
And me

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:56.818
Are you sure?

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:58.403
He'll be good for the job.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:01.698
I believe he'll consider the
feelings of vulnerable people.

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.616
I believe we can trust him.

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:05.493
[Susumu] Then it's decided,

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.329
I'm voting with the
majority as well.

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.914
A decision's been reached.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.666
That wasn't so hard, was it?

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.001
Now that that's been decided,

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.295
the five of you are
able to show yourselves.

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:18.256
We just need to get input
from the final candidate.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.466
[Hoshi] That will make
the decision official.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.304
Ogaro, is this
what you expected?

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.139
It won't go that smoothly.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.476
[Ogaro] The remaining
special rank angel, Muni,

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.854
is the angel of destruction.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.564
So disruption is a certainty.

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.734
The angel of destruction?

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.286
Can I tell you, Mr. Yoneda,

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.537
the guest lecture you gave

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.706
at Harvard was something else.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.499
I agree, sir, it
really spoke to me.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.296
He ignored us again.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.672
It's fine. Let's just go.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:07.305
Why doesn't anyone realize
how absurd my lecture was?

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.557
I guess the answer is simple.

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:12.477
They assume it was amazing
and I must be brilliant

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.687
because I'm the youngest
person ever to receive

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.565
the Nobel prize in both
physics and literature.

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.694
[Muni] I can see
that you're scowling.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.738
What is it you're
thinking about?

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.115
The red and white arrows again?

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.327
[Yoneda] No, I'm thinking
about meat or fish.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.995
[Muni] You mean for dinner?

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.330
[Yoneda] It's the only subject

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.123
that has any true value anymore.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:37.543
[Yoneda] My world could
disappear at a moment's notice.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.545
And when the
world's about to end

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:40.880
people find themselves thinking

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.132
about what to have
for their last meal.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:45.718
[water bubbling]

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.345
[fire whooshing]

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.555
Muni, you chose me
because you knew

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.724
I'd expose the angels'
true identities,

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:55.311
as well as how the God selection
process actually works.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.146
If I told people directly,

00:14:57.188 --> 00:15:00.441
I'd be demoted and unable
to fulfill my goal.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.151
But there's no issue
with me responding

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:04.821
to your questions with
yes or no answers.

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:08.157
[Yoneda] My writings highlight
my despair with humanity.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:10.576
And you took advantage
of the suicidal thoughts

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.787
that accompanied
that state of mind.

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.997
I tried to offer you
hope for your life.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.166
[Yoneda] Then you've
misunderstood me.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:18.376
What?

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.711
My despair toward
humanity is also

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.548
paradoxically, my
aspiration for humanity.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:29.762
Regardless, I now find myself
haunted by a malevolent God.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:30.763
[Muni] Angel.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:31.806
Of course.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.933
[Yoneda] Actually,
I shouldn't be using

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:36.227
the words God or angel.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.604
The truth is I'm
still unable to prove

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.773
such entities exist, even now.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.608
[Yoneda] And their existence
would fundamentally

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.445
contradict a good
chunk of my writings.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.612
I only have the right to make

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.782
assumptions based
on our interactions.

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:53.619
[Yoneda] And you appear to
be far smarter than a human.

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.620
Ah.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.789
[Yoneda] But we still
don't know if events

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:57.790
will proceed as you hope.

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:00.460
The odds aren't zero That
the two God candidates

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.004
I have yet to meet will
be greater than myself

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.589
or Kanade Uryu.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.675
Would you have approved
of Kanade becoming God?

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.595
[Yoneda] No.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.638
From a scholar's point
of view, I was interested

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.849
in observing a world gone mad.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.851
Or maybe I was
just curious to see

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.478
something that frightened me.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.147
[ominous music]

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.027
[Yazeli] What you
told us last night,

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.653
is it everything you know?

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:28.821
[Ogaro] Not really.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:29.822
You haven't truly gotten

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.782
to the heart of the
matter, have you?

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.327
If I told you that I would
immediately be stripped

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:36.913
of my rank and would no
longer be an angel involved

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:39.040
in the process of
selecting the new God.

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.334
And as a result of
my recklessness,

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.878
Shuji Nakaumi would
lose his life.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.422
[Mirai] Alright, everyone.
We need to stick to the plan.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:47.423
[Saki] Got it.

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.883
[Mirai] Are you ready, Susumu?

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:49.884
[Susumu] Yeah.

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.302
Man, this really sucks.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.888
I have to go out there
in this frumpy outfit?

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.641
Huh? You're looking pale kid.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.725
Are you okay?

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.101
I'm fine.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.687
Is the thought of becoming
God starting to scare you?

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.855
Course not, why would it?

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.732
I've been given wings
and a red arrow.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.901
I should go along
with you, Miss Saki.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.946
It's better if you focus on
your job as a police officer.

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.489
She's right, Yumiki.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.074
Let these five handle it.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.868
We need to prepare for
the worst case scenario.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.163
We don't wanna repeat of what
happened with the Mukaidos.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.500
You two need to follow Hoshi
and Yumiki's instructions.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.878
We understand, good
luck to all of you.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.880
Mr. Hoshi and Miss Yumiki,

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.715
we wanna thank you
for everything.

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:31.300
I realize.

00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:34.345
If someone finally becomes God,
whether it's Nakaumi or not,

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.680
we'll probably forget all about

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.974
the selection process
and the candidates.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.940
[wings unfurling]

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:48.734
[Mirai] Ready, Saki?

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.947
[sentimental music]

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.828
That's so sweet, are
those two together?

00:17:58.869 --> 00:17:59.954
How should I know?

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.332
Let's go.

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:06.002
[wings flapping]

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:18.723
Look, a God candidate.

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.391
It's Susumu.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.310
How many are up there?

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.311
I count five.

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:24.770
Hey, Red's showing his face.

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:25.771
Why are you here?

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.189
Are you gonna destroy the city?

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.190
Enough already!

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.442
Go away, you pests!

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:31.777
We're not very popular, are we?

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:32.820
They're here.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:39.785
[ominous music]

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:40.870
No questioning.

00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:41.912
That's Muni.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.415
We see you, where's
your partner?

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:53.966
What's up, sir?

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:55.801
You're fidgeting
even more than usual.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:19:00.139
Oh, are you interested in God
candidates as well, professor?

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.265
[Yoneda] Oh, yes.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.395
Five God candidates
have appeared

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:08.439
in Tokyo's Yurakucho district.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.858
Coordinate with the tactical
team and capture them.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.818
Don't let some other
nation get them.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:16.781
Hold on.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.574
If they're in the sky,
they'll be able to escape.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:19.909
They're too fast.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.243
What to do?

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.204
[Officer] Should we attack them?

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:24.830
[General] Attack them?

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.082
What's the matter with you?

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:28.376
Are you trying to
start world war III?

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:30.419
[Officer] Pardon me, sir.

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:33.881
I suppose if we do, we might
incur divine punishment.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:34.924
[General] It's not God

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.801
or the President of
the United States

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.886
who makes the world go round.

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:40.262
[Officer] Sir.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.014
[Muni] Before he
reveals himself,

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:44.266
my partner has a request.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.019
He wishes to know what
each of you thinks.

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.938
He says he'll decide to interact

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:51.273
with you depending
on your response.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.526
Where does he come
off making demands?

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.945
What do you mean by
our thinking, exactly?

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:58.322
What you would do
once you become God.

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:01.367
He wants a five minute
overview from each one of you.

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.496
[Mirai] What we do
once we become God?

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:06.872
Sorry about that.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.749
But the five of us
already got together

00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.043
and decided who's
going to become God.

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:14.046
We'd appreciate it if you could
just give us his approval.

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:17.967
[Muni] Oh, how unfortunate,
negotiations have broken down.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.511
At around 10:00 AM this morning

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.847
five God candidates appeared.

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:24.223
They seem to be
discussing something

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.934
but we're unable to listen
in on their conversation.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:30.521
[Muni] Farewell.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.022
Wait a minute.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.984
If the five of us lay out
what we do once we became God

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:37.278
then your partner would
talk to us, right?

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:38.779
[Muni] I didn't say that.

00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:40.698
I said he would listen
to your thinking

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.992
and then determine if
you're worth talking to.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.704
The truth is my partner
is a human being

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.998
who is far superior
to any of you.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:52.668
I think she's yanking
our chain and it's gross.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.336
You're the angel of destruction.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.297
So what is it you're planning?

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:57.882
What is your candidate's goal?

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:01.093
Ah, I see no reason
to do tell you that.

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.970
You can ask my partner about it

00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:05.347
when you meet with him yourself.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:08.225
Hey, why don't we just do it?

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.769
Sharing our thoughts
with each other

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.604
wouldn't be a bad thing.

00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:13.189
And it sounds kind of fun.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.941
It could be just like
a class presentation.

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.028
[helicopters whirring]

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:24.074
[ominous music]

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.997
[gasps]

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.754
30 millimeter cannon
ready. Targets ahead.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.755
Ready.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:38.756
Ready.

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.007
You're kidding, right?

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:41.133
Seriously?

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:42.301
That's the self defense force.

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:43.594
They're armed to the teeth.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:44.595
This can't be good.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.932
[crowd screaming]

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:48.933
What's going on?

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:50.184
I wasn't told about this.

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.186
This makes no sense.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.687
What's the government doing?

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.065
Who are you calling, sir?

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:57.191
The Prime Minister.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.400
The Prime Minister?

00:21:58.442 --> 00:21:59.985
Of course, what am I thinking?

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:01.320
He wouldn't be out of reach

00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:03.239
for a national honor
award recipient like you.

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.199
[Prime Minister] Hello?

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.408
Minister Suzuki.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.452
Please don't do anything
that would injure

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:11.038
the God candidates or
put their lives at risk.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.040
We're attempting
to capture them now

00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.626
in order to protect the
safety of the people.

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:16.961
The helicopters
were not dispatched

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:20.130
to attack them,
only to secure them.

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.757
[Prime Minister] Don't tell
me you believe in all this

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:24.176
God selection
nonsense, professor?

00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:26.053
[Yoneda] What's happening
right now is a bonafide

00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:28.806
God selection process,
Prime Minister.

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:30.558
As opposed to their
previous appearances.

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:32.560
They aren't bothering
to hide their faces.

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:36.021
This time, they don't have any
intention of harming anyone.

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.481
[Prime Minister] You
expect me to believe you

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:39.066
based only on that?

00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:40.693
Set your watch, Prime Minister.

00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:43.237
I'll prove it to
you within 24 hours.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.698
For now attacking those
people is out of the question.

00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:48.117
If anything, you should
really be protecting them.

00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:54.456
[closing theme music]
