00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.052
We have this breaking news,

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:12.179
what's believed to be a
declaration of criminal intent

written by fugitive Girl A has
been released to the public.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.184
The note reads
I killed three people

[Girl] What is this?

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:19.186

couple of years ago,

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:20.229

they be given to humans

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.401
Yes, but only with conditions.

held at local juvenile--

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:31.073
Metropoliman could have
given them to that girl?

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.283
Yeah, but weren't her three
earlier murder victims

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.077
stabbed to death with a knife?

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.037
Hey, if she's gotten
hold of a knife

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.914
she won't need a white arrow.

[birds cawing]

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:50.092
A photo of the girl has
already been uploaded

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.134
to the internet.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:52.386
[Nasse] Wow, look at her.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.679
Cute, don't you think?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.598
Oh yeah, she was an
amateur model apparently.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.226
Everyone was talking her
up until she got arrested.

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:00.894
According to the eyewitnesses,

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.522
the staff showed her
out the front gate.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.649
This one guy says they had
big smiles on their faces

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:07.442
and waved as she left.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.903
As soon as she was out,
she vanished instantly.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.282
Well I guess that confirms it.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:16.451
She's got a red arrow and wings.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.161

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:34.845
Hey, keep it down out here.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:38.640
Mr. Metropoliman,
you came to see me.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:39.641
I'm so happy.

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:40.726
I missed you.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:42.686
Hold on a minute.

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:44.271
Who's this guy, Misurin?

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.773
I don't like most boys
cause they're dirty,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.985
except for my darling
Mr. Poliman, right?

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:51.987
I checked out the tower.

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.697
She was fairly pretty that one.

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:55.532
I told you to pick ugly girls.

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:57.117
Sorry about that.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.328
Did I make a mistake-arin?

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.913
She was on the edge
of acceptability.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.333
[Mr. Metropoliman] This
one's pretty borderline too.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.043
Really?

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.299
Nevermind, just do what
I tell you from now on.

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:13.717
Yes, Sir!

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.095
And just like that he's gone.

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:21.558
Now then where were we?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.102

a little naughtier?

[opening theme music]

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.795
All right, let's review
everything we know so far.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.423
Metropoliman currently
has three sets of wings

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.383
and three arrows he picked
up from the candidates

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.177
he's been able to
eliminate to date.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.097
He's also found out that
it's possible to share wings

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.434
and arrows with humans
who aren't God candidates.

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:30.645
However, he can't just hand
them over unconditionally.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.315
To give them to someone,
the God candidate must first

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.650
hit that person
with a red arrow.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.277
Once the tools have been shared,

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.863
the human can use the wings
and arrows as they please,

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.948
until the initial
red arrow's effects

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.992
wear off after 33 days.

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:47.454
Which means for now Girl A can--

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:49.873
It means until those
33 days are up,

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:52.876
she can use those tools to
commit unlimited murders.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.004
I can't believe this.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.466
How could he share wings and
an arrow with a known murderer?

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:01.176
The guy's lost his mind.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.263
The only thing he's focused on

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.724
is making sure that
he becomes God.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.935
He's clearly using
Girl A as nothing more

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.311
than some kind of allure

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.314
so he can kill anyone
who tries to stop her.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.733
What are we supposed to do now?

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.236
Do we just let her run amuck?

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.907
By asking that, what
you're really asking is

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.743
whether we want to take
Metropoliman's bait or not.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.245
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.997
It would be dangerous.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.333
What do you think
we should do here?

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:36.711
My advice to you is to
kill Girl A and fast.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:41.299
She's a murderer with a fondness
for middle-school girls,

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.301
who has wings and a red arrow.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.387
Once she makes them
fall in love with her,

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.763
killing them becomes easy.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.099
For all we know she's
doing that right now.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.351
Just thinking about it
makes me want to stop her.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.562
Especially after we
watched Metropoliman murder

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.439
that young girl at the stadium.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.816
We know the setup.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.735
We focus our efforts on Girl
A and while we're distracted,

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.738
he sneaks in and removes
us one at a time.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.740
But we turn the tables.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.410
We shoot him with a white
arrow and kill him instead.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.161
That's our best option.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.247
[Mirai gasping]

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.582
I'd have to shoot him.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.001
I'm the only one who
has a white arrow.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.211
Look, if we kill
Metropoliman, Girl A

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.130
goes back to being normal.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:21.590
She won't be a threat.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.342
Metropoliman is the
root of all of this.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.553
He can't be allowed to live.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:29.139
I'm determined to see him
bite the dust before I do.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.141
Don't you think
I'm right, Mirai?

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.184
Don't you want to wipe him out?

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:38.064
I don't really want
to kill anyone.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.069
Why use a white arrow?

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:46.448
Maybe we could stop the
guy with a red arrow.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.866
You're not entirely wrong,

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.827
but let's assume for a moment
that you do shoot Metropoliman

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.870
with a red arrow.

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.580
It might not work.

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:56.416
If someone else ended up
shooting you with a red arrow,

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:57.876
the tables would turn instantly.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:01.630
Metropoliman has two more
sets of wings and arrows.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.549
He might've shared them with
someone else besides Girl A.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.968
Someone who could sneak
up and attack you.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.471
I believe if the
opportunity presents itself,

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:10.805
we should take him out.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.976
I understand what
you're saying, really,

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.478
but I still have doubts.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.606
I don't know if any of that

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:21.524
makes it all right
to kill someone.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.694
It's either us or him.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.905
Can't you just think
of it as self-defense?

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.366
I'd rather be deceived
than deceive someone.

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:34.329
I'd rather be bullied than
be the one to bully someone.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.124
I'd rather be killed
than kill someone.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.795
You see, that is
what I believed.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:44.089
Even on the day I
tried to kill myself,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.426
I felt that no matter what
happened, I shouldn't hate.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.096
What, hey, are you serious?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.432
That kind of attitude may work
as the teachings of a Saint,

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.519
but even grade school kids
would call that foolish.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.895
I understand.

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:02.357
It isn't the time to be
saying something like that.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.692
However--

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.069
However, in the end, that's
what's good about you.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.570
That's what I believe anyway.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.280
All right, look at it this way.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.659
Suppose you, no, suppose
Saki here is the one

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:16.663
who's in Metropoliman's line
of fire at the present moment.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:18.164
You're able to sneak up on him,

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.291
so you're in position
to shoot him first

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.878
without him noticing you,
but you only have one shot.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.132
Do you choose the red
arrow or the white arrow?

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.258
Wait a minute.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.552
The red arrow or
the white arrow?

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.895
What's the most effective
way to stop him?

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.148
Red, wait, no.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.109
If he's already been shot
with a red arrow by an ally,

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.111
mine won't be able
to pierce his armor.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.988
Saki and I will both be killed.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.949
Then, white, use it.

and we'll talk some more.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:39.996
Meanwhile, keep your guard up.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.956
If he's trying to lure
out God candidates,

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.458
he'll send a clear signal.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.585
Okay, we won't do
anything reckless.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.631
Mirai, about that hypothetical.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.174
In a situation like that,

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:54.677
if someone's about to be killed,
you can use your red arrow.

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.014
Metropoliman's something
of a control freak.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.809
I'm sure he wouldn't even
allow an ally to shoot him.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.727
Mr. Mukaido.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:03.770
I'm sorry.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.065
Believe me, in
spite of everything,

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.317
I want you to live
as long as possible.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:15.740
Geez kid, you're
gonna make me cry.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.243
Later.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.961
[Kanade] Why are the
police so incompetent?

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.796
And you were considerate enough

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:32.215
to anonymously
report the murder.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.801
You even told them where to go.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.803
I need them to find
the body promptly

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.513
and make a huge fuss over it.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:43.476
Is this really going
to lure anyone out?

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:44.853
Probably.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.688
I'm sure there are one or
two soft-hearted idiots

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.439
among the God candidates.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.317
It's fine if nobody
actually shows.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.236
Reducing the number of
ugly girls out there,

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:55.572
makes Minamikawa's
wish come true.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:57.657
No way.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.325
It's a coincidence.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.035
[TV Presenter] Yesterday,
the ministry of health,

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.037
labor, and welfare
released data estimates

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.289
from last year's national--

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.041
Daddy's got lots of
medicines to take.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.209
Here's some water.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.795
Oh thanks very much, Nanaka.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:12.046
[TV Presenter] Making it
the fewest number of births--

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:15.633
Nanato, you've been
going out a lot lately.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.010
How are you feeling?

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:19.012
Pretty good actually.

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:21.639
[TV Presenter] Last year with
Okinawa coming in on top,

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.683
while [indistinct]
languishes at the bottom.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.310
Here.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.811
We have breaking news.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.146
We're getting more information

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.773
on the middle-school
serial killer, Girl A,

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.151
who escaped juvenile
custody yesterday.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.778
Late last night, the body of
missing high school student

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.282
Hikari Yaishi was discovered
on top of the Grand Tower.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.576
According to a statement
by authorities--

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:44.704
He left the body in quite
a hard to reach place,

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:47.749
or perhaps he wasn't the one
who did the actual killing.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.877
If not, then he's telling
us Girl A has wings.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.879
The police believe the
incidents are connected.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.340
According to one of her
friends, Miss Yaishi

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.425
was in Shibuya
yesterday at 1:00 PM,

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.718
but where she went after that--

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.554
A middle school girl
hanging out in Shibuya.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.265
Hold on.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.100
[dramatic music]

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.019
Those involved in
the investigation

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.062
say that a sharp blade

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:10.730
--was used to--
--Could it be?

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:11.731
No way.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.107
[TV Presenter] Carotid
artery and wrist.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.318
Her carotid artery
and both wrists?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.196
The same kind of wounds as
Girl A's previous victims.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.573
[knocking]

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:21.908
Mr. Mukaido's here.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.410
Knocking six times, how stupid.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:26.412
Just because his
name has six in it.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.750
This is my angel, Baret

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.336
A pleasure to meet you all.

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:35.296
My name's Nasse.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.714
Nice to meet you too.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.758
And I'm Revel, welcome Baret.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.510
[Mirai] What's with the bags?

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:41.761
Oh, these?

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.931
Before I came over I
borrowed all kinds of stuff

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.808
from the Self-Defense Forces.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.102
What?

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:51.020
Hey, they might not hold
a candle to white arrows,

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.231
but at least we
could put up a fight.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.817
The new God will be chosen
using wings and arrows,

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:58.361
so I have a feeling this
is against the rules.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.571
The rules don't say there's
anything to prevent someone

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.449
from using human creations
to keep God candidates

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.243
from becoming God.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:06.536
Is that true?

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.788
No wonder they call you the
angel of knowledge Baret.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.957
I had no idea.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:11.958
I'm glad to hear that.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.584
Then you two should take this.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.169
I couldn't.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.755
Come on, is this
some kind of joke?

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:18.756
Does it look like a joke?

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.425
I'm dead serious.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.387
Yeah, I get it, but
that's not what I meant.

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:25.805
Step back for a minute.

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:29.434
I'm asking if it's right to
turn children into murderers.

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.480
We don't always get
to choose our fates.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:37.191
Listen, it doesn't matter
who kills Metropoliman

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.401
or how they do it.

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.028
When everything comes
to light in the end,

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.612
they'll be considered a hero.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:45.116
Just so we're straight, I'm
not saying I want to be a hero.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.871
I don't want to be a father
who surrenders without a fight

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:53.082
and in the process ends up
sacrificing his children.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.251
I was called on to
be a God candidate.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.836
All right then, so be it.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.212
I'll bear that obligation.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.219
We can't just stand
around here talking.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.888
If we don't act immediately,

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:08.598
she's going to claim
her next victim.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.641
Okay, but where
do we find Girl A?

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.227
I think I may have an idea.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.188
There's a set of rules
that seem to govern

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.731
how she commits her crimes.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.443
[Misurin breathing heavily]

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.862
[eerie music]

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.451
This is so incredible.

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:29.994
I'm gonna orgasm.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.499
Okay, time to go
pluck the next fruit.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.876
[eerie music]

00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:40.421
I need to change clothes.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.507
Mistake-arin.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.892
Well have any God
candidates shown up?

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:53.935
'Fraid not.

00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:57.563
In that case, we'll
just have to set off

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:58.815
some bigger fireworks.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:04.695
Here's a clue.

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.906
The three victims Girl
A killed two years ago

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:08.699
were wearing sailor uniforms.

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:11.160
They went missing in
Shibuya, Harajuku,

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.995
and then Shibuya again.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:15.706
The girl they found butchered
at the Grand Tower yesterday

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:16.999
was wearing one as well.

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.876
She disappeared in Shibuya.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.212
That means Girl A's
next destination

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.797
is gonna be Harajuku.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:25.133
[TV dinging]

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.968
[Nasse] Hey, they've
got an update.

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:28.302
[TV Presenter] This just in,

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.346
following yesterday's
discovery of Hikari Yaishi,

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.765
a social media posts
says yet another body

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:33.933
--has now been found
--[Mr. Mukaido] What the hell?

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.268
[TV Presenter] On top
of the Grand Tower.

[Misurin yawning]

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.025
I'm so sleepy.

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.695
I think she posted that photo

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.572
and she's still up
there at the tower.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:50.825
People on social media
say she's flying around.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:51.909
[Woman] Look at that.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.077

hanging in the air.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:09.093
I must've tripped out.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.556
Sorry about that. Mr. Poliman.

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:15.141
Damn it!

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.727
I figured we could search for
Girl A in Shibuya or Harajuku

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:19.103
and stop her that way.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:22.648
But it turns out she was at
the Grand Tower all this time.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.150
This isn't a battle of wits.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.652
He's making it
perfectly obvious.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.863
Anyone who's not a cop
at that crime scene

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.615
has to be a God candidate.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:31.991
[kids gasping]

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.159
I see.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.828
At the stadium, we could
blend in with the crowd

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.873
and remain anonymous, but
there's nowhere to hide here.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.584
We'd have to fight openly
on top of the tower.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.045
[dramatic music]

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.796
All right, here we go.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.400
Misurin,

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.073
rolling thunder?

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.200
[Man grunting]

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:17.078
Okay everybody, take the
corpse down with you,

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.081
and make sure that nobody
else comes up here.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:22.124
[Everyone] Understood.

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.044
This is ridiculous.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.673
I may love you forever
Misurin, but the fact is

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.258
you're a murderer.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.009
This is truly amazing.

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:35.096
I can't believe how hard gramps
is fighting the red arrow.

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:36.806
He'd risk his life for his job.

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:38.015
That's funny.

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:41.269
Mr. Poliman, everyone's
left the area.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.229
[Kanade] Time to
do what I told you.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.272
Okay.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.107
Let's do this Mirai.

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:48.901
Metropoliman's intent
is pretty obvious.

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:51.279
He's luring God candidates
to the top of the tower,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.698
so he can shoot them
with white arrows.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.284
But that also affords
us an opportunity.

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.911
Once we're there we'll
shoot him with a red arrow.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.664
The first thing I'll do when
I get there is engage Girl A

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.249
and act as a decoy.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:06.043
When Metropoliman shows up
and is focused on killing me,

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:07.086
you shoot him.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:10.923
I'd do it myself, but I
can't shoot any arrows.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.258
What, why not?

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.176
He's already reached
his quota for now.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:16.178
He used up his 14 red arrows

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.098
while he was looking for God
candidates at the stadium.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.725
Oh, that's right

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:23.144
What do you say, will
you come along with me?

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.104
Yes.

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.314
Good.

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.149
You could use your white arrow,

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:32.903
but a red arrow will do.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.697
That right, Baret?

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:35.740
Yes.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.326
When a God candidate
shoots someone

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.910
and gives them a red arrow,

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.746
the God candidate
can then command them

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:42.997
to shoot him or her.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.457
However, if they
issue this order,

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:46.500
it has the effect of
nullifying the arrow

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.544
initially fired by
the God candidate.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.547
So only the arrow shot
second remains in effect.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.925
This causes them to
reverse their positions.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.135
Really?

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.513
I seriously doubt Metropoliman
would take that risk.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:02.767
He probably hasn't been
shot with a red arrow.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.354
We'll face them head on.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.605
Change into that.

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.231
It's for you, Mirai.

00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:12.193
This one was borrowed from
the Self-Defense Forces.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.992
Mr. Mukaido, that
looks really heavy.

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:21.619
Are you going to be all right?

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.163
Yeah, it's a little rough
with my illness and all,

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.499
but the weight won't
affect how fast I can fly.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.001
If you're strong enough
to wear it, it'll be fine.

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:31.504
However, you can
only carry one human.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.381
Yours looks good, perfect fit.

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:36.342
I based it on a protective
suit worn for motor sports

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:38.177
that my company developed.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.596
It's made of a new material
that combines leather

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:41.931
and aramid fibers.

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.308
It's light, friction
resistant, impact resistant,

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.935
and even stab proof.

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:48.771
And with the dust
repelling mask and hood on,

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.398
you can conceal your face.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:53.234
It was never commercialized
because it was too expensive.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:56.362
Who knew it'd come in handy
for something like this?

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.030
You're looking like a superhero.

00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.031
Huh?

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:00.074
What?

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:05.413
Nasse and Baret, come with us.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.832
Revel and Saki, you
hold down the fort.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.583
There's no way you'll
be attacked here.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.210
Call us if anything happens.

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:12.211
Got it.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.422
If we were gonna be
fighting in a crowd,

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.757
I had planned on
asking you to shoot me

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.008
with a red arrow first,

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.635
so they couldn't
shoot and control me.

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:21.762
I have a wife and
children to consider.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:24.181
I intended to get
you to do it, Mirai,

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.558
instead of asking Saki,

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:29.270
but I wouldn't be able to
act counter to your ideals.

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.313
And I'd lose the
ability to kill.

00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:35.234
Excuse me, what does that mean?

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.319
Hypothetically, if Metropoliman

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:41.240
doesn't make an appearance,
I'm gonna kill Girl A.

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:44.702
She has wings and can't
be shot with a red arrow.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.037
That makes her a monster
who can't be controlled.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:50.082
If she escapes, another
innocent girl will be killed.

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:51.625
That's not gonna happen.

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.878
She's the one who should
be getting stabbed.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:57.882
That's as close as we're
gonna get to justice, right?

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.259
But our main target
is Metropoliman.

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:02.636
I want to finish him off
while I'm still alive.

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:05.347
[somber music]

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.439
Saki.

[somber music]

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:33.918
If Metropoliman doesn't show up,

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.837
Mr. Mukaido will kill Girl A.

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:39.673
But it's wrong to kill people.

00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:43.761
Please, be there Metropoliman.

00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:54.563
[Mr. Mukaido] Hey, what
are you doing over there?

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.943
[dramatic music]

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:01.320
About time.

00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:03.489
I'm doing some online shopping.

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.449
I was looking for
cute hair ribbons.

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.326
[Mr. Mukaido] That's
not what I meant.

00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:09.203
I'm asking you why you're here.

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:11.580
I'm waiting for Mr. Poliman.

00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:12.706
He's coming here?

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:15.376
[dramatic music]

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:21.340
Hey, why are you
standing so far away?

00:22:21.382 --> 00:22:23.551
Come closer, I won't bite.

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:26.470
I'm actually itching
to do something crazy.

00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:27.763
--Wanna see?
--Where is he?

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:29.515
Where is he coming from?

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.892
Mr. Poliman told me if
anyone with wings shows up

00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:33.477
I have to stay with them.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.604
So I really don't have a choice.

00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:37.940
[dramatic music]

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:40.234
