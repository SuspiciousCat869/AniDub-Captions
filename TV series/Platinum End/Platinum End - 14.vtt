WEBVTT

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.344
[Mirai] If you're saying
you'll fight fairly,

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:11.637
I'm pleased to hear it.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.930
[Kanade] In that
case, let's hurry up

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.014
and settle this quickly.

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:15.974
Go on and shoot me.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.434
I'm sure you're trying
to come up with a way

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:19.561
to win without using your Wings.

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:21.396
But you can't, can you?

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.024
[Mirai] Actually, I'm
not thinking about that.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.026
What I am thinking is,

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:29.947
am I fighting the real
Metropoliman or someone else?

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:33.659
--What?
--[tense music]

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.789
[Mukaido] Red! I'm 99%
sure that's Metropoliman!

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.040
[Mirai] I know you are.

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:42.000
But that's not 100%, is it?

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.045
And if it's not 100%,
we might have a problem.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.803
[Susumu humming]

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:54.429
[Kanade] What's he doing?

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.975
Is he stalling for time? No.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.019
He presents he's
not sure of himself,

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.896
but he's always actually...

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.737
[Mukaido] If you're
worried about who he is,

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:13.282
you can just remove his
mask after you've shot him.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.867
You've already seen his face.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.536
[Mirai] Yes, I know that, but...

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:22.874
[Kanade] [sighs] You really
are a stupid pain in the ass.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.419
If that's what this is
all about, I'll show you.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:30.674
[Mukaido and Nasse gasp]

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.929
--[Mirai gasps]
--[foreboding music]

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.015
[Mirai] He actually
removed his mask.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.018
I can't believe he's
being so open and fair.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.352
Satisfied now?

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:45.897
[Mirai] Yes.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.691
You're definitely
the same Metropoliman

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.484
I fought at the tower.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.112
Thanks. It's all
clear to me now.

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:03.749
[opening theme music]

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.003
--Did you see his face?
--No, this camera angle sucks.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.339
[Spectator] So we don't get
to know Metropoliman's identity?

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.383
[Spectator] Man,
what a boring video.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.138
No. We have to watch.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.557
This will determine
who becomes God.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.434
This sacred battle
will ultimately decide

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:49.813
who will end up being the
redeemer who saves this planet!

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:51.022
Go for it, God!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.065
You can do it!

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.442
And remember, when
you're choosing

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:54.860
people to go to Heaven,
please choose me!

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.695
--Crazy alert.
--He's nuts.

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:57.738
[Hoshi] Well?

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.115
His face was obscured.

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:01.658
We couldn't identify him.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.036
And someone's blocking us from
determining their location.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.329
[Hoshi] Hmm.

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.459
[Susumi] Hmm. I wonder who's
gonna win this standoff.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.043
I'm kinda pulling
for the red guy.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.504
Up to this point, he's
been pretty interesting.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.383
--Here we go.
--"Here we go"?

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.010
What the hell are
you, a character

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.846
in a superhero
show or something?

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:24.473
[Mirai] I'm fighting fairly.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.017
If I said "here we go"
then moved in closer

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:30.228
and fired my Arrow, that
would be an unfair move.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.105
But if I walk up and
stab you with that Arrow

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:35.942
instead of firing it,
that's not unfair at all.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.944
[energizing music begins]

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.488
[Kanade] What's he doing now?

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.080
[energizing music intensifies]

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.874
He's charging from this close?

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.834
--Mirai!
--Stupid move, pal!

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.294
You're just easier to kill!

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.135
[Mirai] That's what you think!

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.473
[Mirai shouting]

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.608
[Mirai gasps]

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.361
--[both gasp]
--It's not piercing him.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.781
--How can that be?
--Unbelievable!

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.117
[energizing music continues]

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.118
[Mirai] Of course.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.162
He's already been
pierced by a Red Arrow!

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:37.295
--[energy crackling]
--[Mirai straining]

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.548
[Mukaido] Metropoliman's
next White Arrow

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.133
is being blocked
by Mirai's Red one.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.343
[Mirai] He didn't retreat

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.303
when he lost his
numerical advantage,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.181
and he didn't back out of our
one-on-one face-off, either.

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.100
He only joined this
so-called "fair fight"

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.144
because he knew he couldn't
be pierced by my Red Arrow.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.187
He couldn't lose the battle

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.398
as long as I refused
to use my White.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.359
So who did he order to
shoot him with the Red?

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.194
That leaves me with
just one option!

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.031
[energizing music continues]

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.742
[metal clanging]

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.202
[Kanade] What's he doing?

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:16.501
--[air whooshing]
--[energy crackling]

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.961
He's blocking his view.

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:20.922
[Kanade] [panting] I can't see!

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:24.217
[Revel] He can't fire his Arrow
if he can't see his target.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.510
[Kanade] Damn it! [panting]

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.971
Wings are visible
to God candidates.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.931
However, since
they can't interact

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.349
with objects from
the human world,

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.184
he is unable to grab them.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.229
Only the owner of the Wings
can manipulate them freely.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.316
Ah. What a smart idea.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.985
--Damn it!
--[energizing music continues]

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:43.236
This isn't good.

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.988
Red's been shot by Mukaido,

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.574
so even if he has no intention
of killing me himself,

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.410
there's a good chance he won't
stop Mukaido from doing it!

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.374
[Mirai grunting]

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.500

Meyza! Transfer my White
Arrow to my left hand.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.396
I can't see him, but
I can still stab him.

[Mukaido] Red,
Yellow, thank you.

me you were fighting an evil

that could destroy the world.

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:08.506
[Mukaido] The truth is, I've
become a hero chosen by God.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.343
Don't worry. I promise you
and Nanaka will be safe.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.348
And I swear I'll join you
both when this is over.

to block his Arrow

by charging in with
one in his hand.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.410
It worked because he
was already up close.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.040
You two, keep a
firm grip on him.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:46.753
I'll be over there in
just a minute to kill him.

don't wanna do this.

[Mukaido grunting]

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:57.722
You'll be a murderer.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.265
Have you thought about that?

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.561
Red, stop him!

you said life was sacred?

That it was wrong
to kill people?

Green his desire, then I...

thing is to make sure

a monster like Metropoliman
never becomes God.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.645
[Spectator] No way he's
really gonna shoot that guy.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.397
This is staged, right?

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.566
[Susumu] Is it finally over?

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.653
We've got their location.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.323
All right, let's get over there.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.366
Kanade.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.662
[Kanade] Listen to me!

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.873
I'm doing this for
my family, too!

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.750
I had a sister I
accidentally killed,

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.044
and I just wanted
to see her again.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.503
That angel tempted me.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.340
She promised me I'd get to
see her if I became God.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.508
That's the reason I've
been doing all this.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.345
[Mukaido panting]

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.557
For, for my sister.

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.478
[Mirai] Listen, can't we
just keep him blindfolded

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.938
and stick him in prison?

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.606
[Kanade] Yes, yes, do that!

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.900
You don't have to do anything
stupid like committing murder.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.360
Can you hear me, Mukaido?

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.696
Come on, we can work this out.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.573
Right, Mukaido? Mukaido!

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:23.993
[Mirai] Mr. Mukaido.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.956
This is goodbye, isn't it?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.296
--[Mukaido straining]
--[somber music]

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.548
[Mukaido]
Before I go, just grant me

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.717
the strength to
pull this trigger.

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:46.140
That's all I ask.
[breathing shakily]

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:51.187
This act will serve as
proof that I was alive.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:54.065
This is my justice.

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:59.570
Mirai, I know you will say
this was selfish on my part,

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:03.241
but someday, I trust you and
my family will understand

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.617
why it had to be done:

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:09.080
to protect my beloved
wife and children.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.334
It's starting to
get so dark. Yes.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.004
I wish I had more
time with my family,

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.798
to be able to watch
my children grow up.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.552
I never thought killing
someone would make me happy.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.804
[pensive music]

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:30.184
Life takes some
surprising turns.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.399
[Nanaka] Daddy's going
to be okay, right?

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:39.235
[Aya] Nanaka, don't touch those!

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.989
[Nanaka] What, Mommy?

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.699
Just remember this.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.329
Your daddy is a hero.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.216
[Mukaido] Aya.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.261
[gunshots rattling]

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.599
[dramatic music begins]

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.683
I gotta move!

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.816
Damn it! Let go!

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:22.070
Judging by the sound, he's
firing from pretty close range.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.822
Red, let's make a deal!

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.449
I don't need to become God.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.117
You can be Him!

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:29.118
You know what?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.495
I'll, I'll give you money.

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.746
As much as you want.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.247
What do you say, one billion?

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.875
10 billion? You name
it, I'll get it for you!

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:39.420
She-cat, I'll make you my wife!

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:40.630
You'll never want for anything!

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.256
I'll give you whatever you want.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.842
I promise I'll make
your life happy.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:48.805
--What do you say?
--[dramatic music continues]

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:51.557
I have everything you
could want. Everything.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.979
[flesh squelching]

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:03.111
[Kanade screaming]

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.535
Where's my angel?

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:25.883
Rea. [coughs]

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.389
Rea.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.812
[dramatic music continues]

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:45.403
--[gunshots rattling]
--[spectators gasp]

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.405
All right!

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.240
Poliman lost! He lost!

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:56.622
Sorry about that, Kanade Uryu.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.417
Guess you overreached.
[blows raspberry]

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.006
[silence]

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.349
[Saki] This, this was...

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:26.360
As horrible as it was,
if we hadn't done this,

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:29.864
even more lives would have
been lost, right? [sobs]

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:38.623
[Mirai] Yeah.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:45.838
But still,

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:49.175
it was a life.

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:52.845
[Nasse] This is great.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.806
I can see that Mirai's taken
another step towards happiness.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:03.856
[Mirai] The rings!

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.487
I have to assume they're
going to the God candidate

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.739
who shot Metropoliman
with a Red Arrow.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:14.867
[Saki] Mr. Mukaido!

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:20.957
[Nasse] Aw. Look, they're gone.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.006
[Mirai] We need to
get him to a hospital.

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.803
[mournful music begins]

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.892
How could someone
like this fail?

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:42.895
He was a wealthy member of
the upper echelons of society.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:47.066
Money only has an effect
on human conflicts.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.860
It's useless against
Wings and Arrows.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.321
Even someone like
Hajime, who had no money,

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:53.864
had powers as a God candidate.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.119
Why did you obstruct my plans?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.288
That wasn't my intention.

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.915
I was following a simple hunch

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:05.126
that Hajime's involvement
could be interesting.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.837
Well, I'll see you later.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:10.548
I have to admit, in the end,
it was truly interesting.

and in spite of that, I'm left
ferrying a dead human again.

His cardiopulmonary functions

are fading fast.

There's nothing more
we can do for him.

His breathing will gradually
get slower and slower.

It's amazing he stayed
alive this long.

[poignant music softens]

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:04.054
Nanato Mukaido, you
had given up on life

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.307
and found yourself meekly
awaiting your death.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.227
But then you surprised me.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:13.314
The fact is, many humans had
acquired Wings and Arrows

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:17.735
before you, but for someone to
sacrifice so much of himself

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:21.155
for his family and to die
satisfied with his own life,

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:27.077
I know of no other human
who has achieved that.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.331
It's thanks to you two.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.669
Take this Arrow and these Wings.

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.214
Please keep Mukaido's
hopes and dreams

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:39.757
alive within your heart.

[poignant music continues]

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.060
[Saki] This means
goodbye to you as well.

It's all right.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.105
You still have Revel,

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.399
who is an even greater
Angel of Knowledge than me.

00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:06.408
Come. Let us go, Nanato Mukaido.

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:15.084

[Mukaido] Don't worry.

I promise you and
Nanaka will be safe,

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:27.721

both when this is over.
