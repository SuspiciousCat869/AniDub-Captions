1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,963
WHY...
WHY DO YOU...

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,175
WHY DO YOU...
LOOK JUST LIKE ME?

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,970
IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THE
EXACT SAME DNA.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,807
BASE SEQUENCE PATTERN...
0988 TYPE.

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,060
THAT MEANS...
YOU ARE...

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,937
AN INNOVATOR.

7
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,439
REGENE REGETTA.

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,815
YOU'RE AN INNOVATOR!

9
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,776
THAT'S RIGHT.

10
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,153
HIS VOICE IS IN MY HEAD!

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,948
(Telepathically)
THIS IS A TELEPATHIC ABILITY
USING QUANTUM BRAINWAVES,

12
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,492
CATALYZED BY GN PARTICLES.

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,495
WE USE THEM TO PROVIDE US
WITH A DIRECT LINK TO VEDA.

14
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,039
AND THANKS TO GENETIC
MANIPULATION AND NANOMACHINES,

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,791
WE DO NOT AGE.

16
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,086
BEINGS LIKE US ARE ESSENTIAL
TO AEOLIA SCHENBERG'S PLAN.

17
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,922
(Sighs)

18
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,632
DON'T TELL ME...

19
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,385
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WERE
OTHERS LIKE YOU?

20
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,886
(Angry breath)

21
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,639
(Chuckling) BECAUSE
YOU'RE A GUNDAM MEISTER,

22
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,641
IT SEEMS VEDA
MUST HAVE PLACED

23
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,102
RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT YOU
WERE ALLOWED TO ACCESS.

24
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,230
THAT CAN'T BE...

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,233
IN THAT CASE,
LET ME ENLIGHTEN YOU...

26
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,027
STAGE ONE OF THE PLAN WAS
TO HAVE CELESTIAL BEING

27
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,862
USE ARMED INTERVENTIONS
TO TRIGGER

28
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,865
A UNIFICATION OF THE WORLD.

29
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,659
STAGE TWO
IS TO USE THE A‐LAWS

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,079
TO UNITE THE WILL OF
ALL MANKIND.

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,374
AND STAGE THREE IS TO PUSH
HUMANITY INTO OUTER SPACE

32
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,085
AND PREPARE THEM FOR THE
DIALOGUES THAT ARE TO COME.

33
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:34,594
THAT IS AEOLIA'S PLAN
IN ITS ENTIRETY.

34
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,516
YES. WE WHO ARE ADAPTED
TO THE ENVIRONMENT OF SPACE...

35
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,061
ARE TO GUIDE HUMANITY UP AND
ONWARD TO AN ALL‐NEW FRONTIER.

36
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,229
(Gasping)

37
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:51,153
HONESTLY.
THAT WAS UNNECESSARY.

38
00:01:51,153 --> 00:02:01,204

39
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:21,224

Ian:
DAMN THAT ALLELUJAH...

44
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,544
DAMAGING HIS MACHINE RIGHT
AFTER SETSUNA WRECKED HIS...

45
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,587
AND WHAT'S THIS I HEAR
ABOUT HIM BRINGING

46
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,340
A GIRLFRIEND BACK WITH HIM?
I MEAN, REALLY.

47
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,510
A GIRLFRIEND...

48
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,846
FEELING LONELY, SAJI?
FEELING LONELY, SAJI?

49
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,431
HMM?

50
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,850
I GUESS SO.
A LITTLE BIT.

51
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,399
Lasse:
THAT GIRL, MARIE. SHE'S FROM THE
SUPERHUMAN INSTITUTE, RIGHT?

52
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,110
DO YOU THINK IT'S SAFE LETTING
HER ON BOARD THE SHIP?

53
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,320
WELL, WE RAN A PRETTY
THOROUGH CHECK ON HER.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,031
BESIDES...
I THINK ALLELUJAH NEEDS HER.

55
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,408
WHY'S THAT?

56
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,786
Sumeragi:
HE NEEDS A REASON TO FIGHT.

57
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,497
QUICK QUESTION
FOR YOU GUYS:

58
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,332
ARE YOU TWO
LOVERS OR WHAT?

59
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,418
(Both gasping)

60
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,045
(Screaming)
MY FEMALE INTUITION
GOT IT RIGHT!

61
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,967
(Sighing)
SO KLAUS AND THE OTHERS
MANAGED TO GET AWAY SAFELY.

62
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,720
AND YET...

63
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,809
"FEDERATION TO LEAD
MIDDLE EAST RENEWAL PLAN.

64

AZADISTAN DISSOLVED."

65
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,355
MARINA ISMAIL...

66
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,651
Leanne:
PRINCESS MARINA...

67
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,528
HMM?
WELL, HELLO THERE...

68
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,780
TRY TO CHEER UP.

69
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,532
I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU THIS.

70
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,243
(Sighing)

71
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,913
THANK YOU,
LITTLE ONE...

72
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,997
THANK YOU.

73
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,341
REGENE REGETTA...

74
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,804
Regene:
IN ORDER TO GUIDE
HUMANITY TO A NEW STAGE...

75
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,349
A GREAT WAVE IS
NECESSARY.

76
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,642
(Gasps)

77
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,394
INDEED... A WAVE
CALLED REFORMATION.

78
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,812
(Sighing)

79
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,856
SO YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD JUST
LET THE A‐LAWS CONTINUE

80
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,816
THEIR DETESTABLE CONDUCT?

81
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,528
BUT REFORM
IS NEVER PAINLESS.

82
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,364
DO YOU THINK WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
DOING IS HARMLESS?

83
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,323
(Sighing)

84
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,412
YOU PEOPLE... HAVE BECOME
OBSTACLES TO AEOLIA'S PLAN.

85
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,414
(Gasping)

86
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,834
ALL OF US WERE CREATED FOR THE
SAKE OF THE PLAN.

87
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,838
THE REASON WHY WE EXIST
IS TO EXECUTE THE PLAN...

88
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:43,635
AND SEE IT THROUGH
TO ITS END.

89
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,011
YOU SHOULD KNOW...

90
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,098
YOU ARE CONTRADICTING THE REASON
FOR YOUR EXISTENCE.

91
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,224
(Stunned gasp)

92
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,726
(Splash)

93
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,857
TIERIA ERDE...

94
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,527
LET US GUIDE HUMANITY,
TOGETHER.

95
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,862
AS INNOVATORS,
HAND IN HAND.

96
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,785
NO NEED TO ANSWER NOW.

97
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,413
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN.

98
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,875
BECAUSE YOU AND I...
ARE ALWAYS CONNECTED.

99
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,382
INNOVATORS...
THEY'RE THE ONES

100
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,343
WHO EXECUTE THE PLAN.
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,

101
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,804
THEN I'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE
THE PATH OF‐‐

102
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,515
Lockon:
DON'T SQUEEZE YOURSELF INTO A
SPECIFIC MOLD LIKE THAT.

103
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,975
(Gasping)

104
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,519
JUST GO OUT THERE AND DO WHAT
YOU BELIEVE IS RIGHT...

105
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,188
AND BE AS GUNG‐HO
AS YOU WANT WHILE DOING IT.

106
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,483
I MEAN AFTER ALL...

107
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,194
OLD MAN AEOLIA ENTRUSTED THE
GUNDAMS TO US RIGHT?

108
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,366
LOCKON...

109
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,872
HUH?

110
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,166
Allelujah:
FELDT...

111
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,710
I HAVEN'T INTRODUCED
YOU TWO YET, HAVE I?

112
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,754
SHE'LL BE LIVING
ON PTOLEMY WITH US. THIS IS‐‐

113
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,547
SOMA PERIES.

114
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,798
HUH?

115
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,800
FOUR YEARS AGO
SHE FOUGHT AGAINST US

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,511
AS A PILOT
FOR THE UN FORCES.

117
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,013
YES, BUT FELDT...

118
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,391
IN THAT LAST BATTLE, WE LOST A
LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE...

119
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,101
LIKE CHRISTINA...

120
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,770
AND LICHTY...

121
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,938
DR. MORENO...

122
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,816
AND THEN...
WE LOST LOCKON, TOO!

123
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,068
I‐I DIDN'T‐‐

124
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,611
NOW HOLD ON
A MINUTE!

125
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,154
FELDT!
MARIE WASN'T‐‐

126
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,115
I KNOW THAT!
I KNOW IT WASN'T HER FAULT!

127
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,285
BUT...I JUST HAD TO SAY
SOMETHING!

128
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,912
FELDT!

129
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,751
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, MARIE.

130
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,753
TO FELDT, ALL THE CREW
OF THIS SHIP

131
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,713
ARE LIKE
CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS...

132
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,049
THIS SHIP IS...
EVERYTHING TO HER.

133
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,724
(Thinking)
LIEUTENANT PERIES
WAS KILLED IN BATTLE.

134
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,851
I KNOW COLONEL SMIRNOV
HIMSELF REPORTED IT BUT‐‐

135
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,895
Louise:
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

136
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,605
I HAVE A REQUEST, COLONEL.

137
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,649
I'D LIKE YOUR
PERMISSION TO BECOME

138
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,192
THE PILOT
OF THIS MACHINE.

139
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,445
A MERE WARRANT OFFICER
WANTS TO PILOT A CUSTOM AHEAD?

140
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,823
I WILL NOT DISAPPOINT
YOU IN BATTLE, MA'AM.

141
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,825
LET ME TAKE REVENGE
FOR THE LIEUTENANT!

142
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,201
DENIED.

143
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,371
I CANNOT APPROVE
YOUR REQUEST.

144
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,415
Rindt:
I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM!

145
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,627
I WILL PERSONALLY RECOMMEND
THAT GENERAL GOODMAN

146
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,045
APPROVES YOUR REQUEST.

147
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,630
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR!

148
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,340
AND PERHAPS
YOU COULD DO ME A FAVOR.

149
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,967
I HAVE A SPECIAL JOB
FOR YOU.

150
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,386
A JOB?

151
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,722
BUT, MAJOR,
THIS IS A...

152
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,100
FEEL FREE TO TAKE LIEUTENANT
SMIRNOV TO ACT AS YOUR ESCORT.

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,477
YOU DO REALIZE WHAT
SENDING OUT TWO PILOTS WILL DO

154
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,937
TO OUR
MOBILE SUIT FORCE?

155
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,606
OH, I'VE ALREADY ARRANGED FOR
SUBSTITUTE PILOTS.

156
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,817
AND THEY'LL BE BRINGING
THE LATEST MODEL,

157
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,277
EVEN MORE ADVANCED
THAN THE AHEAD.

158
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:47,944
WHAT?

159
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,446
OH, YES.

160
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,323
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AMONG THE
REPLACEMENT PERSONNEL

161
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,159
IS A MAN
YOU KNOW QUITE WELL.

162
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,546
WHO WOULD'VE EVER IMAGINED THAT
I'D FIND MYSELF

163
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,173
JOINING THE A‐LAWS?

164
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,385
THAT MUST BE THE NEW MODEL

165
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,554
Patrick:
COLONEL!

166
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,848
HEY, I'VE COME BACK!

167
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,475
OH NO, IT'S HIM!

168
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,645
Spokesperson:
THE MIDDLE EAST
REORGANIZATION PLAN IS

169
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,230
THE HIGHEST CURRENT PRIORITY

170
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,232
OF THE EARTH SPHERE
FEDERATION GOVERNMENT,

171
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,693
IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS GOAL
OF TOTAL UNIFICATION.

172
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,905
WE INTEND TO STABILIZE
RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC CONFLICTS

173
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,532
BETWEEN NATIONS
BY USING THE FEDERATION FORCES

174
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,785
TO SECURE ALL
THE NATIONAL BORDERS.

175
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,204
AS FOR ALL CONTINUING
INTERNAL CONFLICTS

176
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,956
CONSIDERATION IS
BEING GIVEN TO RELOCATING

177
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,625
(Scoffing)
OH, COME ON,

178
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,586
THIS WOMAN IS SPOUTING SOME
RIDICULOUS STUFF HERE.

179
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,963
EVEN SO, THIS WILL PROBABLY GO
OVER WELL WITH THE PUBLIC.

180
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,381
WHY'S THAT?

181
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,592
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
AFFECT THEM DIRECTLY.

182
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,011
Sumeragi:
WITH SOLAR POWER,
THE ORBITAL ELEVATOR PROJECT,

183
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,971
AND COLONY DEVELOPMENT,

184
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,432
THE FEDERATION HAS
ACHIEVED FINANCIAL STABILITY.

185
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,935
AS A RESULT OF THESE BLESSINGS,
THE STANDARD OF LIVING

186
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,895
FOR PEOPLE IN
THE FEDERATION HAS RISEN.

187
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,314
AND THE A‐LAWS
AND THE SECURITY AGENCY

188
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,900
ARE SUPPRESSING ALL
DISSIDENT ACTIVITY.

189
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,319
IF NOBODY ASKS QUESTIONS,
THERE'S NO HARM DONE.

190
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,571
THAT'S WHY THERE
WON'T BE ANY COMPLAINTS.

191
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,199
BUT EVEN WITH ALL THAT, THERE
ARE STILL PEOPLE OUT THERE

192
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,118
WHO ARE DYING
FOR NO GOOD REASON.

193
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,995
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE WAY
THE WORLD IS MEANT TO BE.

194
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,747
IT'S THE BASTARDS
WHO FOUNDED THE A‐LAWS.

195
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,208
THEY'RE THE MAIN CULPRITS.

196
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,044
Regene:
STAGE TWO IS TO USE THE A‐LAWS

197
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,588
TO UNITE THE WILL
OF ALL MANKIND.

198
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,298
INNOVATORS...

199
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,804
(Door slides open)

200
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,059
FELDT... I'M...
I'M SORRY.

201
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,396
I'M JUST HORRIBLE,
AREN'T I?

202
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,773
I ALWAYS INTEND
TO HANG TOUGH,

203
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,818
BUT I LET MYSELF BE SPOILED
BY HOW KIND EVERYONE IS.

204
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,778
DON'T WORRY,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

205
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,488
AFTER ALL... WE'RE FAMILY.

206
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,906
(Gasping)

207
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:58,992
(Sighs)

208
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,537
DO YOU KNOW HOW
FOOLISH YOU ARE, LIEUTENANT?

209
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,414
I WARNED YOU NOT TO
GET INVOLVED WITH THE A‐LAWS!

210
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,458
I VOLUNTEERED FOR THE
A‐LAWS MYSELF!

211
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,919
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO PROTECT YOU, COLONEL!

212
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,796
(Sighing)
IF YOU STAY HERE...

213
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,840
EVENTUALLY YOU'LL HAVE TO
FIGHT THE GUNDAMS.

214
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,925
YOU'LL JUST END UP DEAD.

215
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,845
PARDON ME, BUT
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MA'AM,

216
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,180
I'VE SURVIVED SEVEN
BATTLES WITH THE GUNDAMS.

217
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,975
MY COMRADES GAVE ME
A NICKNAME, THEY CALL ME

218
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,269
"COLASOUR THE INDESTRUCTABLE".

219
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,396
DON'T YOU KNOW THEY'RE
DISPARAGING YOU?

220
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,316
HO‐HO! YOU REALLY THINK SO?
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT!

221
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,942
(Sighing)
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

222
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,694
IT'S NOT EASY
BEING POPULAR, IS IT?

223
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,238
HE REALLY IS HOPELESS.

224
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,452
Ian:
THE TEMPORARY REPAIRS TO 00 AND
ARIOS ARE ALL DONE.

225
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,078
AND SOME MORE GOOD NEWS:

226
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,123
TWO OF OUR SUPPORT MACHINES
ARE FINISHED.

227
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,209
TO GET THE TWIN DRIVE WORKING
JUST RIGHT, I'D LIKE TO

228
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,421
TAKE IT UP INTO SPACE FIRST
AND WORK ON FINE TUNING IT.

229
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,049
I UNDERSTAND.
MILEINA, DO YOU THINK

230
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,426
YOU CAN TAKE OVER
THE MAINTENANCE DUTIES FOR IAN?

231
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,594
YES, MA'AM!

232
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,639
Lasse:
WE HAVE A CODED MESSAGE
FROM WANG LIU MEI.

233
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,015
Sumeragi:
DECODE IT.

234
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,435
Liu Mei:
EVERYONE. I HAVE SOLID
INTELLIGENCE THAT MEMBERS

235
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,438
OF THE A‐LAWS LEADERSHIP
WHO HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY APPEARED

236
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,232
IN PUBLIC WILL BE ATTENDING
AN EXCLUSIVE PARTY

237
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,485
I WILL REPORT
OUR FINDINGS LATER.

238
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,613
WAIT, I'M GOING TOO, I WANT TO
BE PART OF THE RECON MISSION.

239
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,531
BUT TIERIA...

240
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,826
I WANNA SEE OUR REAL ENEMY
WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

241
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,955
OKAY, BUT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THE ENEMY KNOWS WHO WE ARE.

242
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,207
I'M WILLING
TO BE HIS BACKUP.

243
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,168
WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S NO CHOICE

244
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,088
BUT ONLY UNDER THE CONDITION YOU
FOLLOW MY EXACT INSTRUCTIONS.

245
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,134
WAS THAT ALL RIGHT?

246
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,096
YES. THAT WAS
BEAUTIFULLY DONE.

247
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,981
MS. FELDT.

248
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,608
I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

249
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,485
MY EMOTIONS
GOT THE BEST OF ME.

250
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,863
IT'S FINE...
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

251
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,156
GOODBYE.

252
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,701
SO, YOU...

253
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,369
SO YOU REALLY
DO TREASURE

254
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,955
EVERYONE ON THIS SHIP,
DON'T YOU?

255
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,332
THAT'S BECAUSE...
THIS IS MY FAMILY.

256
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,298
I DIDN'T EXPECT THE PARTICLE
OUTPUT OF THE TWIN DRIVE

257
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,260
TO CAUSE THE MACHINE
TO SCREAM LIKE THAT...

258
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,847
BUT ONCE WE HAVE THE 0‐RAISER
WE CAN COVER THAT, TOO.

259
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,390
IN FACT, ONCE WE HAVE IT,

260
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,059
THIS MACHINE WILL SURPASS
ALL OTHER GUNDAMS.

261
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:37,066
(People laughing and chatting)

262
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,485
IT CERTAINLY WAS A
DELIGHTFUL AUCTION.

263
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,737
OH, HEY...

264
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,988
HUH?
OOH...

265
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,782
Guest 1:
IT'S WANG LIU MEI.

266
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,785
Guest 2:
SHE BECAME HEAD OF THE WANG
FAMILY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY 15.

267
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,163
Guest 3:
SHE IS STUNNING.

268
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,249
I WONDER WHERE THEY ARE?

269
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,208
(Gasping)

270
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,673
THAT WAS PROBABLY MISS
SUMERAGI'S IDEA...

271
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,217
MY MISTRESS...
LOOK THERE.

272
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,219
Liu Mei:
HOMER KATAGIRI.

273
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,015
HE'S THE HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT
FOR US A‐LAWS.

274
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,933
HELLO, I'M
BILLY KATAGIRI.

275
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,311
OH, SO YOU'RE COMMANDER
KATAGIRI'S NEPHEW...

276
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,480
I'VE HEARD YOU'RE
SOME KIND OF GENIUS.

277
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,814
NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

278
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,649
(All laughing)

279
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,445
Tieria:
THAT'S THE COMMANDER
OF THE A‐LAWS THERE.

280
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,074
BUT HE'S NOT THE ONE
CALLING THE SHOTS.

281
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,868
WHERE IS THE REAL ENEMY?

282
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,036
WHERE?

283
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,124
REGENE'S WILLFULNESS HAS PUT ME
IN A TOUGH SPOT.

284
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,293
I WOULD'VE PREFERRED
TO LET HIM ROAM FREELY

285
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,003
FOR JUST A WHILE LONGER.

286
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,926
SO UH... WHY DO YOU
NEED ME AT THIS PARTY?

287
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,929
YOU ARE THE HEAD
OF THE HALEVY FAMILY,

288
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,182
ONE OF A‐LAWS PRIMARY
SPONSORS.

289
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,060
ALL THE PEOPLE GATHERED HERE
TONIGHT ARE WORKING TO ACHIEVE

290
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,355
A PERMANENT PEACE BY
UNITING THIS WORLD OF OURS.

291
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:01,359
AND SO WE FIND OURSELVES
IN NEED OF THEIR COOPERATION.

292
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,278
OF COURSE, THIS IS ALSO TO
DEFEAT THE GUNDAMS.

293
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,989
WHEN I'M DONE GREETING
EVERYBODY,

294
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,408
MAY I BE EXCUSED
AND RETURN TO WORK?

295
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,868
CERTAINLY.

296
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,122
ALSO, TO COMPENSATE YOU FOR YOUR
TIME AND INCONVENIENCE,

297
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,415
I'VE ARRANGED TO HAVE
THE AHEAD THAT

298
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,252
SOMA PERIES USED TO PILOT
REASSIGNED FOR YOU TO USE.

299
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,170
I'M GRATEFUL, SIR.

300
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,593
DO YOU KNOW
ANY OF THESE VIPS?

301
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,555
THEY'RE JUST
ACQUAINTANCES.

302
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,975
HUH?

303
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:34,976
WHAT IS IT?

304
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,270
UH, NO...
IT'S NOTHING.

305
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,231
(Party guests mingling)

306
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,858
WOW THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GREAT HOBBY!

307
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,109
THANK YOU
FOR SAYING SO.

308
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,944
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE
THE PLEASURE

309
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,445
OF ESCORTING
YOU SOMETIME!

310
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,364
OH! I'D BE HONORED!

311
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,200
FILTHY SCUM...
SUCKING UP TO THE FEDERATION

312
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,035
TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN
