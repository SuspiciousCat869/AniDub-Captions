IGNORE THAT! SEND REINFORCEMENTS
TO FOURTH PLATOON.

SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION,

52
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,674
HUMANITY HAS USED
ITS TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE

00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,728
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT, GUNDAM!

166
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,862
(Screaming)

167
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,573
S‐SAJI!

168
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,741
Saji:

NOW I'LL AVENGE...

170
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,704
BRING'S DEATH!

171
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,706
TRANS AM RAISER!

INCOMING HIGH ENERGY

177
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,097
A WHAT?

178
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,061
(Sighs)
IT MISSED US!

179
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,396
THE BEAM IS MOVING, SIR!

180
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,022
HUH?

181
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,691
Goodman:
IT'S DOING WHAT?!

182
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,529
THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT
BEING SHOT AT!

183
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,197
IT'S A BEAM SABER!

184
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,700
(Aggressive yelling)

185
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,544
(Gasps)
WE DID IT!

186
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,378
Setsuna:
IT WASN'T ENOUGH!

187
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,504
HUH?

188
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,300
NO.
DON'T DO IT.

189
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,722
DON'T DO IT!

190
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,098
(Whirring)

191
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,848
SIR!
THE PILLAR UNDER

192
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,059
THE LOW ORBITAL STATION
IS STARTING TO AUTO‐PURGE!

193
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,810
CHECK THE AUTO‐BALANCERS!

194
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,732
Operator:
CONFIRMED!
THE ANCHORS ARE RELEASING!

195
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,987
HUH? THE PILLAR'S SHELL
IS CRACKING!

196
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,031
(Grunts)
HURRY UP!

197
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,699
(Gasps)

198
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,578
Feldt:
THE LASER STRUCK THE PILLAR!

199
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,748
THE PILLAR'S EXTERNAL SHELL IS
STARTING TO AUTO‐PURGE!

200
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,086
FRAGMENTS ENTERING FROM
ABOVE THE STRATOSPHERE

201
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,172
WILL BURN UP
DUE TO ATMOSPHERIC HEATING,

202
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,634
BUT FRAGMENTS FROM
THE SECTIONS BELOW

203
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,719
WILL HIT THE EARTH.

204
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,685
(Screaming)

205
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,820
IT'S MY FAULT.

206
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,113
Sergei:
PULL IT TOGETHER!

207
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,700
RIGHT NOW, THINK ABOUT HOW
WE CAN PREVENT ANY MORE DAMAGE!

208
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,125
WHAT'S THAT?

209
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,876
THEY REALLY DID IT.

210
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,421
IT'S THE ORBITAL ELEVATOR!

211
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,757
Tieria:
IT'S COLLAPSING!

212
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,676
MISS SUMERAGI.
TO ALL UNITS
IN THIS AIRSPACE.

213
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,887
WHAT'S THIS?
I'M TRANSMITTING DATA
VIA A VISUAL COMLINK.

214
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,681
PLEASE DESTROY
THE PILLAR FRAGMENTS

215
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,684
THAT WILL BE ENTERING
THE AIR SPACES I'VE INDICATED.

216
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,978
BELOW THEM ARE
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS.

217
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,396
WHAT DID SHE SAY?!

218
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,732
UNLESS WE WORK TOGETHER
AND DO OUR BEST,

219
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,067
TENS OF MILLIONS
OF LIVES WILL BE LOST.

220
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,444
I'M BEGGING YOU,

221
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,696
SAVE THOSE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

222
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,999
COMPRESSED PARTICLES,
RELEASING!

223
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,719
(Panicked screaming)

224
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,227
HARO!

225
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,897
DEPLOYING SHIELD BITS!
DEPLOYING SHIELD BITS!

226
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,749
(Grunts)

227
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,674
(Stunned gasps)

228
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,101
THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY OF THEM!

229
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,978
DAMN IT!

230
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,522
(Gasps)

231
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,357
THAT'S...

232
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,608
Allelujah:
MARIE!

233
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,485
THIS DOESN'T COUNT AS A BATTLE!

234
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,278
IT'S TO SAVE LIVES!

235
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,865
HMM.

236
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,707
DAMN IT.
IF THIS KEEPS UP...

237
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,964
IT GOT PAST!

238
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,382
(Gasps)

239
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,093
I THINK THAT'S...

240
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,136
KATHARON!

241
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,303
(Grunts)

242
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,727
(Gasps)
UNITS FROM THE COUP D'ETAT?

243
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,997
THIS IS A HELL OF A MESS!

244
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,375
WHAT'S THIS?!

245
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,002
IT'S THE REGULAR ARMY!

246
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,170
(Tense grunt)

247
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,548
(Gasps)

248
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,966
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE URBAN AREAS

249
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,342
ARE GONNA BE SPARED
ANY DIRECT HITS!

250
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:12,763
(Relieved sigh)

251
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,348
MY THANKS TO ALL.

252
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,683
IN TIMES LIKE THIS,

253
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,977
I GUESS EVERYBODY
COMES TOGETHER AS ONE.

254
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,729
THAT'S WHAT I CALL IRONY.

255
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,565
(Chuckles)
BUT IT ISN'T BAD!

256
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,483
HMM.

257
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,110
(Gasps)

258
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,904
Feldt:
MOBILE SUIT TEAMS ARE
APPROACHING US FROM PORTSIDE!

259
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:28,905
IT'S A‐LAWS!

260
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,823
THEY WERE WAITING FOR
THIS OPPORTUNITY!

261
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,325
LET'S CALL BACK
MR. ERDE AND THE OTHERS!

262
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,784
WE'LL KEEP ON LIKE THIS!

263
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,203
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

264
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,038
HMM.

265
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,416
(Kati thinking)
IF SHE IS THEIR COMMANDER,
I KNOW WHAT SHE'LL DO.

266
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,171
HMM?

267
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,551
I KNOW WE HAVE OUR ORDERS,
BUT STILL...

268
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,887
I WILL NOT ABANDON
PEOPLE TO THEIR FATE!

269
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,306
I'M GONNA BE
DIFFERENT FROM MY FATHER!

270
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,695

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,201
HUH?

274
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,787

275
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,914
MARIE!

276
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,207
Andrei:
WHAT? YOU'RE SAYING

277
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,875
YOU SAW MACHINES
COME OUT OF THE PILLAR?

278
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,126
YES.

279
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,087
THEY COULD BE
THE LEADERS OF THE REBELLION.

280
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,296
FOLLOW ME.

281
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,714

284
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,140
THAT YOU, PERIES?
WHY ARE YOU IN A MOBILE SUIT?

285
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,892

00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,359
A‐LAWS!

288
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,278
HUH?
I KNOW THAT VOICE.

289
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,154
COLONEL HERCURY?!

290
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,615
Hercury:
HUH? ANDREI!

291
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,367
WHAT THE HELL?!

292
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,660
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

293
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,996
Louise:
LIEUTENANT!
THAT'S A HUGE FRAGMENT!

294
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,706
WHAT?

295
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,296
DAMN IT, IT DIDN'T FULLY
AUTO‐PURGE!

296
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,465
IF THAT THING HITS...

297
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,092
A GUNDAM!

298
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,552

304
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,339
THAT'S THE ORBITAL ELEVATOR.

305
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,965
AFTER THIS,

306
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,843
WHAT'S THE WORLD
GONNA BE LIKE?

307
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,263
IF ONLY EVERYONE
COULD HEAR OUR SONG.

308
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,431

309
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,599
(Murmuring)

310
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,292
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

311
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,293
(Beeps)

312
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,711
HMM?

313
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,966
I SEE YOU MADE IT,
HERCURY.

314
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,343
UNBELIEVABLE.

315
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,178
WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS JUST...

316
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,723
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT CAN NEVER BE TAKEN BACK.

317
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,560
HUH?
HERCURY!

319
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,980
Andrei:
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!

320
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,610
YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO CAUSED THIS CATASTROPHE!

321
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,529
YOU BASTARD!
