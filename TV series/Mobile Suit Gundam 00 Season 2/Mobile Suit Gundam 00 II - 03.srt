00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,713
Interrogator:
DURING THE AZADISTAN CIVIL WAR
FOUR YEARS AGO,

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,173
YOU WERE IN CONTACT WITH

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,634
A MEMBER OF
CELESTIAL BEING, WEREN'T YOU?

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,552
Marina:
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
ALL ABOUT IT

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,887
FOUR YEARS AGO.

6
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,890
WELL, THE SITUATION
HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,142
NOW THAT NEW GUNDAMS HAVE
APPEARED ON THE SCENE,

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,560
YOU HAVE ONCE AGAIN BECOME

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,604
A PERSON OF
TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE TO US.

10
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:21,605
(Sighs)

11
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,315
MARINA ISMAIL,

12
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,109

THE KINGDOM OF AZADISTAN.

Secretary General:
THE ASSEMBLY HAS DECIDED

19
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,748
TO PLACE THE FEDERAL
SECURITY AGENCY

20
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,957
UNDER THE DIRECT CONTROL

21
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,793
OF THE AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE.

22
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,838
WE NOW HAVE
SOME 40 MILLION SOLDIERS.

23
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,131
THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF THIS FORCE

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,549
COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED

25
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,302
WITHOUT VEDA'S INFORMATION
CONTROL CAPABILITIES.

26
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,054
Ribbons:
IT WAS AN HONOR
TO ASSIST YOU.

27
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,597
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT

28
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,184
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GIVE IN
TO PETTY RESISTANCE.

29
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,936
FOR ANY DIALOGUES
IN THE FUTURE.

30
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,689
Secretary General:
WE HAVE GREAT HOPES FOR
WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

31
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,358
OF COURSE YOU DO.

32
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,485
IT'S THE REASON WE WERE BORN.

33
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,487
IT'S WHY WE EXIST.

34
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,702
I AM FAITHFULLY EXECUTING
AEOLIA SCHENBERG'S PLAN.

35
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,663
SOMETHING NO HUMAN CAN DO.

36
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,415
AND ONLY WE CAN,

37
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,626
FOR WE ARE THE INNOVATORS.

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,047
Regene:
REGARDING
THE AZADISTAN PRINCESS,

39
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,007
YOU'VE BEEN LEAVING HER
ALONE UNTIL NOW.

40
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,385
SO WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND?

41
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,636
(Chuckles)

42
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,513
YOU KNOW THE REASON.

43
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,555
HMPH.

44
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,432
SO, YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'LL SHOW UP?

45
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,226
OF COURSE THEY WILL.

46
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,144
AFTER ALL,
ONE OF THE GUNDAM MEISTERS

47
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,521
IS BEING HELD THERE TOO.

48
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,944
WAKE UP,
TEST SUBJECT E‐57.

49
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,988
(Groggy moaning)

50
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,448
SO THIS IS THE MAN.

51
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,033
THE GUNDAM PILOT
YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING HERE

52
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,701
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

53
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,578
(Gasps)

54
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,331
(Muffled shouting)

55
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,582
HMM?

56
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,836
(Muffled shouting)

57
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,130
Peries: (Thinking)
MY QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES
AREN'T AFFECTING HIM ANYMORE.

58
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,589
THE FILE REPORT SAYS

59
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,758
IT'S BECAUSE OF A HEAD INJURY
HE SUFFERED.

60
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,676
Allelujah:
(Panting)

61
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,094
MARIE.

62
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,138
(Sighs)

63
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,807
YOU FINALLY CAME.

64
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,643
IT IS YOU,
YOU SURVIVED SOMEHOW.

65
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,145
MARIE.

66
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,312
MARIE?

67
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,273
(Gasps)
BUT IT'S ME!

68
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,650
YOU AND I USED TO TALK
ALL THE TIME IN THE HOME!

69
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,901
IT'S ALLELUJAH!

70
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,447
STOP TALKING LIKE THAT,
MY NAME IS NOT MARIE!

71
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,448
NO.

72
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,074
YOU'RE MARIE,
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

73
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,706
Tieria:
DO YOU HAVE ANY MOBILE SUIT
COMBAT EXPERIENCE?

74
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,332
OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T.

75
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,169
BUT I HAVE OPERATED
AN INDUSTRIAL WORK LOADER.

76
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,504
SO HE BROUGHT US SOMEONE
WHO'S A COMPLETE NOVICE.

77
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,755
DAMN SETSUNA.

78
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,340
THAT JUST MEANS
I'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS

79
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,341
I NEED TO LEARN.

80
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,759
SO I'M COUNTING ON YOU,

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,053
MY OH‐SO‐CHARMING
INSTRUCTOR.

82
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,139
I'D PREFER LESS TEASING!

83
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,104
LYLE DYLANDY.

84
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,651
MILEINA, HAVE ARIOS AND
CHERUDIM BEEN LOADED YET?

85
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,944
Mileina:
ALL FINISHED!

86
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,113
AND WHAT'S MISS SUMERAGI
DOING NOW?

87
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,907
SHE'S STILL SHUTTING
HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM.

88
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,325
Lasse and Mileina:
(Worried sigh)

89
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,869
Ian:
SHE SAYS SHE ISN'T
NECESSARILY GOING TO

90
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,287
REJOIN CELESTIAL BEING.

91
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,542
Setsuna:
YES, THE RECORDS HAVE IT RIGHT.

92
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,961
OUR GROUP HAD A DIFFERENT
POINT OF VIEW FROM THE THRONES

93
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,130
WHEN IT CAME TO
ARMED INTERVENTIONS.

94
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,007
SO THEY WEREN'T YOUR ALLIES?

95
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,175
NO.

96
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,136
(Gasps)

97
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,014
HMM.

98
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,559
EVEN SO, YOU KILLED PEOPLE
WITH YOUR GUNDAMS, TOO.

99
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,355
HURTING THEIR LOVED ONES
LIKE I'VE BEEN HURT.

100
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,773
IT'S ONLY NATURAL FOR PEOPLE

101
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,150
TO HATE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID.

102
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,985
I KNOW THAT.

103
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,530
THE WORLD WAS PEACEFUL
BACK THEN.

104
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,242
MY NORMAL EVERYDAY LIFE
WOULD HAVE CONTINUED,

105
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,994
AND IT WAS YOU PEOPLE
WHO DESTROYED ALL THAT!

106
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,248
SO EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT

107
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,582
AS LONG AS
YOU HAVE PEACE?

108
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,625
(Bothered gasp)

109
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,919
I DON'T MEAN THAT.

110
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,130
BUT, NO ONE WANTS
TO BE UNHAPPY.

111
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,883
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT,

112
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,176
NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL

113
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,220
AFTER YOUR TRANSFER
TO THE A‐LAWS?

114
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,805
NO, NOT REALLY.

115
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,975
JUST THE FACT THERE'S MORE
TRAINING THAN USUAL, I GUESS.

116
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,351
I SEE.

117
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,561
UH, COLONEL,

118
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,813
IN THE FILES
ON THE SUPER HUMAN INSTITUTE,

119
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,399
WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT
A PERSON NAMED MARIE?

120
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,525
MARIE?

121
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,485
NO, I DON'T RECALL THE NAME.

122
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,320
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
I WENT THROUGH ALL THE FILES

123
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,114
WE COLLECTED FROM THAT PLACE.

124
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,699
IS THAT SO?

125
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,825
(Knock on door)

126
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,076
HMM?

127
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,828
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M STILL ON DUTY.

128
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,288
OF COURSE.

129
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,456
COME IN.

130
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,335
LIEUTENANT, THE MAIN FORCE
IS ARRIVING NOW.

131
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,962
VERY GOOD.
ONCE THEY MAKE CONTACT,

132
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,505
HAVE EVERYONE TAKE
THEIR STATIONS.

133
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,256
YES, MA'AM.

134
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,054
Kati:
ASSUME DEFENSIVE POSITIONS

135
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,390
IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE MISSION PLAN.

136
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,225
CONTACT LIEUTENANT PERIES
OF THE ADVANCE TEAM.

137
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,310
YES, MA'AM.

138
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,354
SO, THIS IS WHERE
THEY'RE HOLDING

139
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,315
THE PILOT OF
THE WINGED ONE.

140
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,944
EVER SINCE WE HANDED HIM OVER
TO THE TOP BRASS,

141
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,656
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY WORD
ABOUT WHAT'S BECOME OF HIM.

142
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,284
BUT THE A‐LAWS KNEW
WHERE HE WAS.

143
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,119
Nena:
I'VE CONFIRMED
THE INFORMATION FROM LEVEL TWO

144
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,330
ABOUT THE MEISTER STILL
BEING ALIVE.

145
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,749
AND THE A‐LAWS HAVE
JUST SHOWN UP.

146
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,958
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO,
MISTRESS?

147
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,168
ANY SUGGESTIONS?

148
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,003
I'LL HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

149
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,713
YOU MAY RETURN NOW.

150
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,131
ROGER THAT!

151
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,137
Allelujah:
MARIE.

152
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,139
WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME?

153
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,267
AND YOU TALK LIKE
A STRANGER.

154
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,604
THEY MUST HAVE GIVEN HER
A DIFFERENT PERSONALITY.

155
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,190
Feldt:
WE HAVE A CODED MESSAGE
FROM WANG LIU MEI.

156
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,609
A DISSIDENT DETENTION CENTER
IN THE HRL‐‐

157
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,610
(Surprised gasp)

158
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,362
IS HOLDING ALLELUJAH HAPTISM!

159
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,613
I KNOW HIM!

160
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,531
HE'S ONE OF
THE GUNDAM MEISTERS!

161
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,783
I SEE.

162
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,493
HE WAS CAPTURED BY
THE FEDERATION!

163
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,537
NO WONDER WE COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT WHERE HE WAS.

164
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,539
FELDT,
GET EVERYONE TOGETHER.

165
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,416
WE'RE HAVING A BRIEFING.

166
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,459
WHAT?!

167
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,586
THEY FOUND OUT
WHERE ALLELUJAH IS?!

168
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,754
ALLELUJAH?

169
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,880
WHO ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

170
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,424
YOUR BUDDY! YOUR BUDDY!

171
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,134
SO THEY FOUND HIM.

172
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,057
(Grunts)

173
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,059
(Gasps)
COLONEL!

174
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,978
WHY HAVE WE SUSPENDED
OUR SEARCH FOR THE GUNDAMS, SIR?

175
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
BECAUSE IT'S
NO LONGER NECESSARY.

176
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,399
NOT NECESSARY?!

177
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,150
IT APPEARS HEADQUARTERS
HAS DANGLED SOME BAIT

178
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,985
FOR CELESTIAL BEING.

179
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,737
I FEEL SORRY
FOR THE GROUND FORCES,

180
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,114
BUT THIS COULD BE
A GOOD CHANCE

181
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,116
TO MEASURE
THE ENEMY'S STRENGTH.

182
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,744
IS IT TRUE,

183
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,371
YOU KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE HOLDING ALLELUJAH?

184
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,123
YEAH, THIS IS
RELIABLE INFORMATION

185
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,666
FROM WANG LIU MEI.

186
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,001
WE'RE GETTING STARTED ON
A RESCUE MISSION NOW.

187
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,879
SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
RESCUE HIM?

188
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,631
THAT'S WHAT
WE WANT YOU TO FIGURE OUT.

189
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,841
(Shocked gasp)

190
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,259
MISS SUMERAGI,

191
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,387
WE'D LIKE ONE OF YOUR
TACTICAL FORECASTS.

192
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,430
BUT I'M...

193
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,723
IF HE'S WITH US,

194
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,349
THEN WE CAN START
MOUNTING OPERATIONS

195
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,101
WITH FOUR GUNDAMS AGAIN.

196
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,103
HEY, I'M STILL
NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THIS.

197
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:40,478
HMPH!

198
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,855
OOPSY.

199
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,148
PLEASE, HELP US OUT.

200
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,358
WE CAN SAVE ALLELUJAH!

201
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,943
(Sighs)

202
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,695
MISS SUMERAGI.

203
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,114
TAKE THIS.

204
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,115

205
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,366
STOP IT!

206
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,828
I CAN'T LIVE UP TO
YOUR EXPECTATIONS ANYMORE!

207
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,913
MY FORECASTS CAN'T REALLY
CHANGE ANYTHING

208
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,832
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

209
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,043
I'D JUST BE PUTTING
EVERYONE IN DANGER!

210
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,336
THERE ARE NO REGRETS!

211
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,629
(Gasps)

212
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,007
EVEN IF THE MISSION FAILS,

213
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,468
WE'LL NEVER
BLAME YOU FOR IT.

214

Setsuna:
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

215
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,598
ALLELUJAH IS OUR COMRADE.

216
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:20,393
AND WE'RE GOING TO
SAVE HIM!

217
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,146
SO PLEASE, WORK OUT
A TACTICAL PLAN FOR US.

218
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,941
FELDT,

219
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,109
LATER, COULD YOU
UPDATE ME ON

220
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,527
OUR CURRENT
FIGHTING STRENGTH

221
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,529
AND OUR PRESENT SITUATION,
PLEASE?

222
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,114
YES, MISS SUMERAGI!

223
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,627
Feldt:
WE JUST RECEIVED THIS DATA
FROM WANG LIU MEI.

224
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,295
INCREDIBLE!

225
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,547
THE NAME OF EVERY DETAINEE
AND THEIR LOCATION.

00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,551
IT'S HER.

228
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,969
IF WE CAN KEEP THIS CARRIER

229
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,097
FROM USING
ITS PARTICLE BEAMS...

230
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,141
AND THEN THERE'S THIS.

231
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,770
LYLE DYLANDY'S ABILITY SCORES
ARE VERY HIGH.

232
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,813
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

233
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,314
Feldt:
00, SERAVEE, CHERUDIM,

234
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,732
PREPARE TO LAUNCH.
WE'LL FINALLY
SEE SOME ACTION!

235
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,068
I DON'T IMAGINE YOU'LL BE
SEEING MUCH OF IT TODAY.

236
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,820
WELL, THAT MAKES ME FEEL
A LOT BETTER!

237

(Announcement on PA)

238
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,906
SO, WHAT'S ALL
THIS EXCITEMENT ABOUT?

239
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,741
WHAT ARE THEY GETTING READY FOR
OUT THERE?

240
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,327
RESCUING A BUDDY!
RESCUING A BUDDY!

IS THERE SOMETHING COOL

324
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,537
MY BROTHER WOULD SAY
WHEN HE WAS FIGHTING?

325
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,414
TARGETED AND FIRING!
TARGETED AND FIRING!

326
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,999
(Chuckles)
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

327
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,627
CHERUDIM GUNDAM,
LOCKON STRATOS,

328
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,712
TARGETED AND FIRING!

329
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,221
LOOK AT THAT PARTICLE OUTPUT!

330
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,098
I'VE GOT THIS COVERED!

331
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,313
WE'VE GOT TO GET CLOSER!

332
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,486
NOT ONE STEP BACK!

333
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,364
(Surprised gasp)

334
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,032
WHAT THE?!

335
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,951
Pilot:
WE'RE BEING ATTACKED
FROM ANOTHER DIRECTION!

336
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,161
Feldt:
CHERUDIM HAS SHOT DOWN
AN ENEMY MACHINE!

337
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,830
Lasse:
ISN'T THIS GUY SUPPOSED
TO BE AN AMATEUR?

338
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,623
HMM.

339
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,166
Sumeragi:
WHAT IS HE?

340
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,918
YOU GOT HIM!
YOU GOT HIM!

341
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,294
IT WAS JUST A LUCKY SHOT!

342
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,928
I CAN'T CLOSE IN!

343
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,179
HOW'S THE RESCUE COMING?

344
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,723
(Panting)

345
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,935
WHAT THE?!

346
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,648
(Rapid gunfire)

347
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,691
IT'S KATHARON.

348
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,025
I'LL HANDLE THINGS HERE.

349
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,236
GO AND SECURE E‐57,
LIEUTENANT!

350
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,612
THANKS!

351
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,864
Kati:
WHAT?

352
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,283
KATHARON IS RELEASING
THE PRISONERS?

353
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,701
DOES THIS MEAN
THEY'RE CONSPIRING

354
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,202
WITH CELESTIAL BEING?

355
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,579
(Startled gasp)

356
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,540
WHAT IN THE WORLD'S GOING ON?

357
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,130
(Surprised gasp)

358
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,595
SETSUNA,

359
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,180
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

360
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,514
GO TO THAT POINT.

361
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,932
ARIOS IS ON ITS WAY.

362
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,767
WHAT'S ARIOS?

363
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,144
THE NAME OF YOUR NEW GUNDAM.

364
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,691
HMM.

365
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,528
WE HAVE FOUND ALLELUJAH!

366
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,613
(Grunts)

367
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,198
LAUNCH ARIOS!

368
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,117
Mileina:
YOU GOT IT!
ARIOS, LAUNCHING!

369
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,122
PTOLEMY, RE‐SUBMERGING!

370
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,543
Lasse:
WHILE HOLDING THEM OFF
WITH GN MISSILES,

371
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,087
WE'LL MAKE OUR WAY
TO THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.

372
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,882
ONLY 120 SECONDS LEFT.

373
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,886
(Panting)

374
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,804
Allelujah:
THEY'RE RELEASING
THE OTHER PRISONERS, TOO.

375
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,224
BUT IT'S NOT SETSUNA'S DOING.

376
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,142
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE?

377
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,897
(Gasps)

378
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,649
THIS IS THE DESIGNATED POINT.

379
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,078
GUNDAM.

380
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,622
HOLD IT!

381
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,666
HUH?

382
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,667
END OF THE LINE!

383
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,835
DON'T MOVE, SUBJECT E‐57.

384
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,545
Marina:
(Gasping)

385
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,257
IS THERE A BATTLE
GOING ON OUTSIDE?

386
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,967
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

387
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,343
Setsuna:
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

388
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,344
MOVE AWAY FROM THE DOOR!

389
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,345
WHAT?

390
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,638
GET BACK!

391
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,265
(Nervous gasp)

392
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,516
(Startled cry)

393
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,017
(Door opens)

394
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,143
HUH?

395
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,562
LET'S GO.

396
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,647
(Gasp)

397
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,107
SETSUNA!

398
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,693
(Shots being fired)

399
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,155
THERE'S LESS THAN
30 SECONDS LEFT!

400
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,702
MARIE.

401
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,536
STOP RIGHT THERE!

402
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,787
MARIE!

403
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,123
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU,
THAT'S NOT MY NAME!

404
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,127
NO, I'M MORE CERTAIN
THAN EVER THAT

405
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,337
THAT'S YOUR REAL NAME.

406
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,298
MARIE.

407
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,466
MARIE PARFACY.

408
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,552
M‐MARIE...

409
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,179
PARFACY?

410
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,848
Young Allelujah:
MARIE! MARIE!

411
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,141
(Peries gasps)

412
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,731
(Stunned gasp)

413
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,482
WHAT...
WHAT WAS...

414
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,151
THAT VISION I JUST HAD?

415
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,193
MARIE!

416
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,987
(Grunts)

417
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,114
GIVE YOURSELF UP, E‐57!

418
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,535
LIEUTENANT!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

419
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,162
(Frustrated grunt)

420
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,788
Tieria:
SETSUNA! ALLELUJAH!
WE'RE OUT OF TIME!

421
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,789
Setsuna:
ROGER!

422
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,541
DAMN IT.

423
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,128
MARIE IS RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF ME!

424
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,380
Tieria:
ALLELUJAH, WHAT'S WRONG?!

425
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,091
ALLELUJAH! ALLELUJAH!

426
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,468
(Frustrated growl)

427
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,470
ROGER.

428
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,305
(Gunshots)

429
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,648
MARIE.

430
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,776
ONE DAY I WILL COME BACK
FOR YOU.

431
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,277
I SWEAR!

432
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,118
Pilot:
TH‐THERE ARE THREE GUNDAMS!

433
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,502
AW, CRAP!

434
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,510
DAMN IT!

435
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,945
Kati:
CEASE FIRING!

436
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,571
DO WE FOLLOW THEM, MA'AM?

437
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,615
NO, SECURING THE FACILITY
COMES FIRST.

438
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,783
MA'AM.

439
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,326
(Growls)

440
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,953
Feldt:
THE GUNDAMS HAVE ESCAPED,

441
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,580
WE'RE COMMENCING
WITHDRAWAL NOW.

442
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,124
(Relieved sigh)

443
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,292
Haro:
MISSION COMPLETE!
MISSION COMPLETE!

444
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,296
(Relieved sigh)

445
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,756
THEY MANAGED TO GET AWAY.

446
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,680
Katharon Leader:
WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESCUED
OUR COMRADES!

447
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,932
AND IT'S ALL THANKS
TO THE INFO FROM JEAN ONE!

448
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,101
YEAH, HE REALLY
CAME THROUGH FOR US!

449
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,353
HMM.

450
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,354
SHIRIN.

451
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,564
I JUST HEARD A MISSION REPORT

452
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,649
FROM ONE OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE RESCUE PARTY.

453
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,025
WHAT IS IT?

454
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,069
IT SEEMS WHEN THEY WERE IN
THE DETENTION CENTER,

455
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,946
THEY RECOGNIZED
A PRISONER THERE.

456
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,031
THE PRINCESS ROYAL
OF AZADISTAN,

457
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,616
MARINA ISMAIL.

458
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,160
WHAT? M‐MARINA?!

459
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,953
SHE WAS BEING HELD
IN DETENTION?!

460
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,455
IT SEEMS SO.

461
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,498
WHERE IS SHE?

462
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,791
I'M SORRY.

463
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,377
SHE ISN'T AMONG THE PEOPLE
WE TOOK OUT OF THERE.

464
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,753
(Worried)
OH, NO.

465
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,130
BUT ACCORDING TO THE REPORT,

466
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,549
PRINCESS MARINA WAS TAKEN AWAY
BY SOMEONE

467
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,051
WHO SEEMED TO BE
A MEMBER OF CELESTIAL BEING.

468
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,344
TAKEN AWAY?

469
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,847
A MEMBER OF CELESTIAL BEING?

470
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,140
(Gasps)

471
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,310
COULD IT BE HIM?

472
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,149
Shirin:

OH, THANKS,
TIERIA.

481
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,290
ALLELUJAH,

482
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,750
WHY WAS THE FEDERATION
GOVERNMENT HOLDING YOU?

483

THE SUPER SOLDIER
DATA WAS‐‐

MAN OH MAN,
THIS SHIP IS AMAZING!

485
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,340

IT EVEN OPERATES UNDERWATER!

BUT HOW?!

487
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,137
I'M GETTING TIRED OF
THAT REACTION.

488
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,975
UHH, I'M...
I'M SORRY.

489
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,060
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.
YOU'RE STILL THE SAME.

490
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,895
YOU THINK SO?

491
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,773
THERE'S REALLY
NO NEED FOR YOU TO CHANGE.

492
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,774
WELCOME BACK,

493
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,984
ALLELUJAH.

494
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:22,985
HMM.

495
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,111
THANKS.

496
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,655
GOOD TO BE BACK.

497
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,949
Setsuna:
I GOT YOU INTO TROUBLE,

498
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,410
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE
I APPROACHED YOU.

499
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,662
I'M SORRY, MARINA.

500
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,624
SETSUNA, WHY?

501
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,793
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO
START FIGHTING AGAIN?

502
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,712
IT'S ALL I KNOW
HOW TO DO.

503
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,172
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

504
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,757
THERE ARE COUNTLESS WAYS
YOU CAN LIVE YOUR LIFE

505
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,134
WITHOUT HAVING TO
FIGHT AGAIN!

506
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,969
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY.

507
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,554
(Gasps)

508
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,431
THAT'S WHY MY WISH

509
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,683
WILL ONLY COME TRUE
THROUGH FIGHTING.

510
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,144
THAT'S JUST...

511
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,146
THAT'S JUST SO SAD.

512
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,899
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

513
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:02,900
(Sobs)

514
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,111
I'M CRYING BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T.

515
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,740
Narrator:
THOSE WHO HAVE MADE MISTAKES

516
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,951
CAN ONLY CORRECT
THEIR MISTAKES THEMSELVES.

517
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,121
THE JOURNEY OF ATONEMENT
IS A JOURNEY OF REBIRTH.

518
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,124
NEXT EPISODE:
"A REASON TO FIGHT".

519
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,919
HOWEVER,
SINS NEVER DISAPPEAR.
