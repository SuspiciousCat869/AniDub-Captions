LOOK HOW WE'RE HERE
TOGETHER NOW!

169
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,554
I WAS ALWAYS WAITING FOR YOU.

170
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,138
HERE IN SPACE.

171
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,813
LET'S GO BACK,
LOUISE!

172
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,566
BACK TO WHAT WE HAD!

173
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,111
TO THOSE DAYS
WHEN EVERYTHING WAS PEACEFUL.

174
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,699
I CAN'T.

175
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,033
HUH?
WHY NOT?

176
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,035
YOU WERE ABLE TO HEAR MY VOICE,
RIGHT?

177
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,329
I'M NOT PART OF CELESTIAL BEING.

178
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,873
I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THIS MESS!

179
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,708
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

180
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,710
IN THAT CASE‐‐

181
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,837
HUH?

182
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,841
I'VE SWORN TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO
MAKING THIS A UNITED WORLD.

183
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,677
TO CREATING A PERMANENT PEACE,

184
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,387
TO DEFEATING CELESTIAL BEING,

185
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,140
WHICH ONLY BRINGS CHAOS
TO THE WORLD.

186
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,019
AND TO TAKING REVENGE
FOR MY MOM AND DAD!

187
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,146
LOUISE.

188
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,109
HMM.

189
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,403
DON'T TRY TO STOP ME!

190
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,616
IF YOU GET IN MY WAY,
I'LL SHOOT YOU.

191
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,075
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

192
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,410
THAT'S NOT RIGHT!

193
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,873
YOU NEVER USED TO BE
THIS KIND OF GIRL BEFORE!

194
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:51,169
WHAT CHANGED YOU INTO THIS?!

195
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,004
I CHOSE TO CHANGE MYSELF,

196
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,631
OF MY OWN FREE WILL.

197
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,924
THAT'S A LIE!

198
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,216
(Gasps)

199
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,718
I KNOW YOU, LOUISE.

200
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,219
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LIKE!

201
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:05,266
YOU'RE A GENTLE,
KIND‐HEARTED GIRL!

202
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:11,397
I KNOW YOU STUDIED REALLY HARD
SO YOU COULD GO UP INTO SPACE!

203
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,734
AND THAT YOU'RE A BIT CLUMSY IN
HOW YOU PRETEND TO BE SELFISH

204
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,027
JUST TO ATTRACT ATTENTION!

205
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,195
(Grunts)

206
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,285
THAT THE TRUTH IS, YOU OFTEN
FEEL VERY MUCH ALONE.

207
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,289
(Gasping)

208
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,715
I KNOW THE REAL YOU.

209
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,974
LOUISE.

210
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,434
SAJI.

211
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,479
WHAT, LOUISE?

212
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,480
I...

213
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,442
I'M TRYING TO...

214
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,610
(Gasps)

215
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,654
OH, LOUISE.

216
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,031
(Gasps)

217
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,117
SAJI, I...

218
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,085
(Sobs)
I HAVE TO...

219
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,461
Andrei:
WARRANT OFFICER HALEVY!

220
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,089
I HAVE TO CHANGE IT!

221
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,382
LOUISE, NO!

222
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,258
HEADS UP!

223
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,426
THAT'S ENOUGH!

224
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,136
RELEASE HER!

225
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:31,144
YOU'RE JUST CONFUSING HER
WITH YOUR WEIRD ILLUSIONS!

226
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,704
IT APPEARS THAT COMBAT
AT CLOSE RANGE

227
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,205
ISN'T ONE OF
YOUR MACHINE'S STRENGTHS!

228
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,666
IT'S NOT ONE OF YOUR STRENGTHS
EITHER.

229
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,835
YOU'RE BUILT FOR NOTHING
BUT FIREPOWER!

230
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,837
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

231
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,005
TRANS AM!

232
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,136
(Growls)

233
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,139
(Yelling)

234
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,143
(Grunts)

235
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,441
THIS CAN'T BE!

236
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,109
(Grunts)

237
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,698
NOT SO FAST!

238
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,116
SERAPHIM!

239
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,667
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
I WANNA ASK YOU.

240
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,420
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
ANSWER THEM, INNOVATOR!

241
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,676
WE'VE REACHED TRANS AM'S LIMIT!

242
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,720
LOUISE!

243
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,723
I WON'T LET YOU TAKE HER!

244
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,724
(Beeps)

245
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,934
HUH?

246
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,560
Peries:
THERE YOU ARE!

247
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,147
ANDREI SMIRNOV!

248
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,358
THAT MACHINE!
REINFORCEMENTS?!

249
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,359
WHY?!

250
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,944
WHY DID YOU KILL THE COLONEL?!

251
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,403
LIEUTENANT PERIES?

252
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,363
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?!

253
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,032
ANSWER ME!

254
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,829
SO, THAT MEANS...
YOU'RE A TRAITOR, TOO!

255
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,623
WHO ARE YOU TO
CALL ME A TRAITOR?!

256
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,127
Allelujah:
MARIE!

257
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,921
(Growling)
EVEN MORE REINFORCEMENTS?!

258
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,132
WARRANT OFFICER, LET'S GO!

259
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,138
(Aggressive yell)

260
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,057
Allelujah:
MARIE, STOP IT!

261
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,392
Peries:
DON'T INTERFERE!

262
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,977
I HAVE TO AVENGE
THE COLONEL'S DEATH!

263
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,146
Saji:
STOP IT!

264
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,111
JUST STOP IT ALREADY!

265
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,697
NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE.

266
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,740
EVEN IF YOU AVENGE
HIS DEATH,

267
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,577
IT WON'T BRING ANYONE BACK.

268
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,538
IT'LL JUST ADD TO THE SORROWS.

269
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,123
EVERYTHING THAT
YOU'RE DOING

270
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,543
IS JUST MAKING YOU ALL CRAZIER.

271
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:05,173
NONE OF THIS IS GOING ANYWHERE.

272
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:08,134
NONE OF YOU ARE MAKING
ANY PROGRESS.

273
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:19,937
Graham:
A RIDICULOUS FARCE. ALL THIS
HALF‐HEARTED FIGHTING.

274
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,898
YOUNG MAN,
ARE YOU GOING TO REFUSE

275
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,525
TO BE MY WORTHY ADVERSARY?

276
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,152
IN THAT CASE,

277
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,113
I HAVE TO RESORT
TO A HARDER APPROACH.

278
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:44,212
(Crickets chirping)

279
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,796
Shirin:
WE SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT HERE.

280
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,923
SHIRIN,

281
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,050
WHAT DO WE DO
FROM THIS POINT ON?

282
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,968
WE'RE GONNA HEAD
TO THE RENDEZVOUS POINT

283
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,137
THAT KLAUS AND I
DECIDED ON IN ADVANCE.

284
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,181
I'LL GO SEE HOW THINGS ARE.

285
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,476
YOU AND THE CHILDREN CAN GO WAIT
AT THE CABIN OVER THERE.

286
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,228
SHIRIN!

287
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,940
YOU CAN'T EVEN CARRY A GUN
SO YOU'LL JUST BE A LIABILITY.

288
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,691
STAY AND LOOK AFTER
THE CHILDREN.

289
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,361
(Gasps)

290
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,528
MARINA.

291
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,738
I'M FIGHTING,

292
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,199
AND KATHARON IS FIGHTING, TOO.

293
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,138
SAJI.

294
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,313
Saji:
I'LL FIGHT.

295
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,899
I'LL DO IT TO BRING LOUISE BACK,

296
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,902
BUT I'M GONNA FIGHT
MY OWN BATTLE!

297
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,792
LIEUTENANT PERIES HAS SIDED
WITH CELESTIAL BEING.

298
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,171
EXACTLY HOW LONG HAS MY FATHER
BEEN BETRAYING OUR MILITARY?

299
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,719
SAJI.

300
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,138
(Sobbing)
SAJI.

301
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,477
(Thinking)
WARRANT OFFICER. YOU'RE UNABLE
TO CLOSE OFF YOUR FEELINGS.

302
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,605
THEN I'LL HAVE TO DO THAT
FOR YOU

303
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,024
SO YOU GET WHAT YOU HOPE FOR.

304
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,568
YOU GET WHAT YOU
REALLY DESIRE.

305
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,487
SO, MORE THAN HALF OF
OUR MOBILE SUITS WERE DESTROYED,

306
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,033
AND ON TOP OF THAT, CAPTAIN
REVIVAL WAS TAKEN PRISONER?

307
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,160
SOUNDS LIKE THE FAMOUS
LICENSE HOLDERS

308
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,037
AREN'T LIVING UP TO
THEIR REPUTATION.

309
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,998
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
OUR METHODS, NOW, DO YOU?

310
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,626
THERE WAS A METHOD TO THIS MESS?

311
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,380
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET US HANDLE
THE NEXT OPERATION ON OUR OWN.

312
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,008
WELL WELL,
AREN'T YOU THE BIG TALKER!

313
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,178
I MUST SAY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO YOUR NEXT BATTLE.

314
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,721
(Grunts)
ROGER.

315
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,602
SORRY I'M LATE.

316
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,854
SO THIS IS
ONE OF THE INNOVATORS?

317
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,273
YES, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

318
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,859
YOU CAN REMOVE
YOUR HELMET NOW.

319
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,117
(Gasps)

320
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,496
GREETINGS TO YOU ALL,
MEMBERS OF CELESTIAL BEING.

321
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,706
MY NAME IS REVIVE REVIVAL.

322
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,666
I AM AN INNOVATOR.

323
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:32,880
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TALK
TO US ABOUT THE INNOVATORS?

324
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,132
ANEW.

325
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,761
HUH?

326
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,098
ANEW, YOU'RE STEERING US AWAY
FROM THE PLANNED COURSE.

327
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,141
GET BACK ON TRACK.

328
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,436
HUH?!

329
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,896
ANEW!

330
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,606
MISS RETURNER, NO!

331
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,358
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

332
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,735
WHAT AM I DOING?

333
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,823
I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

334
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,451
SEEING AS HOW I AM
AN INNOVATOR.

335
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,702
(Gasps)

336
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,621
(Gunshot)

337
00:20:05,621 --> 00:21:34,710
♪

338
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,218
I AM THE BEST SUITED TO
PILOT THE 00 GUNDAM.

339
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,803
YOU THINK SO TOO, DON'T YOU,
REGENE?

340
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,556
WHY OF COURSE, RIBBONS.

341
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,142
HMM. INDEED,
YOU THINK SO SUCH THING.

342
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,360
Liu Mei:
STILL NO RESPONSE FROM
THE PTOLEMAIOS?

343
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,444
NOTHING YET.

344
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,447
I SEE.

345
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,659
IF I CAN GET VEDA'S LOCATION
TO CELESTIAL BEING,

346
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,204
IT SHOULD THROW THE
INNOVATORS' PLANS INTO DISARRAY.

347
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,415
ONCE MORE,
THE WORLD WILL CHANGE.

348
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,416
Hong Long:
MY MISTRESS!

349
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,543
WHAT IS IT?

350
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,627
THE SHIP'S STEERING.

351
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,046
THE CONTROLS ARE LOCKED.

352
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,464
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE.

353
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,299
WHAT'S GOING ON?

354
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,553
I'M NOT SURE, BUT ALL OF
OUR SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN ERASED!

355
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,720
AT THIS RATE!

356
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,139
OH HEAVENS!
VEDA'S INTERVENING!

357
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,099
(Slap)

358
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,727
(Stunned gasp)

359
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,146
YOUR MISCHIEF HAS GONE TOO FAR.

360
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,066
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF YOU DO IT AGAIN.

361
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,526
DON'T YOU?

362
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,444
(Gasps)

363
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,946
(Growls)

364
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,614
Hong Long:
THE CONTROLS ARE FROZEN!

365
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,242
WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE NOW!
GET THE SHUTTLE READY!

366
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,952
I CAN'T DO IT!
NONE OF THE SHIP'S SYSTEMS

367
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,579
ARE RESPONDING ANYMORE!

368
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,329
(Nena giggling)

369
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,747
NENA?

370
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,125
Liu Mei:
NENA TRINITY? CAN YOU HEAR ME?

371
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,835
WE CAN'T CONTROL
THE SHIP'S SYSTEMS!

372
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,253
PLEASE COME AND HELP US!

373
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,713
Nena:
(Laughing)

374
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,172
YOU DUMMY!

375
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,509
I ALREADY KNOW THAT,
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE DOING IT!

376
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,261
YOU'RE...YOU'RE THE ONE?!

377
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,139
Hong Long:
THE MONITOR!

378
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,308
MY MISTRESS!

379
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:16,145
Nena:
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING,
AND YET YOU WANT EVEN MORE.

380
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,318
BUT ON THE INSIDE,
YOU'RE HOLLOW.

381
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,988
YOU KNOW,

382
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:31,535
I'VE ALWAYS HATED YOU FOR THAT!

383
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,203
THAT'S WHY I THINK,

384
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,205
YOU'D BE BETTER OFF DEAD!

385
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,419
(Gasps)

386
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,796
(Nena laughing)

387
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,342
BUT I'M
SUPPOSED TO SEE...

388
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,218
LIU MEI!

389
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,220
THE WORLD REFORMATION!

390
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,931
(Laughing)

391
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,100
THIS IS THE GREATEST!

392
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,477
I CAN'T STAND IT!

393
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:02,483
(Laughing)

394
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,532
Narrator:
ANEW, WHO HAS AWAKENED
AS AN INNOVATOR,

395
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,826
ATTEMPTS TO STEAL THE 00.

396
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,663
NEXT EPISODE:
"ANEW RETURNS".

397
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,790
SHOULD SHE RETURN TO
WHERE SHE COMES FROM,

398
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,958
OR TO THE MAN SHE LOVES?
