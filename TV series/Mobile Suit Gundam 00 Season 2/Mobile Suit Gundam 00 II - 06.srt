AZADISTAN IS...

EVERYTHING'S BURNING!

BUT WHY IS AZADISTAN... WHY?!

THE SCALE...

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,644
NOT TERRORISTS.

00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,029
IS IT HIM?!

Al‐Saachez:
THAT'S RIGHT!

HEY, POINT THAT LIGHT
THE OTHER WAY.

YOU MADE IT THROUGH OKAY.

YEAH, SOMEHOW.

32
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,122

00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,791
WELL, YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF.

34
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,334

THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

40

THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

HOW DO I KNOW THAT?!

THEY'RE MY BUDDIES!

47

WE WERE JUST LAUGHING IT UP,
MINUTES AGO!

I HEAR YOU.

00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,194
I WONDER.

51
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
WHO DID TELL THE A‐LAWS?

I...I JUST‐‐

57
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,593
SO YOU CAUSED THIS.

58
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,846
WHO ARE YOU REALLY?
AN A‐LAWS SPY?

59

NO!
I'M NOT!

WELL, SAJI CROSSROAD,

63
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,521
LET'S HEAR YOUR EXPLANATION.

00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,522
(Nervous grunt)

65
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,944
JUST TERRIBLE.

66
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,155
DID THEY HAVE TO BE
SO RUTHLESS?

67
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,281
DAMN A‐LAWS.

68
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,740
MILEINA, DON'T LOOK.

69
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,285
OH, ALL RIGHT,
THEN.

70
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,538
WE LIVE FOR HIS SAKE,
AND WE DIE FOR HIS SAKE.

71
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,831
IF THIS IS TO BE MY FATE‐‐

(Shocked gasp)
IF THIS IS TO BE MY FATE‐‐

00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,460
IF THIS IS
TO BE MY FATE,

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,295
IT IS POINTLESS TO RESIST IT.

75
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,178
Emilio:
WE LIVE FOR HIS SAKE...

76
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,013
IT'S POSSIBLE
THEY COULD BE FRIENDLIES.

77
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,723
Emilio:
AND WE DIE FOR HIS SAKE.

78

00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,562
Emilio:
IF THIS IS TO BE MY FATE,
IT IS POINTLESS TO RESIST IT.

80
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,980
THEY WEREN'T ENEMIES!

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,774
Emilio:
WE TRAVEL A ROAD
WE CANNOT SEE,

82
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,527
AND WHAT LIES
AT THE END OF THE ROAD

83
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,279
IS THE END OF LIFE.

84
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,116
AND ALL OF THIS
IS THE GUIDANCE OF GOD.

85
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,536
(Gasps)

86
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,121
EMILIO.

87
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,458
(Sobs)
EMILIO!

88
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,459
(Dizzy sigh)

89
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,335
HUH?
HUH?

90
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,586
H‐HEY!

91
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,046
MISS SUMERAGI,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

92
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,547
MISS SUMERAGI?

93
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,341
(Slaps face)

94
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,967
HOW COULD YOU?

95
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,386
HOW COULD YOU DO
SOMETHING SO FOOLISH?!

96
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,680
I DIDN'T THINK SOMETHING
LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,557
I DIDN'T THINK...

98
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,602
I JUST WANTED TO GET AS FAR AS
POSSIBLE FROM THE FIGHTING!

99
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,187
NOTHING LIKE THIS.

100
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,272
THIS WASN'T WHAT I‐‐

101
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,733
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOOK
THEIR LIVES, YOU KNOW!

102
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,901
(Shocked gasp)

103
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,736
THROUGH YOUR OWN
FOOLISH ACTIONS!

104
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,196
"OH, I'M DIFFERENT.

105
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,822
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

106
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,950
IT'S ALL HAPPENING
IN A DIFFERENT WORLD."

107
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,743
IGNORING REALITY LIKE THAT

108
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,246
IS JUST A KIND OF
INADVERTENT MALICE.

109
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,206
AND THEN
THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN!

110
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,917
(Sobbing)

111
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,919
I DIDN'T...

112
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,963
MEAN FOR THIS.

113
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,632
(Weeping)

114
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,133
TIERIA‐‐

115
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,134
SETSUNA.

116
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,594
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

117
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,720
OUT THERE?

118
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,640
IT WAS THE WORK
OF THE A‐LAWS.

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,809
AND IT ALL HAPPENED
BECAUSE OF HIM.

120
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,310
(Weeping)

121
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,312
SAJI CROSSROAD.

122
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,445
YOU DIDN'T GO BACK
TO AZADISTAN?

123
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,115
(Sobs)
SHIRIN! AZADISTAN IS...

124
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,285
OUR HOMELAND...
OUR HOMELAND IS...

125
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,120
AZADISTAN?

126
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,129
Rindt:
ALTHOUGH WE LOST TWO OF
OUR UNITS

127
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,298
THANKS TO
THE MEDDLING OF THE GUNDAMS,

128
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:25,135
WE DID SUCCEED IN SMASHING THE
SECRET BASE OF THE DISSIDENTS.

129
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,720
THIS IS SURE TO EARN US
BOTH COMMENDATIONS,

130
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,305
COLONEL MANNEQUIN.

131
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,306
OH, SHUT UP.

132
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,473
OH.

133
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,517
YOU DON'T CARE FOR
MOPPING‐UP OPERATIONS.

134
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,477
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM.

135
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,646
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU ENJOY MURDERING PEOPLE?!

136
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,108
WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO WORKED UP
ABOUT THIS OPERATION?

137
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,446
YOU'VE DONE THINGS SIMILAR TO
THIS IN THE PAST, HAVEN'T YOU?

138
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,655
GOODNESS ME,

139
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,366
THERE WAS THAT
ONE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT.

140
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,703
FALSE INFORMATION LEADING TO
A BATTLE BETWEEN ALLIES.

141
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,121
I BELIEVE AT THE TIME

142
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,582
YOU WERE A TACTICAL FORECASTER
FOR THE AEU.

143
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,792
SHUT UP!

144
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,503
RAISING YOUR HAND
AGAINST AN ALLY ONCE AGAIN?

145
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,340
I WOULD NEVER FEEL LIKE
PARTICIPATING IN A WAR AGAIN

146
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,091
AFTER AN EXPERIENCE
LIKE THAT.

147
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,553
SO, I HAVE TROUBLE
UNDERSTANDING WHY.

148
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,431
(Clears throat)

149
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,143
IT'S AN HONOR WORKING WITH YOU,
COLONEL MANNEQUIN.

150
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,110
Tieria:
AZADISTAN WAS ATTACKED?

151
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,654
WAS IT THE FEDERATION?

152
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,572
I'M NOT SURE.

153
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,575
BUT AMONG THE MOBILE SUITS
THAT MADE THE ATTACK,

154
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,369
THERE WAS A GUNDAM.

155
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,787
THERE WAS A GUNDAM?

156
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,748
YOU KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS.

157
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,999
(Allelujah gasps)

158
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,501
IT APPEARS THAT
MISS SUMERAGI FAINTED.

159
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,502
SHE WHAT?

160
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,503
WHAT HAPPENED?

161
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,754
I DON'T KNOW.

162
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,714
BUT WE HAVE ORDERS TO
RETURN TO THE PTOLEMY.

163
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,384
ALL RIGHT.
HEAD BACK.

164
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,551
YOU'RE COMING.

165
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,969
IF WE LEAVE YOU HERE,

166
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,138
YOU MIGHT BE IN
SERIOUS DANGER.

167
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,728
MOST OF THE MAJOR FACILITIES
IN THE CITIES

168
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,772
WERE REDUCED TO RUBBLE.

169
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:05,276
THERE ARE NO FUNCTIONING POLICE
OR ARMY PERSONNEL LEFT.

170
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,738
BUT EVEN SO,
MY COUNTRY NEEDS ME.

171
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,907
RASA ENTRUSTED ME WITH IT!

172
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,827
COMING BACK HERE
WAS A GOOD IDEA.

173
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,080
(Gasps)
SETSUNA INSISTED.

174
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,540
THEN WE SHOULD
THANK HIM FOR THAT.

175
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,791
FOR WHAT?!

176
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,376
I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY LIFE!

177
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,169
FOR AZADISTAN
I WOULD GLADLY...

178
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,295
GIVE MY...

179
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,465
(Sobs)

180
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,550
MARINA.

181
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,721
(Marina crying)

182
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,890
CELESTIAL BEING SAYS

183
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,767
IT'LL PROVIDE YOU WITH
ANY FOOD OR SUPPLIES

184
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,186
YOU MIGHT REQUIRE
IN GETTING OUT OF HERE.

185
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,272
UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY GET
SET UP IN ANOTHER BASE,

186
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,065
WE'LL PROVIDE YOU
WITH PROTECTION.

187
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,442
IS THAT RIGHT?

188
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,696
TELL THEM THAT WE APPRECIATE
THEIR ASSISTANCE.

189
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:54,075
JUST WHO WAS IT THAT LEAKED
THE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BASE?

190
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,077
I'M THE SPY AND
YOU'RE ASKING ME THAT?

191
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,167
Liu Mei:
HOW VERY KIND OF
THE REBORN CELESTIAL BEING.

192
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,170
I WONDER WHO COULD BE
INFLUENCING THEM.

193
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,546
MY MISTRESS,

194
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,173
LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS.

195
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,633
I'M GOING TO HAVE
NENA TRINITY DO IT.

196
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,302
WHY'S THAT?

197
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,512
CAN YOU USE
QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES?

198
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,431
I DON'T.

199
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,558
Liu‐Mei:
IN ORDER TO DECEIVE
THE INNOVATORS,

200
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,312
THAT GIRL'S ABILITIES
ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.

201
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,023
YOU'RE SIMPLY NOT IN
THE SAME LEAGUE, HONG LONG.

202
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,024
OR RATHER,

203
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,151
ELDER BROTHER.

204
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,823
IS HE RIGHT?

205
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,702
AM I NO DIFFERENT FROM HIM?

206
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,746
Feldt:
DUE TO A MENTAL SHOCK
OF SOME KIND,

207
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,915
SHE'S TEMPORARILY UNCONSCIOUS.

208
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,084
GIVE HER SOME TIME AND
SHE SHOULD WAKE UP ON HER OWN.

209
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,504
WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED
TO MISS SUMERAGI?

210
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,089
I DON'T KNOW.

211
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,548
BUT ONE THING
I DO KNOW IS THAT

212
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,427
IT WAS SOMEHOW TRIGGERED BY
THIS LATEST MASSACRE.

213
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,554
EMILIO.

214
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,599
I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN
YOUR TACTICAL FORECASTS.

215
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,351
YOU EACH MADE
YOUR TACTICAL PREDICTIONS

216
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,186
BASED ON FALSE INFORMATION.

217
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,813
AND AS A RESULT,

218
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,981
ALLIED SOLDIERS WOUND UP
FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER.

219
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,983
I RESPECT YOUR EFFORTS A LOT.

220
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,568
YOU FACE THE REALITY OF WAR

221
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,862
AND TRY HARD TO BRING IT
TO AN EARLIER CONCLUSION.

222
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,030
IT WAS JUST A CASE OF YOU

223
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,699
DOING YOUR JOBS TOO WELL,
MANNEQUIN,

224
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,243
MY DEAR EMILIO.

225
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,118
Officer:
KUJO.

226
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,286
(Shocked gasp)

227
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,543
(Thinking)
THE GUNDAMS' TACTICS ARE
JUST LIKE HER STYLE!

228
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,294
COULD KUJO BE...

229
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,638
(Rapid gunfire)

230
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,265
WAS IT JUST...

231
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,935
NO, THAT IS WHAT
A REAL BATTLEFIELD LOOKS LIKE.

232
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,144
HUH?

233
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,150
A CODED MESSAGE
FROM THE COLONEL?

234
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,531
WHY IS IT IN A FORMAT USED ONLY
BY THE OLD CHOBU TEAM?

235
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,533
Sergei:
I'M SORRY FOR
GETTING THIS MESSAGE TO YOU

236
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,368
IN SUCH A COMPLICATED WAY,

237
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,954
BUT I DIDN'T WANT THE A‐LAWS
TO TAKE NOTICE.

238
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,247
I HEARD YOU WERE INVOLVED

239
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,249
IN THE KATHARON
ELIMINATION MISSION.

240
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,376
I'M AFRAID I'M THE ONE
WHO HAS TO APOLOGIZE

241
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,587
FOR WHAT TRANSPIRED
IN CONNECTION WITH THAT.

242
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,046
APOLOGIZE?

243
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,464
HUH?

244
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,758
THAT MOPPING‐UP OPERATION
WAS CARRIED OUT

245
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,719
BECAUSE OF INFORMATION
THE COLONEL OBTAINED?

246
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,345
THAT'S AWFUL.

247
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,181
THE COLONEL MUST BE
FILLED WITH REGRET RIGHT NOW,

248
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,310
AND YET HE'S STILL WORRIED ABOUT
HOW I'M FEELING.

249
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,023
YOU'D LIKE TO ADOPT ME, SIR?

250
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,274
YES, BUT...

251
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,526
ONLY WITH YOUR APPROVAL,
OF COURSE.

252
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,527
(Gasps)

253
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,070
BUT I JUST‐‐

254
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,739
I GUESS SOMA SMIRNOV
MAY NOT EXACTLY BE

255
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,449
THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF NAMES.

256
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,200
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

257
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,536
BUT... BUT SIR,

258
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,914
I GUESS I WOULD FEEL
A LITTLE LONELY

259
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,957
LOSING THE NAME PERIES.

260
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,710
ARE YOU FOND OF THAT NAME?

261
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,046
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
FORGET THAT PEOPLE

262
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,298
USED TO CALL ME BY THAT NAME.

263
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:01,429
(Sniffles)

264
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,973
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COLONEL.

265
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,975
THANKS TO YOU, SIR,
I'VE BEEN REMINDED THAT

266
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,353
I AM SUPER SOLDIER NUMBER ONE
OF THE SUPERHUMAN

267
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,146
SPECIAL DUTY INSTITUTE.

268
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,691
I'M A WEAPON,
A TOOL FOR KILLING PEOPLE.

269
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,611
I DON'T DESERVE TO
KNOW HAPPINESS!

270
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,112
(Teary gasp)

271
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,824
Rindt:
YOU SCREWED UP,
COLONEL SMIRNOV.

272
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,702
YOU ALLOWED
THE KATHARON MEMBER TO ESCAPE.

273
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,162
WITH HIM GONE,

274
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,497
THERE WAS NO POINT IN
HAVING US COME OUT HERE!

275
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,498
(Grunts)

276
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,749
COLONEL!

277
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,209
HE'S A SUPERIOR OFFICER!

278
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,961
AND WE ARE MEMBERS OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S

279
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,088
AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE.

280
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,965
DON'T THINK THAT OUR RANKS
ARE THE SAME

281
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,716
AS THOSE OF
THE FEDERATION FORCES.

282
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,343
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

283
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,012
I ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

284
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,555
YOU SHALL REMAIN ON DUTY UNTIL

285
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,808
OUR SUPERIORS DECIDE
THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THIS.

286
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,934
SIR.

287
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,815
HMM.

288
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,322
ATTACK ON AZADISTAN.

289
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,284
FEDERATION SETS OUT TO
REORGANIZE MIDDLE EAST.

290
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:05,994
HUH?

291
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,537
AH, LOOK!

292
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,664
THEY REALLY DID A NUMBER HERE!

293
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,416
WHATEVER! WHATEVER!

294
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,750
ALL RIGHT!

295
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,502
IT'S TIME TO GET TO WORK!

296
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,142
Zinin:
CAPTAIN BARACK ZININ
AND TEAM MEMBERS

297
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,893
REPORTING FOR
RESERVE DUTY, MA'AM.

298
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,104
I'M KATI MANNEQUIN.

299
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,565
CAPTAIN, WHY DID YOU
JOIN THE A‐LAWS?

300
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,316
MA'AM!
I VOLUNTEERED TO BECOME

301
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,693
THE FOUNDATION OF
THE UNITED WORLD

302
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,819
WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD.

303
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,279
AND YOU HAVE NO REGRETS?

304
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,321
NONE, MA'AM.

305
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,489
I SEE.

306
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,541
HOW'S MISS SUMERAGI DOING?

307
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,168
SHE HASN'T WOKEN UP.

308
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,795
SHE MAY NEED TO STAY IN BED
FOR A WHILE.

309
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,756
SO, WHAT'S THE LATEST
ON KATHARON?

310
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,592
I'LL PUT IT ON THE MONITOR.

311
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:07,638
Mileina:
THE KATHARON MEMBERS WILL BEGIN
EVACUATING AT 1200 AS PLANNED.

312
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,599
THE A‐LAWS WILL BE BACK.

313
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,808
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

314
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,851
WE KNOW THAT.

315
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,394
WE'LL SEND OUT THE GUNDAMS.

316
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,313
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR STRATEGY?

317
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,565
IN THIS SITUATION,
WITH MISS SUMERAGI UNCONSCIOUS‐‐

318
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,609
Lasse:
EVEN SO,
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

319
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,319
WE'LL MOVE PTOLEMY
OVER TO THE COASTLINE.

320
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,780
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
THE ENEMY DETECTS ONLY US.

321
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,697
Mileina:
ROGER THAT!

322
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,282
PTOLEMAOIS, TAKING OFF.

323
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,130
HUH?

324
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,394
IN RETALIATION FOR THE
AUTONOMOUS PEACEKEEPING FORCE'S

325
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,189
SUPPRESSION OPERATION AGAINST
THE DISSIDENT GROUP,

326
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,483
ACTS OF TERRORISM
