1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,172
I feel that I understand...

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,508
...why Aeolia Schenberg
created the Gundams.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,553
Or rather, why he created
the GN Drives.

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:13,931
What...?

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,351
The armed interventions were to
prepare for this.

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:21,480
Aeolia's goal was to guide
humanity to reformation.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,649
And so...

8
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,983
I'm going...

9
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,944
I'm going to change and
reform myself.

10
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,528
Reformation?

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,908
Are you saying that's the ultimate
mystery which you've mastered?

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,456
Celestial Being will return soon.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,083
When that time comes...

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,461
...I ask that you please grant me
the opportunity to fight them again.

15
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,381
For revenge?

16
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:52,344
What I seek is the ultimate mystery
which only true warriors can attain.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,018
That young man once said
that I was twisted...

18
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,564
But even he is also someone who
can do nothing but fight.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,942
And that is why I desire
nothing more...

20
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,736
...than to fight you!

21
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,618
For the ultimate victory!

22
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,203
All you desire is victory?

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,080
What else is there?!

24
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,665
It's obvious...!

25
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,627
A tomorrow that links us...

26
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,878
...to the future!

27
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,513
Apologies for taking your life!

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,684
You caught my blade?!

29
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,648
This is my way of fighting!

30
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,261
F‐Fight me, young man...!

31
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:23,644
Cut me down, and seize the
victory you so richly deserve!

32
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,694
Why? Why won't you
finish me off?

33
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,364
I...will live.

34
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,367
I'll live and seize tomorrow!

35
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,661
That is... my way of fighting.

36
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,290
And you... must also fight to live.

37
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,384
Saji. Where's Louise
Halevy's machine?

38
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,886
There's no signal.
She must have withdrawn.

39
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,179
I see...

40
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,598
‐ Thank you.
‐ For what?

41
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,684
I just felt it's something
I should say.

42
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,650
So you've awakened as a
purebred type, Setsuna F. Seiei?

43
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,737
The power you have obtained
holds the fate of humanity.

44
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,868
There's no need to
make someone sad

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,621
It's all right
if you can't smile

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,708
That's what she said
with downcast eyes

47
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:35,715
I wept into the night

48
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:42,889
Freezing in the chilly clinginess

49
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,768
Reality keeps raining
down on us

50
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,980
No umbrella can
shut it out

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,695
To go on living is to fight

52
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,449
I was trapped for
merely that reason

53
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,535
My heart My story

54
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:08,373
I can see beyond
the tears

55
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,959
It's dazzling

56
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,711
Through a small window

57
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,713
Just like in those days

58
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,799
We can see the blue sky

59
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,009
ah ah

60
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,763
Although we can't
fly like the birds

61
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:33,231
When I made someone sad

62
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,859
The pain that I felt

63
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,779
I gently closed my eyes
so I wouldn't forget

64
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,158
And I wept

65
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,669
You found out Veda's location?!

66
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,256
Yeah. I got the information
from Wang Liu Mei.

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,217
So Veda has been found...

68
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,429
Crypt‐analysis of the data is complete.

69
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,932
It's at point CZ9842R.

70
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,642
The dark side of the moon!

71
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,728
Mileina, focus the super
long‐range camera on that point.

72
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,938
Roger!

73
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,397
Lagrange Two...

74
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,317
That's an area where they're not
even developing any colonies.

75
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,152
The perfect place to hide, I'd say.

76
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,737
I'm showing that location now!

77
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,616
There's nothing there.

78
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,869
Superimpose the star map for our
current location over this image.

79
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,204
Right away!

80
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,832
Hm? What's this?

81
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,252
The positions of the stars are off...

82
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,003
Optically camouflaged.

83
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,798
Feldt, calculate the area
of the discrepancy.

84
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,799
Roger.

85
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,717
The area...

86
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,178
A‐A diameter of fifteen kilometers!

87
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,930
Fifteen kilometers?!

88
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,224
Something they need to
hide so expansively is...

89
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,726
On the dark side of the moon.

90
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,779
Miss Sumeragi. It's an encoded message
from our lab's transport ship!

91
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,780
Mom!

92
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,448
The new equipment is here!

93
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,919
The Autonomous Peacekeeping Force, A‐LAWS,
is using all available resources...

94
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,172
...to commence an annihilation
operation against Celestial Being...

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,011
By defeating them, the last stronghold
of the anti‐government forces...

96
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,806
...we shall create a united
world and earn true peace.

97
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,517
I expect every one of you
to do your best.

98
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,857
Twenty‐one cruisers and
108 mobile suits.

99
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,943
This much fighting
strength can't lose...

100
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,944
General.

101
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,780
The license holders have moved
away from the fleet, sir.

102
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,532
Never mind them.

103
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,993
At least they won't interfere
with our operation.

104
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,665
Ribbons gave us the order to return...

105
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,293
Has he finally decided
to go it on his own?

106
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,420
Nope, this is all
according to plan.

107
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,840
Because the event that's to
come will be drawing nearer.

108
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,927
Louise Halevy...

109
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,897
Revenge for your family?!
I'm doing the same thing!

110
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,358
Don't act like you're
the only one suffering!

111
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,823
Serves you right.

112
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,039
We brought along everything that
could help out in the battle.

113
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,874
Upgrade parts for each
of the Gundams...

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,293
...as well as supplies
for Ptolemy!

115
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,923
You even brought 0 Gundam!

116
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,927
We attached a particle storage tank,
so it can fight for a limited launch!

117
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,304
Great! Let's hurry and get it on board!

118
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,263
Right!

119
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,895
A fleet is gathering at the point
Wang Liu Mei indicated for us.

120
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,980
Then there's no mistake.

121
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,816
That's definitely where Veda is.

122
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,110
And also the Innovators' headquarters.

123
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,279
We'll break through the A‐LAWS
fleet and recover Veda.

124
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,907
This will be a fierce battle
like none before.

125
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,914
I'm going. In order to fight
my own battle.

126
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,624
Saji...?

127
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,877
I've made up my mind.
No more hesitation.

128
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,380
Allow me to take part in this, too.

129
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,090
Soma Peries...

130
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,343
I also have my reasons
for joining you.

131
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,638
That's right.

132
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,268
Though our goals may differ, we all
have a reason to head out there.

133
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,855
It's because those feelings are
connected to the future.

134
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,819
All of us here...are fighting
for the future.

135
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,120
To liberate all humanity from
the control of the Innovators.

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,041
To make this a world where anomalies
like Soma Peries and myself...

137
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,751
...are never again created.

138
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,756
My mission is to overthrow the
Federation Government.

139
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,092
And shoot down the Innovators.
And also...

140
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,053
We'll change.

141
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,265
If we don't, we'll never face the future.

142
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,309
Setsuna...

143
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,898
Ptolemy will depart as soon as we've
finished resupplying. All right?

144
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,484
Yeah.

145
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,737
But Ptolemy doesn't have a
helmsman right now...

146
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,658
‐ You've got one right here.
‐ Lasse!

147
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,202
Can you do it?!

148
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,995
Of course I can do it!

149
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,504
Let's go.

150
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,673
To the other side of the moon.

151
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,016
Princess Marina, look at all the stars!

152
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
Indeed. They're so beautiful.

153
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,232
Children, behave yourselves, please.

154
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,733
Okay!

155
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,365
Setsuna...

156
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,994
The A‐LAWS are assembling
a fleet at Lagrange Two?

157
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,038
That's the report from Jean One.

158
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,124
It seems Celestial Being intends
to go there as well.

159
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,586
We've received the very same information
from the coup d'Ãˆtat faction.

160
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,172
They also sent a detailed
tactical plan.

161
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,139
Our forces are ready and the
deployment's complete, Colonel.

162
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,522
The time has come to pass judgment.

163
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,568
Will it be Setsuna F. Seiei, who
has awakened as a purebred type...

164
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,986
...or will it be us?

165
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,614
The fate of humanity will be
decided by one or the other.

166
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,158
And that's fine by us.

167
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,792
The way of Bushido...

168
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,050
To find the right moment to die...

169
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,554
And you... must also fight to live.

170
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,142
The way of Bushido...

171
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,482
The super long‐range camera...

172
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,192
...has detected the enemy fleet!

173
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,236
All hands, to primary battle stations!

174
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,659
Setsuna.

175
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,828
Yes, Feldt?

176
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,748
Take this.

177
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,875
A flower...

178
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,252
Apparently, Mrs. Linda
grew this in the lab.

179
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,047
I'd like you to have it.

180
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,051
Thanks, Feldt.

181
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,511
I hope Miss Marina
won't be upset by this.

182
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,015
We don't have that kind
of relationship.

183
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,100
‐ I'm going to my Gundam now.
‐ Uh...

184
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,062
Please don't die, Setsuna!

185
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,272
Roger that.

186
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,946
Ptolemy, opening all hatches!

187
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,577
No matter what it takes,
I will recover Veda.

188
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,372
Guide me in what I
have to do... Lockon.

189
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,958
Mr. Erde, we're counting
on you to win!

190
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,792
Roger!

191
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,211
Seravee, Tieria Erde, launching!

192
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,301
Are you all set, Soma Peries?

193
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,679
‐ You can call me Marie.
‐ Huh?

194
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,723
It's okay if you want to
call me that.

195
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,141
However, I'm still...

196
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,518
I understand.

197
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,482
Archer Arios, Allelujah Haptism,
Soma Peries, flying to the target!

198
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,408
Cherudim, take‐off
preparations complete!

199
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,995
Anew...I'm gonna do it.

200
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,706
Cherudim, Lockon Stratos,
targeted and firing!

201
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:13,292
I gazed at the far‐off sky

202
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,715
Are you really okay
with this, Saji?

203
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,675
Please, don't worry about it.

204
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,344
I'm with you...I wanna
find the future!

205
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,305
Roger.

206
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,183
00, Setsuna F. Seiei, launching!

207
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,689
0‐Raiser, Saji Crossroad.
I'm taking off!

208
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,945
Haro, switch the 0‐Raiser
to docking mode!

209
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,530
0‐Raiser, docking mode.

210
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,878
The Gundams have launched from
their spaceship, sir.

211
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,130
Deploy advance force and
commence attack!

212
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,508
Don't fail me...
special duty ships.

213
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,974
We're to divert the enemy forces!

214
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,142
Go!

215
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,528
Now releasing all
compressed particles!

216
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,647
These new weapons
are pretty awesome!

217
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,491
What's this? The enemy ships are...

218
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,328
The enemy ships aren't slowing down!

219
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,287
They're ramming us!

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,461
Setsuna, use the Raiser Sword!

221
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,295
Roger!

222
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,297
Activating the Raiser System!

223
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,051
Trans‐Am Raiser!

224
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,037
Particle disruption?!

225
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,085
An anti‐field has been deployed
over a wide area!

226
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,380
‐ Particle beam effectiveness is diminished.
‐ Was it a trap?!

227
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,341
We're lucky that this thing wasn't
deployed at point‐blank range!

228
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,343
Change course! Get us
out of this field!

229
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,726
They dealt with that faster
than I expected.

230
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,686
Main forces, begin your attack!

231
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,688
Overwhelm them with our numbers!

232
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,331
Setsuna! The particle beams...!

233
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,082
Yeah, I know!

234
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,678
I'm starting to run
out of missiles!

235
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
There are just too many enemies!

236
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,438
Incoming!

237
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,612
Tieria!

238
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,701
They broke through!

239
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,387
Portside's been hit!

240
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,888
The damage is...

241
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,954
Damn it, are they gonna
bully us to death?!

242
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,168
Incoming enemy machines!

243
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,392
Wh‐What the...?!

244
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,436
So they came after all!

245
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,938
Katharon!

246
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,482
Provide support for
Celestial Being!

247
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,370
Reinforcements?!

248
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,456
Is that Katharon?

249
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,584
Good of you to show up!

250
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,044
Great timing, guys!

251
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,968
Katharon's weapons work...

252
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,596
They predicted the use
of an anti‐field.

253
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,057
If that's the case... Steer
Ptolemy at the enemy fleet!

254
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,934
What's this? Katharon?

255
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,604
As if their strength will
make a difference...

256
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,856
General! They have one
of our transports!

257
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,483
One of ours?!

258
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,068
Incoming particle beam!

259
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,194
What?!

260
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,745
A word of warning to
the A‐LAWS fleet.

261
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,375
We hereby rise up against you.

262
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,127
As a puppet of the misgoverning
Federation, the A‐LAWS...

263
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,921
...are no longer a military!

264
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,176
The future of the world can be decided
only by the will of the people!

265
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:42,515
We shall charge you for your barbarity,
and the people will pass judgment on you!

266
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,146
That damned bitch...!

267
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,692
Strike them down! They're all
anti‐government forces!

268
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,692
Roger!

269
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,824
Enemy forces are
approaching, ma'am!

270
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,742
Mobile suit teams,
begin your assault!

271
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,830
Colasour the Indestructible...

272
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,624
...is here to save the day!

273
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,099
It's just one transport,
what are you doing?!

274
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,602
It's hiding behind our own
ships. We can't attack it!

275
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,147
We don't need allies
that can't move!

276
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,107
Take them out together with
the enemy ship!

277
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,526
‐ They're our own soldiers!
‐ Never mind them, just fire!

278
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,446
General, the enemy ship has
broken through the anti‐field!

279
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,488
What?!

280
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,244
G‐Gundam!

281
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,039
00‐Raiser, eliminating the target!

282
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,919
Do something!!

283
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,199
Just as flowers sway and
dance in the wind

284
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,826
Just as the rain
nurtures the earth

285
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:30,456
All things in the world
help each other to live on

286
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:35,544
Then why do people
hurt one another?

287
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:41,634
Why do we have
to say farewell?

288
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,678
Even if you go far away

289
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,598
The center of my heart is still

290
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,936
Full of memories of
your gentle smile

291
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:57,024
The pieces of you
that I embraced

292
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,196
Even if it hurts, I can
still connect with them

293
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,782
I believe that we will
see each other again

294
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,742
I'm waiting for your love

295
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,620
I love you

296
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,206
I trust you

297
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:17,753
I want you to share your
loneliness with me

298
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,422
I love you

299
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,967
I trust you

300
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:27,846
Either in light or
in darkness

301
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,475
Because it's you and me

302
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,772
We can believe
in each other

303
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,734
Please don't let go

304
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,575
‐ Wow!
‐ Awesome!

305
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,494
Klaus and the others will have
joined the battle by now.

306
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,872
Those are the lights of battle...

307
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,378
It looks like they've broken
through the A‐LAWS fleet.

308
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,881
Humanity seems to have a real
fondness for fighting.

309
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,843
Aren't you the one who put
them up to it, though?

310
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,805
You are the one who's been
guiding them here.

311
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,933
That's also what you wish,
as far as I understand.

312
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,934
What?

313
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,814
I told you... I'm a superior
being to all of you.

314
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,191
You could even say that
I'm your creator.

315
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,028
And that is why...

316
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,363
Your thoughts, so consumed
with ambition...

317
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,993
...have been coming straight to
me via quantum brainwaves.

318
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,165
Too bad, isn't it, Regene Regetta?

319
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,964
Ribbons Almark!!

320
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,978
It's me. I'm the one.

321
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,066
The one who will guide
humanity is me...

322
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,903
Regene Regetta!

323
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,867
