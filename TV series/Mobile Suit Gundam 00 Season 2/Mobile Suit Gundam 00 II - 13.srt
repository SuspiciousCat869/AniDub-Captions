1
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,221
Operator:
WE HAVE VISUAL
ON THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

2
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,349
WE'LL BE WITHIN STRIKING
RANGE SHORTLY, SIR.

3
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,351
WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS
OF THE SECOND FLEET?

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,479
IT'S APPROACHING
ITS DESIGNATED POINT NOW, SIR

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,606
VERY GOOD.
AS SOON AS IT REACHES POSITION,

6
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,441
THE TWO FLEETS WILL
BEGIN CONDUCTING

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,901
STAGGERED MISSILE
ATTACKS ON THE TARGET.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,944
CAPTAIN.

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,403
THE SATELLITE WEAPON
IS MOVING!

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,531
IT'S MOVING?!

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:38,622
Operator:
TH‐THE LASER BARREL IS
EMERGING FROM THE TOP!

12
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,500
THAT ANGLE HAS IT POINTED
AT THE SECOND FLEET!

13
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,755
(Blast)

14
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,098
HALF OF THE SECOND FLEET WAS
JUST WIPED OUT, SIR!

15
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,683
(Frustrated grunt)

16
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,065
CAPTAIN!
FIRE MISSILES?!

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,317
NOT YET! I DON'T THINK
THEY CAN FIRE ANOTHER BLAST

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,944
FROM THAT THING
SO SOON.

19
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,195
WE NEED TO GET CLOSER
JUST TO MAKE SURE

20
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,571
WE'LL BE ABLE HIT IT!

21
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,448
PARTICLE BEAM!
WHAT?!

22
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,742
(Blast)

23
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:29,381
TOO FAR FOR YOU TO FIRE,
BUT I'VE GOT MUCH GREATER RANGE!

24
00:01:29,756 --> 00:02:58,637
♪

25

(Boom)

28
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,031
SHIPS SEVEN AND NINE WERE
DESTROYED, SIR!

29
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,533
LAUNCH MOBILE SUIT TEAMS.

30
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,618
HAVE THEM PROTECT
THE MISSILE CARRIERS.

31
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,870
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE
ANY MORE LOSSES.

32
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,790
HUH?

33
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,917
WE JUST LOST SHIP TWO!

34
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,876
(Groans)

35
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,295
CAPTAIN!

36
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,256
BEGIN THE MISSILE ATTACK
AT ONCE!

37
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,175
HAVE ALL SHIPS
LAUNCH A MISSILE BARRAGE!

38
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,441
NINETY‐THREE PERCENT
OF THE MISSILES

39
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,152
WERE SHOT DOWN BY
THEIR DEFENSES, SIR!

40
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,448
BUT‐BUT WE FIRED
SO MANY!

41
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,825
WE HAVE INCOMING
ENEMY MOBILE SUITS, SIR!

42
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,952
MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
TO INTERCEPT.

47
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,651
HOW RUDE.

48
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,779
DON'T JUST RUN IN THERE
AND STEAL MY PREY.

49
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,910
Operator:
IT'S HOPELESS,
WE'RE COMPLETELY OUTMATCHED!

50
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,120
NO MATTER WHAT, WE HAVE TO
BREAK THROUGH THE ENEMY!

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,581
THE SECOND FLEET
ONLY HAS THREE SHIPS LEFT!

52
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,333
ONLY ONE OF THEM HAS TO MAKE IT!

53
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,002
APPROACH THE SATELLITE WEAPON
AND RAM INTO IT!

54
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,587
CAPTAIN!

00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,266
RE‐REINFORCEMENTS?

58
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,979
HUH? THAT MACHINE, IT'S...

59
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,314
HERE IT COMES.

60
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,078
Setsuna:
ATTENTION KATHARON FLEET,

61
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,288
THIS IS CELESTIAL BEING.

62
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,583
WE'LL CARRY OUT THE MISSION TO
DESTROY THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

63
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,086
WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR
YOUR ASSISTANCE.

64
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,547
WE'D LIKE WHATEVER DATA
YOU HAVE ON YOUR TARGET.

65
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,590
SEND IT OVER CHANNEL 34.

66
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,470
OKAY, WE'RE SENDING IT
OVER RIGHT AWAY.

67
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,892
(Monitor beeps)

68
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,894
TRANSMISSION DONE.

69
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,689
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THE WEAPON WILL FIRE AGAIN.

70
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,691
MOVE YOUR FORCES BELOW
THE ORBITAL RING.

71
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,027
WE'RE MOVING NOW.

72
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,823
THIS IS IT. THE A‐LAWS'
SATELLITE WEAPON.

73
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,997
A GUNDAM
HAS APPEARED, SIR!

74
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,625
LOOKS LIKE FOUR MOBILE SUITS
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, SIR.

75
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,379
SO YOU DECIDED TO SHOW UP
AFTER ALL, CELESTIAL BEING.

76
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,423
IS THE MEMENTO MORI
RECHARGED YET?

77
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,510
THE RESONANCE RATE IS AT
TWENTY‐SEVEN PERCENT, SIR.

78
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,512
CAPTAIN HILING CARE WILL
DEAL WITH THE GUNDAM.

79
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,015
OUR FORCES WILL TAKE
A DEFENSIVE STANCE.

80
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,392
PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT BY
THE ENEMY SHIPS.

81
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,728
YES, SIR.

82
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,939
THEIR OBJECTIVE WILL BE
TO DESTROY THE MEMENTO MORI.

83
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,232
IN THAT CASE,

84
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,694
WE'LL SIMPLY STRIKE THEM DOWN
AS THEY DRAW NEAR.

85
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,029
I'LL SHOW YOU WHY

86
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,407
I LOVE MOPPING UP
OPERATIONS SO MUCH.

87
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,621
(Lasers blasting)

88
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,462
(Boom)

89
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,884
RIBBONS IS INTERESTED
IN THIS BOY.

90
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,552
THAT MAKES ME JEALOUS.

91
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,311
THAT PARTICLE OUTPUT.
IT'S A NEW MODEL!

92
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,562
YOU HAVE SOME SKILLS, BOY.

93
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,980
(Gasps)

94
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,740
(Frustrated grunt)

95
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,950
EVEN IF THE PARTICLES WERE
A LITTLE MORE DIFFUSED.

96
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,370
TO HAVE THE SAME RANGE
AS THE GADESSA IS...

97
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,206
(Grunts)

98
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,625
Operator:
CAPTAIN CARE,
DON'T LEAVE YOUR POSITION!

99
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,794
MAJOR, IT'S THE GADESSA!

100
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,506
THE CAPTAIN HAS A LICENSE.
LET HER DO WHAT SHE WANTS.

101
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,806
HMM.

102
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,016
WELCOME BACK FROM YOUR VISIT,
MY MISTRESS.

103
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,770
HUH? DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO YOU?

104
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,772
HOWEVER SUPERIOR HE IS...

105
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,192
A MAN'S JEALOUSY
IS AN UGLY THING TO SEE.

106
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,611
NOW THEN,
HOW'S THE BATTLE COMING?

107
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,239
THE PTOLEMAOIS, HAS NOT
YET LAUNCHED

108
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,658
A DIRECT ATTACK
ON THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

109
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,077
Liu Mei:
I SEE. THEY'RE BEING CAUTIOUS.

110
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,620
(Giggles)

111
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,205
OH, MY MISTRESS.

112
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,291
I'D SAY A WOMAN'S JEALOUSY
IS JUST AS UGLY.

113
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,045
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DON'T GET YOUR WAY.

114
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,296
HARO.

115
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,881
GOTCHA! GOTCHA!

116
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,431
I'M DISPLAYING THE DATA
THE DOUBLE 0 RAISER

117
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,183
SENT US ABOUT
THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

118
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,145
LIKE WE THOUGHT,

119
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,148
A FREE‐ELECTRON LASER STRAFING
DEVICE THAT HAS ACCESS

120
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,860
TO THE ORBITAL RING'S
PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

121
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,737
Feldt:
AND THE WAY THOSE
ESCORT SHIPS ARE DEPLOYED.

122
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,864
AS YOU FORECAST, MISS SUMERAGI.

123
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,533
THE LASER BARREL ONLY HAS
A LIMITED FIRING ANGLE.

124
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,826
HUH?

125
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,661
MISS NORIEGA, WE'RE RECEIVING
WHAT LOOKS LIKE

126
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,621
SOME CODED DATA FROM AN AGENT!

127
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,249
FROM WANG LIU MEI?
WHERE WAS SHE ALL THIS TIME?

128
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,834
PUT IT ON SCREEN,
MILEINA.

129
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,419
YOU GOT IT!

130
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,261
IT'S STRUCTURAL DATA ON
THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

131
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,138
HOW DID SHE MANAGE
TO GET THESE?

132
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,181
Feldt:
MISS SUMERAGI!

133
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,224
THERE'S THE WEAPON'S
WEAK POINT.

134
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,018
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC RESONATOR!

135
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,233
THEN I GUESS THAT DETERMINES
OUR MISSION PLAN.

136
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,235
WE'LL APPROACH THE WEAPON
THROUGH ITS BLIND SPOT

137
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,779
AND THEN LAUNCH
A DIRECT ASSAULT.

138
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,989
TIERIA AND LOCKON WILL
HAVE TO COORDINATE

139
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,324
WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION.

140
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,242
AND ITS DEFENSIVE FORCES?

141
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,619
WE'LL CHARGE RIGHT
PAST THEM.

142
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,121
IS THIS PLAN ABOUT PRECISION
OR BRUTE FORCE?

143
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,165
WE'RE GOING TO NEED BOTH.

144
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,751
ALL RIGHT, TIME TO GET THIS
MISSION UNDERWAY.

145
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,503
Everyone:
ROGER!

146
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,423
I SENT IT! I SENT IT!

147
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,841
THANK YOU, HARO!

148
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,260
NOW, WE JUST GOT TO
GO GET THEM!

149
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,845
(Giggles)

150
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,850
YOU KNOW LOUISE?

151
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,436
YES. ALTHOUGH,
RIGHT AFTER SHE WAS

152
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,439
GIVEN HER OFFICIAL DUTY
ASSIGNMENT, I CAME HERE.

153
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,441
SO, LOUISE
IS A MOBILE SUIT?

154
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,652
YES, SHE WAS A PILOT.

155
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,278
I KNEW IT.

156
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,696
I KNEW WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING

157
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,115
THAT LOUISE HAD TO BE
SOMEWHERE CLOSE BY.

158
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,576
(Phone ringing)

159
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,204
Sumeragi:
COME TO THE BRIDGE, PLEASE.
AND BRING SAJI WITH YOU.

160
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,705
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

161

RIGHT NOW ALL OF ARIOS'
TRANS AM POWER

234
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,906
IS BEING DEVOTED
TO PTOLEMY'S THRUSTERS.

235
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,244
SO WE CAN'T USE OUR GN FIELD.

236
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,829
Sumeragi:
LOCKON!

(Lasers ricochet)

242

00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,163
UNTIL IT REACHES ITS

I AM YOUR OPPONENT!
PREPARE YOURSELF!

(Whimper)

261
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,545
ARIOS HAS REACHED
ITS TRANS AM TIME LIMIT!

262
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,552
I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS
PLAN SUCCEED.

263
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,180
CHERUDIM'S SHIELD BITS

279
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,670
LOOKS LIKE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
QUITE ENOUGH FIREPOWER.

280
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,714
IT WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH
TO DESTROY

281
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,592
THE MEMENTO MORI'S
ELECTROMAGNETIC RESONATOR.

THEY ACTUALLY DID IT.

THEY MIGHT'VE JUST SAVED
THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,170
A TERRIBLE THING
WE DON'T WANT TO PASS ON

327
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,839
TO YOUR GENERATION.

328
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:09,763
WHAT SHOULD WE PASS ON
TO THIS GENERATION?

329
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,272
SO, THE SATELLITE HAS FALLEN.

330
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,607
(Door opens)

331
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,943
MOST LIKELY, IT WAS
THE WORK OF CELESTIAL BEING.

332
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,280
HERCURY!

333
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,366
COLONEL PANG HERCURY!

334
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:35,831
IT SURE HAS BEEN A WHILE.
HELLO, WILD BEAR OF RUSSIA!

335
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,252
Narrator:
SEPARATED FROM THE PTOLEMAIOS,

336
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,504
SETSUNA RETURNS
TO A PLACE FROM THE PAST

337
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,841
TO FINALLY MEET THE EXECUTOR
OF THE MASTER PLAN.

338
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,427
NEXT EPISODE:
"I CAN HEAR A SONG".

339
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,180
WHEN SHE SINGS,
IT PIERCES THE HEART.
