(Focused breath)

00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,727
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC
OPTICAL RESONATOR.

00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,646
I HAVE JUST ONE CHANCE!

00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,650
JUST LIKE
THE NAME SAYS...

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,735
TARGETED AND FIRING!

Feldt:
CONFIRMING, THE SATELLITE
WEAPON HAS BEEN DESTROYED!

11
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,146
THAT'S IT, PTOLEMY HAS LEFT
THE COMBAT AREA!

12
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:03,939
(Relieved sigh)

13
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,691
WE PULLED IT OFF.

14
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,859

TO YOU GUYS.

CELESTIAL BEING FIGHTS
ITS BATTLES.

SOMETHING ON THE E‐SENSOR!
ENEMY MACHINES!

21
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,582
ARE YOU CERTAIN?

22
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,045
CELESTIAL BEING, YOU MAY HAVE
DESTROYED THE MEMENTO MORI.

23
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,381
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO
PAY FOR THAT.

IT'S BEEN
DETERMINED THAT THE EXPLOSION

IN GEOSTATIONARY
SATELLITE ORBIT

27
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,740
WAS THE RESULT OF AN ATTACK BY
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT FORCES.

28
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,991
IN RESPONSE TO THESE
INCREASINGLY

HEINOUS ACTS OF TERRORISM,

SO, THE MEMENTO MORI
HAS FALLEN.

36
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,633
WE DID WIPE OUT NEARLY ALL OF
KATHARON'S SPACE FORCES.

00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,468
THEY'VE BEEN CRIPPLED.

IN ORDER TO UNITE THE WORLD AND
BRING ABOUT A PERMANENT PEACE

39
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,684
CELESTIAL BEING AND ITS MEMBERS
MUST BE COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

40
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,477
IF WE ALLOW
THIS GROUP TO EXIST

41
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,813
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT FORCES
MIGHT BE INSPIRED

THE RENDEZVOUS POINT SHOULD
BE AROUND HERE.

HUH? WHAT IS THIS?

48
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,040
IT CAN'T BE.

49
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,842
WHERE'S PTOLEMY?

50
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,970
HUH?

YOU'VE BECOME
A REAL STUD, DUDE!

56
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,490
NENA LIKES WHAT SHE SEES.

57
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,160
HEY, WAIT A SECOND!

58
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,704
REMEMBER, I HELPED YOU
OUT BACK THERE.

59
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,955
BUT NEVER MIND.

60
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,332
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

61
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,417
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR SHIP
FELL TO EARTH.

62
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,045
I JUST SENT OVER THE DATA
FROM THE BATTLE,

63
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,214
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WENT BY.

HUH? HEY, DON'T RUSH OFF!

65

HE'S JUST SO IMPATIENT,
DARN IT!

HE'S NOT INTO YOU!
HE'S NOT INTO YOU!

OW!

00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,022
TO WHAT DO I OWE THE
PLEASURE OF YOUR VISIT?

70
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,316
YOU DIDN'T COME ALL THE WAY
OUT TO THE MIDDLE EAST

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,526
JUST TO SEE ME.

72
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,945
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN APPOINTED
A MILITARY INSPECTOR,

73
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,239
THERE'S SOME INFORMATION
I WANT TO PASS ON TO YOU.

74
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,698
SOME INFORMATION?

75
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,076
YES.

76
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,953
THERE'S A MOVEMENT WITHIN
THE MILITARY

77
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,038
AIMED AT PULLING OFF
SOME KIND OF COUP D'ETAT.

78
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,748
HUH?

79
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,166
I KNOW THERE
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

80
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,043
WHO ARE STARTING TO HAVE
SECOND THOUGHTS

81
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,962
ABOUT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES,

82
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,756
BUT TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER
A COUP D'ETAT?

83
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,007
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO,

84
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,425
THE GOVERNMENT
HAS BEEN REDUCED

85
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,927
TO A MERE PUPPET OF
THE A‐LAWS.

86
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,220
(Gasps)

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,764
YOU DON'T MEAN,
YOU'RE‐‐

88
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,142
PEOPLE NEED TO OPEN THEIR EYES
AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

89
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,311
SERGEI.

90
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,278

00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,074
(Grunts)

92
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,410
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE 0 RAISER?

93
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,287
WHAT ABOUT THE BATTLE?

94
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,292
(Off balance grunt)

95
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,168
WE HAVE GRAVITY.

96
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,421
WHEN DID WE COME DOWN
TO THE SURFACE?

97
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,010
HMM?

98
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,720
(Birds chirping)

99
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,560
WH‐WH...

100
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,479
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?!

101
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,524
Feldt:
ANTI‐OBSERVATION OPTICAL
CAMOUFLAGE RESTORED.

102
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,067
NOW DEPLOYING.

103
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,534
Ian:
SO YOU'RE SAYING,
YOU ACTIVATED THE 00 RAISER

104
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,287
AND CHASED AWAY THE ENEMIES
AT LAGRANGE THREE.

105
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,955
BUT, UPON LEARNING
THAT THE A‐LAWS

106
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,206
WERE USING A SATELLITE WEAPON,

107
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,000
YOU WENT ON A MISSION
TO DESTROY IT.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,169
YOU SUCCESSFULLY ELIMINATED IT,

109
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,754
BUT YOU WERE CAUGHT BY
A SURPRISE ATTACK

110
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,172
AND FELL TO EARTH,

111
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,466
WHERE YOU SOMEHOW MADE
AN EMERGENCY LANDING.

112
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,343
AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU DON'T
KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS

113
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,637
OF SETSUNA
AND THE 00 RAISER.

114
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,888
DID I GET ALL THAT RIGHT?

115
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,097
THAT'S IT EXACTLY!

116
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,849
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A DISASTER!

117
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,726
COME ON, DON'T SAY THAT,
OLD MAN.

118
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,062
WE DID DESTROY
THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

119
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,357
AND REMEMBER, WE WERE COMPLETELY
OUT OF ALL GN PARTICLES

120
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,275
WHEN WE CAME UNDER ATTACK.

121
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,736
FURTHERMORE, THE ENEMY
FORCES EVEN DEPLOYED

122
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,614
A NEW MOBILE ARMOR
WHEN THEY AMBUSHED US.

123
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,741
IT WAS SUMERAGI LEE
NORIEGA'S IDEA

124
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,785
TO USE THE FORCE OF
THE IMPACTS FROM THE SHOTS

125
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,745
TO ACCELERATE DOWN TO EARTH,

126
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,956
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
CONCEALING THE SHIP WITH SMOKE.

127
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,167
IF IT WASN'T
FOR HER QUICK THINKING,

128
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,753
WE WOULD'VE BEEN FINISHED
FOR SURE.

129
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,173
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,
WE'RE JUST LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

130
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,801
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S PTOLEMY'S
CONDITION NOW?

131
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,929
THE ENGINES ARE FINE BUT THE
NAVIGATION, WEAPONS CONTROL,

132
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,764
COMMUNICATIONS,
AND SENSOR SYSTEMS

133
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,641
HAVE ALL SUFFERED
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE.

134
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,267
OH, GIVE ME STRENGTH!

135
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,854
IF THE ENEMY ATTACKED US NOW
WE'D BE DONE FOR!

136
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,231
HI, EVERYONE!

137
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,816
I'VE BROUGHT YOU YOUR MEALS!

138
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,942
YAY! TIME TO EAT!

139
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,694
I SAID DONE FOR!

140
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,824
I'M SORRY, ALLELUJAH.

141
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,202
I HAD MISS MARIE PLAY
AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE BATTLE.

142
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,995
WELL, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

143
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,416
BESIDES, MARIE WAS MORE THAN
WILLING TO HELP US OUT.

144
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,417
BUT, PLEASE...

145
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,711
NEVER ASK HER TO
DO IT AGAIN.

146
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,629
AS A FAVOR TO ME.

147
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,090
OKAY.
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.

148
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,638
THE SATELLITE WEAPON
WAS DESTROYED.

149
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,099
BUT WE WERE
PRETTY HEAVILY DAMAGED.

150
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,018
IN THE WORST CASE, WE MIGHT HAVE
TO ASK YOUR BRANCH FOR HELP.

151
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,355
PERFECT, THANK YOU.

152
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,358
HUH?

153
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,987
WHO WERE YOU TALKING
TO JUST NOW?

154
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,697
JUST SOME MINOR BUSINESS.

155
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,157
I'VE BEEN WONDERING...

156
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,074
HUH?

157
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,242
THE QUESTION IS...

158
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,203
HOW WERE THE A‐LAWS ABLE TO
FIGURE OUT PRECISELY

159
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,498
WHERE THE PTOLEMAOIS WOULD BE?

160
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,083
AH, I SEE.

161
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,544
SO YOU'RE SUSPICIOUS OF ME,
MISS RETURNER?

162
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,879
HMM?

163
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,172
GOODNESS, NO!

164
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,799
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S
BEEN PUZZLING ME.

165
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,051
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

166
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,554
YOU CAN CALL ME ANEW
IF YOU WANT TO.

167
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,555
(Pleased sigh)

168
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,308
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
YOU CAN CALL ME LYLE.

169
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,476
YOUR NAME'S LYLE?

170
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,311
YUP, LYLE DYLANDY.

171
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,730
THAT'S WHAT
MY REAL NAME IS.

(Bothered sigh)

173
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,250
STILL NO RESPONSE
FROM PTOLEMY.

174
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,710
HMM?

175
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,137
TH‐THIS CRATER IS FROM
THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

176
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,223
MORE EVIDENCE
OF THE KIND OF ATROCITY

177
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,517
THE INNOVATORS CAN INFLICT.

178
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,480

179
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,109
HIM AGAIN?

180

WHAT THE HELL IS HE
DOING HERE?!

181
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,200

FOLLOW ME, PUNK!

Katharon Leader:
A GROUP WITHIN
THE FEDERATION FORCES

183
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,750
IS PLANNING A COUP D'ÉTAT?!

184
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,586
IS THIS CREDIBLE,
IKEDA?

185
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,339
MY SOURCE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF
MINE FROM WHEN I WAS A REPORTER,

186
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,466
HE'S ABOUT AS RELIABLE
AS THEY COME.

187
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,386
THEY MUST BE OUTRAGED
BY THE A‐LAWS' ATROCITIES.

188
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,346
APPARENTLY,
THE COUP D'ÉTAT FACTION

189
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,473
IS ATTEMPTING TO MAKE
CONTACT WITH US.

190
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,350
THEY'VE DECIDED THEY
WANT TO HOLD A MEETING

191
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,727
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

192
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,396
I'LL GO SEE THEM.

193
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,190
JUST A MINUTE, KLAUS,
THIS MEETING COULD BE A TRAP!

194
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,152
I BELIEVE THIS GROUP IS REALLY
DETERMINED TO CORRECT

195
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,028
THE MISGOVERNMENT OF
THE FEDERATION.

196

YOU BASTARD, YOU'RE WITH

223

YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

224
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,027
IF A MERCENARY IS ASKED

HE'LL GO ANYWHERE

BUT THAT'S
NOT THE CASE FOR ME.

244
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,080
I FIRST MET YOU
ELEVEN YEARS AGO.

245
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:56,044
YES. RIGHT HERE.

246
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,254
IN THIS HELLHOLE OF
A BATTLEFIELD,

247
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,007
WHERE FOOLISH HUMANS
WERE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

248
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,762
AND ON IT, ONE BOY DESPERATELY
RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE.

249
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,930
I WAS WATCHING YOU.

250
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,102
FROM THE VANTAGE POINT
OF A MOBILE SUIT COCKPIT.

(Stunned gasps)

ARE YOU SAYING...

253
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,235
YOU WERE IN THAT MACHINE?

254
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,905
IN THE 0 GUNDAM?

255
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,326
THAT ARMED INTERVENTION

256
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,370
WAS A PERFORMANCE TEST
OF THE 0 GUNDAM.

257
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,165
NATURALLY, THE PLAN WAS
TO DISPOSE OF EVERY WITNESS

258
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,960
AT THAT LOCATION SO AS
TO MAINTAIN SECRECY.

259
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,964
BUT THEN ON THE SPUR OF
THE MOMENT I SPARED YOUR LIFE.

260
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,966
BECAUSE OF THE LOOK
IN YOUR EYES

261
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,720
AS YOU STARED AT
THE 0 GUNDAM...AT ME.

262
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,975
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

263
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,228
YOU SEE,
IT WAS I WHO USED VEDA

264
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,772
TO RECOMMEND YOU AS
A GUNDAM MEISTER.

ARE YOU WAITING FOR ME
TO THANK YOU?

268
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,329
NOW THAT YOUR
SERVICES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED,

269
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,873
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TIME
YOU RETURNED THAT TO ME.

270
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,000
BECAUSE BY ALL RIGHTS

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,086
I AM THE LEGITIMATE PILOT
OF THAT MACHINE.

272

SORRY, BOSS.

277

FIGHTING IS MY REASON
FOR LIVING.

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,312
(Panting)

299
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,691
IT'S A BOMBARDMENT TYPE.

300

311
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,483

THIS IS THE POWER OF
THE INNOVATORS!

315

IF EVERYONE
COULD HEAR OUR SONG.

320
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,893
THEN WE GOT TO SING IT
FOR THEM!

321
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,855
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

322
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,399
THAT MAY BE
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO.

323
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,068
IN WHICH CASE, I MUST DO IT.

324
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,448
Bring:
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT
DESTROYING ONE OF US!

325
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,159
BUT I MUST CARRY OUT MY MISSION!

326
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,203
I, TOO, HAVE THINGS
I CAN NEVER COMPROMISE ON!

327
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,084
WHERE DID HIS FIELD GO?!

328
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,341
(Struggling grunt)

329
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,176
HIS TRANS AM!

330
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,636
IF THAT'S ALL
YOU'VE GOT, THEN...!

331
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,972
(Startled gasp)

332
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,351
WHAT IS‐‐

333
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,269
Tiera:
THIS ISN'T LIKE
WHAT HAPPENED WITH NADLEEH.

334
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,439
I REVEAL THIS FORM BY
MY OWN FREE WILL!

335
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,364
WHAT MACHINE IS THAT?!

336
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,451
THIS IS SERAPHIM GUNDAM!

337
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,498
GN FIELD ON!

338
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,337
YOU'RE DESTROYING
YOUR OWN KIND!

339
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,338
NO.

340
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,298
I AM A HUMAN BEING!

341
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,762
(Worried cry)

342
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,806
Revive:

343
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,725

344

(Grunts)

345
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,231
TIERIA...

346
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,154
YOU'RE GETTING
CARRIED AWAY HERE.

347
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,989
(Alert beeps)

348
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,951
WHAT'S THIS?

349
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,538
Pilot:
KLAUS! IT'S A MOBILE SUIT!

350
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,539
(Startled grunts)

351
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,832
A GUNDAM?

352
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,792
DID IT COME
TO ESCORT US?

353
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,795
(Sinister chuckle)

354
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,256
THESE PEOPLE ARE
MY HOSTAGES!

355
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,591
ONE FALSE MOVE AND I'LL‐‐

356
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,593
WHAT HAPPENED?

357
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,516
(Al‐Saachez screams in pain)
FANGS, FLY!

358
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,191
(Boom)

359
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,822
(Frustrated cry)

360
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,908
(Crush)

361
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,287

Louise:
YET ANOTHER NEW MODEL?

386
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,203
THIS ONE'S
A MOBILE ARMOR.

387
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,997
Divine:
IT'S CALLED THE EMPRUSS.

388
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:56,083
HUH?

389
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,960
THIS IS THE PROTOTYPE
OF A MACHINE

390
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,254
THAT WILL
EVENTUALLY BE YOURS.

391
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,548
I'LL HAVE MY OWN MACHINE.

392
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,302
A TOKEN OF APPRECIATION
FROM RIBBONS ALMARK.

393
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,055
Graham:
IS IT FINISHED?

394
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,891
Katagiri:
YES, IT'S FINALLY DONE.

395
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,478
MASURAO.
YOUR NEW CUSTOM MACHINE.

396
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,897
I CAN SEE A RESEMBLANCE
TO THE FLAG.

397
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,483
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE
OF WORK, KATAGIRI.

398
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,986
I'VE ADDED A SECRET BONUS
TO IT AS WELL.

399
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,030
SECRET BONUS?

400
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,948
WHEN WE WENT TO
PROFESSOR EIFMAN'S HOME,

401
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,951
WE FOUND SOME HANDWRITTEN
NOTES ON GN DRIVES.

402
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,287
I CONFIRMED HIS THEORIES
AND IMPLEMENTED

403
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,123
THE RESULTS IN
THIS PARTICULAR MACHINE.

404
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,043
REALLY? I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THAT.

405

406

(Gust of wind blows)

407
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,485
GOOD‐BYE, KUJO, FOREVER.

408
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,865
Narrator:
SETSUNA COLLAPSES
FROM HIS BULLET WOUND.

409
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,533
TIERIA AND THE OTHERS

410
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,744
ARE FIERCELY ATTACKED
BY THE INNOVATORS.

411
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,746
BATTLES LEAD TO NEW BATTLES.

412
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,749
NEXT EPISODE: "VICTORY SONG
OF THE RESISTANCE".

413
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,001
THE VIOLENT BACKLASH
IS AT HAND.
