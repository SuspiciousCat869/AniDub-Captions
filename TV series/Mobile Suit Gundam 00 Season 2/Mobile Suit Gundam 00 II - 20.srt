1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,632
Revive:
VEDA'S LOCATION?

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,843
WELL, I CAN'T SAY
I REALLY KNOW.

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,888
YOU'RE AN INNOVATOR AND
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS?

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,807
OKAY, LET'S SAY I DO KNOW
THE LOCATION.

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,185
WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE
INTEND TO DO WITH VEDA?

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,187
TAKE IT BACK.

7
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,188
(Chuckles)

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,648
BUT ORIGINALLY,

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,984
VEDA WAS MADE FOR
WE INNOVATORS TO USE.

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,945
OKAY, THEN TELL ME THIS.

11
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:31,865
IF VEDA SERVES YOU, THEN WHAT
DO YOU INTEND TO USE IT FOR?

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,370
WHAT WAS AEOLIA'S REAL GOAL
WHEN HE CREATED HIS PLAN?

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,039
IT'S FOR THE DIALOGUES
THAT ARE TO COME.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,667
DIALOGUES THAT ARE TO COME?

15
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,627
(Grunts)

16
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,712
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,507
THAT'S THE LIMITATION OF
BEING HUMAN.

18
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,343
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SO PERFECT YOURSELF.

19
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,179
YOU WERE CAPTURED,
AFTER ALL.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,931
DON'T BE ABSURD.

21
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,057
I ALLOWED IT.

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,392
YOU WHAT?!

23
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,477
(Gasps)

Feldt:
MISS SUMERAGI!

25
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,438
WHAT'S WRONG, FELDT?

26
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,856
IT'S MISS RETURNER!

27
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,733
WHAT ABOUT ANEW?!

28
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,153
SHE SHOT LASSE AND
TOOK MILEINA HOSTAGE!

29
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,446
Allelujah:
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

30
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,615
MISS RETURNER SAID SHE WAS

31
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,075
AN INNOVATOR!

32
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,285
AN INNOVATOR?!

33
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,661
SHE SAID THAT?!

34
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,538
BUT HOW?

35
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,706
(Grunts)

36
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,251
DON'T MOVE!

37
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,337
Revive:
YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING,
RIGHT?

38
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,131
IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME,

39
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,717
I CANNOT GUARANTEE
THE SAFETY OF THE HOSTAGE.

40
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,760
BECAUSE WE'RE THE SAME TYPE,

41
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,140
ANEW AND I ARE ABLE
TO CONNECT OUR THOUGHTS.

42
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,851
I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND.

43
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,729
QUANTUM WAVES.
HUH?

(Gasps)

45
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,946
(Thinking)
ANEW, CONTINUE
ACCORDING TO THE PLAN.

THE SHIPBOARD SYSTEMS!

DAMN IT!

00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,417
UH, MISS RETURNER,

YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

52

EVERYONE WILL FORGIVE YOU‐‐

53
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,795
SHUT UP.

AH! OKAY!

YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF HERE.

58
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,228
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

59
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,691
THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO USES QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES?

60

THE SHIPBOARD SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN
INFECTED WITH A VIRUS?!

62
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,088
WE'LL SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS
AND LOOK FOR MILEINA.

63
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,673
GET TO THE BRIDGE,
MISS SUMERAGI.

ALL RIGHT.

THE C‐LEVEL

I FORGOT YOU WERE ON THIS SHIP.

DID YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME?

THEY TOOK BACK THE HOSTAGE?

THAT'S WHAT WE GET
FOR MAKING HER A WOMAN.

Revive:
THEN I HAVE NO CHOICE.
I'LL GIVE UP THE 0 RAISER.

140
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,768
BUT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU...

141
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,144
TO FIX IT!

142
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,939

00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,118
Ribbons:
I HEARD YOU WEREN'T
FEELING WELL.

169
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,870
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

170
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,166
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
A GOOD IDEA TO PRESCRIBE

171
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,876
SOME NEW MEDICATION FOR YOU.

172
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,378
ALMARK,
I DON'T‐‐

173
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,632
I GAVE YOU THE MEDICATION THAT
SUPPRESSED THE CELLULAR DEFECTS

174
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,467
THAT WERE EATING YOUR BODY.

175
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,968
WHY DID I DO THAT?

176
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,721
(Gasps)

177
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,557
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

178
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,269
SO THAT YOU CAN BRING ABOUT
A UNITED WORLD WITHOUT WAR.

179
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,522
AND AVENGE YOUR PARENTS

180
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,899
BY DEFEATING THE GUNDAMS.

181
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,818
DEFEAT GUNDAMS.

182
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,445
I HAVE SUCH HIGH HOPES FOR YOU.

183
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,698
I BROUGHT THIS REGNANT
SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU.

184
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,495
I WANT YOU TO BECOME
HUMANITY'S FIRST INNOVATOR,

185
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,040
SO YOU CAN GUIDE THIS WORLD.

186
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,041
WILL YOU?

187
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,709
LOUISE HALEVY?

188
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,173
I'LL DO THAT, ALMARK.

189
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,299
HMM.

190
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,884
THAT'S MY GIRL.

191
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,934
Sumeragi:
FELDT, WHAT'S THE CONDITION OF
THE SHIPBOARD SYSTEMS?

192
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,813
Feldt:
NAVIGATION AND COMBAT SYSTEMS
ARE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED.

193
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,439
WE REMOVED THE VIRUS,

194
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,902
BUT 3456 PACKETS OF DATA
WERE COMPLETELY DELETED.

195
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,405
IT LOOKS LIKE THE INNOVATORS
TOOK SOME DATA, TOO.

196
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,365
HOW LONG TILL
EVERYTHING'S RESTORED?

197
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,368
AT LEAST 2210.

198
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,703
MISS SUMERAGI.

199
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,580
WHAT ABOUT MISS RETURNER?

200
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,582
JUST FOCUS ON YOUR WORK FOR NOW.

201
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,208
THE ENEMY'S COMING.

202
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,128
IAN, WHAT'S UP WITH
THE 0 RAISER'S REPAIRS?

203
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,922
WE'VE REPLACED
THE ENTIRE COCKPIT UNIT.

204
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,050
BUT RE‐TUNING THE RAISER
SYSTEM'S GONNA TAKE TIME.

205
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,469
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO LAUNCH 00
FOR A WHILE.

206
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,305
I UNDERSTAND.

207
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,728
HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED?

208
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,942
ANEW.

209
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,110
HOW COULD YOU?

210
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,486
HOW COULD YOU DO IT?!

211
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,906
DAMN IT!

212
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,159
Setsuna:
WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE HER
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

213
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,702
(Sighs)

214
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,204
HMM.

215
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,582
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA
MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY.

216
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,917
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

217
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,294
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME,
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

218
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,046
THAT GIRL IS
AN INNOVATOR.

219
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,839
SHE'S OUR ENEMY.

220
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,840
PULLING THE TRIGGER
WILL BE‐‐

221
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,008
DON'T TRY TO ACT TOUGH.

222
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,635
(Grunts)

223
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,346
I'LL BE THE ONE TO
PULL THE TRIGGER.

224
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,306
I DON'T MIND IF YOU HATE ME.

225
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,683
STOP PLAYING
THE HARD CASE, KID!

226
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,020
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT
NO REASON TO FIGHT HER.

227
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,521
SURE, I DO!

228
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,608
YOU'VE MORE OF
A REASON NOT TO FIGHT HER.

229
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,276
HMPH.

230
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,861
TSK.

231
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,865
HUH?

232
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,409
TIERIA. GET SERAVEE
READY FOR LAUNCH.

233
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,244
I'LL HANDLE THINGS HERE.

234
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,622
BUT YOUR SHIP‐HANDLING
SKILLS AREN'T‐‐

235
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,083
I KNOW THEY LEAVE
MUCH TO BE DESIRED.

236
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,419
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU TO
PROTECT US WITH YOUR GUNDAM.

237
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,630
ROGER.

238
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,966
GETTING READINGS ON
THE E‐SENSOR!

239
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,760
FROM THE SPEED,
THEY'RE PROBABLY ENEMY FORCES!

240
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,262
INNOVATORS.

241
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,724
(Sighs)
ANEW'S COMING.

242
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,477
(Grunts)

243
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,651
Hiling:
THEIR SHIP'S SYSTEMS ARE IN
SHAMBLES, AND 00 IS DAMAGED.

244
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,654
SHOULD BE EASY TAKING OUT
THE REMAINING GUNDAMS.

245
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,989
HILING.

246
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,616
REMEMBER, OUR OBJECTIVE
IS TO CAPTURE THE 00.

247
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:08,705
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW THAT.

248
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,457
Hiling:
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO
NEED HER HELP

249
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,751
WHEN WE GET THERE.

250
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,753
YOU'RE A TWISTED ONE.

251
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,006
WARRANT OFFICER,

252
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,674
THIS MAY BE THE NEW REGNANT'S
FIRST SORTIE,

253
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,509
BUT WE'RE EXPECTING
A LOT FROM YOU.

254
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,593
ROGER.

255
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,970
Hiling:
THE GUNDAMS ARE HERE!

256
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,722
(Gasps)

257
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,098
THREE MACHINES.

258
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,311
Tieria:
ONLY A FEW ENEMY UNITS, BUT
ONE OF THEM IS A MOBILE ARMOR.

259
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,313
IT'S DIFFERENT
FROM THE PREVIOUS ONE.

260
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,148
Lyle:
INCOMING!

261
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,733
Lyle:
INCOMING!
(Grunts)

262
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,824
Tieria:
THAT PARTICLE BEAM!

263
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,284
Lyle:
IT CURVED!

264
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,705
IT'S SO POWERFUL!

265
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,376
Allelujah:
THIS ATTACK...

266
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,794
IT'S GONNA HIT!

267
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,379
NO, IT WON'T!

268
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,176
WHERE?

269
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,302
WHERE ARE YOU, ANEW?!

270
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,763
ENEMY APPROACHING!
ENEMY APPROACHING!

271
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,889
HMM?

272
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,025
Anew:
DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD, LYLE!

273
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,943
YOU'VE GOT AN IMAGE
TO LIVE UP TO!

274
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,278
ANEW, STOP!

275
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,532
THAT'S ANEW?!

276
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,911
Hiling:
(Laughs)

277
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,913
WHAT A DRAMATIC REUNION.

278
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,541
YOUR BELOVED IS AN INNOVATOR
AND YOUR SWORN ENEMY!

279
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,338
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL
A TRULY DANGEROUS LIAISON!

280
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,090
THIS WON'T END WELL.

281
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,734
Allelujah:
LOCKON!

282
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,819
(Grunts)

283
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,784
ANEW'S TAKEN ONE MACHINE
WITH HER!

284
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,702
WE'LL DEAL WITH THE REST!

285
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,249
Allelujah:
(Grunts)

286
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,625
IF THIS BEAM HITS...

287
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,961
Tieria:
I'LL MAKE AN OPENING!

288
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,712
HYPER BURST MODE!

289
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,800
HIGH DENSITY
COMPRESSED PARTICLES,

290
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,301
RELEASING!

291
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,307
IMPOSSIBLE!

292
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,101
THE HYPER BURST WAS...

293
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,310
(Grunts)

294
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,939
Allelujah:

(Screams)

297
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,822
Peries:
HOW DARE YOU!

298
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,201
Feldt:
ARIOS IS DAMAGED!

299
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,996
CHERUDIM IS STILL HEADING AWAY
FROM THE COMBAT AIRSPACE!

300
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,998
ISN'T 00 READY, YET?!

301
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,249
Ian:
A LITTLE MORE TIME!

302
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,918
Sumeragi:
HURRY!

303
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,712
WAIT, LYLE.

304
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,551
Anew:
FANGS, FLY!

305
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,304
HARO, DEPLOY THE SHIELD BITS
IN ASSAULT MODE!

306
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,655
Lyle:
WHY?!

307
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,575
WHY DO WE HAVE TO FIGHT
EACH OTHER LIKE THIS?!

308
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,744
Anew:
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A HUMAN.

309
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,705
AND OBVIOUSLY,
I AM AN INNOVATOR!

310
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,712
(Grunts)

311
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,923
WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER!

312
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,716
IT WAS A FALSE REALITY!

313
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,135
YOU'RE SAYING IT WAS ALL A LIE?

314
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,512
THE THINGS I WANTED,
AND THE THINGS YOU FELT?!

315
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,764
(Grunts)

316
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,724
HAVE IT YOUR WAY!

317
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,796
OH, LYLE.

318
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,714
(Grunts)

319
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,766
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GOT GOING!

320
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,103
THEY BROKE THROUGH!

321
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,944
Tieria, Allelujah, Peries:
(Screaming)

322
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,909
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

323
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,078
Lyle:
IT'S OBVIOUS, ISN'T IT?

324
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,455
I'M GONNA DO MY BEST

325
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,291
TO MAKE YOU MY WOMAN AGAIN!

326
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,713
AND I'M NOT TAKING NO
FOR AN ANSWER!

327
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:11,966
BUT...

328
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,260
