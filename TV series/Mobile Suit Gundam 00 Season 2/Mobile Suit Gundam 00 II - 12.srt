WH‐WHAT IS THIS?

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,847
Andrei:
THAT MACHINE!

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,474
Setsuna:
A VOICE?

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,100
Bring:
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,020
I CAN HEAR VOICES.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,564
THE VOICES
OF EVERYONE HERE.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,316
Louise:
GUNDAM!

8
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:28,570
THAT VOICE!
IT COULDN'T BE... LOUISE?

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,280
LOUISE!

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,116
WHAT? WHY AM I HEARING
SAJI'S VOICE?

11
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,036
Saji:
LOUISE, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE IN A MOBILE SUIT.

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,914
WHERE ARE YOU?!
SAJI! WHERE?

13
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,667
ARE YOU...IN THAT GUNDAM?

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,336
LOUISE, YOU'RE NOT WITH
THE A‐LAWS, ARE YOU?

15
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,673
SAJI, CAN I ASK YOU TO
REALIZE MY DREAM FOR ME?

16
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,800
Louise: (Flashback)
SAJI, WHY?!

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,718
MY DREAM IS SIMPLE...

18
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,262
BUT WHY ARE YOU‐‐

19
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,888
IT'S TO MAKE
YOUR DREAM COME TRUE.

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,015
WHY?!
TO GO INTO SPACE.

21
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,601
(Flashback)
WELL, WHY ARE YOU?

22
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,437
SO, PLEASE, I NEED YOU TO HELP
ME FULFILL MY DREAM.

23
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,023
Both:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

24
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,195
Louise:
THEN IT'S A PROMISE.

THE SUIT QUANTIZED?

87
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,406
A GUNDAM POWER THAT EVEN
I WASN'T AWARE OF?

88

HUH?

00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,993
OH, IS SOMETHING
THE MATTER?

SHUT UP.

HAVE BEGUN FALLING BACK.

PTOLEMY CEASE FIRING.

99
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,276
GUNDAMS,
ASSUME DEFENSIVE POSITIONS.

100
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,319
Tiera:
ROGER.

101
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,655
HOW MANY MACHINES DID
SETSUNA TAKE OUT?

102
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,365
I THINK IT WAS
ALMOST TEN OF THEM.

103
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,866
DON'T RELAX JUST YET.

104
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,410
OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE
IS STILL

105
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,620
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

106
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,873
MILEINA, I REALIZE YOU MUST BE
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PARENTS,

107
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,417
BUT I NEED YOU
TO USE THE KARELS

108
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,793
TO REPAIR PTOLEMY AND
THE GUNDAMS.

109
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,795
ROGER THAT, MA'AM.

110
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,255
THIS IS ARIOS,

111
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,674
I'VE ESCORTED ALL THE
TRANSPORTS TO A SAFE DISTANCE.

112
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,884
AND MILEINA,
YOUR MOM'S OKAY TOO.

113
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,344
(Pleased gasp)

114
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,722
ISN'T THAT GREAT NEWS,
MILEINA?
IT SURE IS!

115
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,515
I'LL GO TAKE CARE OF
THE REPAIRS, NOW!

116
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,100
(Sighs)

117
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,603
DOUBLE 0 RAISER.

118
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,398
WHO WOULD'VE IMAGINED SUCH
INCREDIBLE ABILITIES?

119
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,527
(Frustrated grunts)

120
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,612
Saji:
MOVE! COME ON, MOVE!

121
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,782
SAJI CROSSROAD.

122
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,993
COME ON, MOVE,
DAMN IT!

123
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,204
(Panting)

124
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,749
I HAVE TO GO
TO WHERE LOUISE IS.

125
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,585
TO WHERE LOUISE IS.

126
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,170
(Crying)

127
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,595
I HEARD... SAJI'S VOICE.

128
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,807
SAJI WAS THERE.
HE WAS WITH CELESTIAL BEING.

129
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,852
WORKING TOGETHER WITH
THE BASTARDS

130
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,687
WHO KILLED MOM AND DAD.

131
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,023
(Gasps)

132
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:29,235
SETSUNA. HE WAS A MEMBER
OF THAT GROUP, TOO.

133
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,280
AND SAJI LIVED
NEXT DOOR TO HIM.

134
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,619
THAT MEANS
THEY WERE CONNECTED

135
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,662
ALL ALONG.

136
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,080
(Pained gasp)

137
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,377
(Struggling to breath)

138
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,299
(Gulps)

139
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,976
THE DOUBLE POWERED GUNDAM'S
PERFORMANCE WAS SO EXCEPTIONAL.

140
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,896
JUST WHAT IS THAT MACHINE?

141
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,575
ANEW, WHAT'S IAN'S CONDITION?

142
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,869
HIS INJURIES AREN'T
LIFE‐THREATENING.

143
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,372
HE SHOULD BE FULLY RECOVERED
WITHIN TEN DAYS.

144
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,920
HUH?

145
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,761
SAJI CROSSROAD.

146
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,847
I HEARD LOUISE'S VOICE.

147
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,307
SHE WAS PILOTING
A MOBILE SUIT.

148
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,479
SHE CALLED OUT... MY NAME.

149
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,651
BUT WHY IS
SHE WITH THE A‐LAWS?

150
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,361
(Chuckles)

151
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:58,616
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
SHE DESPISES THE GUNDAMS!

152
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,328
LOUISE'S PARENTS WERE KILLED BY
GUNDAMS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER!

153
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,335
IT'S ALL BECAUSE
OF YOU GUYS.

154
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,297
IT'S YOUR FAULT
LOUISE JOINED THE A‐LAWS.

155
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,008
AND THEN SHE...

156
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,303
WHY? WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

157
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,638
WHY DID IT HAVE TO
BE LIKE THIS?

158
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,603
Setsuna:
WHY DID IT
HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS?

159
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,814
YEAH, I ALWAYS WONDERED
THE SAME THING.

160
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,320
TO RESIST FATE,
YOU HAVE TO...

161
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,364
FIGHT.

162
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,285
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO
GET LOUISE HALEVY

163
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,828
BACK FROM THE A‐LAWS,

164
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,830
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO FIGHT.

165
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,125
I SHOULD...FIGHT THEM?

166
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,460
IF SHE'S THAT
IMPORTANT TO YOU,

167
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,170
THEN YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO.

168
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,631
YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT ME
TO KILL PEOPLE?!

169
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,341
NO, I'M NOT.

170
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,009
YOU'LL JUST BE FIGHTING
TO BRING HER BACK.

171
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,260
YOU'RE JUST MINCING WORDS!

172
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,262
WHEN YOU FIGHT,
PEOPLE GET HURT!

173
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,305
LIKE LOUISE.

174
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,058
WHEN YOU FIGHT,
DO IT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE.

175
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,809
(Pained grunt)

176
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,189
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

177
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,274
LISTEN, I'M NOT LIKE
THE REST OF YOU!

178
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,817
DON'T THINK THAT I AM!

179
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,073
(Fuming grunt)

180
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,079
EAVESDROPPING AGAIN?

181
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,331
IT WASN'T MY FAULT
I OVERHEARD.

182
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,583
BUT YOU KNOW,
YOU REALLY MESSED THAT UP.

183
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,834
WHAT?

184
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,294
IT PROBABLY WOULD
HAVE BEEN BEST

185
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,338
IF YOU'D BEEN A LITTLE
CLEARER WITH THE KID.

186
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,382
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID,
"I'LL DO THE FIGHTING.

187
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,300
"YOU JUST FOCUS
ON CHANGING HER MIND

188
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,885
"OR WHATEVER YOU'VE
GOT TO DO

189
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,096
"TO GET HER
TO LEAVE THE A‐LAWS."

190
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,181
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
SHE'LL COME BACK.

191
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,100
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
PRETTY EAGER TO HELP.

192
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,397
MAKING UP FOR MISTAKES
IN THE PAST?

193
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,817
NOT IN THE PAST.
THIS IS FOR THE FUTURE.

194
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,093
(Sobbing)

195
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,404
(Rip)

196
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,072
Huh?

197
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,540
THAT PHOTO, SIR,
IS SHE YOUR WIFE?

198
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,959
Zinin:
UNTIL TWO MONTHS AGO,
THAT IS.

199
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,836
SHE WAS KILLED IN
ONE OF KATHRON'S ACTS

200
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,796
OF ANTI‐FEDERATION TERRORISM.

201
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,381
(Emotional sigh)

202
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,011
(Tensed breath)

203
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,346
(Door slides open)

204
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,015
I THOUGHT I'D FIND YOU HERE,
WARRANT OFFICER.

205
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,559
(Gasps)

206
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,563
I HEARD CAPTAIN ZININ WAS
PROMOTED TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL.

207
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,940
OH, IS THAT SO.

208
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,902
WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING, I HEARD
A VOICE, WARRANT OFFICER.

209
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,988
TELL ME,
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

210
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,406
I DON'T KNOW.

211
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,326
YOU WERE COMMUNICATING WITH
THE ENEMY, WEREN'T YOU?

212
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,660
NO, I WASN'T.

213
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,079
BUT WARRANT OFFICER,

214
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,247
YOU DO KNOW ONE
OF THE ENEMY.

215
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,417
HE SEEMED LIKE
A CLOSE FRIEND OF YOURS.

216
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,337
HE'S NOT! THOSE PEOPLE
KILLED MY FAMILY!

217
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,464
THEY'LL BRING NOTHING
BUT CHAOS TO OUR WORLD!

218
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,425
AND THAT'S WHY I‐‐

219
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,719
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

220
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,429
SUCH A SLENDER ARM.

221
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,432
YOU WOULDN'T THINK
IT BELONGED TO A PILOT.

222
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,976
SOMEONE LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T
BE IN THE A‐LAWS.

223
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,186
(Winces)

224
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,107
EXCUSE ME.

225
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,573
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE WERE BESTED
IN BATTLE BY MERE HUMANS!

226
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,408
IF ONLY RIBBONS HAD TOLD US

227
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,994
WHAT THE TWIN DRIVE WAS REALLY
CAPABLE OF DOING!

228
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,959
RIBBONS ALMARK?
BRING, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

229
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,128
WE'RE TO CAPTURE THE DOUBLE 0.

230
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,921
AND HE'S GETTING
HILING AND DIVINE

231
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,423
INVOLVED IN THIS AS WELL.

232
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,843
IS IT...IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
NOT EVEN RIBBONS

233
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,595
KNEW ABOUT THE
TWIN DRIVE'S CAPABILITIES?

234
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,351
OH! WHAT'S THAT?

235
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,602
WHAT?

236
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,447
(Rumbling)

237
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,450
Subordinate:
THE SATELLITE WEAPON
WAS FIRED AGAIN?

238
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,370
YEAH, AT RICHIELA'S
MILITARY BASE.

239
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,582
ARE ALL THE MIDDLE EASTERN
ARMIES BEING WIPED OUT?

240
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,791
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

241
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,419
WASN'T THERE A REFUGEE CAMP
WITH OVER A MILLION PEOPLE

242
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,045
NEXT TO RICHIELA'S BASE?

243
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,965
THEY MIGHT HAVE
BEEN WIPED OUT TOO.

244
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,633
JUST KILLING
INNOCENT PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

245
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,760
TO HELL WITH THEIR
SO‐CALLED UNITED WORLD!

246
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,679
(Angry grunt)

247
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,723
Klaus:
DOES THE FEDERATION
GOVERNMENT REALLY BELIEVE

248
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,266
THESE KINDS OF METHODS

249
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,685
WILL BRING
ABOUT A LASTING PEACE?!

250
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,687
(Heavy breathing)

251
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,439
(Footsteps)

252
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,238
(Peaceful moan)

253
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,453
IT SEEMS AS IF ALL OUR LANDS,
OUR PEOPLE,

254
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,206
OUR COUNTRIES ARE DISAPPEARING.

255
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,503
UNDER A GAG ORDER?

256
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,881
JUST WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
COMMANDER?

257
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,050
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE A‐LAWS

258
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,636
USED THE SOLAR POWER
GENERATION SYSTEM

259
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,639
TO PERFORM A HIGH‐OUTPUT LASER
ATTACK FROM ORBIT!

260
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,974
A WEAPON OF MASS
DESTRUCTION LIKE THAT IS‐‐

261
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,852
THIS IS AN ORDER FROM
THE FEDERATION PRESIDENT.

262
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,062
WE CAN'T IGNORE IT.

263
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,647
ALL OF THE SOLDIERS
OUT HERE

264
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,982
WITNESSED THE
DESTRUCTION FIRSTHAND!

265
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,151
RUMORS ARE GOING TO
SPREAD QUICKLY.

266
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,819
MANY OF THEM ARE
STARTING TO QUESTION

267
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,404
THE METHODS OF THE A‐LAWS!

268
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,990
THAT'S WHY I WANT
YOU TO ACT AS A MONITOR

269
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,369
TO MAKE SURE THE GAG ORDER
IS STRICTLY ENFORCED.

270
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,579
IS THAT A DIRECT ORDER,
COMMANDER?

271
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,414
OF COURSE IT IS.

272
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,251
AND THERE WILL BE NO CHANGE
IN MILITARY POLICY.

273
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,089
(Sighs)

274
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,800
A SOLDIER ALWAYS FOLLOWS ORDERS.

275
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,724
FELDT,

276
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,935
HAS THERE BEEN ANY RESPONSE AT
ALL FROM WANG LIU MEI?

277
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,229
NO, SHE HASN'T
REPLIED YET.

278
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,107
WE NEED RELIABLE INFORMATION ON
THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

279
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,317
HMM?

280
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,319
I'M GETTING
A REPORT THE SATELLITE WEAPON

281
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,821
HAS FIRED A SECOND SHOT
AT EARTH!

282
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,364
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

283
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,783
WE CAN'T WASTE ANY
MORE TIME!

284
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,577
ATTENTION ALL HANDS,
THIS IS SUMERAGI!

285
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,163
AS SOON AS THE REPAIRS TO
PTOLEMY'S HULL ARE COMPLETE,

286
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,041
WE'LL USE TRANS AM TO MOVE OUT
AT FULL ACCELERATION.

287
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,876
WE'LL BEGIN OUR ASSAULT
ON THE ENEMY SATELLITE WEAPON

288
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,628
ON THE ORBITAL RING!

289
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,423
REPAIRS ON THE GUNDAMS WILL
CONTINUE AS WE ACCELERATE.

290
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,967
EVERYONE, LET'S GIVE IT
OUR BEST.

291
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,846
BUT, LOUISE IS IN
THIS SECTOR.

292
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,848
I'LL BE LEAVING HER.

293
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,892
I NEED A FAVOR, HARO.

294
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,561
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?

295
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,610
MILEINA.

296
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,237
MR. ERDE.

297
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,990
IT'LL DEFINITELY BE
FIXED FOR THE MISSION.

298
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,575
MAKE SURE.

299
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,079
I WONDER IF KLAUS
AND MY FRIENDS ARE SAFE?

300
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,374
(Grunts)

301
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,339
HUH?

302
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,842
MR. CROSSROAD?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

303
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,678
UM, JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
THEY ASKED ME TO DO.

304
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,889
BYE!

305
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,640
HE SEEMS KIND OF...

306
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,148
I HAVE TO SEE LOUISE!

307
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,943
SHE SHOULDN'T
BE WITH THE A‐LAWS.

308
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,820
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH US.

309
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,531
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

310
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,076
JUST LEAVE WAR TO THE GUYS
WHO ACTUALLY WANT TO FIGHT!

311
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,039
WE'RE GOING TO
GET BACK EVERYTHING WE HAD.

312
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,959
THOSE TIMES, THOSE DAYS.

313
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,337
HUH?

314
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,255
Tiera: (Flashback)
IGNORING REALITY LIKE THAT

315
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,841
IS JUST A KIND
OF INADVERTENT MALICE.

316
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,177
AND THEN THINGS LIKE
THIS HAPPEN!

317
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,429
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TOOK THEIR LIVES, YOU KNOW!

318
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,141
THROUGH YOUR
OWN FOOLISH ACTIONS!

319
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,186
(Stunned gasps)

320
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,855
I WAS ABOUT TO DO
THE SAME THING.

321
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,236
BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

322
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,238
OH, LOUISE.

323
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,373
THE SOLAR REACTORS OF CHERUDIM,
