BUT IF YOU FIGHT,

10

CHERUDIM HAS LAUNCHED.

169
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,864
Mileina:
SERAVEE HAS JUST ARRIVED
ON THE CATAPULT DECK.

170
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,741
Sumeragi:
TIERIA, I'VE SENT YOU THE DATA
ON THE AIRSPACE

171
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,159
WHERE ARIOS WAS FIGHTING.

172
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,537
TRY TO AVOID COMBAT
WITH THE A‐LAWS.

173
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,788
STAY FOCUSED ON THE SEARCH.

174
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,789
ROGER.

175
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,376
TIERIA ERDE, HEADING OUT.

176
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,794
Mileina:
SERAVEE HAS LAUNCHED!

177
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,255
BEGINNING PREPARATIONS
TO SUBMERGE!

178
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,464
Ian:
SETSUNA!

179
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,925
DAMN IT, I TOLD YOU
NOT TO USE TRANS‐AM!

180
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,136
LUCKILY FOR US THE TWIN DRIVE
IS STILL WORKING,

181
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,512
BUT EVEN SO...

182
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,596
PLEASE, GET IT REPAIRED.

183
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,515
ALLELUJAH'S...

184
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,142
YEAH.

185
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,143
HEY, OVER HERE!

186
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,144
RIGHT.

187
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,062
SAJI CROSSROAD.

188
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,857
YOU SURE?
YOU HATE GUNDAMS.

189
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,151
UNTIL THE KATHARON PEOPLE
GET AWAY SAFELY,

190
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,278
I'M GONNA DO
ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP.

191
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,118
IT'S RAINING.

192
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,878
Young Peries:
ALLELUJAH?

193
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,880
ALLELUJAH!

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,339
(Desperately)
ALLELUJAH!

195
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,674
(Gasps)

196
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,720
(Panting)

197
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,019
WHERE AM I?

198
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,229
MARIE.

199
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,230
HEY, THERE.

200
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,400
I SEE YOU'RE AWAKE.

201
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,401
YES,

202
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,070
ALLELUJAH.

203
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,156
I CHECKED OUR MACHINES
PRETTY THOROUGHLY,

204
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,241
BUT ALL THE SYSTEMS
ARE DOWN IN BOTH.

205
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,660
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO
FIX THEM BY OURSELVES.

206
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,912
OH.

207
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,706
LET'S HOPE THAT
SOMEBODY COMES FOR US.

208
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,876
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

209
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,252
HMM?

210
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:50,590
HOW DID YOU EVER END UP
BECOMING THIS SOMA PERIES?

211
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,258
THEY PROBABLY...

212
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,053
IMPLANTED
ANOTHER PERSONALITY,

213
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,721
IN ORDER TO RESTORE
THE FIVE SENSES

214
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,431
THAT I'D LOST.

215
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,767
THEN THE SUPERHUMAN INSTITUTE
MUST HAVE SENT ME

216
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,769
TO THE MILITARY TO SERVE
AS A SUPER SOLDIER

217
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,480
TO MAKE SURE
THEY WOULDN'T BE CLOSED DOWN.

218
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,190
HOW TERRIBLE FOR YOU.

219
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,649
YES.

220
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,900
YES.
HMM?

221
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,109
BUT BECAUSE OF ALL THAT,

222
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,736
I COULD FINALLY SEE
WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE

223
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,029
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

224
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,073
AND I KNEW IT WAS YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

225
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,243
I THINK IT WAS
THE QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

226
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,869
YEAH, WELL, HERE I AM

227
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,788
ACTUALLY TALKING TO YOU
FACE TO FACE.

228
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,917
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT MYSELF.

229
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,545
HEY, NOW CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

230
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,004
WHAT DID YOU DO

231
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:35,051
AFTER YOU GOT AWAY
FROM THE LAB?

232
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,761
Allelujah:
WE WERE TRYING TO
AVOID DISPOSAL,

233
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,639
SO MY FRIENDS AND I ESCAPED
THE INSTITUTE TOGETHER.

234
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,724
(Panting)

235
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,648
(Sobs)

236
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,111
AT FIRST, I REGRETTED
NOT TAKING YOU WITH US.

237
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,239
BUT IT WAS A VERY GOOD THING
THAT I DIDN'T.

238
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,200
TELL ME, WHAT HAPPENED?

239
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,911
MY FRIENDS AND I WERE ABLE TO
STEAL A TRANSPORT SHIP

240
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,372
AND ESCAPE THE COLONY.

241
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,209
BUT WE HAD NO PLACE TO GO.

242
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,545
WE JUST KEPT DRIFTING IN SPACE,

243
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,382
UNTIL EVENTUALLY
WE RAN OUT OF FOOD AND AIR.

244
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,884
AND THEN...

245
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:20,638
NO! I DON'T WANNA DIE!
ALLELUJAH! ALLELUJAH!

246
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,765
IT'S NO GOOD!

247
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,475
YOU'RE GONNA DIE!

248
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,810
ALLELUJAH,
PLEASE.

249
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,895
ALLELUJAH,
NO.
PLEASE.

250
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,938
MY NAME IS...

251
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,068
Peries:
I KNEW.

252
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,697
I KNEW THAT ANOTHER PERSONALITY
EXISTED INSIDE YOU.

253
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,282
IT DOESN'T EXCUSE
WHAT I DID.

254
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,491
HALLELUJAH IS ME.

255
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,743
BUT‐‐

256
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,496
AS THE SHIP'S SOLE SURVIVOR,
I CURSED MY FATE.

257
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,834
AND THE SUPERHUMAN INSTITUTE,
AND THIS WORLD TOO.

258
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,961
THAT'S WHY,
TO CHANGE THIS WORLD,

259
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,048
I ACCEPTED THE OFFER
TO BE A GUNDAM MEISTER.

260
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,133
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING
SUPER SOLDIERS KNOW

261
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,718
IS HOW TO FIGHT.

262
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,391
MARIE, DO YOU STILL HAVE
THE MEMORIES OF SOMA PERIES?

263
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,601
I HAVE THEM.

264
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,603
AND HER PERSONALITY.

265
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:13,608
THEN YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE.

266
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:14,692
I...

267
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,989
I KILLED THEM ALL.

268
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,324
AT MY HANDS.

269
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:25,161
OUR FRIENDS,
AND OUR SIBLINGS.

270
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:30,375
I TOOK THEIR LIVES
FOR THE SECOND TIME!

271
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,251
I'M THE SAME AS YOU.

272
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,129
WITH MY HANDS,
I KILLED YOU ONCE BEFORE.

273
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,928
IN THAT ATTACK,
I KILLED THE OTHER YOU.

274
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,137
HALLELUJAH.

275
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,060
Peries:
I GAVE YOU THIS SCAR.

276
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,105
NO! SOMA PERIES DID THAT TO ME!

277
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,441
IT'S THE SAME WITH YOU.
BECAUSE I'M PERIES, TOO.

278
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,693
THAT'S WHY...

279
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,821
I'M SORRY, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

280
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,322
AND I FEEL THE SAME WAY MARIE!

281
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,158
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT
YOU WERE SOMA PERIES,

282
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,952
I COULDN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU,

283
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,954
I WANTED TO SAVE YOU SO MUCH!

284
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,747
BUT, NOW THAT I'VE DONE IT,

285
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,542
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO NEXT.

286
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,960
SOMEONE LIKE ME

287
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,129
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING
TO OFFER YOU.

288
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,301
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HERE WITH ME.

289
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,678
MARIE.

290
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,306
JUST THINK I'M FINALLY
ABLE TO MEET YOU.

291
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,392
WHEN I WAS DEPRIVED
OF MY SENSES,

292
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,353
ALL I COULD DO WAS CALL OUT
WITH QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

293
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,772
AND YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
WHO ANSWERED.

294
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,691
BECAUSE OF YOU,
I WAS ABLE TO FEEL GRATEFUL

295
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,152
FOR BEING ALIVE.

296
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,945
AND NOW I CAN
SEE YOU WITH MY OWN EYES,

297
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:45,074
I CAN SPEAK WITH YOU,
EVEN TOUCH YOU.

298
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,619
I NEVER THOUGHT
THIS DAY WOULD COME.

299
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,121
MARIE.

300
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,624
FOR ALL THIS,

301
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,543
I THANK GOD.

302
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,919
ALLELUJAH.

303
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,132
HUH?

304
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,928
THE FEDERATION?

305
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,305
I KNOW THAT MACHINE.

306
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,018
LIEUTENANT!

307
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,644
COLONEL!

308
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,937
SOMEONE YOU KNOW?

309
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,938
HUH?

310
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,566
THAT VOICE.

311
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,984
Allelujah:
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

312
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,986
EVERYONE,
MOVE TO THE CENTRAL BLOCK!

313
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,154
HIS VOICE.

314
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,198
HE'S A YOUNG MAN.

315
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,991
I SEE.

316
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,119
YOU'RE THAT YOUNG GUNDAM PILOT
FROM BACK THEN.

317
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,582
MOVE AWAY FROM THE LIEUTENANT!

318
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,125
CELESTIAL BEING!

319
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,712
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU, KLAUS!

320
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,172
SORRY TO TELL YOU,

321
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,465
BUT THE ENEMY GOT
THE THIRD BRANCH.

322
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,551
RIGHT NOW, LET'S JUST
BE HAPPY THAT WE CAN MEET.

323
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,345
THAT ASIDE, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE FEDERATION

324
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,514
IS FINALLY MOVING IN
ON THE MIDDLE EAST.

325
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,598
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

326
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,350
AFTER AZADISTAN WAS ATTACKED,

327
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,977
THE REGULAR FEDERATION FORCES
MARCHED RIGHT IN

328
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,896
AND SET UP
A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.

329
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,689
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT?

330
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,441
REALLY?
IS THIS TRUE?!

331
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,610
(Surprised gasp)
PRINCESS MARINA ISMAIL!

332
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,861
IS WHAT YOU SAID TRUE?

333
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,780
IS AZADISTAN...

334
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,241
UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS TRUE.

335
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,284
THE FEDERATION IS USING THAT
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT

336
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,453
AS A PRECEDENT FOR
DISMANTLING THE OTHER NATIONS.

337
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,747
THEY'RE REORGANIZING
THE MIDDLE EAST.

338
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,374
DISMANTLING.

339
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,252
REORGANIZING THE MIDDLE EAST.

340
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,045
RIGHT NOW,

341
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,464
THERE IS NO SUCH PLACE
AS AZADISTAN.

342
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,092
(Shocked gasp)

343
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,969
OH!

344
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,389
(Gasps)
MARINA!

345
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,890
IT CAN'T BE.

346
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,767
(Sobs)

347
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,687
AZADISTAN...

348
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,147
(Growls)

349
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,275
(Grunts)

350
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,947
YOU SAY, HER PERSONALITY
WAS OVERWRITTEN?

351
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,031
THAT'S RIGHT.

352
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,868
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'M NO LONGER SOMA PERIES.

353
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,161
I'M MARIE.

354
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,620
MARIE PARFACY.

355
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,164
MARIE.

356
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,083
SO, THAT'S YOUR REAL NAME,
LIEUTENANT?

357
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,586
THE SUPERHUMAN INSTITUTE
DID THIS TO YOU?!

358
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,588
MARIE IS A KIND HEARTED GIRL.

359
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,923
SHE'S NEVER BEEN
THE TYPE WHO WOULD KILL.

360
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,217
I'M NEVER GOING TO
HAND HER OVER TO YOU.

361
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,761
IF SHE GOES BACK TO
THE FEDERATION OR THE A‐LAWS,

362
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,805
THEY'LL USE HER
AS A SUPER SOLDIER!

363
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,349
BUT YOU'RE A MEMBER OF
CELESTIAL BEING, BOY.

364
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,767
EVEN IF SHE GOES WITH YOU,

365
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,269
SHE'LL STILL BE
DRAWN INTO THE FIGHTING.

366
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,812
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!

367
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,522
TOO BAD FOR YOU,
I'M NOT STUPID ENOUGH

368
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,900
TO BELIEVE THE WORDS OF
A TERRORIST!

369
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,110
PLEASE, BELIEVE ME!

370
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,111
(Worried gasp)

371
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,696
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

372
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,365
NO, BECAUSE OF THE CRAP
ALL YOU GUYS HAVE DONE,

373
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,660
I'VE LOST A LOT OF COUNTRYMEN
AND SOME GOOD SUBORDINATES.

374
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,455
DO YOU THINK I CAN FORGET
MY RESENTMENT SO EASILY?

375
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,832
PLEASE, COLONEL, DON'T!

376
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,292
THEN JUST SHOOT ME.

377
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,793
ALLELUJAH.

378
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,670
IN RETURN,
PROMISE ME THAT MARIE,

379
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,173
NO, SOMA PERIES,
WILL LIVE A NORMAL LIFE

380
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,884
AND NEVER BE INVOLVED IN
ANY FIGHTING AGAIN.

381
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,886
Peries:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
ALLELUJAH?

382
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,221
Allelujah:
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MARIE.

383
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,848
AS LONG AS YOU CAN LIVE
A HAPPY LIFE.

384
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,266
(Gasps)

385
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,227
PLEASE, SHOOT ME.

386
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,020
(Scared gasp)

387
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,106
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGED.

388
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,900
(Screams)
NO!

389
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,202
MARIE!

390
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,078
(Gasps)

391
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,835
(Gasps)
COLONEL?

392
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,963
A MOMENT AGO,
LIEUTENANT SOMA PERIES

393
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,173
DIED AN HONORABLE DEATH
IN BATTLE.

394
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,549
NOW, I'LL RETURN AND

395
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,636
INFORM MY SUPERIORS
OF HER FATE.

396
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,137
COLONEL.

397
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,351
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I NEVER DID THANK YOU.

398
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,811
HUH?

399
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,730
FIVE YEARS AGO, THE ACCIDENT
AT THE LOW ORBITAL STATION.

400
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,148
I WANT TO THANK YOU

401
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,110
FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION
IN THE RESCUE EFFORT.

402
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,281
Peries:
COLONEL SMIRNOV!

403
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,617
YOU ONLY EVER SENT ME OUT
ON ANTI‐GUNDAM OPERATIONS.

404
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,120
FOR THAT, AND FOR NOT USING ME
IN ANY OTHER FIGHTING,

405
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,329
I WANT TO THANK YOU.

406
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,956
THE WAY YOU SAY IT.

407
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,749
NOW I'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE

408
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,127
YOU'RE NOT THE LIEUTENANT
I USED TO KNOW.

409
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,920
AND ONE MORE THING.

410
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,921
THE SOMA PERIES
WHO'S INSIDE ME

411
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,465
WANTS YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING.

412
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,428
MORE THAN ANYTHING,
I WANTED TO BE YOUR DAUGHTER.

413
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,179
IS THAT RIGHT?

414
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,473
THOSE WORDS ARE
MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR ME.

415
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,933
(Sobs)

416
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,143
COLONEL!

417
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,401
LIVE ON.

418
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,070
KEEP ON LIVING.

419
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,698
HAPPILY, TOGETHER WITH HIM.

420
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,374
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING
YOU DID FOR ME, COLONEL.

421
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,292
HMM.

422
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,974
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
I AM LIEUTENANT SOMA PERIES,

423
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,559
SUPER SOLDIER NUMBER ONE.

424
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,854
DISPATCHED FROM THE
SUPER‐HUMAN INSTITUTE LABS.

425
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,272
YOU ARE MUCH TOO YOUNG.

426
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,110
TIEREN TAOZI.

427
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,529
THIS WILL BE MY MOBILE SUIT.

428
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,115
Sergei:
OUR ACE IN THE HOLE
AGAINST THE GUNDAMS.

429
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,160
BUT, SHE'S STILL
JUST A CHILD, REALLY.

430
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,663
(Pilots cheering)

431
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,331
Sergei:
I GUESS THIS IS
YOUR FIRST TASTE,

432
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,124
ISN'T IT, LIEUTENANT?

433
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,086
THIS IS THE SWEET TASTE
OF VICTORY.

434
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,129
THE SWEET TASTE OF VICTORY.

435
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,009
Sergei:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
NEVER MIND ABOUT ME!

436
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,636
KEEP FIGHTING, LIEUTENANT!

437
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,387
Peries:
I CAN'T!

438
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,638
HUH?

439
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,723
IF YOU WERE GONE, COLONEL,

440
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,141
I'D BE ALL ALONE.

441
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,749
MARIE?

442
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:18,134
(Peries crying)

443
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,178
THANK YOU FOR BEING ALIVE
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

444
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,638
AND MOST OF ALL,

445
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,891
THANK YOU FOR
GIVING ME A REASON TO LIVE.

446
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,309
ALLELUJAH.

447
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,989
IF HE FELL IN THE WATER,
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL FIND HIM.

448
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,532
ENEMY APPROACHING!
ENEMY APPROACHING!

449
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,618
ENEMY?!

451
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,832
HUH,

00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,125

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,134
PERIES.

ALLELUJAH DETECTED!

WHAT THE HELL?

00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,110
ALL THIS TROUBLE
TRYING TO FIND HIM

457

YOU'RE SMILING.

WHO'S THERE?!

485
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,001
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HERE?

486
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,712
I KNEW
BECAUSE WE'RE THE SAME.
