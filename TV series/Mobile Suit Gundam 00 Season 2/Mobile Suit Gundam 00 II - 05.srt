1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,715
Spokesperson #26A:
THERE IS NO DOUBT IT WAS
GUNDAMS THAT ATTACKED

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,760
THE DETENTION CENTER FOR
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,095
ARE THEY STILL AFFILIATED WITH
CELESTIAL BEING?

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,181
WHAT ABOUT THE RUMOR THESE
PARTICULAR GUNDAMS

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,141
WERE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED
BY A DISSIDENT GROUP?

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,644
WHILE THOSE ARE STILL
UNSUBSTANTIATED RUMORS,

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,396
EITHER WAY IT'S CLEAR THEY ARE
ENGAGING IN TERRORIST ACTS

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,316
THAT THREATEN OUR
PRESENT POLITICAL SYSTEM.

9
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,401
IN ORDER TO EXTERMINATE THESE
TERRORISTS...

10
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,903
THE GOVERNMENT
IS DISPATCHING

11
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,279
ITS AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE.

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,739
(TV running in background)

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,283
Regene:
PREDICTING THE REVIVAL OF
CELESTIAL BEING,

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,703
AND USING IT TO
EXPAND THE POWER OF A‐LAWS...

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,999
WAS THIS SOMETHING
YOU THOUGHT UP?

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,751
OR WAS IT
VEDA'S IDEA?

17
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,420
AH, YES... WHOSE WAS IT?

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,799
Revive:
IN ANY CASE...IT'S ABOUT TIME
FOR US TO MAKE OUR OWN MOVES.

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,010
REVIVE REVIVAL.

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,264
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
THE GADESSA'S BEEN ROLLED OUT.

21
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,391
IT'S READY TO
SORTIE RIGHT NOW...

22
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,101
JUST SAY THE WORD.

23
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,144
THANK YOU BUT THAT
WON'T BE NECESSARY, REVIVE.

24
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,729
I'VE ASKED SOMEONE ELSE
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,606
PARTICULAR
OPERATION.

26
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,774
SOMEONE ELSE?

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,777
DO YOU MEAN DIVINE?
OR DID YOU CALL IN BRING?

28
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,821
ACTUALLY, HE'S HUMAN.

29
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,322
THOUGH IN A WAY...

30
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,409
HE SEEMS TO HAVE
TRANSCENDED THOSE LIMITATIONS

31

32

37
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,678
STAYING HERE
TO WATCH THE SHIP IS BORING!

38
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,222
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

39
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,307
WE'RE OVERSEEING REPAIRS TO
PTOLEMAIOS,

40
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,601
ANALYZING THE NEW
A‐LAWS MOBILE SUIT,

41
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,604
TUNING 00'S TWIN
DRIVE SYSTEM...

42
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,648
THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO DO RIGHT NOW.

43
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,067
YEAH, BUT NONE OF
THAT STUFF IS ANY FUN!

44
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,326
Tieria:
A PLACE LIKE THIS...

45
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,329
I'M SURPRISED THE FEDERATION
HASN'T FOUND IT BY NOW.

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,832
THE FEDERATION SCATTERS GN
PARTICLES IN THE MIDDLE EAST

47
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,127
WHICH HAS
A LOT OF NON‐MEMBER NATIONS.

48
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,212
OFFICIALLY, IT'S USING THE
PARTICLE EFFECTS

49
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,714
TO DISRUPT THE COMMUNICATIONS
OF TERROR NETWORKS.

50
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,925
BUT ITS REAL GOAL
IS TO PARALYZE

51
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,719
THE ECONOMIC GROWTH
OF MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES.

52
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,430
SIMPLY PUT, DO WHAT THE
FEDERATION SAYS

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,266
OR YOU'RE IN FOR
A ROUGH TIME.

54
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,768
BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THANKS
TO THE GN PARTICLES,

55
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,187
THE KATHARON BASE HASN'T
BEEN DISCOVERED YET.

56
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,856
YOU SURE
KNOW A LOT.

57
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:51,940
OH, YOU THINK SO?

58
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,942
WELL, IT'S JUST
COMMON SENSE REALLY...

59
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,610
Announcer:
ARE YOU READING ME?

60
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,737
WE'VE CONFIRMED YOUR MOBILE
SUITS. WE'RE OPENING THE HATCH.

61
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,905
Setsuna:
ROGER.

62
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,458
(Impressed murmuring)

63
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,251
SO THESE
ARE GUNDAMS!

64
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,921
YEAH! THE HEROIC MACHINES
THAT SAVED AZADISTAN!

65
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,382
IT'S A REAL HONOR TO HAVE YOU
WITH US, CELESTIAL BEING!

66
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,675
YEAH, WELCOME!

67
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,886
WON'T YOU
SHOW US YOUR FACES?

68
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,013
OH, RIGHT.
MY FAULT.

69
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,806
Tieria:
OUR IDENTITIES
ARE SECRET!

70
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,100
DON'T BE SUCH
A STICKLER FOR RULES.

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,102
THEY HELPED US OUT,
DIDN'T THEY?

72
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,437
(Scoffs)

73
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,649
(Thinking)
THE ANTI‐GOVERNMENT
ORGANIZATION... KATHARON...

74
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,027
WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU AGREED TO
MEET WITH US.

75
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,614
I'M KLAUS GRAD OF THE KATHARON
MIDDLE EASTERN BRANCH.

76
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,324
WE REPRESENT
CELESTIAL BEING.

77
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,909
THAT'S ALL
WE CAN SAY.

78
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,911
THAT'S FINE, WE UNDERSTAND
YOUR SITUATION.

79
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,704
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
YOU RESCUED PRINCESS MARINA

80
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,539
FROM THAT CENTER.

81
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,335
FROM NOW ON WE'LL ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER SAFETY.

82
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,337
SHIRIN...

83
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,881
WOULD YOU RATHER WE LEFT YOU
WITH CELESTIAL BEING?

84
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,425
BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH A
GROUP OF DISSIDENTS?

85
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,426
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT?

86
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,222
(Sighs)

87
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,432
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE WE'D LIKE
TO LEAVE WITH YOU.

88
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,184
THIS IS SAJI CROSSROAD.

89
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,061
HE'S A CIVILIAN.

90
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,812
HE WAS ACCUSED OF BEING
A MEMBER OF KATHARON

91
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,773
EVEN THOUGH HE'S
COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

92
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,108
WELL, I'M REALLY SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

93
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,694
YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT WE'LL
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM, TOO.

94
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,196
HOLD ON,
DON'T I HAVE A SAY?

95
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,365
IT'S THE BEST OPTION
FOR ALL OF US.

96
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,742
(Laughing)
HEY, WHATCHA DOING?

97
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,703
HOLD ON, YOU CAN'T JUST
BARGE IN HERE LIKE THAT.

98
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,455
THEY HAVE KIDS HERE...

99
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,873
(Gasps)

100
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,711
DON'T TELL ME...

101
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,588
ARE YOU ACTUALLY
RAISING THESE CHILDREN

102
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,507
TO BE MEMBERS OF
KATHARON?

103
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,550
HMM?

104
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,926
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND US.

105
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,761
ALL WE'RE DOING HERE IS TAKING
CARE OF CHILDREN

106
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,179
WHO'VE BEEN ORPHANED.

107
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,598
THE FEDERATION'S
ONE‐SIDED POLICIES

108
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,849
HERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST...

109
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,685
CAUSE REAL DAMAGE.

110
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,812
AND THEY ARE
THE LIVING PROOF.

111
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,233
THOUGH BECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITED
ACCESS TO FUNDS...

112
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,902
WE CAN'T TAKE
IN EVERY CHILD WE'D LIKE TO.

113
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,071
(Gasps)

114
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,739
PRINCESS MARINA!

115
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,117
YOU ARE PRINCESS
MARINA ISMAIL, RIGHT?

116
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,577
YES, I AM.

117
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,870
HEY, I KNOW
WHO SHE IS, TOO!

118
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,790
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M REALLY
TALKING TO THE PRINCESS!

119
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,792
PRINCESS MARINA...
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT

120
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,419
IF YOU SPENT SOME TIME
WITH THE CHILDREN?

121
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,670
OF COURSE.

122
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,422
WOW, REALLY?
THIS WAY, THIS WAY!

123
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,840
ME, TOO! ME, TOO!

124
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,425
(Children giggling)

125
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,051
HMM.

126
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,054
WELL, SHE'S NOT A LIVING SYMBOL
OF OUR NATION FOR NOTHING.

127
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,807
NOW, I'D LIKE TO GET TO
THE MAIN ISSUE AT HAND...

128
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,434
IN ORDER FOR OUR GROUP,
KATHARON,

129
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,477
TO OVERTHROW THE CURRENT
FEDERATION GOVERNMENT‐‐

130
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,354
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT,

131
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,064
UNLIKE YOUR GROUP,
OUR ACTIONS

132
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,067
AREN'T BASED ON ANY
KIND OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY.

133
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,362
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING A
POSITION AGAINST THE FEDERATION.

134
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,198
THAT'S NOT SO, OUR ENEMY IS NOT
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT,

135
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,867
BUT
THE A‐LAWS.

136
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,619
Shirin:
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY, BUT DOESN'T
YOUR GOAL OF FIGHTING

137
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,537
THE GOVERNMENT'S
AUTONOMOUS FORCE

138
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,539
DIRECTLY COINCIDE
WITH OUR GOALS?

139
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,957
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

140
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,335
IN ORDER TO HALT THE EVIL DEEDS
OF THE A‐LAWS,

141
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,253
BOTH OUR GROUPS
SHOULD JOIN FORCES!

142
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,339
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE MOBILE SUITS YOU HAVE HERE

143
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,216
CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST THOSE
EQUIPPED WITH GN DRIVES.

144
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,593
BUT EVEN SO...

145
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,554
WE'RE QUITE SERIOUS ABOUT
COOPERATING WITH YOU.

146
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,848
EVEN SUPPLIES,
MAINTENANCE...

147
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,141
WE WANT TO
HELP YOUR CAUSE.

148
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,567
LOSING THE TRILOBITE LIKE THAT
WAS QUITE THE BLUNDER, MAJOR.

149
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,986
I AM ASHAMED
OF MY FAILURE, SIR.

150
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,323
COLONEL MANNEQUIN. YOU AND THE
MAJOR WILL SHARE COMMAND.

151
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,699
SIR.

152
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,660
REMEMBER THAT WE A‐LAWS HAVE TO
BE THE SHIELD

153
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,953
AND SPEAR OF THE
FEDERATION ITSELF.

154
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,330
FAILURE IS UNFORGIVABLE.

155
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,957
(Frustrated grunt)

156
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,043
SO, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

157
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,712
FROM THIS POINT ON YOU'LL BE
FOLLOWING MY ORDERS AS WELL.

158
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,256
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD,
MR. BUSHIDO?

159
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,384
I CATEGORICALLY
REFUSE.

160
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,885
WHAT?

161
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:53,056
HEADQUARTERS HAS GIVEN ME
PERMISSION TO ACT AS I SEE FIT.

162
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,684
THINK OF ME
AS A ONE‐MAN ARMY.

163
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,228
AN ARMED FORCE MADE UP OF A
SINGLE SOLDIER.

164
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,771
SUCH SELFISHNESS‐‐

165
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,606
I TOLD YOU I HAVE PERMISSION.

166
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,986
OH, SO YOU'VE BEEN MOBILIZED,
COLONEL?

167
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,532
I'VE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH A FORCE
THAT'S LOOKING FOR GUNDAMS.

168
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,950
TO THINK THE REGULAR FORCES ARE
NOW SERVING

169
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,703
AS SOME KIND OF
ERRAND BOY FOR THE A‐LAWS.

170
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,122
IS THAT SO?

171
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,874
BY THE WAY,
HOW'S HE HOLDING UP OUT THERE?

172
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,625
UHH...

173
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,713
YOU MEAN LIEUTENANT ANDREI?

174
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,215
HE'S ALWAYS VERY DEVOTED
TO HIS DUTIES.

175
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,676
Sergei:
I GUESS HE'S
SENDING ME A MESSAGE.

176
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,011
AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL,
HE HATES ME.

177
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:32,804
SIR?

178
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,514
I WAS A DILIGENT SOLDIER,

179
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,434
BUT I WAS NEVER REALLY WHAT
YOU'D CALL A GOOD PARENT TO HIM.

180
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,060
COLONEL I...

181
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,687
(Sighs)

182
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,982
COLONEL,

183
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,943
I'M THINKING OF TAKING YOU UP ON
THAT OFFER WE DISCUSSED.

184
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,653
OFFER?

185
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,156
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT YOU
ADOPTING ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER.

186
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,615
DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?

187
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,452
WE CAN GO OVER THE DETAILS
NEXT TIME WE MEET.

188
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,828
LATER.

189
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,417
I AM A FORTUNATE GIRL.

190
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,755
PRINCESS MARINA!
LOOK AT THESE, TOO!

191
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,382
YES, WELL,
BEFORE WE GET STARTED...

192
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,635
DID YOU WANT
TO COME OVER HERE TOO?

193
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:15,847
HMM.

194
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,559
HUH?

195
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,020
THERE.

196
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,105
COME AND PLAY WITH US,
LITTLE ONE.

197
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,982
UH...

198
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,442
(Hesitating)

199
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,115
(Whimpers)

200
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,414
(Gunshot)

201
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,793
(Tense grunt)

202
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,960
(Sighs)

203
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,923
THOSE CHILDREN ARE YOUR
VICTIMS TOO, YOU KNOW.

204
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,133
VICTIMS OF THE WORLD
THAT YOU GUYS CHANGED.

205
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,344
IT'S TRUE.
I KNOW IT.

206
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,513
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL ANYTHING?

207
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,598
SURE, I FEEL SOMETHING.
THAT'S WHY I'D NEVER

208
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,351
BE ABLE TO JOIN
THEM AND PLAY LIKE THAT.

209
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,144
SO, IF YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

210
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,896
THEN WHY DO YOU KEEP
FIGHTING?

211
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,148
I HAVE MY REASONS.

212
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,026
I DOUBT
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

213
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,904
HATE ME IF YOU WANT.

214
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,823
SETSUNA...

215
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,074
(Growling)

216
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,369
SETSUNA, WAIT.

217
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,620
(Panting)

218
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,704
ARE YOU LEAVING?

219
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,664
THAT'S RIGHT...

220
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,374
BEFORE YOU GO,
I HAVE ONE LAST

221
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,918
IMPORTANT REQUEST
TO ASK OF YOU.

222
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,711
HUH?

223
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,505
WELL, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
THERE'S NO CHANCE

224
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,549
CELESTIAL BEING IS
GOING TO JOIN US.

225
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,925
I GUESS NOT.

226
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,552
BUT THEIR RESPONSE
WAS ENOUGH.

227
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,805
THE FIGHT AGAINST A‐LAWS IS
GOING TO BE EXTREMELY BRUTAL.

228
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,682
THAT MEANS SOMETIME
IN THE FUTURE,

229
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,142
WE WILL BE JOINING
HANDS AND WORKING TOGETHER.

230
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,353
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
JEAN ONE?

231
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,312
I GUESS...

232
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,356
HARD TO SAY, REALLY...

233
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,901
HEY, HOW LONG ARE YOU
GUYS GOING TO KEEP GOOFING OFF?

234
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,778
GET BACK TO YOUR STATIONS AND
START WORKING!

235
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,281
Allelujah:
IS OUR MEETING OVER?

236
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,658
Setsuna:
YEAH. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I HAVE TO DO.

237
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,868
Tieria:
SOMETHING ELSE?

238
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,452
I'LL BE ESCORTING
MARINA ISMAIL

239
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,288
BACK TO THE COUNTRY OF
AZADISTAN.

240
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,164
SO, YOU'RE SAYING...

241
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,875
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?

242
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,544
I'M TRULY SORRY FOR ALL
THE TROUBLE I'M CAUSING.

243
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,628
HMM...

244
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,630
WELL, YOU CAN'T GO BACK
IN A GUNDAM.

245
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,674
ON THE OFF CHANCE
YOU'RE DISCOVERED...

246
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,176
YOU COULD BRING FURTHER HARM
DOWN UPON AZADISTAN.

247
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,388
THEN LET ME HAVE
THE USE OF THIS CRAFT.

248
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,764
YOU CAN USE
THE GUNDAM.

249
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,516
THAT'LL WORK.

250
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,227
AND DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE
TO COME BACK, EITHER.

251
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,438
THAT'S ABSURD.

252
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,399
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
OVER THESE PAST FOUR YEARS?

253
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,484
FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY
TELL A JOKE IS...

254
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,028
I WAS SERIOUS
BACK THERE.

255
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:35,820
WHAT?

256
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,071
(Chuckles)

257
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,657
NOW, THAT WAS A JOKE.

258
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,247
CELESTIAL BEING AND
KATHARON...

259
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,583
BOTH OF THEM ARE
GROUPS THAT CAUSE FIGHTING!

260
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,710
I CAN'T STAY
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS!

261
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,591
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING THERE?

262
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,426
NOTHING!
I WAS JUST...

263
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,970
OH, YOU'RE WITH CELESTIAL BEING,
AREN'T YOU?

264
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,764
HUH?

265
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,975
I'VE GOT COMRADES
IN TOWN I NEED TO TALK TO.

266
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,686
NEAREST TOWN IS A LONG WAY FROM
HERE, TAKE A VEHICLE!

267
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,104
HUH?

268
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,940
THANK YOU!

269
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,362
HAVE YOU SEEN PRINCESS MARINA
WANDERING AROUND?

270
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,821
I JUST SAW HER WITH SOME
CELESTIAL BEING PEOPLE

271
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,114
A FEW
MOMENTS AGO.

272
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,991
SHE WAS WITH THEM?

273
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,826
Announcer:
THE GUNDAMS ARE RETURNING TO
THEIR MOTHER SHIP!

274
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,577
OPEN THE HATCH!

275
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,578
(Gasps)

276
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,540
COULD...
COULD SHE BE...?

277
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,292
WE HAVE TO
STOP THEM FROM TAKING OFF!

278
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,669
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOW.

279
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,507
MARINA...

280
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:50,436
♪

281
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,107
I WONDER IF I CAN MAKE IT ACROSS
THE WHOLE DESERT IN THIS.

282
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,108
HUH?

283
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,655
(Stammering)
THE FEDERATION!

284
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,417
WHY ARE YOU CROSSING THE DESERT
WITH SO LITTLE EQUIPMENT?

285
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,376
(Panting)

286
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,714
WE GOT A HIT
ON HIS BIOMETRICS.

287
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,590
OUR FRIEND HERE IS A
MEMBER OF KATHARON!

288
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,925
I'M NOT!

289
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,385
I SWEAR I'VE NEVER BEEN
A MEMBER OF THAT GROUP!

290
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,803
ENOUGH
OF YOUR LYING!

291
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,305
STOP, THERE'S NO NEED
TO ROUGH HIM UP!

292
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,890
WHA‐‐
COLONEL!

293
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,017
Sergei:
GET OUT.

294
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,601
I WANT TO HEAR
HIS STORY.

295
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,853
(Growling)

296
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,482
YOU'RE NOT REALLY A SOLDIER,
ARE YOU, BOY?

297
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,692
HMM?

298
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,111
I'M AN OLD SOLDIER,
I CAN TELL THESE THINGS.

299
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,947
YOU DON'T HAVE THE EYES OF
SOMEONE WHO'S SEEN COMBAT.

300
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,075
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE CLEARLY
NOT A MEMBER OF KATHARON.

301
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,536
SO, WHAT IN THE WORLD
HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

302
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,204
HUH.

303
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:54,167
YOU'VE BEEN TRAVELING WITH
CELESTIAL BEING, HAVEN'T YOU?

304
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,084
(Gasps)

305
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,711
IT'S PLAUSIBLE.

306
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,422
ACCORDING TO THE DATA,
UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO,

307
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,258
YOU WERE WORKING ON
COLONY DEVELOPMENT AT PROUD,

308
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,427
WHERE THE GUNDAMS FIRST
RE‐APPEARED.

309
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,387
AND NOW YOU'RE IN THE SAME
REGION WHERE THERE WAS

310
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,973
A BATTLE YESTERDAY
WITH THE GUNDAMS.

311
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,058
IT'S NOTHING.

312
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,893
IT'S JUST
SIMPLE REASONING.

313
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,606
I'M...

314
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,900
...NOT WITH KATHARON OR
CELESTIAL BEING.

315
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,359
I BELIEVE YOU.

316
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,987
I JUST WANT TO HEAR
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY, BOY.

317
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,947
I WON'T
USE IT AGAINST YOU.

318
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,366
(Gasps)

319
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,119
Saji:
CAN YOU GET ME
CLEARED OF ALL SUSPICIONS?

320
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,245
Sergei:
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

321
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,082
Zinin:
CAPTAIN BARACK ZININ, SIR.

322
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,125
WITH ALL FIVE MEMBERS
OF SPACE TEAM FOUR.

323
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,337
PRESENT
AND REPORTING FOR DUTY.

324
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,338
GOOD WORK, TEAM.

325
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,298
Goodman:
WHAT?
IS THIS TRUE?

326
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,300
I'LL ISSUE THE ORDERS
IMMEDIATELY.

327
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,885
IF WE LEFT IT
TO THAT NAÏVE WOMAN,

328
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,054
SHE'D BE SURE TO
MESS THIS UP.

329
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,597
EXCELLENT NEWS,
COMMANDER.

330
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,725
WE'VE DISCOVERED
KATHARON'S MILITARY BASE,

331
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,311
AND THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE
THE GUNDAMS ARE THERE TOO.

332
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,979
WE NEED TO ATTEND
TO THIS IMMEDIATELY.

333
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,439
SIR!

334
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,691
COMMANDER, PERMISSION FOR OUR
TEAM TO SORTIE AS WELL.

335
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,068
NO NEED
TO PUSH YOURSELVES.

336
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,861
TAKE IT EASY
FOR NOW.

337
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,196
(Frustrated sigh)

338
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,615
THE GUNDAMS ARE OUT THERE,
AND YET...

339
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,951
Kati:
WH... WHAT KIND
OF AN ORDER IS THIS?

340
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,121
WE'RE EXPECTED TO MAKE USE OF
AUTOMATONS IN KILL MODE?

341
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,497
THIS IS CRAZY!

342
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,249
THIS OPERATION IS BARBARIC!

343
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,625
COLONEL.

344
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,211
AN ORDER FROM THAT HIGH UP HAS
TO BE STRICTLY FOLLOWED.

345
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,046
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU DON'T
THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

346
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,589
ABOUT THE DETAILS
OF THIS OPERATION?

347
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,758
NOW WHY WOULD I
THINK SUCH A THING?

348
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,136
WE'RE FIGHTING THE
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT FORCES.

349
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,597
THERE'S NO NEED TO SHOW THEM
ANY MERCY, NOW IS THERE?

350
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,974
(Frustrated sigh)

351
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,441
AN OPERATION
LIKE THIS ONE...

352
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,360
NOW, I FINALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY THE COLONEL

353
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,029
WAS SO FIRMLY
OPPOSED TO MY REASSIGNMENT.

354
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,948
YOU'VE GOT HIM WRONG,
LIEUTENANT.

355
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,616
COLONEL SMIRNOV
IS THE KIND OF MAN

356
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,410
WHO WOULD ABANDON HIS OWN
FLESH AND BLOOD

357
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,953
TO MAKE SURE HE
FULFILLED HIS DUTY.

358
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,913
HIS FLESH AND BLOOD?

359
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,499
YES, THAT MAN ALLOWED
MY MOTHER TO DIE.

360
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,458
(Gasps)

361
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,086
(Uneasy sigh)

362
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,174
Liu Mei:
SO...

363
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:11,637
THE A‐LAWS KNOW
WHERE THE DISSIDENTS ARE.

364
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,097
I UNDERSTAND.

365
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,641
I'LL LET TIERIA
AND THE OTHERS KNOW.

366
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,605
Sergei:
YOU IDIOT!

367
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,231
(Slam)

368
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,026
WHO TOLD YOU TO
REPORT THIS INFO TO A‐LAWS?

369
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,986
BUT SIR, IT'S OUR DUTY
TO REPORT THESE THINGS!

370
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,197
THAT IS MY DECISION TO MAKE,
SOLDIER!

371
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,781
HUH?

372
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,200
MR. CROSSROAD.

373
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,410
COME WITH ME, YOU HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

374
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,870
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

375
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,247
I'M AFRAID YOUR PRESENCE HERE
WAS LEAKED TO THE A‐LAWS.

376
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,250
THEY'RE A GROUP THAT OPERATES
ABOVE THE LAW.

377
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,502
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AUTHORITY TO
PROTECT YOU WHEN THEY SHOW UP.

378
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,587
BUT THAT'S‐‐

379
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,880
YOU HAVE TO HURRY!

380
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,552
SOMEBODY LEAKED THE FACT
THAT I WAS THERE...

381
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,012
SO, DOES THAT MEAN THAT‐‐

382
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,597
HUH?

383
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,681
THAT COLOR!

384
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,894
Feldt:
EMERGENCY CODED MESSAGE
FROM WANG LIU MEI.

385
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,771
APPARENTLY AN A‐LAWS
MOBILE SUIT TEAM

386
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,856
IS HEADED DIRECTLY
FOR THE KATHARON BASE.

387
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,191
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?

388
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,776
WE'RE GOING
TO GO HELP THEM.

389
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,569
ANTI‐SATELLITE
OPTICAL CAMOUFLAGE,

390
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,154
EMERGENCY ASCENT!

391
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,031
TELL THE GUNDAMS
TO GET READY TO LAUNCH.

392
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,574
THAT'S A ROGER!

393
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,910
Feldt:
PTOLEMY BEGINNING
EMERGENCY ASCENT.

394
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,871
0043 UNTIL SURFACING.

395
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,539
THE A‐LAWS
FOUND THEIR BASE...?

396
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,376
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF INNOCENT
CHILDREN WITH THEM, AS WELL.

397
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,710
HURRY IT UP!

398
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,671
DAMN IT, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF
TIME, HURRY IT UP!

399
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,842
(Siren wails)

400
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,970
IT'S AN A‐LAWS
MOBILE SUIT TEAM!

401
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,888
WAIT, ARE THEY GOING TO
ATTACK THIS PLACE?

402
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,139
HOW MANY OF THEM
ARE COMING?

403
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,225
BUT HOW DID THEY
FIND OUT ABOUT OUR BASE?

404
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,185
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FROM
CELESTIAL BEING, COULD IT?

405
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,853
QUICKLY, GET THE CHILDREN
TO THE SHELTER!

406
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,854
O‐OKAY!

407
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,023
KLAUS, LET'S GO OUT
AND FIGHT!

408
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,067
NO, WE'RE STILL
TOO BADLY OUTMATCHED!

409
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,402
WE'LL STRENGTHEN
OUR DEFENSES

410
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,487
AND WAIT FOR CELESTIAL BEING
TO COME TO OUR AID!

411
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,697
ARE THEY EVEN
GOING TO SHOW UP?

412
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,948
I BELIEVE IN THEM!

413
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:54,949
(Startled yelling)

414
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,158
THEY'RE BOMBING US?

415
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,452
(Panicked murmuring)

416
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,621
(People screaming)

417
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,250
Andrei:
I HAVE VISUAL CONFIRMATION

418
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,168
OF A STRUCTURE THAT
LOOKS LIKE AN ENEMY BASE.

419
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:06,961
HUH?

420
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,465
(Rapid blasting)

421
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,009
Andrei:
ENEMY MOBILE SUITS!

422
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,014
THEY'RE STILL USING OUTDATED
MOBILE SUITS.

423
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20,808
(Frustrated sigh)

424
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,441
Commander #3:
COMMENCE MOPPING‐UP
OPERATION OF ENEMY BASE.

425
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,859
RELEASE AUTOMATONS.

426
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:30,818
Pilot #30A:
ROGER.

427
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,902
THEY WOULDN'T...

428
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,699
Pilot #30A:
RELEASING AUTOMATONS.

429
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,825
NO, WAIT A MINUTE!

430
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,495
(Coughing)

431
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,581
WAIT...
THOSE ARE...

432
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,838
(Mechanical marching)

433
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,798
THEY'RE MILITARY
AUTOMATONS!

434
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,634
EVERYONE,
FALL BACK, NOW!

435
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,052
FALL BACK!

436
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,221
(Blast)

437
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,808
DAMN, WE'RE TOO LATE!

438
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,518
WHAT ABOUT
THE KATHARON PEOPLE?

439
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,103
Lyle:
I'LL LEAVE THIS
TO YOU GUYS!

440
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,899
GET A MOVE ON,
GUNDAM!

441
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,988
Commander #3:
PERIES! INTERCEPT
THAT FIRST GUNDAM!

442
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,156
Peries:
ROGER!

443
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,952
(Blasting rapidly)

444
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,540
HE'S GOT
SOME MOVES!

445
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,626
Commander #3:
ALL MACHINES
AFTER THE OTHER GUNDAMS!

446
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,378
Bushido:
I'LL BE SITTING
THIS ONE OUT.

447
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,962
Commander #3:
MR. BUSHIDO?
BUT WHY?

448
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,673
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!

449
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,259
(Gasping)
THIS IS...

450
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,225
IS THIS...

451
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,311
IS THIS SOMETHING
HUMAN BEINGS WOULD DO?

452
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,856
(Gasping)

453
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,733
Allelujah:
MASS MURDER
WITH AUTOMATED WEAPONS.

454
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,447
(Pilot screaming)

455
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,659
YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU AVOID
PULLING THE TRIGGER YOURSELF

456
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,412
YOU WON'T FEEL ANY OF THE
GUILT FROM COMMITTING THE CRIME?

457
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,875
READY DOUBLE BAZOOKA...

458
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,085
BURST MODE!

459
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,509
Commander #3:
WE'VE ACHIEVED OUR
INITIAL OBJECTIVE!

460
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,428
TIME TO WITHDRAW!

461
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,430

Lyle:
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

465
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,233
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR THIS, A‐LAWS!

466
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,904
DON'T YOU DARE RUN!

467
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,449
DON'T YOU DARE
RUN AWAY FROM ME, A‐LAWS!

468
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,833
Feldt:
IT'S HORRIBLE...

A‐LAWS...

THAT'S RIGHT.

473
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,301
THIS IS THE ENEMY
WE ARE SWORN TO DEFEAT!

474
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,018
(Sighing)
I'M A SUPER‐SOLDIER.

475
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,561
I ONLY EXIST
TO FIGHT.

476
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,857
AND YET I TRIED TO FIND
THE HAPPINESS

477
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,400
THAT NORMAL PEOPLE
TAKE FOR GRANTED.

478
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,865
COLONEL, COULD THIS BE
MY PUNISHMENT...

479
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:23,574
FOR WANTING THAT?

480
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,751
(Grieving sighs)

481
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,298
ALL BECAUSE...

482
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,383
ALL THIS BECAUSE
I TALKED TO THEM...

483
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,722
(Sobbing)

484
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,890
THIS CAN'T BE...

485
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,434
THIS CAN'T BE...

486
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,686
(Sobbing)

487
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,482
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

SHORTLY.

494
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,701
I'M RETURNING
AFTER ALL.

495
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,202
THAT'S RIGHT.

496
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,621
BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY.

497
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,622
HMM.

498
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,047
(Gasping)
AZADISTAN IS...

499
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,049
EVERYTHING'S BURNING...

500
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,384
Marina:
BUT WHY IS AZADISTAN...

501
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,136
WHY?

502
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,846
THE SCALE...

503
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,057
NOT TERRORISTS.

504
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,642
(Gasping)

505
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,851
IT'S...

506
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,811
A GUNDAM!

507
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,439
AND THAT COLOR!

508
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,857
IS IT HIM?

509
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,526
Al‐Saachez:
THAT'S RIGHT!

510
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,111
YOU GUESSED RIGHT, PUNK!

511
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:11,950
Narrator:
A LOST PAST,
A LOST NORMAL LIFE,

512
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,619
A LOST NATION...

513
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,538
EACH ONE OF THESE IS
TEARING APART SOMEONE'S HEART.

514
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,874
NEXT EPISODE:
"SCARS".

515

THE ACHE FROM THE
DULL PAIN CALLED REGRET.
