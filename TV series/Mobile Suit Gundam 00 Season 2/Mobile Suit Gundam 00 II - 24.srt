THE WAY TO BUILD A FUTURE
IS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER!

DON'T YOU FEEL THAT WAY,
TOO, LOUISE?!

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,720
MY FUTURE WAS
STOLEN AWAY FROM ME

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,722
BY CELESTIAL BEING!

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,643
THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO STARTED THE FIGHTING!

6
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,728
AND THEY TWISTED THE WORLD!

SO YOU'RE SAJI, ARE YOU?!

IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU

TO THE LIEUTENANT!

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,873
JUST DIE!

THEY'RE SUICIDAL!

YOU'LL NEVER BREAK FREE NOW,

YOU WON'T SURVIVE!

SO WHAT IF I DON'T?!

17
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,895

IF IT MEANS YOUR DESTRUCTION,
IT'S WORTH IT!

YOU'RE WRONG!

23
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,722
WE ARE NOT
THE REAL INNOVATORS HERE!

24
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,100
WE WERE ARTIFICIALLY CREATED
TO HELP BRING ABOUT

25
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,103
THE EMERGENCE
OF THE TRUE INNOVATORS.

26
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,313
WE ARE INNOVADES!

SUCCEEDED IN EVOLVING HIMSELF?

Tieria:
WHAT?

31
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,076
I HAVE SURPASSED
THE INNOVADES,

00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,287
AND AM NOW A BEING EVEN GREATER
THAN A PUREBRED INNOVATOR.

33
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,705
THAT'S UTTER NONSENSE!

Billy:
I WON'T MISS
THIS TIME.

35
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,423
BUT WHY ARE YOU...

36
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,757
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,012
YOU SHOULD THROW DOWN
YOUR WEAPON AND SURRENDER.

38
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,265
YOU'LL BE TREATED FAIRLY.

Sumeragi:
BILLY, WHY?

40
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,226
YOU DON'T KNOW WHY?

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,229
I'M DOING THIS TO
REALIZE A PERMANENT PEACE.

42
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,731
AND THE GREATEST OBSTACLE
TO ACHIEVING THAT GOAL

43
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,109
IS YOU AND YOUR COMRADES.

44
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,112
AND YOU'RE WILLING TO LIVE UNDER
THE THUMB OF THE INNOVATORS?!

45
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,907
LOGICALLY, IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
TO BE LED BY YOUR SUPERIORS.

46
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,201
BESIDES,
THESE BEINGS WERE CREATED

47
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,746
TO GUIDE HUMANITY ON THE PATH
TO A PEACEFUL EXISTENCE,

48
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,332
AND THEY ASK FOR
NOTHING AT ALL IN RETURN.

49
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,752
IT'S THE IDEAL RELATIONSHIP,
DON'T YOU THINK?

50
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,005
BUT WHAT YOU GIVE UP IN RETURN
IS YOUR FREEDOM!

51
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,799
TOTAL FREEDOM MEANS
THE ABANDONMENT OF MORALITY,

52
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,719
AND THAT PATH CAN ONLY
LEAD TO DESTRUCTION.

53
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,388
WITHIN ANY ORDERED
SOCIAL STRUCTURE,

54
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,641
THE PEOPLE ENJOY
A LIMITED FORM OF FREEDOM.

55
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,895
IT'S FAR BETTER TO BE INSIDE
A CAGE WHERE YOU'RE PROTECTED.

56
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,771
THAT IS WHAT
WE CALL PEACE.

57
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,898
THAT'S CRAZY!

58
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,733
YOU SAY
YOU'LL ERADICATE WAR,

59
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,318
BUT IN REALITY
YOU'RE THE ONES

60
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,944
PLUNGING THE WORLD INTO CHAOS!

61
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,198
WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY,

62
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,326
THE WAY TO END WAR IS TO ENTRUST
THE WORLD TO THE INNOVATORS!

63
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,744
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME

64
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,787
PEOPLE HAVE SOUGHT
TO CREATE A PERFECT UTOPIA

65
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,081
AND NOW WE ARE ON THE VERGE
OF REALIZING IT!

66
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,834
(Gasps)

67
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:57,380
A FUTURE THAT WE DON'T BUILD
OURSELVES IS SIMPLY MEANINGLESS.

68
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,925
UNLESS WE SOMEHOW CORRECT
OUR PAST MISTAKES

69
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,384
THROUGH OUR OWN EFFORTS,

70
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,429
A TRUE FUTURE WILL
NEVER ARRIVE.

71
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,765
AND THAT'S THE REASON
I'LL KEEP ON FIGHTING!

72
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,937
YOU'RE CERTAINLY PERSISTENT,

00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,718
AT THIS RATE,
PTOLEMY'S FINISHED!

167
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,845
NOT YET! WE'RE NOT
GONNA GIVE UP YET!

168
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,971
Setsuna:
MILEINA! FELDT!

169
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,681
WE'RE STARTING TO
RUN OUT OF MISSILES!

170
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,350
THIS IS HOW IT ENDS?!

171
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,810
Setsuna:
IAN! LINDA!

172
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,897
EVERYONE'S LIVES ARE
FADING AWAY.

173
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,151
(Yells)

174
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,696
Lyle:
YOU BASTARD!

175
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:18,701
I AM NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN!

176
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,001
WHAT... WHAT IS THIS?!

177
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,878
THESE GN PARTICLES ARE...

178
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,762
Klaus:
LOOK AT THIS.

179
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,391
THIS LIGHT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE FIGHTING.

180
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,393
GN PARTICLES.

181
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,312
THERE'S A RADIANCE.

182
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,856
Shirin:
WHAT IS THAT?

183
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,524
(Children gasping)

184
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,692
SETSUNA.

185
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,193
(Gasps)

186
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,905
(Thinking)
I'M CERTAIN THAT THIS LIGHT IS

187
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,367
THE LIGHT FROM
SETSUNA'S BATTLE.

188
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,245
THE RADIANCE OF HIS LIFE.

189
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,956
Lockon (in memory):
SETSUNA. YOU COULD CHANGE.

190
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,333
I COULDN'T, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO
DO IT FOR ME.

191
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,002
THAT'S RIGHT.

192
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,171
IN ORDER TO CREATE THE FUTURE,
WE HAVE TO REFORM.

193
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,716
WE HAVE TO CHANGE!

194
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,180
SOMETHING'S DISRUPTING
MY QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES!

195
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,807
IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT GUNDAM!

196
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,810
IF WE HAD IT FOR OURSELVES,
THEN WE'D HAVE THE ADVANTAGE!

197
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,395
Regene:
THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

198
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,606
REGENE REGETTA?!

199
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,859
Regene:
WHEN A PUREBRED INNOVATOR'S
QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES

200

WORK TOGETHER
WITH THE TWIN DRIVE,

201
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,906
THE PURIFIED GN PARTICLES

202
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,618
CAUSE THE EXPANSION
OF PEOPLES' CONSCIOUSNESS.

203
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,703
YOU'VE COMPLETED
YOUR EVOLUTION,

204
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,623
SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

205
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,876
IT IS CLEAR.
YOU ARE A TRUE INNOVATOR!

206
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,464
WHAT THE...?

207
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,549
WHAT'S THIS DISGUSTING
FEELING?

208
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,550
Lyle:
DAMN YOU!

209
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,718
A VOICE?!

210
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,221
Lyle:
YOU TOOK MY BROTHER
AND MY FAMILY.

211
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,015
YOU DAMN MONSTER!

212
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,142
HA, SO YOU'RE
HIS BROTHER?!

213
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,102
SOMETHING FUNNY
ABOUT THAT?!

214
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,646
Al‐Saachez:
IT MAKES KILLING YOU
EVEN SWEETER!

215
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,440
WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH YOU?!

216
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,484
IT'S JUST WHO I AM!

217
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,696
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

218
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,454
Allelujah:
WAS THAT SETSUNA?!

219
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,289
Hallelujah:
DON'T LOOK AWAY, ALLELUJAH!

220
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,916
HALLELUJAH?

221
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,293
JUST KEEP YOUR EYES ON MARIE!

222
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,711
HMM.

223
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:38,967
(Rapid gunfire)

224
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,261
Billy:
WH‐WHAT IS THIS
STRANGE PHENOMENON?

225
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,974
I'M HEARING ALL THESE VOICES
INSIDE MY HEAD!

226
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,767
Sumeragi:
I'M SORRY, BILLY.

227
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,227
(Gasps)

228
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,146
I KNEW HOW YOU FELT ABOUT ME,
AND I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

229
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,940
JUST...
JUST STOP IT!

230
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,692
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT!

231
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:01,739
I'M DOING ALL THIS TO HELP
REALIZE A PERMANENT PEACE!

232
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,701
I DECIDED THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO FIGHT FOR!

233
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,704
WITH YOU...

234
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,082
(Gasps)

235
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,001
YOU...

236
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,922
I‐I'VE ALWAYS WANTED...
WANTED TO...

237
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,924
I JUST...

238
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:27,557
(Sobbing)

239
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,309
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU,
YOU KNOW.

240
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,898
(Gasps)

241
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,900
ALLELUJAH?
(Gasps)

242
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,902
A VOICE?

243
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,946
Peries' voice:
IS THAT LIEUTENANT ANDREI?

244
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,239
ANOTHER VOICE?

245
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,908
IS THAT LIEUTENANT PERIES?

246
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,452
Peries:
I CANNOT FORGIVE YOU.

247
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,871
BUT EVEN IF I KEPT HATING YOU,

248
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,914
AND EVENTUALLY TOOK
MY REVENGE ON YOU,

249
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,709
THE COLONEL WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
HAPPY WITH IT.

250
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,254
SHUT UP!
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A TRAITOR!

251
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,881
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

252
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,133
THE COLONEL WAS
YOUR OWN FATHER ANDREI.

253
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,052
Andrei:
HE BETRAYED THE MILITARY,
AS WELL!

254
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,138
HE JUST GOT HIS COMEUPPANCE!
HIS ACTIONS WERE RUINING

255
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,098
OUR CHANCE TO CREATE
A PERMANENT PEACE!

256
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,558
(Sighs)

257
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,810
Peries:
THE COLONEL WASN'T
THAT KIND OF PERSON.

258
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,187
YOU'RE WRONG!

259
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,481
HE'S THE KIND OF MAN WHO WOULD
JUST LET MY MOTHER DIE!

260
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,817
HOW COULD I BELIEVE HIM?!

261
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:24,113
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY TO
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?

262
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,324
HE WAS JUST SO...

263
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:30,953
THAT MAN NEVER SAID ANYTHING
TO ME! NO EXCUSES, NO APOLOGY!

264
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,456
HE NEVER EVEN TRIED TO
UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS!

265
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,416
AND THAT'S WHY I KILLED HIM!

266
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,502
WITH MY OWN HANDS!

267
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,879
YOU WANTED HIM TO
UNDERSTAND YOU,

268
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,506
BUT DID YOU MAKE AN EFFORT

269
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,925
TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND
THE COLONEL IN RETURN?

270
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,259
HUH?

271
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:49,388
I'M CERTAIN THAT THE COLONEL
WAS ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU.

272
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,807
(Gasps)

273
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,108
(Weeping)
THEN WHY DIDN'T HE SAY
ANYTHING BACK THEN?!

274
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,027
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO UNDERSTAND

275
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,696
IF YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING?

276
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,782
YOU'VE GOTTA TELL ME!

277
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:12,995
(Weeping)

278
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,705
OH, COLONEL.

279
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,168
80% OF ENEMY FORCES
DESTROYED!

280
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,586
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!

281
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,712
Mileina:
ALL RIGHTY!

282
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,713
HMM.

283
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,006
WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS!

284
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,133
YEAH!

285
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,843
WH‐WHAT'S THIS?

286
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,637
IT DOESN'T HURT AS MUCH.

287
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,721
(Grunts)

288
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,892
(Saji weeping)

289
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,561
LOUISE.

290
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,605

291
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,023
Louise:

00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,024

293
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,026

296
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,948
HUH?

297
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,908
LOUISE.

298
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,994
SAJI.

299
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,245
I JUST...

300
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,164
I CAN'T.

301
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,832
(Gasps)

302
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,959
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

303
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,836
I UNDERSTAND.

304
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,546
(Gasps)

305
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,933
Louise:
HEY, WHAT IS THIS WARM LIGHT?

306
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,645
IT'S LIKE MY HEART IS
MELTING AWAY.

307
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,023
IT'S FROM SETSUNA.

308
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,733
SETSUNA?

309
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,903
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

310
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,905
Saji:
THE LIGHT OF HIS HEART.

311
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,782
A LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATES
THE FUTURE.

312
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,711
VEDA'S RIGHT THERE.

313
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,881
(Thud)

314
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,551
RED HARO, LOOK AFTER THE SUIT.

315
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,886
Red Haro:
ROGER! ROGER!

316
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,390
(Grunts)

317
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,768
WHAT WAS WITH ALL THOSE
GN PARTICLES?

318
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,103
THEY DISRUPTED
MY QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

319
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,439
Regene:
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
THIS MOMENT.

320
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,441
REGENE REGETTA?

00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,818
(Gasps)

322
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,195
HUH?

323
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,617
VEDA JUST REJECTED THE LINK
I SHARE WITH IT!

324
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,244
DOES THIS MEAN
THE SYSTEM'S BEEN‐‐

Regene:

WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET YOU
JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT.

327
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,625
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, TIERIA?

328
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,710
(Shocked gasp)

329
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,942
IT'S SERAPHIM!
IT'S DEPLOYED THE TRIAL FIELD!

330
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,568
ALL THE UNITS LINKED TO VEDA

331
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,696
ARE SHUTTING DOWN
ONE AFTER THE OTHER!

332
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,034
WE'VE BEEN CUT OFF
FROM VEDA'S SUPPORT!

333
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,494
(Grunts)

334
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,247
Hiling:
DAMN YOU, TIERIA ERDE!

335
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,958
Feldt:
WE'VE TAKEN VEDA BACK.

336
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,877
THAT MEANS
THE BATTLE IS OVER!

337
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,337
LOOK, DEAR!

338
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,090
SO YOU FINALLY USED IT
AFTER ALL, HEY, TIERIA?

339
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,011
HUH?

340
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,554
WHAT HAPPENED?

341
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,514
IT'S TIERIA!

342
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,684
Allelujah:
MARIE!

343
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,061
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
MARIE?

344
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,856
Peries:
I'M ALL RIGHT.
YES, I'M ALL RIGHT, NOW.

345
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,524
WHAT?

346
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,277
THANKS TO YOU, ALLELUJAH.

347
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,280
(Sighs)

348
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,909
Al‐Saachez:
WHAT... WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?!

349
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,910
DAMN IT!

350
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,704
COME ON, GET THE HELL UP
AND MOVE!

351
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,166
HMM?

352
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,502
SEEMS I'M FEELING
THE SAME WAY MY BROTHER DID.

353
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,713
BECAUSE I CAN NEVER FORGIVE
THIS GUY!

354
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,887
(Exhales)

355
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,306
(Beeps)

356
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,474
HUH?

357
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,725
WHAT?!

358
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,980
WAIT, YOU BASTARD!

00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,650

STOP RIGHT THERE!

361
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,696
(Grunts)

362
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,328
WHAT HE DID.

363
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:27,917
THIS GUY TOOK MY FATHER,
MY MOTHER, AMY,

364
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,835
AND MY BROTHER!

365
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,923
Anew:
LYLE, WE CAME TO UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER, DIDN'T WE?

366
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,299
(Gasps)

367
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,093
WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER.

368
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,435
SUCKER!

369
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,020
(Glass shatters)

370
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,993
Lyle:
ANEW, THANKS TO YOU,

371
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,413
I CAME TO BELIEVE
THAT A WORLD IN WHICH

372
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:09,125
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER ISN'T IMPOSSIBLE.

373
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:13,087
THAT'S WHY, EVEN IF
THE WORLD REJECTS ME,

374
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,798
AND BLAMES ME,

375
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,968
I'LL KEEP ON FIGHTING.

376
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,721
AS A GUNDAM MEISTER OF
CELESTIAL BEING!

I'LL AVENGE YOU.

I'D RATHER YOU WEREN'T SO QUICK
TO WRITE ME OFF.

00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,164
WHERE ARE YOU?!

387
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,040
TIERIA, WHERE ARE YOU?!

388
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,086
RIGHT NOW, MY CONSCIOUSNESS IS
COMPLETELY LINKED TO VEDA.

389
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,337
VEDA?

390
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,756
I'M SURE GLAD
I WAS AN INNOVATOR,

391
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,969
OR RATHER, AN INNOVADE.
BECAUSE OF THAT,

392
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,347
I WAS ABLE TO SAVE ALL OF YOU
WITH MY ABILITIES.

(Gasps)

394
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,059
AND BY LINKING WITH VEDA

395
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,104
I WAS ABLE TO LEARN
MANY THINGS.

396
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:17,693
NOW, LET ME TELL YOU EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE AEOLIA PLAN.

ROGER!

400
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,953
THAT'S THE AEOLIA PLAN.

401
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,540

OUR ARMED INTERVENTIONS FORCED
THE WORLD TO UNITE IN A WAY,

402
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,042
THOUGH IT WAS STILL
FILLED WITH CONTRADICTIONS.

403
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,128
EVEN IF IT RESULTED
IN OUR DESTRUCTION,

404
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,464
OUR PURPOSE WAS TO UNIFY
HUMANITY'S WILL.

405
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,550
THIS WAS TO PREVENT MANKIND

406
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,138
FROM TAKING THE SEEDS OF WAR
WITH IT INTO OUTER SPACE.

407
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,181
UNLESS HUMANITY CHANGES,

408
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,143
IT WILL BE INCAPABLE OF
WEAVING A FUTURE FOR ITSELF.

409
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,145
PEOPLE NEED TO BE READY

WITH THE OTHER SPECIES
WE'LL EVENTUALLY ENCOUNTER.

411
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,567
AND THAT IS WHAT
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO.

412
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,694
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER.

413

IT'S HIM.

00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,717
A MAN?

AFTER ALL,
IT WAS BECAUSE OF ME
