GN DRIVE LINKAGE COMPLETE!

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,264
CONNECTION CONFIRMED.

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,267
ALL 00 COMPONENTS READING
SATISFACTORY.

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,020
THE TWO SOLAR REACTORS ARE
WITHIN NORMAL PARAMETERS.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,689
ALRIGHT.
LET'S BEGIN THE MATCHING TEST.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,524
YOU CAN GO AHEAD, TIERIA.

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,984
ROGER THAT.

8
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,153
GN DRIVE,
DISENGAGING REPAUSE.

TOPOLOGICAL DEFECT CHANGING

10
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,664
FROM GROUND STATE
TO HIGH OUTPUT.

11
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,708
TWIN DRIVE'S PARTICLE
SYNCHRONIZATION RATE IS AT 35%,

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,169
37, 40,

13
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:49,383
47, 49, 55, 58.

14
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,760
WE'VE JUST BROKEN
THE 60% BARRIER.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,136
IF IT MAKES IT PAST 80%,

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,305
WE'LL BE WITHIN
STABLE OPERATIONAL RANGE.

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,975
IT'S LOOKING GOOD.

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,686
WE'VE DEVELOPED AN INSTABILITY
IN THE TOPOLOGICAL DEFECT!

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,937
SAY WHAT?!

20
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,772
TWIN DRIVE SYNC RATE
DECREASING,

21
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,315
FUSION RATE IS ALSO FALLING!

22
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,199
WELL THAT'S IT.

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,118
WE'VE NOW TESTED
EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION

24
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,744
WITH OUR PRESENT RESOURCES.

25
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,955
WHY WON'T IT WORK?!
WHY WON'T IT STABILIZE?!

26
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,207
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE WE MISSING?!

27
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,876
THE ONLY OPTION LEFT IS
EXIA'S SOLAR REACTOR.

28
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,962
NO MATTER WHAT, WE'VE GOTTA
GET THIS THING WORKING

29
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,714
BEFORE THOSE GUYS
GO INTO ACTION.

30
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,968
SO THAT'S OUR LAST HOPE.

31
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,138

YOU CALL ME HERE AND THEN

YOU'RE FROM

NEIL DYLANDY...

42
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,868
WAS A GUNDAM MEISTER.

43
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,745
MY BROTHER WAS

44
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,122
A GUNDAM MEISTER?

45
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,415
THAT'S RIGHT.

46
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,041
HE PILOTED A GUNDAM.

47
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,043
HE "PILOTED"?

48
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,169
WAIT A MINUTE.

49
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,339
HE'S NOT DEAD, IS HE?

50
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,133
IN BATTLE, FOUR YEARS AGO.

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,558
YOU'RE TELLING ME

52
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,394
I SHOULD CARRY OUT HIS WILL
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

53
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,354
I'M NOT SAYING THAT AT ALL.

54
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,773
BUT IF YOU TRULY
WANT TO CHANGE THIS WORLD,

55
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,110
JUST AS NEIL DYLANDY
ALWAYS WANTED TO,

56
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,778
AND,

57
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,115
IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO FIGHT FOR THAT...

58
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,535
YOU'LL FIND
ALL THE INFORMATION

59
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,121
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT US
IN HERE.

60
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,459
ARE YOU SURE?

61
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,752
WHAT IF I TURN THIS OVER
TO THE AUTHORITIES?

62
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,129
THE SECURITY AGENCY

63
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,090
IS ABOUT TO MOVE AGAINST
KATHARON IN EUROPE.

64
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,633
THEY'RE GOING TO ATTACK
THEIR BASES.

65
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,843
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

66
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,094
THOSE GUYS ARE SERIOUS.

67
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,973
COLONEL KATI MANNEQUIN,

68
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,309
HEREBY ACCEPTING
MY NEW POSITION.

69
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,311
I'M PLEASED TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUINTANCE, COLONEL.

70
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,645
SIR.

71
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,105
AS YOU'RE AWARE,
COLONEL,

72
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,442
OUR AUTONOMOUS PEACEKEEPING
FORCE KNOWN AS THE A‐LAWS

73
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,237
WAS ESTABLISHED TO SUPPRESS
ANTI‐FEDERATION ELEMENTS

74
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,948
AND REPORTS DIRECTLY TO
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT.

75
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,658
OUR OFFENSIVE TARGETS INCLUDE

76
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,286
ANY NON‐FEDERATION NATIONS THAT
HAVE RETAINED THEIR MILITARY

77
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,414
AND THE ANTI‐GOVERNMENT
ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS KATHARON.

78
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,749
AND NOW,

79
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,334
IT SEEMS ONE MORE
VERY IMPORTANT TARGET

80
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,628
HAS BEEN ADDED
TO THAT LIST.

81
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,546
THE GUNDAMS, I PRESUME.

82
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,923
IF THEY INTEND TO
START PERFORMING

83
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,175
THEIR ARMED INTERVENTIONS AGAIN,

84
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,428
THEN OUR FORCES WILL HAVE
NO CHOICE BUT TO RETALIATE.

85
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,722
PUBLIC OPINION WOULD SUPPORT
ANY ACTION WE MIGHT TAKE.

86
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,140
IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,768
HOW MUCH I VALUE
YOUR ABILITIES AND SKILLS,

88
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,937
GIVEN THE FACT YOU HAVE
ACTUAL COMBAT EXPERIENCE

89
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,897
BATTLING THE GUNDAMS.

90
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,525
THE A‐LAWS WILL GIVE YOU
THE CHANCE TO USE THOSE SKILLS.

91
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,401
YES, SIR!

92
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,948
(Thinking)
THE AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE, A‐LAWS.

93
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,242
FAITHFUL WATCHDOG
OF THE FEDERATION.

94
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,910
PERMISSION TO SPEAK WITH YOU,
COLONEL?

95
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,119
HMM?

96
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,829
LIEUTENANT PERIES?

97
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,498
SO YOU'RE WITH THE A‐LAWS, TOO?

98
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,750
YES, MA'AM.
THEY CAME CALLING FOR ME,

99
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,669
AND I ACCEPTED
THE POSITION YESTERDAY.

100
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,089
I'M SURPRISED COLONEL SMIRNOV
GAVE HIS PERMISSION FOR THIS.

101
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,633
AN ORDER FROM THE TOP
HAS TO BE OBEYED.

102
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,842
AND WHO ARE YOU?

103
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,511
I'M ANDREI SMIRNOV, MA'AM.

104
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,513
I CARRY THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT.

105
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,139
LIEUTENANT SMIRNOV?

106
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,267
ARE YOU BY ANY CHANCE
COLONEL SMIRNOV'S‐‐

107
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,936
Andrei:
YES, MA'AM. I'M HIS SON.

108
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,564
SO THEY'VE ADDED THE MISSION
COMMANDER FROM THE AEU

109
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,316
AND THE SUPER SOLDIER
FROM THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE.

110
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,110
THAT'S COMMANDER KATAGIRI
FOR YOU.

111
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,486
HE DOESN'T WASTE TIME.

112
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,370
Ian:
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL DO A MATCHING TEST

113
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,540
WITH EXIA'S SOLAR REACTOR
ON OUR WAY BACK TO THE BASE.

114
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,749
THE SIMULATION SHOWED

115
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,543
THE LINKAGE RATIO
BETWEEN EXIA'S

116
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,462
AND THE 0 GUNDAM'S
SOLAR REACTORS TO BE HIGH.

117
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,965
YEAH, BUT WE WON'T REALLY KNOW
UNTIL WE TRY IT OUT.

118
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,133
THAT'S THE PROBLEM

119
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,968
WITH THE NEW
GUNDAM MAIN ENGINE THEORY

120
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,430
AEOLIA SCHENBERG SENT US
ALONG WITH THE TRANS‐AM.

121
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,181
IS IT JUST AN ABSTRACT THEORY,

122
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,558
OR AN ACCURATE PREDICTION
OF SCIENCE

123
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,184
200 YEARS IN THE FUTURE?

124
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,353
BY SYNCHRONIZING
TWO SOLAR REACTORS,

125
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,523
THE RESULTING PARTICLE EMISSIONS
ARE SQUARED.

126
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,276
THAT'S THE 00'S
TWIN DRIVE SYSTEM.

127
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,415
(Cheerfully)
HI, WE'VE BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT!

128
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,876
I'LL LEAVE IT RIGHT HERE,
SO JUST HELP YOURSELF!

129
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,420
AND WE'LL BE LEAVING RED HARO
HERE TO KEEP YOU COMPANY!

130
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,547
PLEASED TO MEET YOU!
PLEASED TO MEET YOU!

131
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,549
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING FROM ME,
OR THE OTHERS,

132
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,176
JUST TELL IT TO RED HARO.

133
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,305
YOU'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO
ACCESS OUR DATABASE.

134
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,557
HOW MUCH LONGER
ARE YOU GONNA KEEP ME HERE?

135
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,808
HUH?

136
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,019
LISTEN, WE KNOW THE A‐LAWS
ARE LOOKING FOR YOU.

137
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,730
LOOK, I'M NOT
A MEMBER OF KATHARON!

138
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,733
WELL, LET'S HOPE THAT THEY THINK
YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER EITHER.

139
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,735
ARE YOU PEOPLE STILL
PLANNING ON PERFORMING

140
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,363
THOSE ARMED INTERVENTIONS
LIKE YOU DID BEFORE?

141
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,698
Lasse:
NO. WE'RE GONNA
TAKE ON THE A‐LAWS.

142
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,200
THE FEDERATION FORCES?

143
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,119
IT'S AN AUTONOMOUS FORCE
THAT REPORTS TO THE GOVERNMENT.

144
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,122
THEY'VE ALREADY COMMITTED
14 ACTS OF MASS MURDER,

145
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,333
ATROCITIES
THEY CALL SUPPRESSION.

146
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,919
THEY'VE PRODUCED
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES,

147
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,337
THOUGH ALL RECORDS OF
THESE ATTACKS

148
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,755
HAVE BEEN ERASED.

149
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,508
I BELIEVE YOU'VE EXPERIENCED
THEIR METHODS FIRST HAND.

150
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,971
BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?!

151
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,557
WASN'T THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT
FORMED IN THE FIRST PLACE

152
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,309
BECAUSE OF
YOUR INTERVENTIONS?

153
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,062
THAT'S WHY WE INTEND
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT AGAIN.

154
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,480
BUT IF YOU FIGHT,

155
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,190
MORE INNOCENT PEOPLE
WILL BE HURT!

156
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,859
WHETHER WE FIGHT OR NOT,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA DIE.

157
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,778
(Frustrated grunt)

158
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,864
MR. AEON, THE TEST IS GOING
TO BE STARTING ANY MINUTE NOW.

159
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,866
ALL RIGHT.

160
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,077
AND HIM?

161
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,370
WHAT'S SETSUNA DOING
RIGHT NOW?

162
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,706
OH, HE'S GONE TO
PICK UP SOME PEOPLE!

163
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,125
HE'S TRACKING DOWN
A FEW OF OUR COMRADES.

164
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,889
(Sighs)
COME ON.

165
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,141
THAT'S ENOUGH NOW,
KNOCK IT OFF.

166
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,684
(Disappointed sigh)

167
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,185
YOU'RE DRINKING
WAY TOO MUCH.

168
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,189
HONESTLY, I CAN'T KEEP
LOOKING AFTER YOU.

169
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,524
I'M LEAVING THEN.

170
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,484
WHAT?

171
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,944
GOODBYE, BILLY.

172
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,446
THANKS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

173
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,739
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

174
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,615
WHOA, WHOA,
WAIT A MINUTE, KUJO.

175
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,534
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN IT
TO COME OUT THAT WAY.

176
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535
(Doorbell rings)

177
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,329
LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE A VISITOR.

178
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,330
(Surprised gasp)

179
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,749
SOMEONE YOU KNOW?

180
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,959
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY
TOLD ONE OF YOUR OLD FRIENDS

181
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,127
WHERE YOU'RE LIVING
RIGHT NOW!

182
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,462
IT'S PERFECT!

183
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,714
WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM TO COME
HAVE LUNCH WITH US?

184
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,965
NO, WAIT!

185
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,967
Billy:
IT WOULD BE KINDA NICE
TO REMINISCE

186
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,093
ABOUT THE PAST WITH A FRIEND.

187
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,935
(Gasps)
SETSUNA.

188
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,479
IT IS YOU.

189
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,564
IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS,

190
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,107
MISS SUMERAGI.

191
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,276
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
THAT ISN'T HER NAME.

192
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,778
THE PERSON
YOU'RE TALKING TO IS‐‐

193
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,906
HER CODENAME IS
SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA.

194
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,785
SHE'S CELESTIAL BEING'S
TACTICAL FORECASTER.

195
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,120
(Shocked gasp)

196
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,123
NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYWHERE YOU CAN RUN.

197
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,171
Lyle:
YOU WERE ACTUALLY RAIDED
BY THE SECURITY AGENCY?

198
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,924
SO, ANY CASUALTIES?

199
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,133
I SEE.

200
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,636
RIGHT, I'LL CALL YOU
BACK SOON.

201
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,887
(Phone beeping)

202
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,390
Lyle:
THIS IS JEAN ONE.

203
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,142
PLEASE GET BACK TO ME
IMMEDIATELY. IT'S IMPORTANT,

204
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,144
SO I THINK WE SHOULD MEET
FACE TO FACE.

205
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,942
Ian:
THE EXIA AND 0 GUNDAM MATCH UP

206
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,319
HAS YIELDED THE HIGHEST
SYNC NUMBERS SO FAR,

207
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,739
BUT IT STILL HASN'T GONE
ABOVE 70%.

208
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:19,202
WE'RE ONLY 10% AWAY
FROM STABLE TERRITORY.

209
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,830
WE COULD TRY FORCING
ACTIVATION WITH TRANS‐AM.

210
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,123
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

211
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,541
IF WE DO THAT,
IT COULD OVERLOAD,

212
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,251
OR MAYBE EVEN BLOW ITSELF UP!

213
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,752
THEN ALL WE CAN DO IS
RECALIBRATE

214
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,170
AND CHECK
THE WHOLE SYSTEM AGAIN.

215
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,171
(Frustrated growl)

216
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,297
OF COURSE WE WILL!

217
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,761
IT WAS DETERMINED
THAT THE GUNDAM THRONES

218
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,721
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ATTACK ON CIVILIANS

219
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,890
THAT TOOK PLACE IN SPAIN.

220
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,892
THE REASON FOR THAT ATTACK,

221
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,727
UNKNOWN.

222
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,563
GUNDAM THRONES?

223
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,400
THE THRONE MACHINES WERE NOT
PART OF THE ORIGINAL PLAN.

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,111
ALSO, THE THRONES ARE EQUIPPED
WITH PSEUDO GN DRIVES.

225
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,737
THE OFFENSIVE PARTICLES
THEY EMIT

226
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,114
MAY POSSIBLY AFFECT
THE HUMAN BODY.

227
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,119
AFFECT THE HUMAN BODY?

228
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,829
Saji:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

229
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,790
WHY WON'T THE REGENERATION
TREATMENT WORK ON HER HAND?

230
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,542
Nurse:
THE DOCTOR THINKS
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING

231
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,127
ABOUT THE GUNDAM'S BEAM WEAPON

232
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,921
THAT CAUSED
THESE CELLULAR DEFECTS.

233
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,673
GUNDAM THRONES.

234
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,884
THESE ARE THE MACHINES
THAT HURT LOUISE!

235
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,552
THEY'RE ENEMIES!
THEY'RE ENEMIES!

236
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,803
HUH?

237
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,138
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

238
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,768
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL ACCOMPLISH

239
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,186
BY DRAGGING ME BACK IN?

240
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,938
EVEN WITH
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT

241
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,941
THE WORLD HASN'T CHANGED
ONE BIT.

242
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,612
EVEN WITH ALL THOSE SACRIFICES
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

243
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,032
AEOLIA'S PLAN
WAS MEANINGLESS.

244
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,159
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN DRUNK
ALL THIS TIME?

245
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,077
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

246
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,829
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

247
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,415
I CAN'T GO ON ANYMORE.

248
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,583
YEAH, BUT I,

249
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,960
I MEAN, WE ARE GONNA FIGHT.

250
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,128
Setsuna:
IF LEADING THE WORLD

251
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,172
INTO A TERRIBLE REFORMATION
IS OUR SIN,

252
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,549
THEN THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN MAKE UP FOR THAT SIN

253
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,718
IS TO CHANGE THE WORLD AGAIN.

254
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,220
I'M AFRAID
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME.

255
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,639
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY?

256
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,391
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
JUST LET ME DISAPPEAR.

257
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,394
I DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF
INNER STRENGTH THAT YOU HAVE.

258
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,607
Announcer:
EXPRESS F‐120 LEAVING
GEOSTATIONARY ORBITAL STATION

259
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,566
FOR GRAND UNION‐‐

260
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,901
PLEASE, SETSUNA.

261
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,653
JUST FORGET ABOUT ME.

262
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,571
HERE COMES
THE NEW MEISTER NOW.

263
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,491
SO THERE'S A NEW MEISTER.

264
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,951
HUH?

265
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,744
YO! YOU GUYS ARE
RUNNING A LITTLE LATE!

266
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,037
IS THAT LOCKON?!

267
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,498
IS HE REALLY...IS HE ALIVE?!

268
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,417
GET OUT OF HERE, DO I REALLY
LOOK LIKE MY BROTHER THAT MUCH?

269
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,961
YOU'RE...
YOU'RE HIS BROTHER?

270
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,587
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU.

271
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,630
THIS IS LYLE DYLANDY‐‐

272
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,839
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

273
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,218
MY NAME IS LOCKON STRATOS.

274
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,513
I'M A GUNDAM MEISTER FOR
CELESTIAL BEING.

275
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,348
Shirin:
KLAUS. JEAN ONE
HAS MADE CONTACT

276
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,225
WITH CELESTIAL BEING.

277
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,520
NOW, THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR
NOT THEY'LL COOPERATE WITH US.

278
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,980
THE WAY
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT

279
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,940
IS USING ACCESS TO
THE SOLAR POWER SYSTEM

280
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,733
TO COERCE ITS MEMBER NATIONS

281
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,527
WHILE ABANDONING
THE NON‐MEMBER NATIONS

282
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,237
IS SIMPLY UNJUST.

283
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,531
NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT IN ITS RUSH TO UNIFY,

284
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,157
THE FEDERATION ESTABLISHED

285
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,159
ITS OWN AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE

286
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,745
TO SUPPRESS
ANYONE WHO DARED OPPOSE IT.

287
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,748
AT THIS RATE, THE FEDERATION
WILL BECOME A DICTATORSHIP.

288
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,128
AND I'M SURE THOSE GUYS KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

289
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,254
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

290
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,092
TO THINK THE GUNDAMS
HAVE APPEARED AGAIN.

291
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,012
ARE YOU A PART OF THIS,
SETSUNA?

292
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,513
(Gasps)

293
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,307
MARINA ISMAIL,
RIGHT?

294
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,684
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

295
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,686
(Scared gasp)

296
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,861
Hong‐Long:
MISTRESS.

297
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,112
WHY DID YOU GIVE THEM
THAT INFORMATION

298
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,697
ABOUT CELESTIAL BEING?

299
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,157
WHAT HAVE WE SPENT

300
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,284
THESE LAST
FOUR YEARS PREPARING FOR?!

301
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,702
THEY'RE OF NO USE TO ANYONE

302
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,038
IF THEY CAN'T OVERCOME
THIS LEVEL OF DANGER.

303
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,581
MISTRESS.

304
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,874
TO MY EYES
IT APPEARS THAT

305
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,667
YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN
STARTING FIGHTS

306
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,335
THAN IN
REFORMING THE WORLD.

307
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
I AM.

308
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,338
Liu‐Mei:
IT'S ONLY WHEN THE BATTLES
ARE OVER

309
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,592
THAT TRUE REFORM
FOR THE WORLD WILL BE FOUND.

310
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,510
YOU CAN MAKE CONTACT
WITH THEM NOW.

311
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,512
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT,
MY MISTRESS.

312
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,768
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
RIBBONS?

313
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,145
Regene:
WOW, FANTASTIC INFORMATION!

314
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,772
WELL, WHAT ELSE
WOULD YOU EXPECT

315
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,649
FROM A FORMER
CELESTIAL BEING AGENT.

316
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,568
SHOULD WE CONTACT
HOMER KATAGIRI?

317
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,321
YES, GOOD THINKING.
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

318
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,119
WE KNOW THE LOCATION OF
THE SPACESHIP

319
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,746
THAT'S CARRYING THE GUNDAMS?

320
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,414
IT'S COMING STRAIGHT
FROM HEADQUARTERS.

321
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,957
I'D SAY IT'S RELIABLE, SIR.

322
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,709
COMMANDER KATAGIRI
DOES IT AGAIN.

323
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,212
HE PLAYS HIS CARDS WELL.

324
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,047
PREPARE TO LAUNCH
ALL MOBILE SUIT TEAMS!

325
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,340
THIS SHIP IS GOING TO CONDUCT

326
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,926
A SURPRISE ATTACK
ON THE GUNDAMS' SPACESHIP!

327
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,054
AHEAD TEAMS ONE AND TWO,
PREPARE TO SORTIE!

328
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,973
Louise:
CAPTAIN! PLEASE GIVE ME
PERMISSION TO SORTIE!

329
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,226
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO MAKES THAT DECISION!

330
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,145
REMAIN ON STANDBY,
WARRANT OFFICER HALEVY.

331
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,564
Mechanic:
YOUR SUSPENSION SETTINGS
ARE ALL GOOD, SIR!

332
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,524
Zinin:
NICE WORK.

333
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,030
STARTUP AHEAD!

334
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,741
ALL UNITS, HURRY UP WITH
YOUR LAUNCH PREP!

335
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,119
DAMN CELESTIAL BEING.

336
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,121
I'M READY! LAUNCHING AHEAD!

337
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,225
EMERGENCY TRANSMISSION,
IT'S COMING FROM PTOLEMY.

338
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,269
Lasse:
I HAVE SOME INFORMATION
FROM WANG LIU MEI.

339
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,604
SHE SAYS THE A‐LAWS
KNOW OUR LOCATION.

340
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,022
I'LL TAKE SERAVEE OUT!

341
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,732
WE NEED TO HURRY UP
THE MATCHING PROCESS.

342
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,692
FELDT, GO AND HELP IAN.

343
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,193
ROGER THAT.

344
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,987
ENEMY FORCE APPROACHING!
ENEMY FORCE APPROACHING!

345
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,197
PREPARE FOR COMBAT!
PREPARE FOR COMBAT!

346
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
NO WAY.

347
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,075
THEY'RE GOING INTO
BATTLE NOW?

348
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,495
Mileina:
OPENING HATCH ON DECK TWO!

349
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,167
MOVING SERAVEE TO
CATAPULT DECK.

350
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,177
INCREASING LINEAR CATAPULT
VOLTAGE FROM 230 TO 520.

351
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,637
SUIT IS STABILIZED
WITHIN FIELD.

352
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,473
TRANSFERRING TIMING CONTROL OF
LAUNCH SEQUENCE TO SERAVEE.

353
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,933
ROGER THAT.

354
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,144
SERAVEE,
TIERIA ERDE, LAUNCHING!

355
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,027
ENEMY FORMATION.

356
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,321
ARE THOSE
A‐LAWS MOBILE SUITS?

357
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,948
SETSUNA, WHAT'S OUR CURRENT
FIGHTING STRENGTH?

358
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,700
WE JUST HAVE
TIERIA'S UNIT RIGHT NOW.

359
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,118
HOWEVER, WE HAVE ANOTHER UNIT

360
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,579
THAT'S ALMOST READY
TO ROLL OUT.

361
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,122
JUST TWO UNITS!

362
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,917
PRETTY LEAN LITTLE GROUP
YOU'RE RUNNING HERE, FRIEND.

363
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,126
(Concerned sigh)

364
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,214
(Gasps)
MR. AEON!

365
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,175
WE'RE RECEIVING AN EMERGENCY
CODED MESSAGE FROM MISS NORIEGA.

366
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,343
NORIEGA?

367
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,761
FROM MISS SUMERAGI?!

368
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,431
IT'S A TACTICAL PLAN.
SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN 0032.

369
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,016
THAT'S A LITTLE
UNREASONABLE.

370
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,351
GOOD WORK, SETSUNA.

371
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,686
HE REALLY DID MANAGE TO
BRING HER BACK.

372
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,689
Zinin:
ENEMY VESSEL SIGHTED.
ONE MOBILE SUIT CONFIRMED.

373
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,899
THAT'S THE GUNDAM
THAT GOT ALAGGA,

374
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,151
AND ITS TRANSPORT SHIP.

375
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,737
TEAM TWO,
DESTROY THE TRANSPORT!

376
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,530
ALL OTHER UNITS, ON THE GUNDAM!

377
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,698
Pilot:
CAPTAIN!
FROM THE TRANSPORT!

378
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,116
Zinin:
HUH?

379
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,291
THEY'RE...THEY'RE JUST MINES.

380
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,960
THEY WON'T EVEN SCRATCH‐‐
(Screams)

381
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,753
THEY'RE DISRUPTING OUR SENSORS?!

382
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,005
ARE THEY TRYING TO
BUY MORE TIME?!

383
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,132
ADJUST COURSE!
WE'LL GO AROUND!

384
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,304
FOLLOW ROUTE ST27.

385
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,430
ROGER.

386
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,058
I SEE YOUR PLAN.
THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

387
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,145
Tieria:
SERAVEE, INTERCEPTING TARGETS.

388
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,066
CHARGING WITH HIGH DENSITY
COMPRESSED PARTICLES.

389
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,317
GN BAZOOKA,

390
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,486
COMPRESSED PARTICLES,
RELEASING!

391
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,369
Zinin:
TEAM TWO,
ATTACK THE SPACESHIP!

392
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,121
I'LL KEEP THE GUNDAM
OCCUPIED FOR NOW!

393
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,129
IAN!

394
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,380
SEND OUT THE 00!

395
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,300
JUST WAIT A MINUTE, SETSUNA!
WE'RE NOT DONE!

396
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,801
THERE'S NO TIME!

397
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,011
YOU TAKE THE CONTROLS.

398
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,846
WH‐WHAT THE HELL?!

399
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,556
I AM NOW PREPARING TO
DOCK THE SHUTTLE.

400
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:23,185
ALSO, I'M INITIATING
THE 00'S LAUNCH SEQUENCE.

401
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,188
Mileina:
OPENING HATCH ON DECK ONE!

402
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,774
THAT MUST BE
CELESTIAL BEING'S SHIP.

403
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,110
Mileina:
MOVING 00 TO CATAPULT DECK.

404
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
DAMN IT! GIVE ME A BREAK!

405
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,541
(Thinking)
00.

406
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,045
0 GUNDAM'S AND EXIA'S
SOLAR REACTORS

407
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,296
ARE IN THAT SUIT!

408
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,136
THIS IS MY GUNDAM!

409
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,847
THE TWIN DRIVE SYSTEM,

410
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,973
WILL IT WORK?

411
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,017
00'S NOT READY,
SETSUNA!

412
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,602
I'M USING TRANS‐AM.

413
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,604
BUT THAT'S CRAZY,
DON'T DO IT!

414
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,147
ACTIVATING TRANS‐AM!

415
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,740
THAT BOY'S INSANE.

416
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,450
IT'S STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

417
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,828
THE PARTICLE FUSION RATE
CAN'T SEEM TO MAKE IT PAST 73%!

418
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,331
NOT EVEN WITH THE TRANS‐AM!

419
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,291
Mileina:
TWO ENEMY MOBILE SUITS
ARE CLOSING FAST!

420
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,128
WHERE'S 00?!

421
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,842
PLEASE, WAKE UP, 00.

422
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,929
THE 0 GUNDAM IS IN HERE!

423
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,722
AND EXIA!

424
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,140
AND ME!

425
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,944
IT'S BEEN ACTIVATED!

426
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,071
THE SQUARING HAS A TIME LAG!

427
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:01,075
THE TWIN DRIVE HAS REACHED
THE STABLE OPERATIONAL RANGE!

428
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,785
D‐DID WE GET IT?

429
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,161
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

430
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,664
(Startled gasp)

431
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,040
(Tense gasp)

432
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,709
NOW WHAT?

433
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,712
WHAT SYSTEM IS THAT?

434
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,343
THIS IS 00 GUNDAM,
SETSUNA F. SEIEI,

435
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,137
I'M HEADING OUT!

436
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,482
IT'S A NEW MODEL!

437
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,109
THE AHEADS WILL
TAKE CARE OF IT!

438
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,698
00, READY TO ELIMINATE TARGETS!

439
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,122
WHA‐WHAT'S GOING ON?!

440
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,168
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT FEATURE?!

441
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,503
THEN TRY THIS!

442
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,132
(Irritated grunt)

443
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,384
NOW YOUR BEAM WEAPONS
WILL BE USELESS!

444
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,137
Pilot:
AND IN CLOSE COMBAT,
THE ADVANTAGE IS MINE!

445
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,435
DON'T YOU KNOW?
THIS IS OUR...

446
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,145
