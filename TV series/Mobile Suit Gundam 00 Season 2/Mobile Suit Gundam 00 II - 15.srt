KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?

OH... YEAH,
I'LL TELL THEM.

I SEE. SO YOU USED SERAPHIM?

65
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,950
IF I HADN'T USED IT,

66
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,452
THE INNOVATOR WOULD HAVE
FINISHED ME OFF.

67
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,038
I WONDER IF THEY TOOK NOTICE OF
SERAPHIM'S SPECIAL FEATURES.

68
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,873
I CAN'T REALLY BE SURE.

69
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,334
FOR NOW, WE'LL PICK UP
THE SUPPLIES FROM KATHARON

70
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,586
AND MAKE OUR WAY OUT OF
THE FEDERATION'S NET.

SYSTEM OFFLINE,

PTOLEMY WOULD BE HELPLESS
IF THE A‐LAWS ATTACKED NOW.

73
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,343
WE COULD BREAK OUT OF

THE DOUBLE 0 RAISER, BUT...

YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE
THE LEADER OF THE COUP D'ÉTAT?

82
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,554
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT
ESTABLISHED

83
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,347
ITS AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE

84
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,099
WITHOUT CONSULTING THE PUBLIC.

85
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,768
IT'S BEEN BUILDING UP
ITS MILITARY STRENGTH.

86
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,896
AND NOW IT'S EVEN RESORTED TO
USING SATELLITE WEAPONS.

87
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,732
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO OVERLOOK

88
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,859
THESE KINDS
OF ACTIONS ANYMORE.

89
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,695
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
THE A‐LAWS.

90
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,531
BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT.
BUT THERE IS ONE PLACE

91
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,242
WHERE NOT EVEN THEY WOULD
DARE TO TOUCH US.

92
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,577
(Gasps)

93
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,038
YOU DON'T MEAN
THE ORBITAL ELEVATOR?!

94
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,832
HMM.

95
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,710
AND YOU WANT ME TO JOIN YOU
IN YOUR COUP D'ÉTAT?

96
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,005
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU EVER
DISOBEYING YOUR ORDERS.

97
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,548
OTHERWISE, HOLLY WOULD
STILL BE‐‐

98
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,425
DON'T SAY IT!

99
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,843
(Fuming grunt)

100
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,889
I PAID YOU THIS VISIT
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU

101
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,641
TO BECOME
INVOLVED IN THIS.

102
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,559
SO, YOU WANT ME TO LOOK
THE OTHER WAY.

103
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,561
I'M NOT ASKING YOU AS
A SOLDIER,

104
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,438
BUT AS AN OLD FRIEND.

105
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,691
I DON'T WANT TO
FIGHT YOU.

106
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,068
HERCURY...

107
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,987
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE,
SERGEI.

108
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,323
AN ARMY EXISTS
TO ACT AS A DETERRENT

109
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,325
AGAINST FOREIGN POWERS
IN ORDER TO PROTECT

110
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,495
THE NATION'S PEOPLE
AND PROSPERITY.

111
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,330
HOWEVER, AN ARMY
CAN'T FUNCTION PROPERLY

112
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,999
UNDER A MISGUIDED GOVERNMENT.

113
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,335
I JUST WANT TO
LIVE MY LIFE AS A SOLDIER

114
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,462
IN AN HONORABLE ARMY AGAIN.

115
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,894
(Birds calling)

116
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,317
Shirin:
SO, YOU'RE SAYING
YOUR GROUP CAN'T TELL KATHARON

117
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,237
WHEN OR WHERE THE COUP D'ÉTAT
IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE?

118
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,864
YES, IT'S TO PREVENT
INFORMATION LEAKS.

119
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,534
ALL WE WANT IS FOR KATHARON
TO OBSERVE WHAT WE DO,

120
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,078
AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT
YOU WANT TO JOIN FORCES.

121
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,247
YOU DON'T NEED
OUR HELP BEFOREHAND?

122
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,625
LEAVE IT TO US, WE'LL HANDLE
EVERYTHING OURSELVES.

123
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,210
I UNDERSTAND.

124
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,422
I'LL NOTIFY ALL OUR BRANCHES
ABOUT YOUR INTENTIONS.

125
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,924
AND CELESTIAL BEING AS WELL.

126
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,009
YOU HAVE A WAY TO GET IN
CONTACT WITH THEM?

127
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,345
YES. THEY'VE SHOWN THAT
THEY HAVE THE FIGHTING STRENGTH

128
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,305
TO OPPOSE THE A‐LAWS.

129
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,100
I THINK IT'S MORE
THAN WORTHWHILE TO ASK THEM.

130
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,229
Shirin:
WAS THAT WISE, KLAUS?

131
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,607
I TOLD YOU, DIDN'T I?
I BELIEVE IN THEM.

132
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,610
HMM. YOU'RE RIGHT.

133
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,572
I DOUBT WE'LL GET TOO MANY
MORE CHANCES LIKE THIS.

134
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,288
ANOTHER OPERATION RIGHT AFTER
GETTING BACK TO EARTH.

135
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,750
IT'S OUR DUTY TO FOLLOW
WHATEVER ORDERS WE'RE GIVEN.

136
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,502
YES, BUT WARRANT OFFICER,

137
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,838
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT
ACTING A LITTLE MORE FEMININE?

138
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,673
I DO NOT.

139
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,925
NOT EVEN FOR THE SAKE
OF THAT GUY, SAJI?

140
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,886
I'VE THROWN AWAY MY PAST.

141
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,263
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'D GIVEN
UP YOUR DESIRE FOR REVENGE.

142
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,431
EXCUSE ME.

143
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,477
HUH?

144
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,687
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO
WIN HER HEART...

145
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,439
TRUST ME, I KNOW
ALL THE RIGHT MOVES!

146
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,191
(Scoffs)

147
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,984
YOU'LL REGRET THIS!

148
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,903
THOSE POOR HUMANS.

149
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,822
UNLIKE US, THEY CAN'T JUST
COMMUNICATE MIND TO MIND.

150
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,783
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

151
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,076
IT LOOKS LIKE REGENE WON'T
BE JOINING US.

152
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,621
THERE'S A STRANGE ONE. HUH?

153
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,582
Revive:
HERE COMES OUR COMMANDER.

154
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,042
IS SHE USEFUL?

155
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,836
WELL, FOR A HUMAN
SHE'S USEFUL.

156
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,551
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,
COLONEL MANNEQUIN.

157
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,386
AND YOU ARE?

158
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,848
TECHNICAL CAPTAIN BILLY KATAGIRI
OF MOBILE SUIT DEVELOPMENT.

159
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,142
I'LL BE STATIONED
ON THIS SHIP, MA'AM.

160
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,895
WHY WOULD AN ENGINEER
COME TO THE FRONT LINE?

161
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:08,274
I WISH TO SEE CELESTIAL BEING'S
DEMISE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

162
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,276
OUR CHIEF COMMANDER GAVE
ME PERMISSION.

163
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,237
YOUR WISH WILL
COME TRUE VERY SOON.

164
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,658
WITH THIS MUCH
FIGHTING STRENGTH,

165
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,410
THERE'S NO MORE NEED
FOR TRICKS.

166
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,080
LET'S SETTLE THIS ONCE
AND FOR ALL, KUJO!

167
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,501
SO, THE A‐LAWS ARE DEPLOYING
PRACTICALLY THEIR ENTIRE FORCE

168
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,212
TO ANNIHILATE CELESTIAL BEING.

169
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,422
I'M SORRY I HAVE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF YOU,

170
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,007
CELESTIAL BEING.

171
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,311
THIS PLACE...

172
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,356
(Gasps)

173
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,692
THIS HOUSE!

174
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,861
(Tense gasp)

175
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,946
I GIVE THIS BODY
TO GOD,

176
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,198
I JOIN IN HIS HOLY WAR.

177
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,869
I'LL BE ACCEPTED BY GOD,
AS ONE OF HIS WARRIORS.

178
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,873
(Gasps)

179
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,165
Setsuna's Mother:
SORAN!

180
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,793
Setsuna's Father:
WHERE HAVE YOU
BEEN ALL THIS TIME?

181
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,794
Father:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

182
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,713
Mother:
SORAN!
STOP IT!

183
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,131
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!

184
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,924
I'M DOING THIS TO UPHOLD
THE TEACHINGS OF GOD!

185
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,802
THERE IS NO GOD IN
THIS WORLD!

186
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,097
NO GOD...

187
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,182
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS A DESPICABLE RITUAL

188
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,101
THAT WILL ONLY BRING ABOUT
MORE VIOLENCE!

189
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,853
(Yelps)

190
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,563
DON'T LET HIM OUT
OF THE HOUSE!

191
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,148
(Grunts)

192
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,278
HUH?

193
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,905
(Shaken gasp)

194
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,823
L‐LOCKON?

195
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,242
SETSUNA. THE ONLY THING
THE PAST CAN CHANGE

196
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,121
IS HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THINGS IN THE PRESENT.

197
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,917
BUT NOTHING ELSE CHANGES.
NOT OTHER'S FEELINGS,

198
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,586
AND CERTAINLY NOT THEIR LIVES.

199
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,129
(Bang)

200
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,632

♪

203
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,979
SETSUNA.
YOU COULD CHANGE.

204
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,024
I COULDN'T,
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT FOR ME.

205
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,859
(Shaken breath)

206
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:19,530
THIS SONG...
THIS SONG IS SO...

207
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,661
♪ LYING ON THE GRASS ♪
♪ IS ALL I NEED ♪

209
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,248
I SEE YOU'RE AWAKE.

210
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,167
MARINA, WHERE AM I?

211
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,710
HEY, LOOK,
GUYS HE'S WAKING UP!

212
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,964
ARE YOU FEELING ANY BETTER?

213
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,840
MARINA...

214
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,218
WHAT WAS THAT SONG I HEARD?

215
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,513
I WROTE IT AFTER HEARING
THE WISHES OF THESE CHILDREN.

216
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,682
IS THAT SO?

217
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,684
I COULD HEAR THAT SONG
WHEN I WAS

218
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,477
IN THE MIDDLE OF TRANS AM.

219
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,022
(Groaning)

220
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,190
DON'T MOVE YET!

221
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,859
WE REMOVED THE BULLET,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS

222
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,862
TO CELL REGENERATION
EQUIPMENT HERE.

223
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,280
I HAVE TO‐‐

224
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,574
YOU NEED TO REST UP WHILE
YOUR WOUND HEALS.

225
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,119
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU WROTE
ABOUT IN THAT LETTER

226
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,997
YOU GAVE ME FOUR YEARS AGO?

227
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,249
YOU SAID YOU WERE LOOKING FOR
ANSWERS ON THE PATH

228
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,918
WHERE PEOPLE
CAN UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

229
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,088
AND UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER

230
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,674
BEGINS WITH GETTING TO
KNOW EACH OTHER.

231
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,427
YOU CAN AT LEAST GIVE ME SOME
TIME FOR THAT, CAN'T YOU?

232
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,178
(Shushing and giggling)

233
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,311
HEY, HEY!

234
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,565
ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO
HAVE TO FIGHT?

235
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,651
I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE GETTING
READY, BUT JUST IN CASE.

236
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,819
ARE YOU GOING TO
COME BACK?

237
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,446
ARE YOU GOING TO DIE?

238
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,448
AH, WELL, IT DEPENDS ON
HOW LUCKY WE ARE,

239
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,824
OR HOW SHOULD I PUT THIS.

240
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,285
HEY, DON'T GET
SO SERIOUS ABOUT IT.

241
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,746
IT'S DANGEROUS HERE,
GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM, KIDS.

242
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,330
NO, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

243
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,415
WHY NOT?

244
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,916
(Giggling)

245
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,918
BECAUSE THEY'RE
LOVEY‐DOVEY!

246
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,048
HOW AWFUL...

247
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,675
I REALLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT
YOU WERE FORCED

248
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,887
TO GO THROUGH
DURING THE KRUGIS WAR.

249
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,847
IT HAPPENED MORE THAN
TEN YEARS AGO.

250
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,682
IT EXPLAINS A LOT.

251
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,102
LIKE WHY YOU HATE WAR
SO MUCH.

252
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,437
(Sighs)

253
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,858
WELL, AS FOR ME, I WAS RAISED
IN A NORMAL HOME,

254
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,527
LIKE YOU'D FIND
JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE.

255
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,988
I REALLY LOVE MUSIC,
AND IF I COULD HAVE,

256
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,407
I WOULD'VE LIKED TO
PURSUE THAT PATH, BUT...

257
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,576
(Sighs)

258
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,453
BECAUSE OF MY BLOODLINE,

259
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,332
I WAS CHOSEN TO BE
THE PRINCESS ROYAL OF AZADISTAN.

260
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,375
I'VE GOT TO SAY...

261
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,128
MAKING MUSIC
SEEMS TO SUIT YOU...

262
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,506
MORE THAN THE LIFE
OF A PRINCESS.

263
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,841
IN MY OPINION.

264
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,844
MAYBE I WAS TRYING
TOO HARD.

265
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,930
BUT YOU...

266
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,015
I COULD SAY THE SAME
THING ABOUT YOU.

267
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,563
YOU'VE BEEN FORCING YOURSELF
TO FIGHT.

268
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,482
(Knocking)

269
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,858
GOT A MINUTE?

270
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,528
WE HAVE NEWS THAT YOUR SHIP
PICKED UP A LOAD OF SUPPLIES

271
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,530
FROM MEMBERS OF
OUR EUROPEAN BRANCH.

272
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,156
YOU MEAN PTOLEMY?

273
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,703
THANKS TO THOSE SUPPLIES THAT
KATHARON PROVIDED,

274
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,956
WE'LL BE FINISHED WITH THE
OUTER HULL REPAIRS PRETTY SOON.

275
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,457
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING
TO BE DONE

276
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,084
BEFORE THE ENEMY EVEN ARRIVES.

277
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,628
BUT WE CAN'T USE
THE SUBMERSIBLE MODE YET.

278
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,548
AND THE WEAPON CONTROL SYSTEM
STILL NEEDS WORK.

279
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,424
GOOD WORK,
BUT PLEASE KEEP AT IT.

280
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,226
(Footsteps approaching)

281
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,646
(Exhausted breath)

282
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,069
THANKS, MILEINA.

283
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,988
WE'RE LUCKY YOU WERE ABLE
TO COME WITH US.

284
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,407
YOU MUSTN'T FALL
IN LOVE.

285
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,409
(Mumbling)

286
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,204
(Alarm buzzes)

287
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,082
Feldt:
ENEMY MOBILE SUITS
ARE APPROACHING THE SHIP!

288
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,458
JUDGING FROM THEIR
PARTICLE OUTPUT,

289
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,335
ENEMY FORCES
ARE PROBABLY A‐LAWS.

290
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,129
IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT ANEW
WAS SAYING,

291
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,673
THE ENEMY ALWAYS
KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE!

292
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,133
WHAT ARE THE ENEMY
NUMBERS, FELDT?

293
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,801
WE HAVE THIRTY‐SIX
ENEMY MACHINES.

294
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,678
THIRTY‐SIX MACHINES?

295
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,889
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE
A NEW MOBILE ARMOR, TOO.

296
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,640
THEY'VE LAUNCHED
AN ALL‐OUT WAR ON US.

297
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,476
SO IT SEEMS. ALL GUNDAMS,
LAUNCH IN SEQUENCE!

298
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,104
PTOLEMY WILL TAKE COVER BEHIND
THE MOUNTAIN RANGE!

299
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,240
COLONEL, HOW COME I'M NOT
OUT THERE

300
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,326
PILOTING ONE
OF THOSE MOBILE SUITS?

301
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,412
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE INDESTRUCTIBLE OR SOMETHING.

302
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,539
I'M COUNTING ON THAT LUCK
TO KEEP US ALIVE.

303
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,498
(Pleased sigh)

304
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,001
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME!

305
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,794
ATTENTION ALL FORCES,

306
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,255
THEIR SHIP IS DAMAGED!
THE GADESSAS AND THE EMPRUSS

307
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,132
ARE TO KEEP
THE GUNDAMS OCCUPIED.

308
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,676
ALL OTHER UNITS WILL ATTACK
THE ENEMY SHIP!

309
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,095
WE REDEEM ALL OUR
PAST GRUDGES IN THIS BATTLE!

310
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,223
COMMENCE THE ATTACK!

311
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,311
(Grunts)
WHAT?!

312
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,150
THAT'S FURTHER THAN
THE GADESSA CAN FIRE!

313
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,610
(Blast)

314
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,904
Lyle:
I'LL REDUCE THEIR NUMBERS
WITH PRE‐EMPTIVE STRIKES!

315
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,697
DON'T SKIMP ON
THE PARTICLES, HARO!

316
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,282
ROGER! ROGER!

317
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,492
THAT'S RIGHT...

318
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,036
TARGETED AND FIRING!

319
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,412
(Boom)

320
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,292
Kati:
THE POWER OF
THAT PARTICLE BEAM...

321
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,795
IT'S AN ATTACK UTILIZING
THE TRANS AM SYSTEM.

322
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,839
I'M AWARE OF THAT.
ALL UNITS DISPERSE!

323
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,675
THE ENEMY'S ATTACK HAS
A TIME LIMIT!

324
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:34,011
UNTIL THEN,
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!

325
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,138
GOT TO ADMIT, THAT TAKES
A LOT OF SKILL!

326
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,059
Haro:
TIME LIMIT REACHED!
TIME LIMIT REACHED!

327
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,939
I'VE TAKEN DOWN MY SHARE.

328
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,525
YOU GUYS CAN TAKE OVER
UNTIL I RECHARGE.

329
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,987
ALLELUJAH, TIERIA.

330
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,531
Tiera:
ALLELUJAH, DON'T LET
THE ENEMY GET CLOSE TO PTOLEMY!

331
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,949
ROGER!

332
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,784
Revive:
HIS TRANS AM MUST HAVE ENDED.

333
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,952
Kati:
ALL UNITS, ATTACK!

334
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,662
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

335
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,789
Louise:
WE'RE GOING STRAIGHT FOR
THE ENEMY SHIP!

336
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,040
Andrei:
WARRANT OFFICER,
HERE COME THE GUNDAMS!

337
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,417
I SEE THEM!

338
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,968
SORRY, BOYS!
WE'RE YOUR OPPONENTS!

339
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,098
(Tiera grunts in pain)

340
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,898
I GOT TO FIND A CHANCE
TO HIT BACK. HUH?

341
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,947
(Sizzling through)

342
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,283
WHAT THE‐‐

343
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,784
(Tiera screams)

344
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,619
Allelujah:
TIERIA!

345
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,205
(Screaming)

346
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,462
THE MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
ARE GOING TO‐‐

347
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,921
(Pained yell)

348
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,301
HARO, HERE THEY COME!

349
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,304
STILL CHARGING GN PARTICLES!
STILL CHARGING GN PARTICLES!

350
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,056
PICK UP THE PACE! UGH!

351
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,605
ENEMY FORCES APPROACHING!

352
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,523
0034 UNTIL THEY REACH
FIRING RANGE!

353
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,484
I CAN'T USE THE WEAPONS!

354
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,362
THE ONLY THING WE'VE
GOT LEFT IS THE GN ARCHER!

355
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,946
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
I'LL TAKE IT OUT!

356
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,073
HUH? BUT YOU'RE‐‐

357
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,408
LOOK AT THAT MOBILE SUIT!
WHAT?

358
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,661
THAT ONE WAS...
MY MACHINE!

359
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,205
LOUISE!
(Sigh)

360
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,126
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT

361
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,836
WITH YOUR INJURY, SETSUNA?

362
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,588
MY FRIENDS ARE WAITING.

363
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,720
MARINA...

364
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,180
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU

365
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,933
I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE CHILDREN
SING THAT SONG AGAIN.

366
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,103
I'M SURE THEY'D LOVE THAT.

367
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,064
JUST MAKE SURE YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

368
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,899
(Groans)

369
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,616

371
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,919
DOUBLE 0 RAISER....

372
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,131
THIS IS SETSUNA F. SEIEI,
LAUNCHING!

373
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,816
Saji:
LOUISE!

374
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,651
DON'T DO THIS, LOUISE!

375
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,986
Pilot:

WITH THIS,
CELESTIAL BEING WILL‐‐

(Alert beeps)

379
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,834
I'M GETTING AN EMERGENCY CODED
MESSAGE FROM HEADQUARTERS.

380
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,794
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!

381
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,006
MISS SUMERAGI, SOMETHING'S
GOING ON WITH THE ENEMY!

382
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,215
WHAT IS IT?

383
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,676
THE PARTICLE BEAM ATTACKS
SEEM TO HAVE STOPPED

384
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,969
AND ALL THE ENEMY
FORCES ARE TURNING AROUND...

385
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,722
LOUISE...

386
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,808
WHAT?! THE ENEMY IS
WITHDRAWING?

387
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,768
WITHDRAWING?

388
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,270
(Allelujah gasping)

389
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,607
DID... DID SOMEONE SAVE US?

390
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,442
BUT WHY?

391
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,989
IT'S‐IT'S A COUP D'ÉTAT.

392
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:27,203
THE ORBITAL ELEVATOR...
HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER!

393
00:21:38,214 --> 00:23:05,509
♪

394
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,515
INFORMATION FROM KATHARON?

395
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,183
A COUP AT
THE AFRICA TOWER?

396
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,894
THE FEDERATION'S RESPONDING?

397

THEN PTOLEMY MUST BE
HEADING THERE.

HUH?

THIS MOBILE SUIT IS LIKE...
BUT IT'S NOT A FLAG!

402
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,336
Graham:
I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON
MEETING YOU HERE.

403
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,005
ONCE YOU HEARD
ABOUT THE AFRICA TOWER!

404
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,840

WELL, HERE'S SOMETHING
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO IGNORE.

OBSERVE CAREFULLY NOW.

409
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,854
THIS IS THE SECRET OF
THE MASURAO MY FRIEND CREATED!

410
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,942
B‐BUT THAT'S...
