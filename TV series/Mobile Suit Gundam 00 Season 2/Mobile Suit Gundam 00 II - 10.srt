1
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,718
Billy Katagiri:
I READ YOUR GRADUATION THESIS
ON THE TACTICAL THEORY

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,721
AND ANTICIPATED CASUALTIES
OF UNMANNED UNIT COMBAT.

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,306
SO, ARE YOU THINKING
OF PURSUING A CAREER

4
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,600
AS A TACTICAL FORECASTER
AFTER YOU GRADUATE?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,227
THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO BE.

6
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,561
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,521
Billy:
I'M GONNA STAY IN COLLEGE

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,689
AND KEEP RESEARCHING
MOBILE SUITS

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,900
WITH PROFESSOR EIFMAN.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,444
BUT YOU'RE
SIMPLY AMAZING!

11
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,196
YOU'RE ONLY 17 YEARS OLD,

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,990
AND ALREADY GRADUATING
FROM A PLACE LIKE THIS!

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,867
I STILL HAVE
A LOT OF THINGS TO LEARN.

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,161
I DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE
TO KATI.

15
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,496
KATI?

16
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,165
AH RIGHT, SHE'S
THE GENIUS TACTICIAN.

17
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,084
HER BRILLIANT SERIES OF
TACTICAL INSIGHTS

18
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,503
HAVE LED TO
VICTORY IN SEVEN CONFLICTS.

19
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,296
I HEAR THE AEU IS
SCOUTING HER

20
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,465
AND WANTS TO MAKE HER
A FIELD OFFICER.

21
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,175
THAT'S MY PERSONAL GOAL.

22
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,927
IF WARS CAN'T BE STOPPED,

23
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,471
THEN I'LL COME UP WITH TACTICS
TO RESOLVE THEM QUICKLY.

24
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,515
BY LIMITING CASUALTIES
TO A MINIMUM,

25
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,767
I'LL BE SAVING LIVES.

26
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,103
I WANT TO BECOME
A TACTICAL FORECASTER,

27
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,396
JUST LIKE KATI.

28
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,648
IF ANYONE CAN DO IT,
YOU CAN.

29
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,649
[GIGGLES]

30
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,443
WE MAY NEVER
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

31
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,195
I'M GONNA BE LONELY.

32
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,655
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING

33
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,864
YOU SHOULD SAY TO A GIRL

34
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,157
WHO'S FIVE YEARS
YOUNGER THAN YOU.

35
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,409
UGH!

36
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,451
UH, WELL, IT'S JUST...

37
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,953
I GUESS NOT.

38
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,914
LEESA! I READ
YOUR GRADUATION THESIS.

39
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,291
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

40
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,251
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
KATI!

41
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,670
THE NEXT TIME WE MEET
WE COULD BE ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

42
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,879
THOUGH, I'D HATE TO
FIND MYSELF

43
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,048
FACING YOU AS AN ENEMY.

44
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,885
Sumeragi: (Thinking)
MANNEQUIN.

45
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,977
WHY ARE YOU WITH THE A‐LAWS?

46
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,353
WHY?

47
00:01:45,939 --> 00:03:17,989
♪

48
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,630
Kim:
COLONEL, ANY MOVEMENT
FROM SUILLE, YET?

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,299
NO, NO CHANGE IN THE SITUATION.

50
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,386
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S BOUND TO
MAKE A MOVE SOONER OR LATER.

51
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,305
SUILLE OPPOSES THE MIDDLE EAST
REORGANIZATION PLAN

52
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,224
AND WE CAN NOT
UNDERESTIMATE IT.

53
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,851
IF IT DECIDES TO TAKE ACTION

54
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,354
YOU CAN BE SURE OTHER COUNTRIES
WILL FOLLOW ITS LEAD.

55
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,730
TO PREVENT THAT FROM OCCURRING,

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,732
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT HAS
DECIDED TO DISPATCH

57
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,359
THE AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE.

58
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,028
SENDING THE A‐LAWS?

59
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,655
Manager:
THE FEDERATION FORCES HAVE
STATIONED TROOPS

60
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,032
ON SUILLE'S
NATIONAL BORDERS.

61
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,119
OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE SENDING
A CLEAR WARNING TO SUILLE.

62
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,288
KNOWING ITS KING,
I DON'T EXPECT SUILLE

63
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,957
TO OPEN NEGOTIATIONS WITH
THE FEDERATION.

64
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,084
AND THE FACT
THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK

65
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,295
IN THE MIDDLE EAST
HAS BEEN CUT OFF,

66
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,464
MEANS ITS WORLD CLASS
INFORMATION INDUSTRY

67
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,425
CAN'T BE USED AS A WEAPON.

68
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,136
AND WITH THE FEDERATION
CONTROLLING WHAT'S HEARD,

69
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,888
IT'LL BE HARDER THAN EVER
FOR THE OUTSIDE WORLD

70
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,264
TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

71
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,891
WHAT'S SUILLE'S
MILITARY STRENGTH?

72
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,934
THOUGH I DON'T KNOW
ALL THE DETAILS,

73
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,478
I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE
THE STRONGEST COUNTRY

74
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,687
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

75
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,897
RARE MINERAL DEPOSITS

76
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,523
AND ITS INFORMATION
INDUSTRY MADE IT

77
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,691
THE REGION'S RICHEST NATION

78
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,234
BEFORE THE FEDERATION
WAS FORMED.

79
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,527
HOW RECKLESS.

80
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,822
EVEN WITH THAT THEY'RE NO MATCH
FOR THE FEDERATION'S MILITARY.

81
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,240
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE.

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,868
IN JUST FOUR YEARS,
EVEN A NATION LIKE SUILLE

83
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,495
COULDN'T HAVE DEVELOPED
NEW WEAPONS

84
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,371
TO SURPASS THOSE
OF THE FEDERATION.

85
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,707
HOWEVER, USING
OUR FORCES TO HELP THEM

86
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,792
ISN'T GOING TO MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

87
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,337
THERE'S REALLY
ONLY ONE THING WE CAN DO.

88
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,380
WE'LL USE SUILLE'S INFORMATION.

89
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,840
WE'LL TAKE WHAT IT KNOWS

90
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,134
ABOUT THE FEDERATION'S ABUSES
IN THE MIDDLE EAST

91
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,221
AND USE KATHARON'S CONNECTIONS
TO SHOW THEM TO THE WHOLE WORLD.

92
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,723
IF PUBLIC OPINION OPPOSES
THE FEDERATION'S ACTIONS,

93
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,308
IT'LL HAVE TO STOP MEDDLING
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

94
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,476
THAT MAKES SENSE.

95
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,769
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO START

96
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,729
SOME KIND OF DIALOGUE
WITH SUILLE.

97
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,690
IKEDA, CAN YOU GET US IN TOUCH
WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY?

98
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,067
I'LL HAVE TO USE
MY CONNECTIONS

99
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,361
FROM WHEN I WAS A REPORTER,
BUT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO.

100
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,695
PLEASE, DO SO.

101
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,074
FOR THE MIDDLE EAST...
NO, FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORLD.

102
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,159
HMM.
I UNDERSTAND.

103
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:33,458

104
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,125

(Gasps)
SHIRIN.

106
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,295
WHAT'S THE SITUATION
IN AZADISTAN?

107
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,172
HOW ARE THE PEOPLE
FARING THESE DAYS?

108
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,882
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY
SUBSTANTIAL NEWS

109
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,092
SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT

110
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,802
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
TAKING OVER.

111
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,679
INFORMATION ON
OUR COUNTRY IS ONLY RELEASED

112
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,430
AT THE WHIM OF THE FEDERATION.

113
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,890
AND EVEN IF WE WANTED
TO GO CHECK OUT

114
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,517
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN
AZADISTAN,

115
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,019
THE FEDERATION MILITARY HAS
SEALED THE BORDERS.

116
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,396
IT SEEMS HOPELESS.

117
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,855
I SEE.

118
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,524
MARINA.

119
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,693
IF WE EVER WANT TO
REBUILD AZADISTAN,

120
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,486
WE HAVE TO DEFEAT
THE FEDERATION.

121
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,862
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT.

122
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,782
AS THE PRINCESS,
YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO DO SO!

123
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,825
I CAN'T.

124
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,743
FIGHTING ONLY BRINGS
MORE FIGHTING!

125
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,079
IF I RECLAIMED AZADISTAN
BY FORCE,

126
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,289
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK

127
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,832
THAT WOULD BRING
HAPPINESS TO EVERYONE?

128
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,292
SO WE SHOULD
JUST GRIN AND BEAR IT?!

129
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,544
ARE YOU FORGETTING OUR HOMELAND
WAS STOLEN FROM US?!

130
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,879
SHIRIN.
I JUST THINK...

131
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,717
(Sighs)

132
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,343
Shirin:
FINE, THEN.

133
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,221
YOU JUST CONTINUE DOING NOTHING
LIKE YOU'RE DOING NOW.

134
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,598
I AM GOING TO FIGHT.

135
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,890
BECAUSE IF I DON'T,

136
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
WE'LL NEVER GET
OUR COUNTRY BACK.

137
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,399
SETSUNA.

138
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,484
I UNDERSTAND NOW.

139
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:46,239
HOW YOU MUST HAVE FELT WHEN
YOU LOST YOUR HOMELAND, KRUGIS.

140
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,450
IT FEELS LIKE
THE VERY GROUND IS DISAPPEARING

141
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,161
FROM BENEATH MY FEET.

142
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:55,040
HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO FIGHT
WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE THIS?

143
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,087
Goodman:
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT FROM
OUR OBSERVATION TEAM,

144
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,505
THERE'S A STRONG PROBABILITY

145
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,882
THAT CELESTIAL BEING'S
SPACESHIP

146
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,635
IS HEADED TO LAGRANGE THREE.

147
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,928
SINCE MAJOR RINDT IS
ON ANOTHER MISSION,

148
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,473
I'M LEAVING YOU IN CHARGE
OF THE GUNDAM PURSUIT.

149
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,724
SIR.

150
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,351
I'M SENDING YOU REINFORCEMENTS.

151
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,270
I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO AVENGE
THE LOSS OF COLONEL ZHEJIANG.

152
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,067
(Sighs)

153
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,234
KUJO.

154
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,534
Sumeragi: (Weeping)
EMILIO!

155
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,662
Kati:
IS IT POSSIBLE
THE MEMORY OF THAT INCIDENT

156
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,705
LINGERED WITHIN HER,

157
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,083
AND SO SHE DEVOTED HERSELF
TO CELESTIAL BEING'S

158
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:43,254
IDEAL OF
ELIMINATING WAR?

159
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,006
IT'S CRAZY.

160
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,342
IT'S NOTHING
BUT A FOOLISH DREAM.

161
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,554
THERE'S NO WAY THE WORLD
WILL EVER BE FREE OF CONFLICT.

162
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,849
AND WASN'T THE REASON
WE BECAME TACTICAL FORECASTERS

163
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,476
SO WE COULD PREVENT
THOSE CONFLICTS

164
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,978
FROM DRAGGING ON?

165
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,606
I'VE GOT YOUR MEAL HERE,
COLONEL, NICE AND HOT!

166
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,191
DIDN'T ANYONE
TEACH YOU TO KNOCK?!

167
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:03,608
(Frightened yelp)

168
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,159
BRING'S BEEN GIVEN ORDERS
TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK.

169
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,160
(Pleased sigh)

170
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,454
HOW WILL YOU REACT,
CELESTIAL BEING?

171
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:25,630
(Metal grinding)

172
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,466
SENSORS ARE
INDICATING ALL GREEN.

173
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,761
PARTICLE SUPPLY LEVELS
READING SATISFACTORY.

174
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,390
(Shocked gasp)
AZADISTAN IS...

175
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,726
BUT MY COUNTRY IS...

176
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,103
Setsuna: (Thinking)
MARINA.

177
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,772
ALI AL‐SAACHEZ.

178
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,442
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

179
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,695
AND I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO...

180
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,655
Feldt:
E‐SENSORS HAVE
DETECTED SOMETHING!

181
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,115
ENEMY MACHINE CLOSING IN!

182
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,783
AN ENEMY?!
IS IT A‐LAWS?!

183
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,452
(Gasps)
IT'S COMING.

184
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,871
HUH?
WHAT'S THE MATTER, MARIE?

185
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,872
(Grunts in pain)

186
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,873
MARIE!

187
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,041
IT'S COMING.

188
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,127
SOMETHING
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

189
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,796
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DANGEROUS?

190
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,091
Feldt:
THE MACHINE IS APPROACHING
AT A RATE OF 78 KILO‐SECONDS!

191
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,344
WHAT KIND OF SPEED
DOES IT HAVE?!

192
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,305
THE ENEMY FORCE
IS ONLY ONE MACHINE?

193
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,308
Mileina:
ARIOS AND SERAVEE ARE
STILL BEING REPAIRED!

194
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,436
GUNDAMS, EMERGENCY LAUNCH!
INTERCEPT THE ENEMY MACHINE.

195
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,897
Setsuna:
00, LAUNCHING FIRST.

196
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,953
THAT'S IT.

197
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,247
IT'S EQUIPPED WITH
A PSEUDO SOLAR REACTOR.

198
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,507
Setsuna:
IT'S A‐LAWS, LIKE I THOUGHT!

199
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,591
IT'S SO MANEUVERABLE.

200
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,885
ANOTHER NEW MODEL?

201
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,475
HUH?!
THAT'S A‐‐

202
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,893
IT HAS A GN FIELD!

203
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,728
THE FEDERATION HAS MACHINES
THAT USE FIELDS?!

204
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,896
(Grunts)

205
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,236
(Surprised gasp)

206
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,449
(Stunned gasp)

207
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,452
(Grunts)

208
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,703
I NEED THE TRANS‐AM!

209
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,455
(Startled gasp)

210
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,874
Lyle:
SETSUNA, YOU ALL RIGHT?!

211
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,879
THAT NEW MODEL WAS
STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERPOWER 00?!

212
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,885
Lyle:
WHAT THE...?

213
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,264
IT RAN AWAY?

214
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,015
Feldt:
THE ENEMY IS WITHDRAWING!

215
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,142
WELL, THAT WAS
A PRETTY QUICK BATTLE.

216
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,811
AFTER THE GUNDAMS ARE
SAFELY ON BOARD,

217
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,980
HEAD FOR LAGRANGE THREE
AT TOP SPEED.

218
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,481
Feldt:
ROGER THAT.

219
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,567
SO WHAT EXACTLY WAS
THE POINT OF ALL THAT?

220
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,026
THEY'RE TELLING US THAT

221
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
THEY CAN DEPLOY FORCES
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE,

222
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,821
AND THEY WANT TO SHOW US

223
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,573
THE CAPABILITIES OF
THEIR NEW MODEL.

224
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,366
IT'S A CHECK AND A WARNING.

225
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,618
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE NEEDING
THE 0‐RAISER'S HELP NOW

226
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,619
MORE THAN EVER.

227
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,080
THAT'S FOR SURE.

228
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,250
WAS THIS ANOTHER OF
MANNEQUIN'S FEINTS?

229
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,918
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

230
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,672
THE PILOT OF THAT NEW MODEL
IS AN INNOVATOR.

231
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,508
THE ONE THAT TOOK CONTROL
OF VEDA IS BEHIND THIS.

232
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,554
HE COULD DEVELOP SUITS
THAT CAN ALSO USE GN FIELDS.

233
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,638
AND THAT MEANS...

234
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,639
Sumeragi:
TIERIA?

235
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,807
(Gasps)

236
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,309
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

237
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,977
UH, NO.

238
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,730
WHY AM I NOT TELLING THEM
ABOUT HIM?

239
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,899
WHY AM I STILL HESITATING?

240
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,570
Goodman:
MAJOR RINDT,

241
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,280
HOW ARE THINGS
PROGRESSING?

242
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,740
EXACTLY AS PLANNED.

243
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,825
SO FAR, THINGS ARE PROCEEDING
WITHOUT A HITCH.

244
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,994
REPORT BACK TO ME
WHEN EVERYTHING'S IN PLACE.

245
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,663
AT THAT POINT I WILL BE
TAKING DIRECT COMMAND.

246
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,583
MESSAGE UNDERSTOOD, SIR.

247
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,501
JUST YOU WAIT, THOSE OF YOU

248
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,339
WHO OPPOSE
THE UNITED GOVERNMENT.

249
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,424
YOU ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A TASTE

250
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,927
OF HEAVEN'S THUNDER.

251
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,262
THE JUDGMENT OF GOD.

252
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,865
Feldt:
OPEN HATCH.

253
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,871
Mileina:
PTOLEMY HAS ALIGNED WITH
LASER SENSORS.

254
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,090
PTOLEMY, TOUCHING DOWN IN

255
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,093
THREE, TWO, ONE.

256
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,428
DOCKING COMPLETE.

257
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,766
Feldt:
ATTACHING ANCHOR ARMS.

258
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,893
CONNECTING BOARDING HATCH.

259
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,191
(Surprised gasp)

260
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,193
HEY, WE'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU GUYS TO SHOW UP!

261
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,195
HI, MOM!

262
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,071
I'M BACK HOME!

263
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,116
SO, HAVE YOU BEEN ALL RIGHT,
MILEINA?

264
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,659
OF COURSE I HAVE!

265
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,411
SHE SAID, "MOM" JUST NOW,
DIDN'T SHE?

266
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,662
YES, SHE DID.

267
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,788
SO, THAT MEANS...

268
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,081
OH, RIGHT, I FORGOT.

269
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,125
SOME OF YOU ARE MEETING HER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

270
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,459
THIS IS MY WIFE.

271
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,877
HELLO, I'M LINDA VASHTI.

272
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,045
WHOA, SHE'S YOUNG!

273
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,547
THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW.

274
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,715
HEY, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!

275
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,466
LET'S PUT THE JOKING
ASIDE FOR NOW.

276
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,301
WHY DO YOU THINK
THIS IS A JOKE?!

277
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,096
HOW LONG TO RESUPPLY AND
REPAIR PTOLEMY AND THE GUNDAMS?

278
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,097
HUH?

279
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,306
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?

280
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,892
THE A‐LAWS ARE CONDUCTING
OPERATIONS IN THIS SECTOR.

281
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,102
WELL, EVEN THOUGH
I THINK

282
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,271
OUR CAMOUFLAGE HERE
IS PERFECT...

283
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,355
I UNDERSTAND.

284
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,481
Anew:
HOWEVER,

285
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,192
REPAIR AND RESUPPLY WILL
REQUIRE AT LEAST FIVE DAYS.

286
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,444
AND WHO ARE YOU?

287
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,029
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE.

288
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,488
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

289
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,658
I WAS SCOUTED WHEN CELESTIAL
BEING RESUMED ITS OPERATIONS.

290
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,243
MY NAME IS ANEW RETURNER.

291
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,244
YOU WERE SCOUTED?

292
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,704
WELL, WHO SCOUTED YOU?

293
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,664
Ian:
WANG LIU MEI
INTRODUCED HER TO US.

294
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,750
ANEW IS SIMPLY AMAZING!

295
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,669
SHE'S AN EXPERT IN ASTROPHYSICS,
MOBILE SUIT ENGINEERING,

296
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,713
AND REGENERATION TREATMENTS.

297
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,673
SHE CAN NAVIGATE AND COOK,
AND TO TOP IT OFF,

298
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,091
SHE'S GORGEOUS!

299
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,136
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
IS SHE A KEEPER OR WHAT?!

300
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,889
I LOOK FORWARD TO
WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU.

301
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,355
WE'VE RECEIVED
A CODED MESSAGE FROM IKEDA!

302
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,191
THE SUILLE ROYAL FAMILY
WANTS A CONFERENCE.

303
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,693
REALLY? HE GOT THROUGH
TO THEM!

304
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,278
I'LL REPRESENT US
AT THE CONFERENCE.

305
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
YOU'LL BE IN CHARGE
WHILE I'M GONE.

306
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,406
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THINGS HERE.

307
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,532
YOU SHOULD TAKE
AN ESCORT WITH YOU

308
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,117
TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.

309
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,369
MM‐HMM.
I PLAN TO.

310
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,330
THIS CAR HERE IS RED.

311
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,748
HEY, PRINCESS?

312
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,957
YES, DEAR?

313
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,877
I HEARD SUILLE'S GONNA BE
ATTACKED, IS IT TRUE?

314
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,378
(Startled gasp)

315
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,756
NOW, NOW, STOP BOTHERING
THE PRINCESS!

316
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,509
I'M VERY SORRY.
THE BOY IS FROM SUILLE,

317
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,135
AND HE'S WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT COULD HAPPEN.

318
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,261
HMM.

319
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,683
WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUST
GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER?

320
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,770
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN,
I WONDER THE SAME THING.

321
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,105
SO WE HAVE TO DO OUR BEST

322
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,565
TO THINK UP WAYS FOR PEOPLE
TO GET ALONG.

323
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,236
THEY SHOULD JUST SIT DOWN
AND HAVE A MEAL TOGETHER!

324
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,403
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

325
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,656
I KNOW!
(Giggles)

326
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,990
THAT WAS GOOD.

327
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,909
WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK
PEOPLE SHOULD DO?

328
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,786
HMM...

329
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,579
EVERYONE CAN PLAY TOGETHER,

330
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,164
SING SONGS TOGETHER,

331
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,290
THAT'S RIGHT.

332
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,584
AND SHOW EACH OTHER
THEIR COOL STUFF!

333
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,504
AND THEN ALSO,
THEY CAN... UM... UM...

334
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,464
(Chuckles)

335
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,015
SO THIS IS THE 0‐RAISER.

336
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,184
THIS MACHINE INCORPORATES
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS

337
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,520
THAT HELP YOU CONTROL
THE TWIN DRIVE SYSTEM.

338
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,772
AND IT AMPLIFIES THE TRANS‐AM.

339
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,858
AND THAT MACHINE?

340
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,736
Anew:
A SUPPORT UNIT FOR ARIOS,
THE GN ARCHER.

341
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,364
THE GN ARCHER.

342
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,491
LET'S START TESTING IT,
SETSUNA.

343
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,660
ROGER THAT.

344
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,078
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT

345
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,915
THERE'D BE A BASE THIS LARGE
AT LAGRANGE THREE?

346
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,958
HMM?

347
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,087
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

348
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,089
HMM.

349
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,092
I'M KIND OF AT A LOSS ABOUT
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

350
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,510
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING I DID,

351
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,387
A LOT OF PEOPLE
LOST THEIR LIVES.

352
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,265
SOMEHOW I HAVE TO
MAKE UP FOR THAT.

353
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,977
BUT IF IT MEANS HAVING TO FIGHT,
OR TO ACTUALLY KILL PEOPLE,

354
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,770
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY‐‐

355
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,898
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT.

356
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,649
YES, BUT...

357
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,484
I HAVE TO HELP OUT SOMEHOW.

358
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,697
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING I CAN DO.

359
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,450
UM, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

360
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,492
SURE, WHAT ABOUT?

361
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,911
I JUST WANT TO KNOW

362
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,455
IF YOU INTEND TO STAY WITH THEM
FROM NOW ON.

363
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,041
YES. AS LONG AS
ALLELUJAH IS HERE.

364
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,127
EVEN IF IT MEANS
YOU MAY HAVE TO FIGHT?

365
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,503
I USED TO BE A SOLDIER,

366
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,088
SO I BELIEVE
I'VE ALREADY MADE MY PEACE

367
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,090
WITH THAT POSSIBILITY.

368
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,342
BESIDES,

369
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,427
I'VE MADE MY CHOICE.

370
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,514
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I WILL
NEVER LEAVE ALLELUJAH AGAIN.

371
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,600
HOW I ENVY YOU.

372
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,436
THERE'S SOMEONE I FEEL
THAT WAY ABOUT, TOO.

373
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,897
IF, BY SOME CHANCE, WE WERE TO
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN,

374
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,983
I DON'T THINK
I'D LEAVE HER SIDE EITHER.

375
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,611
BUT I'M WORRIED.

376
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,695
(Groaning in pain)

377
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,530
Saji:
I'M REALLY WORRIED.

378
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,242
(Gasping and moaning)

379
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,126
A RENDEZVOUS IN SPACE
JUST TO ADD MORE PERSONNEL.

380
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,378
HEY!

381
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,504
ANOTHER NEW MODEL.

382
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,214
COLONEL!

383
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,799
NEW MODEL?!

384
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,009
I WANT ONE,
GIVE ME A NEW MODEL TOO!

385
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:32,593
SHUT UP!

386
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,594
(Frightened gasp)
SHUT UP!

387
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:39,016
BUT... BUT COLONEL!

388
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,812
I NEVER EXPECTED YOU TO
JOIN THE A‐LAWS, TOO.

389
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,983
WHAT HAPPENED
TO BRING THIS ABOUT?

390
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,611
A MAN OF FEW WORDS,
AS ALWAYS.

391
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,363
WE'RE USING
THE MEMENTO MORI.

392
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,199
THE MEMENTO MORI?

393
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,409
IS THAT SO?

394
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,161
FINALLY, RIBBONS.

395
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,330
Regene:
USING THE MEMENTO MORI.

396
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,083
Ribbons:
WITH THIS, THE MIDDLE EAST PLAN
WILL ACCELERATE,

397
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,836
AND WE SHALL UNITE
THE WILL OF HUMANITY.

398
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,296
BY UNITE,

399
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,340
DON'T YOU ACTUALLY MEAN
TO SAY "STANDARDIZE"?

400
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,843
NO, I MEAN UNITE.

401
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,722
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY WILL
UNITE BEFORE OUR FEET.

402
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,433
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP IN BUILDING

403
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,893
THE MEMENTO MORI.

404
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,104
I HAVE GREAT HOPES
FOR THE FUTURE

405
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,064
YOU INNOVATORS ARE CREATING.

406
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,570
Al‐Saachez:
WHATCHA DOING?

407
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,946
(Surprised gasp)

408
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,240
YO!

409
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,783
Nena:
IT'S YOU!

410
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,328
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO...

411
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:44,498
MICHAEL AND JOHANN WERE...

412
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,459
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KILLED MY BROTHERS!

413
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,044
GET OUT OF HERE!

414
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,881
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED FAMILIAR,
YOU WERE THAT LITTLE GIRL.

415
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,091
BUT CLEARLY YOU'VE BECOME
A WOMAN SINCE.

416
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,218
SON OF A‐‐

417

(Gasps)

418
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,892
YOU WANNA FIGHT ME?
BETTER THINK AGAIN.

419
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,519
YOU WERE LUCKY TO
KEEP YOUR LIFE LAST TIME.

420
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,229
WHY THROW IT AWAY NOW?

421
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,230
(Grunts)

422
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,899
(Angry growl)

I LOOKED AROUND
LIKE YOU ORDERED, BOSS,

BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANYONE
MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION.

443
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,600
IS THAT SO?

444
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,810
THEN THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,520
SORRY TO

YOU KNOW, MAYBE I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT'LL MAKE UP FOR IT.

449
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,779
YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS TOO.

450
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,030
WHAT IS IT?

451
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,867
SOMETHING I THINK

IN BOTH PARTICLE GENERATION
AND EMISSION RATES!

470

IT'S PASSING
THE NORMAL 180% FIGURE,

AND THE NUMBERS ARE
STILL CLIMBING!

00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,986
THEN THIS IS...

481
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,697
THE TWIN DRIVE
THAT AEOLIA ENVISIONED.

482
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,867
ARE WE SEEING ITS TRUE POWER?

483
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,080
(Startled gasp)
COLONEL!

484
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,081
HUH?

485
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,833
(Cries)
MY HEAD!

486
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,251
(Grunts in pain)

487
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,961
WHA... WHAT IS THIS...

488
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,255
FEELING?

489
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,841
THAT LIGHT,
IT COULDN'T BE!

490
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,051
(Grunts)

491
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,056
Peries:
COLONEL!

492
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,893
GET AWAY FROM THERE, COLONEL!
RUN, COLONEL!

493
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,733
Hallelujah:
THE QUANTUM PARTICLES ARE
ACCELERATING IN THIS DIRECTION.

494
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,734
DAMN.

495
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,819
GUESS IT'S ABOUT TIME I WOKE UP.

496
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,909
Narrator:
WITH ITS TRUE AWAKENING,
THANKS TO 00 RAISER.

497
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,537
THE TWIN DRIVE INVITES SETSUNA
INTO UNKNOWN TERRITORY.

498
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,874
NEXT EPISODE: "00'S VOICE".

499
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,669
IS IT THE BIRTH CRY
OF A NEW WORLD?
