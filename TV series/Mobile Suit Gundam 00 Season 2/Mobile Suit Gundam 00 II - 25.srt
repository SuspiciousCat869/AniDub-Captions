00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,983
I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND THEM!

168
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,693
(Gasps)
HMM.

169
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,696
Setsuna:
TRANS AM!

170
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,880
I WILL STOP YOU!

171
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,176
HE QUANTIZED HIMSELF!

172
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,553
(Grunts)

173
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,722
(Aggressive yell)

174
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,726
DAMN YOU!

175
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,371
Ribbons:
(Laughing)

176
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,583
I FINALLY HAVE ONE!
AN ORIGINAL SOLAR REACTOR!

177
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,002
WITH THIS, I'LL BECOME
THE EMBODIMENT

178
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,004
OF THE AEOLIA PLAN ITSELF.

179
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,092
NO, I'LL BECOME A BEING THAT
TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT!

180
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,134
(Gasps)

181
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,470
(Grunts)
MY MACHINE'S DAMAGED.

182
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,639
AT THIS RATE...

183
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,807
(Gasps)

184
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,188
(Chuckles)

185
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,650
I'VE FOUND MY DESTINY.

186
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,695
NOW, I CAN CARRY ON FIGHTING!

187
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,119
(Groaning)

188
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,083
(Grunting)

189
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,084
(Gasps)

190
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,711
THAT'S THE...!

191
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,883
Ribbons:
GN DRIVE, MATCHING CLEARED.

192
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,719
IT WORKS!

193
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,930
WHERE ARE YOU?
WHERE HAVE YOU GOTTEN TO,

194
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,682
SETSUNA F. SEIEI?

195
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,683
HUH?

196
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,351
THERE YOU ARE!

197
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,645
(Gasps)
THERE'S NO SOLAR REACTOR.

198
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,189
COULD...
COULD HE HAVE...

199
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,858
HE DID IT!

200
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,824
Setsuna:
GUNDAM EXIA.

201
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,076
SETSUNA F. SEIEI,

202
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,495
SLASHING THROUGH
TO THE FUTURE!

203
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,830
(Grunts)

204
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,583
YOU ARE NOTHING
BUT A MERE HUMAN!

205
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,962
(Aggressive yell)

206
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,840
Marina:
SETSUNA.

207
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,509
EVEN IF YOU NEVER READ
THIS LETTER,

208
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,970
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I WRITE IT.

209
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,725
SO PLEASE, LET ME PUT MY
FEELINGS ABOUT YOU INTO WORDS.

210
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:19,150
YOU WERE FORCED TO FIGHT
AS A CHILD SOLDIER OF KRUGIS,

211
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,155
UNTIL EVENTUALLY, YOU COULD
LIVE ONLY ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

212
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,698
(Aggressive yell)

213
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,160
EVEN THOUGH WE BOTH SHARE
THE SAME DESIRE TO SEEK PEACE,

214
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,622
(Grunts)

215
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:37,752
EVEN THOUGH WE UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER,

216
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:41,923
WHY IS IT...
MY PATH AND YOURS...

217
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,300
WILL NEVER INTERSECT?

218
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,264
YOU USE FORCE TO TRY TO
ELIMINATE CONFLICT

219
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,100
FROM THE WORLD.

220
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,938
EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SUCCEED,

221
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:00,691
WOULD YOU EVER FIND
YOUR OWN HAPPINESS IN IT?

222
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,704
YOU'RE BURDENED WITH SIN,
AND YOU SUFFER SCARS,

223
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,750
AND YET YOU CONTINUE TO FIGHT.

224
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,129
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT
YOUR WAY OF LIVING IS...

225
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,880
UNBEARABLY SAD.

226
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,138
I BELIEVE THAT
SHARING WITH OTHERS

227
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,765
THE HAPPINESS THAT IS
WITHIN EACH PERSON,

228
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,726
AND THEN EXPANDING
THOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,

229
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:40,565
IS WHAT WILL LEAD US
TO TRUE PEACE.

230
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,109
SO PLEASE,
IT IS MY WISH THAT

231
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:47,613
SOMEHOW YOU WILL SEIZE
YOUR OWN HAPPINESS.

232
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,617
SETSUNA, I PRAY THAT SOMEDAY,

233
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,703
HAPPINESS FINDS YOU.

234
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,250
(Children laughing)

235
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,585
(Knocking on door)

236
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,752
(Door opens)

237
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,088
Attendant:
PRINCESS MARINA,
IT'S TIME.

238
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,424
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

239
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,468
ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN,
TIME TO GO.

240
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,887
Children:
OKAY!

241
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,855
Marina:
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE EARTH
SPHERE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT,

242
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,317
WE HAVE RECONSTRUCTED OUR
BELOVED NATION OF AZADISTAN.

243
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,864
I WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO
ENSURE THAT THIS SUPPORT

244
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,617
EXTENDS TO ALL THE NATIONS
OF THE MIDDLE EAST.

245
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,285
(Applause)

246
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:39,540
(Crowd cheering)

247
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,420
SETSUNA, I'M GOING TO SPREAD
THIS SMALL PEACE.

248
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,964
LIKE A STORY
THAT GETS RETOLD.

249
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,718
LIKE A SONG
THAT TOUCHES PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

250
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,354
Saji:
IT SEEMS THE CELLULAR
ABNORMALITIES

251
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,397
THAT WERE SPREADING
THROUGHOUT LOUISE'S BODY

252
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,775
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY HALTED.

253
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,693
I WONDER IF THAT LIGHT
SETSUNA RELEASED

254
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,739
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THAT, TOO.

255
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,326
EVEN IF WE NEVER FIND OUT
THE TRUTH OR THE REAL REASON,

256
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,703
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
THAT SHE'S HERE.

257
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,459
Louise:
LOOK.

258
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,712
IT'S THE NEW PRESIDENT OF
THE FEDERATION.

259
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,053
Saji:
PEOPLE FROM KATHARON
ARE THERE.

260
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,721
President:
THE AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE,

261
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,140
WHICH WAS GUILTY OF
NUMEROUS ATROCITIES

262
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,726
AND THE MANIPULATION OF
INFORMATION TO HIDE THE TRUTH,

263
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,895
HAS BEEN DISBANDED.

264
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,191
WE WILL BEGIN TO REORGANIZE THE
EARTH SPHERE FEDERATION FORCES.

265
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,194
FURTHERMORE, I HEREBY DECLARE
THAT WE SHALL DO OUR UTMOST

266
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,571
TO PROVIDE AID
TO NON‐MEMBER NATIONS,

267
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,615
AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO JOIN US,

268
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,784
ALLOWING US TO WORK
TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT

269
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,953
OF A TRUE EARTH SPHERE
FEDERATION!

270
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:06,127
(Applause)

271
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,504
WITH THIS,
THE WORLD REALLY IS CHANGING.

272
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,880
YES,

273
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,049
BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
OF WHAT'S TO COME.

274
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,928
A PEACEFUL WORLD FILLED WITH
UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.

275
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,639
IT'S PRETTY EASY
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

276
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,391
BUT WE HAVE TO
MAKE DAMN SURE

277
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,268
WE WORK HARD TO ACHIEVE
THAT GOAL,

278
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,562
FOR THE SAKE OF
THE GENERATIONS TO COME.

279
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,939
YES, YOU'VE GOT THAT RIGHT,
KLAUS.

280
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,649
THE CHANGE IS GOING TO
HAVE TO BEGIN WITH

281
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,026
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.

282
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,112
RIGHT.

283
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,698
President:
FOR A TRUE EARTH SPHERE
FEDERATION.

284
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,367
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT,
WE INTEND TO ESTABLISH‐‐

285
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,578
Louise:
HEY, SAJI,

286
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,372
WHAT'S THE WORLD GONNA BE LIKE
FROM NOW ON?

287
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:49,170
Saji:
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

288
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,715
BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD
TO REMAIN IGNORANT ANY LONGER.

289
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,968
IT WAS ALL SO PEACEFUL
WHERE WE LIVED,

290
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,556
THEN WE SAW THE REAL WORLD,
WE EXPERIENCED WAR,

291
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,935
AND IT MADE US AWARE OF
HOW IMPORTANT EVERYTHING WAS.

292
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,063
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
GIVE IT SOME REAL THOUGHT.

293
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,272
BECAUSE REALLY,

294
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,399
IF WE DESIRE PEACE,

295
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,859
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

296
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,736
THINK ABOUT
THE REST OF THE WORLD, TOO.

297
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,862
YEAH.

298
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,619
Andrei:
GENERAL, HOW HAS
HEADQUARTERS DECIDED

299
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,663
TO HANDLE CELESTIAL BEING?

300
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,247
Kati:
THEY DESERVE CREDIT
FOR THEIR ROLE

301
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,416
IN HELPING TO TAKE DOWN
THE CORRUPT A‐LAWS.

302
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,627
HOWEVER, SO LONG AS
THEY DO NOT DISARM,

303
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,961
THEY REMAIN
A DANGEROUS ENTITY

304
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,923
AND THEY ARE A THREAT TO
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION.

305
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,593
IF THEY TAKE ANY ACTION,
WE WILL RESPOND AT ONCE.

306
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,470
MA'AM!

307
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,304
Patrick:
COLONEL!

308
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,472
Patrick:
HMM?
COLONEL!

309
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,890
WHAT'S TAKING YOU SO LONG?

310
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,767
DON'T COME IN
WITHOUT KNOCKING!

311
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,394
ALSO, I'VE BEEN PROMOTED
TO GENERAL.

312
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,938
UH, I'M SORRY.

313
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,774
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
YOU'RE RUNNING BEHIND HERE!

314
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,068
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE STAR OF
THE SHOW BEING LATE?!

315
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,029
OKAY, I KNOW.

316
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,491
(Church bell ringing)

317
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,700
Patrick:
(Laughing)

318
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,702
COLASOUR THE INDESTRUCTIBLE
HAS BECOME

319
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,289
COLASOUR
THE RIDICULOUSLY LUCKY!

320
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,457
(Laughing)

321
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,209
OH, BOY.

322
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,420
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

323
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,715
(Cheering)

324
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,890
Andrei:
I'LL LIVE MY LIFE AS A SOLDIER.

325
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,352
I'LL PROTECT THE CITIZENS AND
FIGHT WHATEVER THREATENS PEACE.

326
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,937
I'LL BE THE KIND OF SOLDIER

327
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,689
MY FATHER AND MOTHER
ASPIRED TO BE.

328
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:46,078
Lyle:
DAD, MOM, AMY, NEIL.

329
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,958
I'M CUTTING MY TIES
WITH KATHARON,

330
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,044
AND I'M CHOOSING
THE LIFE OF A GUNDAM MEISTER.

331
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,882
I'M GONNA FACE THIS WORLD AS
LOCKON STRATOS.

332
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,928
EVEN IF THE WORLD SHOULD
REJECT ME,

333
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,765
I'LL KEEP ON FIGHTING
UNTIL I'M PUNISHED.

334
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:11,437
GUESS I WON'T BE HEADING TO
WHERE YOU ARE JUST YET.

335
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,900
UNTIL THAT DAY COMES,
PLEASE WAIT FOR ME, ANEW.

336
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,407
Allelujah:
THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO
CHANGE ONCE AGAIN.

337
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,701
BUT THE SINS
I'VE COMMITTED FOR THAT GOAL,

338
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,370
THE SIN OF TAKING
PEOPLE'S LIVES,

339
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,080
THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE.

340
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,917
ALLELUJAH?

341
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,211
HUH?

342
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,922
THIS WORLD IS FILLED WITH
CONTRADICTIONS.

343
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,508
I MYSELF AM
A CONTRADICTION.

344
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,511
BUT WE NEED TO CHANGE ALL THAT.

345
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,139
WE'RE GONNA FIND IT.

346
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,726
A MEANING FOR OUR LIVES.
THE ANSWER.

347
00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:00,986
Tieria:
NOW WE'VE ENTRUSTED
THE FUTURE TO HUMANITY.

348
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,073
I WILL BECOME A PART OF VEDA
AND WATCH OVER YOU ALL.

349
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,116
UNTIL THAT TIME,

350
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,495
THE TIME OF THE DIALOGUES
THAT ARE TO COME.

351
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,705
FAREWELL, EVERYONE.

352
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,591
Saji:
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO THE WORLD.

353
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:27,263
BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE STILL
ABLE TO MAKE OUR OWN CHOICES.

354
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,265
ALTHOUGH WE CAN'T CHANGE
THE PAST,

355
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,559
WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE,

356
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,811
INTO THE WORLD
WE DESIRE.

357
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,481
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
WE MAKE A MISTAKE?

358
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,650
IF THERE'S SOME
MISUNDERSTANDING,

359
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,070
AND THEN NEW FIGHTING
BREAKS OUT,

360
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,657
I'M SURE THEY'LL RETURN.

361
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,492
EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO TAKE

362
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:52,288
ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS
UPON THEMSELVES.

363
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,124
LET'S GO,
WE CAN'T REST JUST YET.

364
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,250
THERE'S STILL WORK.

365
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,876
HMM.

366
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,878
WE HAVE TO WATCH OVER
THE WORLD

367
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,464
THAT EVERYONE GAVE
THEIR LIVES TO CHANGE.

368
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,300
THAT'S RIGHT.

369
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,640
Setsuna:
WE ARE CELESTIAL BEING.

370
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,352
OUR GOAL IS
THE ERADICATION OF WAR.

371
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,855
EVEN IF THE WORLD
CHOOSES TO REJECT US,

372
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:22,192
WE WILL CONTINUE TO
CONFRONT IT.

373
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,029
AND EVEN IF WE MUST USE FORCE
TO DO SO,

374
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,617
WE WILL ACT AS
A DETERRENT FOR THE WORLD.

375
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:34,622
THAT'S THE REASON
WHY WE MUST CONTINUE TO EXIST.

376
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,498
FOR THE FUTURE.
