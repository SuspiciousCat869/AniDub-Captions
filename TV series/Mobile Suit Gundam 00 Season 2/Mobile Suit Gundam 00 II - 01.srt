00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,204
Klaus:
RESOLUS WAS ATTACKED
BY MOBILE SUITS?

2
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,039
DAMN FEDERATION...

3
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,125
ATTACKING WITHOUT
ANY WARNING LIKE THAT.

4
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,835
I HEARD THERE WERE
NEW MODEL MOBILE SUITS

5
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,962
MIXED IN WITH
THE ENEMY FORCES.

6
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,631
MAYBE WE SHOULD...

7
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,758
LOOK KLAUS,
THESE GUYS ARE SERIOUS.

8
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,594
I THINK IT'S BEST WE POSTPONE
THE RESCUE OPERATION AT PROUD.

9
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,263
NO. IN FACT,

10
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,223
I THINK WE SHOULD PUSH
FOR AN EARLIER START.

11
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,475
A LOT OF OUR COMRADES' LIVES
ARE ON THE LINE.

12
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,602
(Tense sigh)

13
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,647
I'M SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE THEM.

14
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,107
I UNDERSTAND.

15
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,234
I'LL CONTACT THE RESCUE TEAM
AND TELL THEM

16
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,861
THAT THE OPERATION'S
BEEN RESCHEDULED.

17
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,779
PLEASE DO THAT.

18
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,115
HMM.

19
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,370
Klaus:
DAMN A‐LAWS!

00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,843
Spokesperson:
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT
HEREBY ANNOUNCES

UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL,

23
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,099
IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS.

24
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,019
ACTING IN COOPERATION WITH
THE FEDERAL SECURITY AGENCY,

25
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,854
PEACEKEEPERS WILL EFFICIENTLY
BEGIN OPERATIONS TO‐‐

26
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,397
Kati:
HEADQUARTERS
HAS JUST INFORMED ME

27
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,815
THEY WANT TO TRANSFER ME

28
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,525
TO THE AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE.

29
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,069
DO YOU PLAN ON GOING?

30
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,612
IT MIGHT NOT BE
SUCH A BAD IDEA

31
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,197
TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
AT THESE A‐LAWS

32
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,657
THAT'S A GROUP
THAT HAS TOO MANY SECRETS.

33
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,202
I'D BE GRATEFUL IF YOU KEPT
ME INFORMED OF YOUR FINDINGS.

34
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,371
I ALWAYS INTENDED TO.
LATER, THEN.

35
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,623
YEAH.

36
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,000
WAS THAT
COLONEL MANNEQUIN?

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,169
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

38
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,213
WHAT DID SHE WANT?

39
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,966
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

40
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,677
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO
THE MATTER WE DISCUSSED EARLIER?

41
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,596
(Gasps)

42
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,598
NO, NOT YET.

43
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,018
THERE'S NO NEED TO
RUSH ANYTHING.

44
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,187
TAKE YOUR TIME
AND THINK IT OVER.

45
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,741
Miyasaka:
THAT'S GOOD.

46
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,661
STEADY... STEADY...

47
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,996
STOP! RIGHT THERE
IS JUST PERFECT!

48
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,499
(Relieved sigh)

49
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,585
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GETTING
PRETTY GOOD AT THIS JOB, ROOKIE!

50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,587
I'VE BEEN HERE
HALF A YEAR ALREADY.

51
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,214
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA STOP
CALLING ME ROOKIE,

52
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,799
MY NAME IS
SAJI CROSSROAD‐‐

54
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,803
EDDIE MIYASAKA RIGHT?

55
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,638
ON SUSPICION OF
CONSPIRING WITH KATHARON,

56
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,347
YOU ARE HEREBY‐‐

(Grunts)

58
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,562
BASTARD!

59
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,646
DAMN!

60
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,606
MR. MIYASAKA!

61
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,774
I'M TAKING YOU IN, TOO!

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,235
(Cries in pain)

64
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,862
(Choking)

65
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,614
Saji:
WAIT A MINUTE! WON'T YOU EVEN
TELL ME WHAT I'VE DONE?!

66
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,658
PLEASE! STOP IT!

67
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,827
IT'S CONFIRMED, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE FEDERATION'S

68
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,122
NEW SPACE CRUISER IS MAKING
ITS WAY TOWARDS LAGRANGE 4.

69
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,874
IT'S JUST LIKE
WANG LIU MEI REPORTED.

70
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,125
MAYBE THIS WILL‐‐

00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,793
I'M GOING OUT
WITH SERAVEE.

72
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,545
WELL, ROGER THAT!

HE'LL COME.

74
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,217
IF HE'S STILL ALIVE,
I KNOW HE'LL COME.

75
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,944
(Men grunting)

76
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,239
(Straining)
FORCED TO DO HARD LABOR
IN HIGH GRAVITY!

77
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,701
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO USE
ANY MACHINES!

78
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,203
(Collapsing groan)

79
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,496
ARE YOU OKAY?

80
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,331

IF YOU WANT TO LIVE,
SHUT UP AND KEEP WORKING!

GET BACK TO WORK, R‐81!

85
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,215
(Groans)

86
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,393
DISTANCE,
2300 TO PROUD.

87
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,687
MAINTAIN GN PARTICLE DISPERSAL
AT NORMAL LEVELS.

88
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,189
COLONEL ZHEJIANG,

89
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,691
I UNDERSTAND
WE'VE FOUND THE KATHARON VESSEL.

90
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,943
YES, SIR.

91
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,319
A RECON UNIT DETECTED IT.

92
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,947
WE ARE CURRENTLY
TRACING ITS COURSE.

93
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,157
SO THEY ARE HEADING TO
PROUD AFTER ALL.

94
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,535
WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS
OF OUR NEW AUTOMATONS?

95
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,828
ALL UNITS ARE
PREPARED FOR DEPLOYMENT, SIR.

96
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,829

00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,558
CAPTAIN ZININ.

104
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,102
THIS WILL BE WARRANT OFFICER
HALEVY'S FIRST SORTIE.

105
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,855
JUST LET HER GET A FEEL

106
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,107

107
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,193
ZININ TEAM,
READY AND LAUNCHING!

108
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,772
(Thinking)
IS IT BEING TARGETED?

109
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,190
THIS PLACE, TOO.

110
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,820
(Men straining)

111
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,989
I CAN'T LET THIS BEAT ME!

112
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,616
AS LONG AS
I'M IN SPACE,

113
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,160
THEN MAYBE ONE DAY,
LOUISE...

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,162
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE EX‐MILITARY.

115
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,164
ARE YOU A MEMBER
OF KATHARON, TOO?

116
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,124
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THEM!

117
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,335
JUST HAPPENED
TO GET CAUGHT UP?

118
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,545
STILL, THINGS COULD BE
A WHOLE LOT WORSE!

119
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,380
AND WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,007
YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

121
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,144
HURRY UP

00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,023
R‐RIGHT!

124
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,192
SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH MY SUIT.

125
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,864
(Surprised cry)

126
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,449
WHAT HAPPENED?

127
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,118
(Struggling gasp)

128
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,119
(Startled gasp)

129
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,162
WHAT "OPERATION"?

130
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,330
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

131
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,373
ANSWER ME.

132
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,124
(Gasps)
I DON'T KNOW.

133
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,920
WE WERE JUST GIVEN ORDERS TO
EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY!

134
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,546
HEY YOU!
HOLD ON!

135
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,215
YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING TO
LEAVE ME HERE, ARE YOU?!

136
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,216
(Crash)

137
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,217
(Surprised gasp)

138
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,176
WHAT'S THAT?

139
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,945
REALDO TEAM HAS COMPLETED
INITIAL OPERATION!

140
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,196

00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,547
AND THEN HACK INTO IT!

146
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,798

(Groans)

150
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,647
WHAT'S GOING ON?

151
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,815
THE GRAVITY!

152
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,150
THEY'VE COME
TO PICK US UP!

153
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,817
HUH?

154
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,777
OUR COMRADES ARE HERE!

155
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,157

160
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,581
THAT MEANS
THEY'RE A‐LAWS.

161
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,214
(Screaming)

162
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,260
HUH?

163
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,304

00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,771
I'LL PROCEED WITH
THE PERFORMANCE TEST

169
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,189
FOR THE NEW AUTOMATONS.

170
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,200
Pilot:
IT'S TOO FAST!

171
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,217
Zinin:
I'VE REACHED THE TARGET POINT.
RELEASING CONTAINER.

172
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,809
NOW COMMENCING ACTIVATION
OF THE NEW AUTOMATONS.

173
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,770
(Machines whirring)

174
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:13,196
(Men shouting)

175
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:17,742
(Rapid gunfire)

176
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,369
MILITARY AUTOMATONS?!

177
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,037
WHAT'S GOING ON?!

178
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,920
(Surprised gasp)

179
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,798
(Panicked screaming)

180
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,258
(Gasps)

181
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,926
Setsuna:
ANTI‐PERSONNEL WEAPONS?

182
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,637
A‐LAWS MUST BE DOING THIS!

183
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,181
(Beeping and whirring)

184
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,183
(Rapid gunfire)

185
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,351

186
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,813
(Frightened panting)

187
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,192
(Determined grunt)

188
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:55,989
(Grunts)

189
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,202
(Gasps)

190
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,373
(Panting)

191
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,466
(Gasps)

192
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,384
Setsuna:

193
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,221
(Yells)

194
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,437
(Heavy breathing)

195
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,022
Setsuna:
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

196
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,189
(Gasps)

197
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,490
I'M GRATEFUL.

198
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,742
HUH?

199
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,118
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

200
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,872
COULD YOU BE
SETSUNA F. SEIEI?

201
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,583
AND YOU'RE SAJI CROSSROAD.

202
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,596

00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,601
WE'RE GOING!

204
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,190
FEDERATION DOG!

205
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,528
Alagga:
UNIT THREE?

206
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,489
NOT BAD.

207
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,200
Zinin:
UNIT THREE,
THAT WAS A GOOD CALL.

208
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,370
(Shallow breathing)

209
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,751
SETSUNA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

210
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,710
JUST KEEP QUIET.

211
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,962
(Nervous gasp)

212
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:34,712
(Automaton approaching)

213
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,472
YOU OKAY?

214
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,807
YEAH.

215
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,226
(Gasps)

216
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,394
THIS WAY!

217
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,898
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

218
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,776
NOT ONE DAMN THING HAS CHANGED
IN ALL THIS TIME!

219
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,361
A READING
ON THE E‐SENSOR?

220
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,197
ENEMY REINFORCEMENTS!

221
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,201
THIS ISN'T WHAT WE WERE AFTER!

222
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,378
I DIDN'T WANT THIS,
AND NEITHER DID LOCKON!

223
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,006
NOT A WORLD LIKE THIS!

224
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,216
Setsuna:
YOUR HELMET.

225
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,217
Saji:
HUH?

226
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,219
OH, RIGHT.

227
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,805
(Gasps)

228
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,979
(Stunned gasping)

229
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,191
Alagga:
CAPTAIN! THAT SILHOUETTE!

230
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,609
YEAH.

231
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,445
AND THOSE GN PARTICLES.

232
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,779
(Gasps)

233
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,158
THE NUMBER OF AUTOMATONS
IN THERE...

234
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,784
IT'S DECREASING!

235
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,998
WHAT THE...?!

236
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,207
Alagga:
CAPTAIN! ABOVE US!

237
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,378
Alagga:
(Surprised cry)

238
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,133
THAT'S A...!

239
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,134
(Shocked gasp)

240
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,385
G‐GUNDAM!

241
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,597
HMM.

242
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,015
IT'S EXIA.

243
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,183
GUNDAM EXIA.

244
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,562
Saji:
SETSUNA.

245
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,189
HOW COULD YOU?

246
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:25,364
(Panting heavily)

247
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,201
MY HEAD IS JUST...!

248
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,204
Zinin:
SO IT'S CELESTIAL BEING,
IS IT?!

249
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,126
WHY WAIT TILL NOW
TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE?!

250
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,170
Setsuna:
I'LL DESTROY YOU.

251
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,172
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
DESTROY YOU.

252
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,383
ALL OF YOU OUT THERE
WHO DO THINGS LIKE THIS!

253
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,220
I'LL ELIMINATE YOU
ALL BY MYSELF!

254
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,016
YOU MAY BE A GUNDAM,
BUT YOU'RE FIVE YEARS OLD!

255
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,227
YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR MY AHEAD!

256
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,148
(Grunts)

257
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,737
UNIT THREE, COVERING FIRE!

258
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,072
HUH?

259
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,782
WARRANT OFFICER HALEVY,
WHAT'S WRONG?!

260
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,617
(Heavy panting)

261
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:14,205
Zinin:
NEVER MIND, THE TWO OF US
CAN TAKE CARE OF IT!

262
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,042
I LOST A LOT OF FRIENDS
TO YOU BASTARDS!

263
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,877
(Metal crashing)

264
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,796
AND THIS IS MY CHANCE...

265
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,881
(Setsuna grunts)

266
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,383
...TO AVENGE THEM!

267
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,221
(Metal grinding)

268
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,224
(Frustrated gasp)

269
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,976
YOUR TIME IN THIS WORLD

270
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,228
HAS ALREADY ENDED!

271
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,356
(Frustrated growl)

272
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,192
I'VE GOT YOU NOW, GUNDAM!

273
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,780
(Gasp)

274
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,202
Alagga:
WHAT THE...?!

275
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,664
(Gasps)

276
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,000
THAT LOOKS LIKE A...

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,376
GUNDAM!

278
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,596
Alagga:
I GOTCHA!

279
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,765
WHAT?!

280
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,392
THAT'S A GN FIELD!

281
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,355
Alagga:
THERE'S A FACE ON ITS BACK!

282
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,194
(Alagga screaming)

283
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,617
Zinin:
WE'RE WITHDRAWING!
WARRANT OFFICER HALEVY!

284
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,535
UNIT THREE,
RESPOND IMMEDIATELY!

285
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,621
(Grunts)

286
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,206
DAMN IT.

287
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,844
Tieria:
I KIND OF FIGURED
YOU'D BE TRACKING

288
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,221
THE A‐LAWS' ACTIVITIES.

289
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,640
LONG TIME NO SEE,
SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

290
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,891
TIERIA...

291
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,434
ERDE.

292
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,103
Mileina:
MR. ERDE HAS LOCATED EXIA!

293
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,439
SETSUNA, SO YOU WERE
ON PROUD THEN.

294
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,691
MISS WANG'S INFORMATION
WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY!

295
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,027
I BET HE'S GONNA BE SURPRISED
WHEN HE SHOWS UP

296
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,820
AND SEES YOU ON
THE BRIDGE, MR. LASSE.

297
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,572
YEAH, I IMAGINE SO.

298
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,283
SO, YOU'RE ALIVE AFTER ALL,
SETSUNA.

299
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,828
NOW WE CAN TRY OUT
EXIA'S SOLAR REACTOR.

300
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,539
GUNDAMS SHOWED UP
AT PROUD?

301
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,709
WELL THEN, I GUESS WE OWE THEM
A DEBT OF GRATITUDE.

302
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,212
THANKS TO THEM WE WERE ABLE TO
RESCUE OUR COMRADES

303
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,339
WHO WERE
STILL ALIVE IN THERE.

304
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,341
BESIDES, THIS IS A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY.

305
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,593
YOU KNOW THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

306
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,387
THAT THEY COULD TARGET US
FOR AN ARMED INTERVENTION.

307
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,098
NO.

308
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,350
AFTER ALL,
THEY'RE THE KIND OF PEOPLE

309
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,228
WHO SHARE THE SAME AMBITIONS
AND IDEALS AS WE DO.

310
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,025
IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS,

311
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,236
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.

312
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,822
ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE BIT.

313
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,198
YOU LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.

314
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,783
I GET THAT A LOT.

315
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,326
HMM.

316
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,203
SO, DOES THIS GUNDAM

317
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,122
BELONG TO CELESTIAL BEING?

318
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,916
Tieria:
NATURALLY.

319
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,128
Saji: (Angrily)
SETSUNA F. SEIEI!

320
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,630
HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN
THE PILOT OF THAT GUNDAM?!

321
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,632
SAJI CROSSROAD.

322
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,884
ANSWER ME!

323
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,345
YES.

324
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,972
THAT MEANS...

325
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,640
YOU WERE INVOLVED
FIVE YEARS AGO!

326
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,059
YES, I WAS.

327
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,516
HMPH.

328
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,106
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?!

329
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,607
BECAUSE OF WHAT
YOU WERE DOING

330
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,027
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED
WHO DIDN'T HAVE TO!

331
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,362
AND YOU'RE THE ONES
RESPONSIBLE!

332
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,659
BECAUSE OF YOU GUYS,

333
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,995
THE PERSON I LOVED

334
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,621
WAS INJURED,

335
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,583
AND HER FAMILY AND RELATIVES
WERE KILLED!

336
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,464
AND THEN ALL I HAD LEFT
WAS MY SISTER,

337
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,343
BUT SHE CROSSED PATHS
WITH CELESTIAL BEING,

338
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,720
AND SHE WAS KILLED, TOO!

339
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,683
(Sobbing)

340
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,145
I LOST LOUISE...

341
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,565
AND MY SISTER!

342
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,442
THEY'RE BOTH GONE NOW!

343
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,611
(Sobbing)

344
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,196
SAY SOMETHING!

345
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,367
(Furious grunt)

346
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,579
SAY SOMETHING!

347
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,167
YOU GIVE THEM BACK!

348
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,877
GIVE THEM BACK TO ME.

349
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,796
BOTH OF THEM!

350
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,384
(Screaming)
GIVE THEM BACK TO ME!

351
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,520
Zhejiang:
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
GUNDAMS WOULD STAND IN OUR WAY?

352
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,688
A SPLENDID TURN OF EVENTS.

353
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,816
THEIR APPEARANCE
MAKES OUR ORGANIZATION

354
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,276
ALL THE MORE NECESSARY.

355
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,114
(Nervous gasping)

356
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,368
HMPH.

357
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,204
WHY IS SOMEONE LIKE THIS
EVEN IN THE A‐LAWS?

358
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,958
Ribbons:
LOUISE HALEVY.

359
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,584
I'M PLEASED FOR YOU.

360
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,044
WITH ALL THAT'S HAPPENED,

361
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,296
NOW YOU HAVE
A REASON TO FIGHT, TOO.

362
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,215
Regene:
RIBBONS. YOU HAVE A GUEST.

363
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,475
THE AUTONOMOUS PEACEKEEPING
FORCE ENCOUNTERED A NEW GUNDAM.

364
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,644
WHETHER OR NOT THE GUNDAM
BELONGS TO CELESTIAL BEING

365
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,438
IS STILL UNCLEAR.

366
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,606
GUN... DAM.

367
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,026
I SEE.

368
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,195
I'M GLAD
THEY'VE COME OUT AGAIN.

369
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,197
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE SO HAPPY

370
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,783
TO BE BORN
UNDER THE SIGN OF VIRGO.

371
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,412
I AM FROM
THE FEDERATION MILITARY

372
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,247
AUTONOMOUS PEACEKEEPING FORCE,

373
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,999
AND I AM HERE FOR
LIEUTENANT SOMA PERIES.

374
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,834
I AM LIEUTENANT
ANDREI SMIRNOV

375
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,670
OF THE FIFTH MOBILE SUIT
COMPANY.

376
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,672
A‐ANDREI?

377
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,341
WHEN'D YOU JOIN THE A‐LAWS?

378
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,470
I AM NOT OBLIGATED TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION, FATHER.

379
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,804
SORRY,

380
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,306
COLONEL SERGEI SMIRNOV.

381
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,225

WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT
SETSUNA DEAD?

388
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,620
KILLING SOMEONE WOULD MAKE ME
THE SAME AS YOU GUYS.

389
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,498
THAT'S THE
LAST THING I WANT.

390
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,209
Tieria:
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL
TO SETSUNA.

391
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,253
IF HE HADN'T BROUGHT YOU
ALONG WITH US,

392
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,629
YOU LIKELY WOULD'VE
BEEN LABELED A MEMBER

393
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,798
OF THE ANTI‐FEDERATION GROUP,
KATHARON...

394
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,967
AND THEN EXECUTED.

395
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,468
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

396
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,346
YOU'RE BLIND TO THE WAY
THINGS REALLY ARE.

397
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,307
OPEN YOUR EYES
AND LOOK AROUND!

398
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,225
AND SEE THE WORLD
THAT YOU'RE LIVING IN!

399
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,775
GUNDAM.

400
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,194
00 GUNDAM.

401
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,082
(Footsteps approaching)

402
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,250
HUH?

403
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,712
ARE YOU THE ONE
WHO CALLED ME HERE?

404
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,964
YOU'RE LYLE DYLANDY,
A MEMBER OF KATHARON.

405
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,008
YOU FROM SECURITY?!

406
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,468
I'VE COME
TO RECRUIT YOU.

407
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,469
HMM?

408
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,720
MY NAME IS...

409
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,264
SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

410
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,642
I'M A GUNDAM MEISTER
FROM CELESTIAL BEING.

411
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,269
YOU'RE FROM
CELESTIAL BEING.

412
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,856
AND YOU, TOO, ARE TO BECOME
A GUNDAM MEISTER.

413
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,691
LYLE DYLANDY.

414
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,193
OR...

415
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,195
LOCKON STRATOS.

416
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,034
Narrator:
THOSE WHO DESIRE DESTRUCTION
AND THOSE WHO REJECT IT.

417
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,827
NOW, WITH
THEIR DIFFERING THOUGHTS,

418
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,830
THEY GREET
THE AWAKENING OF 00.

419
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,249
NEXT EPISODE:
"TWIN DRIVE".

420
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,169
IS IT A GUNDAM
THAT ELIMINATES GUNDAMS?
