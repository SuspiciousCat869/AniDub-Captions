00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:06,131
Hercury:
THIS IS A MESSAGE
FOR ALL CITIZENS HERE.

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,884
I AM COLONEL PANG HERCURY,

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,802
OF THE EARTH SPHERE
FEDERATION FORCES,

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,763
INFORMATION OPERATIONS CENTER.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,102
MY COMRADES AND I HAVE TAKEN
CONTROL OF THIS STATION.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,105
WE ARE NOW IN CONTROL OF
THE GARRISON FORCES,

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,108
THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM,
THE LINEAR TRAINS

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,694
AND THE SOLAR
POWER GENERATION SYSTEM.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,156
WE HAVE BUT ONE OBJECTIVE.

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,993
WE WANT TO INFORM THE WORLD OF
THE BRUTALITY OF THE A‐LAWS,

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,746
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT'S
AUTONOMOUS PEACEKEEPING FORCE,

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,540
SO THE PUBLIC CAN DECIDE

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,541
WHETHER THEY ARE TRULY
IN THE RIGHT.

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
ARE YOU AWARE
THAT UNDER THE GUISE

15
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,671
OF ELIMINATING
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT FORCES,

16
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,715
THEY HAVE MASSACRED MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE IN COLD BLOOD?

17
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,054
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY INNOCENT
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,140
IN THEIR BID TO
REORGANIZE THE MIDDLE EAST?

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,018
IT'S ALL TRUE. YOU HAVE BEEN
HANDED A FALSE PEACE

20
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,896
BY THE FEDERATION'S
INFORMATION CONTROL.

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,898
AND WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT,

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,942
YOU HAVE ALL BEEN
LIVING IN A DICTATORSHIP.

23
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,405
WHILE WE ARE DISCLOSING THESE
FACTS TO THE WORLD,

24
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,825
I'M AFRAID THAT YOUR
LIVES WILL BE IN OUR HANDS.

25
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,953
GO AHEAD AND DESPISE ME
IF YOU WISH.

26
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,706
BUT LET ME MAKE
SOMETHING PERFECTLY CLEAR.

27
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,958
AS SOLDIERS WE'RE SWORN
TO PROTECT

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,377
THE INTERESTS
OF THE FEDERATION'S CITIZENS.

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,671
AND THAT IS WHY,
CORRECTING THE MISTAKES

30
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,257
OF A MISGUIDED GOVERNMENT
AND MILITARY

31
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,718
IS ALSO THE SWORN
DUTY OF A SOLDIER!

32
00:01:32,718 --> 00:03:03,141
♪

33
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,566
Spokesperson:
THE FEDERATION ASSEMBLY
HAS RECEIVED

34
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,194
A CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY
AND A LIST OF DEMANDS

35
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,738
FROM THE ANTI‐GOVERNMENT
FORCES THAT TOOK CONTROL OF

36
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,449
THE AFRICA TOWER'S
LOW ORBITAL STATION.

37
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,327
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE
OF THE CITIZENS IN THE STATION,

38
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,122
THEY DEMAND THE DISSOLUTION OF
THE FEDERATION ASSEMBLY,

39
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,957
THE RELEASE
OF FORTY‐FIVE THOUSAND

40
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,709
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT ACTIVISTS,
AND ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLL‐‐

41
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,632
BUT THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT
WILL NOT SUBMIT

42
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,552
TO THESE DEMANDS NOR
WILL IT YIELD TO TERRORISM.

43
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,303
THE GOVERNMENT
HAS ALREADY DISPATCHED

44
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,847
THE AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING FORCE

45
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,557
TO THE SCENE TO BRING
A SWIFT CONCLUSION.

46
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,016
(TV beeps off)

47
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,730
INFORMATION CONTROL...
THIS IS JUST MORE LIES.

48
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,739
AGAINST THEIR POWERFUL SYSTEM...

49
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,784
WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY
ACCOMPLISH, HERCURY?

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,372
Hercury:
THE SOLAR POWER GENERATION
SYSTEM WE'RE CREATING

51
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,208
WITH THE ORBITAL ELEVATORS
IS THE HOPE THAT IS GOING TO

52
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,419
LEAD HUMANITY INTO THE FUTURE.

53
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,962
SO MANY OF
THE WORLD'S CONFLICTS

54
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,715
ARE THE RESULT OF WIDESPREAD
ENERGY SHORTAGES.

55
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,842
IF WE CAN SOLVE
THE ENERGY CRISIS,

56
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,510
THEN WE CAN TURN OUR EFFORTS
TO DEALING WITH

57
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,804
THE FOOD AND
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.

58
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,182
THAT'S TRUE, BUT THE NATIONAL
BLOCS THAT CONTROL

59
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,893
THE ORBITAL ELEVATORS SEEM
TO BE EXPANDING THEIR MILITARIES

60
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,020
IN THE NAME OF DEFENSE.

61
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,063
EVENTUALLY IT'S GOING TO LEAD
TO INCREASED TENSION

62
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,191
BETWEEN THESE
STRENGTHENED NATIONAL BLOCS.

63
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,400
IN OTHER WORDS,

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,652
ISN'T THIS JUST GOING TO BRING
ABOUT ANOTHER COLD WAR?

65
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,696
LOOK, EVEN IF
IT DOES COME TO THAT

66
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,949
WITH A RESPONSIBLE CITIZENRY,
A COMPETENT GOVERNMENT

67
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,243
AND A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING
MILITARY LIKE OURS

68
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,329
TO ACT AS A DETERRENT
AGAINST CONFLICT...

69
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,372
THE PATH WILL OPEN!

70
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,957
WE CAN ALLEVIATE
THE TENSION,

71
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,167
AND WORK TOGETHER

72
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,419
TO REACH A DEEPER
UNDERSTANDING.

73
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,340
AND THEN GRADUALLY,
THE WORLD WILL BECOME UNITED.

74
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,345
(Beeping)

75
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,930
HUH?

76
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,433
COMMANDER KIM!

77
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,478
COLONEL, I HAVE A SECRET MISSION
I WANT TO ENTRUST TO YOU.

78
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,272
A SECRET MISSION?

79
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,859
Homer:
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

80
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,487
SIR, THE REGULAR FORCES
HAVE SURROUNDED

81
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,572
THE LOW ORBITAL STATION.

82
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,742
I'VE SENT OUT A DISPATCH
ORDERING THE ELITE A‐LAWS FORCES

83
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,453
ON THE SURFACE
TO HEAD TO THE SITE.

84
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,914
A COUP D'ÉTAT
AMONG THE REGULAR FORCES.

85
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,041
IF THIS INFORMATION GETS OUT TO
THE GENERAL PUBLIC,

86
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,585
IT COULD EASILY CAUSE
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY

87
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,128
TO SPREAD.

88
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,381
THE WORK CONNECTING EVERYTHING
TO THE ORBITAL RING

89
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,174
WILL BE COMPLETED SHORTLY, SIR.

90
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,677
I'M GOING INTO SPACE TO TAKE
PERSONAL COMMAND.

91
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,804
VERY GOOD. CARRY ON THEN.

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,853
Nena:
LETTING THE REBELS JUST
WALTZ IN THERE

93
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,022
AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.
SOMETIMES I WONDER

94
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,692
WHAT THOSE INNOVATORS
ARE THINKING, MY MISTRESS.

95
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,778
ONLY THEY KNOW WHAT
THEIR PLANS ARE.

96
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,697
DO YOU SUPPOSE
THIS GROUP'S COUP D'ÉTAT

97
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,657
WILL CHANGE THE WORLD?

98
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,033
WHO KNOWS?

99
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,786
IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF
THE END OF EVERYTHING.

100
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,747
AND IS THAT WHAT YOU TRULY
DESIRE, MY MISTRESS?

101
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,759
WE ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED,

102
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,721
BOTH UP HERE AND
ON THE GROUND, COLONEL.

103
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,473
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S JUST AS WE PLANNED.

104
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,601
ANY NEWS FROM KATHARON?

105
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,644
THEY SAY A FAIR NUMBER OF
THEIR MOBILE SUITS

106
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,396
ARE ALREADY ON
THEIR WAY HERE, SIR.

107
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,568
ALL THAT'S LEFT IS TO SEE WHAT
ACTION CELESTIAL BEING TAKES.

108
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,033
THE AFRICA TOWER OCCUPIED BY
A COUP D'ÉTAT FORCE.

109
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,410
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
KATHARON TOLD US ABOUT.

110
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,329
THIS MUST BE
WHY THE A‐LAWS

111
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,997
SUDDENLY WITHDREW FROM
THE BATTLE.

112
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,083
WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT, MISS SUMERAGI?

113
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,544
Lyle:
OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GOING
TO HELP THEM, RIGHT?

114
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,547
THE INNOVATORS HAVE COMPLETE
CONTROL OF VEDA.

115
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,008
SO THEN HOW DID
THEY FAIL TO NOTICE

116
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,302
THE PLANNING OF THIS INCIDENT?

117
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,304
ARE YOU SAYING THEY
PREDICTED THE COUP D'ÉTAT,

118
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,764
BUT STILL LET
IT GO AHEAD?

119
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,641
IT IS A POSSIBILITY.

120
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,559
BUT NOW THAT THE A‐LAWS
ARE BECOMING INVOLVED,

121
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,394
WE CAN'T JUST SIT
BACK HERE

122
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,979
AND WATCH
WHAT HAPPENS.

123
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,357
ALSO, THE REAL MASTERMINDS
BEHIND THE A‐LAWS

124
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,858
ARE THE INNOVATORS.

125
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,153
REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER THEY'RE
PLANNING TO DO

126
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,946
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO ACTUALLY GO THERE

127
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,698
AND FIND OUT FOR OURSELVES.

128
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,700
FURTHERMORE,
ONCE SETSUNA FINDS OUT

129
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,410
A COUP D'ÉTAT'S
TAKEN PLACE...

130
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,745
HE'D HEAD THERE!

131
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,746
YEAH!

132
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,789
HE SURE WOULD!

133
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,168
IAN, CAN YOU GET THE WEAPONS
CONTROL SYSTEM

134
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,754
WORKING BEFORE WE
REACH THE AFRICA TOWER?

135
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,381
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE, DO I?

136
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,098
Operator:
A‐LAWS MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
HAVE LAUNCHED.

137
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,269
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH
THAT EXTRA EQUIPMENT?

138
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,980
DON'T LOOK AT ME,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE.

139
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THE A‐LAWS AND THEIR SECRETS.

140
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,652
WE'RE TO REMAIN ON STANDBY AT
OUR CURRENT POSITION.

141
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,492
COLONEL, WE'RE DETECTING
A‐LAWS MOBILE SUIT TEAMS.

142
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,703
DON'T INTERCEPT THEM.
THE WORLD IS WATCHING.

143
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,955
MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
ARE RELEASING CONTAINERS.

144
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,624
(Scoff)
THE INFAMOUS AUTOMATONS.

145
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,462
(Clunk)

146
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,549
(Whizz)

147
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,927
(Boom)

148
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,929
SIR, THEY'RE THROUGH
THE BULKHEAD WALLS!

149
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,140
SWITCH THE DEFENSES
TO MODE "S" TO REPEL THEM,

150
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,433
JUST LIKE WE PLANNED.

151
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,770
(Blasts)

152
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,403
(Beep)

153
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,493
43 PERCENT OF THE AUTOMATONS
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, SIR.

154
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,078
JUST A SCOUTING PARTY,
PERHAPS?

155
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,621
I'M NOT SO SURE.

156
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,541
COLONEL, DETECTING KATHARON
FORCES APPROACHING THE PILLAR.

157
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,251
Hercury:
IS THE FEDERATION
INTERCEPTING THEM?

158
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,627
NEGATIVE, SIR.

159
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,213
KATHARON UNITS HAVE ENTERED
THE PILLAR'S LAUNCH BAY.

160
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,133
THAT MEANS THEY'VE JOINED UP
WITH OUR GROUND FORCES, SIR.

161
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,386
THE A‐LAWS MUST HAVE BEEN
DEPLOYED ON THE SURFACE AS WELL.

162
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,431
YET, THEY'VE CHOSEN
NOT TO ATTACK.

163
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,557
Soldier:
COLONEL!

164
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,142
WHAT IS IT NOW?

165
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,936
A MACHINE HAS ENTERED
THE PILLAR AT SECTOR DH42, SIR.

166
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,313
AND IT'S ASCENDING.

167
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,355
IS IT A‐LAWS?

168
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,191
IT'S ON THE SCREEN, SIR.

169
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,359
(Gasp)
WHY THAT'S...

170
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,987
THAT'S A TIEREN TAOZI.

171
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,072
SEND SOME MOBILE SUITS
TO ESCORT IT.

172
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,741
COLONEL?

173
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,659
I GUESS IT'S THE LEAST
WE CAN DO.

174
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,706
Hercury:
A GOOD FRIEND IS IN
THAT MACHINE.

175
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,836
AS YOU INSTRUCTED, I'VE SENT
COLONEL SMIRNOV

176
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,589
FROM OUR FORCES
AS A SECRET MESSENGER.

177
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,508
Homer:
YOUR COOPERATION
IS APPRECIATED.

178
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,260
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
ASSIGN ME THE RANK OF GENERAL

179
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,805
WHEN I TRANSFER OVER TO
THE A‐LAWS, SIR.

180
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,640
IT'S A PROMISE.
GOODBYE.

181
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,559
(Sigh)

182
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,814
EVENTUALLY,
EVEN THE REGULAR ARMY

183
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,233
WILL BE ABSORBED BY
THE A‐LAWS.

184
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,401
IS THIS ANOTHER
SIGN OF THE TIMES?

185
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,826
Kati:
REMAIN AT SEA ON STANDBY?

186
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,453
BUT WHY?

187
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,747
WHY WON'T THEY MOBILIZE
THE FORCES I HAVE HERE?!

188
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,255
LOOKS LIKE WE WON'T
BE NEEDED OUT THERE.

189
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,507
THIS IS A BIG OPERATION.

190
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:36,094
WHY DOES RIBBONS
KEEP DOING THESE THINGS?

191
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,595
YOU LOOK IRRITATED.

192
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,973
STILL WAITING TO AVENGE BRING?

193
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,391
WHAT WAS THAT?

194
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,309
(Laughing)
WE CAN TELL, YOU KNOW!

195
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,186
WE'RE ALL THE SAME,
AFTER ALL!

196
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,691
Louise:
YOU KNOW THE LEADER
OF THE REBELS?

197
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,111
HE'S ONE OF MY FATHER'S
CLOSEST FRIENDS.

198
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,364
WHEN I WAS A CHILD, HE WOULD
TELL ME ABOUT THE MILITARY.

199
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,951
ABOUT THE IDEALS
A REAL ARMY SHOULD HAVE.

200
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,787
AND NOW HE'S BECOME A REBEL,
SITTING UP IN A STATION

201
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,956
WITH SIXTY THOUSAND
HOSTAGES AROUND HIM.

202
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,295
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE
REASONS FOR THE REBELLION ARE.

203
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,462
AS MEMBERS OF THE A‐LAWS,

204
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,047
OUR MISSION IS TO
STRIKE DOWN

205
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,674
ALL ANTI‐GOVERNMENT
FORCES

206
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,218
TO RESTORE
PEACE AND ORDER AGAIN.

207
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,804
YES, OF COURSE IT IS,
WARRANT OFFICER.

208
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,855
HUH?

209
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,443
SO IT'S TRUE THEN,

210
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,070
I SEE YOU'VE ALREADY ENROLLED
IN THE MILITARY ACADEMY.

211
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,657
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
PUTTING IN A GOOD WORD

212
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,659
FOR ME WITH
THE HIGHER‐UPS, SIR.

213
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,871
I DIDN'T WANT TO RELY ON
MY FATHER'S ASSISTANCE.

214
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,581
SO, ARE YOU JOINING
THE MILITARY AS A WAY

215
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,291
TO GET BACK AT YOUR FATHER?

216
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,709
HMM.

217
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,544
DON'T RESENT YOUR
FATHER TOO MUCH.

218
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,088
THAT WAS TRULY
AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT.

219
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,715
DON'T DISMISS WHAT HAPPENED

220
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,300
BY CALLING IT
SOMETHING ELSE, SIR!

221
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,261
MY FATHER ALLOWED MY MOTHER
TO DIE.

222
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,347
AND YOU'RE
THE SAME AS HIM!

223
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,598
(Sigh)

224
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,684
I'M NOT GOING TO LIVE MY LIFE
LIKE MY FATHER DID!

225
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,394
I'VE CHOSEN THE PATH
OF A SOLDIER

226
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,563
TO PROVE THAT
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY!

227
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,483
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT
THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE

228
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,152
WOULD HAVE MADE HOLLY HAPPY?

229
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,528
YES, I DO.

230
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,238
BECAUSE MY MOTHER
DESIRED PEACE

231
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,698
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE.

232
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,453
Andrei:
COLONEL...

233
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,790
HALFHEARTED DETERMINATION WILL
NOT BRING ABOUT PEACE.

234
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,542
WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT THE POWER OF THE A‐LAWS

235
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,294
IS NECESSARY IN
TODAY'S WORLD?

236
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,769
SO YOU CAME AFTER ALL, SERGEI.

237
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,355
HERCURY.

238
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,569
(Computers beeping)

239
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,615
HERCURY, I'M HERE TO
GIVE YOU A SECRET MESSAGE

240
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,034
FROM THE EARTH SPHERE
FEDERATION FORCES.

241
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,370
THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT
WILL NEVER SUBMIT

242
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,247
TO THE DEMANDS
YOU'VE MADE.

243
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,958
WE ADVISE YOU TO
SURRENDER IMMEDIATELY.

244
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,294
(Chuckle)
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU
CAME ALL THE WAY UP HERE

245
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,005
JUST TO TELL ME
SUCH A TRIFLE?

246
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,840
THE FEDERATION
GOVERNMENT'S INFORMATION

247
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,925
CONTROL SYSTEM IS
ABSOLUTE.

248
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,636
THERE'S NO WAY YOUR MESSAGE IS
GOING TO REACH THE WORLD.

249
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,472
WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN
INNOCENT CITIZENS HOSTAGE?

250
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,057
THEY ARE NOT
INNOCENT AT ALL.

251
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,561
Hercury:
CONTENT WITH THEIR WEALTH,

252
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,605
THEY ACCEPT THE ASSEMBLY'S
POLICIES WITHOUT QUESTION.

253
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,399
THEY ARE ONE
OF THE MAIN REASONS

254
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,942
FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S CORRUPTION.

255
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,820
IT'S THE FOLLY OF THESE
CITIZENS THAT ALLOWED

256
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,865
THE RISE OF AN ORGANIZATION
LIKE THE A‐LAWS.

257
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,951
WE MUST OPEN THEIR EYES AND
SHOW THEM THE TRUTH.

258
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,412
EVEN IF THE LESSON
IS ACCOMPANIED BY PAIN.

259
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,330
ISN'T THE MILITARY SUPPOSED TO
PROTECT THE INTERESTS

260
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
AND SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE?

261
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,960
THAT IS PRECISELY WHY
WE'RE DOING THIS!

262
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,087
JUST SURRENDER!
IF YOU DO IT NOW,

263
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,798
THERE'S A CHANCE YOU CAN STILL
SAVE THE LIVES OF YOUR MEN!

264
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,675
THE A‐LAWS WON'T BE
THAT FORGIVING.

265
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,886
(Grunt)
HERCURY...

266
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,262
Hercury:
THIS MEETING IS OVER.

267
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,263
HUH?

268
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,681
RETURN TO THE SURFACE

269
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,433
AND CONVEY MY RESPONSE
TO HEADQUARTERS.

270
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,185
WE ARE NOT LEAVING HERE,

271
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,562
AND WE WILL FIGHT TO
THE LAST MAN TO HOLD ONTO IT.

272
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,314
TAKE HIM AWAY.

273
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,690
SIR!
SIR!

274
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,941
HUH? ARGH.

275
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,069
NO, I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE!

276
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,737
WHAT WAS THAT?

277
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,447
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
I CAME HERE

278
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,325
ONLY BECAUSE
I WAS ORDERED TO?

279
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,203
I DON'T WANT TO
LOSE ANOTHER‐‐

280
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,662
COLONEL!
HMM?

281
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,831
NEW AUTOMATONS HAVE
BROKEN THROUGH!

282
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,166
THEY'RE HEADING FOR
THE GRAVITY BLOCK, SIR!

283
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,751
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

284
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,044
(Grunting)

285
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,670
Hercury:
CLOSE THE BULKHEAD WALLS
LIKE WE PLANNED!

286
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,298
HAVE FIRST INFANTRY UNIT
SECURE THE ROUTE

287
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,342
AND GUIDE THE CITIZENS
ONTO THE TRAINS!

288
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,220
SECOND INFANTRY UNIT
WILL INTERCEPT THE AUTOMATONS!

289
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,930
Soldier:
YES, SIR!

290
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,598
HERCURY...

291
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,849
ARE YOU...

292
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,976
Woman:
THIS IS SO CRAZY.

293
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,728
(Curious chatter)

294
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,814
(Guns blasting)

295
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,190
(People screaming)

296
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,693
(Clank)

297
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,779
Soldier:
THE AUTOMATONS ARE ATTACKING
THE CITIZENS TOO, SIR!

298
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,114
(Yell)
(Shocked scream)

299
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,285
(Blasts)

300
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,996
SIR, WE HAVE
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES!

301
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,206
CIVILIANS?

302
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,626
THEY'VE PROGRAMMED
THE AUTOMATONS FOR KILL MODE?

303
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,961
DO YOU SEE, SERGEI?

304
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,838
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH
A MISGUIDED GOVERNMENT

305
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,005
AND MILITARY!

306
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,632
HMM.

307
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,345
Soldier #1:
ESCAPE ROUTE SECURED!

308
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,389
Soldier #2:
WE'RE PUTTING THE CITIZENS
ON BOARD THE TRAINS.

309
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,141
(Panicked yelling)

310
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,602
Shirin:
OUR MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
HAVE LINKED UP

311
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,813
WITH THE COUP D'ÉTAT FORCES.

312
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,857
IF WE CAN USE THIS
TO INFORM THE WORLD

313
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,733
ABOUT THE FEDERATION'S
MISGOVERNMENT

314
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,570
AND THE A‐LAWS' ATROCITIES,
THEN JUST MAYBE...

315
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,822
BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE THE ONES REBELLING

316
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,907
AGAINST THE STATUS
QUO HERE.

317
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,285
I WONDER IF THE WORLD
WILL ACCEPT OUR VERSION

318
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,744
AS THE REAL ONE.

319
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,079
(Door opens)
HUH?

320
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,082
THE FEDERATION'S MAKING
AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT!

321
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,709
Klaus:
ARE THEY FINALLY
GOING TO NEGOTIATE?

322
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,298
Soldier:
FIRST LINEAR TRAIN HAS
DEPARTED, SIR.

323
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,884
THE SECOND ONE WILL LEAVE
IN FIVE MINUTES.

324
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,262
YOU WERE PLANNING TO RELEASE THE
CITIZENS FROM THE VERY START.

325
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,097
THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS?

326
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,557
LIKE I TOLD YOU...

327
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,392
I'M GOING TO
OPEN THE CITIZEN'S EYES

328
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,352
BY HAVING THEM WITNESS
THE ATROCITIES

329
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,771
OF THE FEDERATION
GOVERNMENT'S A‐LAWS.

330
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,149
EVEN IF IT'S ACCOMPANIED
BY PAIN.

331
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,442
(Shots blasting)

332
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,693
(Men grunting in pain)

333
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,320
THAT PAIN
WILL LEAD TO DOUBTS

334
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,946
ABOUT THE FEDERATION
GOVERNMENT...

335
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,490
AND THEN THE DOUBTS WILL
BEGIN TO GROW.

336
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,910
THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE MILITARY MUST HAVE

337
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,288
RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS
IN ORDER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.

338
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,582
I WILL HAPPILY
SACRIFICE MYSELF

339
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,084
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
TO OPEN THEIR EYES.

340
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,669
HERCURY...

341
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,379
COLONEL!

342
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,089
THE FEDERATION'S
ANNOUNCEMENT!

343
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,466
YES,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

344
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,719
THESE IMAGES WERE RECORDED BY
UNMANNED RECONNAISSANCE

345
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,263
DRONES DEPLOYED BY THE
AUTONOMOUS PEACEKEEPING FORCE

346
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,765
INSIDE THE AFRICA TOWER.

347
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,141
HMM?

348
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,979

(Shocked scream)

349
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,356
(Shots blast)

350
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,691
BUT‐BUT THESE ARE...

351
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,276
Spokesperson:
THE ANTI‐GOVERNMENT FORCES

352
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,987
HAVE BEGUN KILLING
THE CITIZENS IN THE STATION.

353
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,865
THE ASSEMBLY IS CURRENTLY
CONSIDERING A FORCED ENTRY

354
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,243
BY THE AUTONOMOUS
PEACEKEEPING‐‐

355
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,954
OH MAN, WHAT THE HELL'S UP
WITH THOSE IMAGES?!

356
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,790
FALSE INFORMATION TO
AROUSE THE PEOPLE'S ANGER.

357
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,542
THE FEDERATION
IS A MASTER AT THIS.

358
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,795
THERE WILL NEVER BE A PERMANENT
PEACE AS LONG

359
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,797
AS THEY RESORT TO
SUCH DECEITFUL METHODS!

360
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,007
THAT IS WHY WE MUST
DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER

361
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,926
TO BRING ABOUT THE END OF
THE FEDERATION!

362
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,471
Hercury:
NO MATTER WHAT
DECEPTIONS THEY USE,

363
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,598
THE TRUTH WILL BE
OUT SOON ENOUGH.

364
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,392
THAT IS WHY I ORDERED
THE CITIZENS

365
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,810
TO BE SENT TO THE SURFACE.

366
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,271
I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS WHOLE
SCHEME OF YOURS

367
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,731
IS OUTSIDE THE
FEDERATION'S EXPECTATIONS.

368
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,400
EVEN SO, THEY'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO SILENCE

369
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,361
SIXTY THOUSAND EYEWITNESSES.

370
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,489
ALSO, FRIENDLY FORCES AND
KATHARON ARE ON THE GROUND.

371
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,909
THEY'RE SPREADING
THIS FALSE INFORMATION

372
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,953
TO GAIN THE PUBLIC'S SUPPORT.

373
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,747
GIVING THEM AN EXCUSE TO
BEGIN THEIR ATTACK.

374
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,919

YOU KNOW,
THE A‐LAWS MUST HAVE A PLAN.

HUH?

THIS MOBILE SUIT
IS LIKE...

379
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,395
BUT IT'S NOT A FLAG!

I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON
MEETING YOU HERE...

383
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,073
ONCE YOU HEARD
ABOUT THE AFRICA TOWER!

384
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,241
BACK OFF!

385
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,160
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO
MESS AROUND WITH YOU RIGHT NOW!

HOW CAN YOU BE SO
CRUEL TO ME?

388
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,500
WELL, HERE'S SOMETHING
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO IGNORE.

389
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,461
OBSERVE CAREFULLY NOW.

390
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,630
THIS IS THE SECRET OF
THE MASURAO MY FRIEND CREATED!

391
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,011
BUT‐BUT THAT'S...

I LIVE FOR
THE SAKE OF COMBAT!

A LIFE FOR FIGHTING!
AGAINST GUNDAMS!

I'M THE SAME!

THAT'S THE ONLY REASON...
