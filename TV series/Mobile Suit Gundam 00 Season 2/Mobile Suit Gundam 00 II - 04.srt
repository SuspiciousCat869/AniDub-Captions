1
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:07,549
Surgeon:
THIS CONCLUDES SUBJECT E‐57'S
QUANTUM BRAIN WAVE SURGERY.

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,136
NOW BEGINNING
POST‐OPERATIVE OBSERVATION.

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:14,723
Young Peries:
ANYONE?

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,308
IS THERE ANYBODY?

5
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,315
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,741
I CAN HEAR SOMEONE.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,118
THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD.

8
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,830
(Eagerly)
I'M OVER HERE.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,707
I'M JUST OVER HERE.

10
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,715
IN HERE.

11
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:01,270
(Desperately)
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,605
ARE YOU THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN TALKING TO ME?

13
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,815
(Relieved sigh)

14
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,692
YOU CAN HEAR ME.

15
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,986
WHERE... WHERE ARE YOU?

16
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,112
HUH?

17
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,323
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE
BESIDE YOU.

18
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,201
I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T TELL.

19
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,744
HUH?

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,539
BUT I AM REALLY HAPPY THAT
I CAN TALK WITH YOU!

21
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,542
BECAUSE UP TO NOW
I'VE BEEN ALL ALONE.

22
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,961
THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME.

23
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,337
WHO ARE YOU?

24
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,297
MARIE.

25
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,424
MARIE.

26
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,135
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

27
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,636
I'M NOT TOO SURE.

28
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,888
I CAN'T SEEM TO REMEMBER IT.

29
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,765
Young Allelujah:
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM OR

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,851
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

31
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,938
I DON'T EVEN KNOW MY OWN NAME.

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,733
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN I'LL GIVE YOU A NAME.

33
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,734
(Gasps)

34
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:49,901
LET'S SEE.

35
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,528
A GOOD NAME FOR YOU
WOULD BE

36
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,071
(Gasps)
ALLELUJAH!

37
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,157
ALLELUJAH?

38
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,617
IT'S THE WORD YOU USE
WHEN YOU GIVE THANKS TO GOD.

39
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,494
HUH?
GIVE THANKS?

40
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,663
WHAT WOULD WE GIVE THANKS FOR?

41
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,000
WHY, THAT'S OBVIOUS!
FOR BEING ALIVE!

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,002
(Startled gasp)

43
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,633
Allelujah: (Thinking)
THAT WAS THE MOMENT
WHEN SHE BAPTIZED ME.

44
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,137
IN THE TRUEST SENSE
OF THE WORD.

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,318
FOR COMING TO MY RESCUE,
AND FOR BRINGING AN END

52
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,072
TO THE TERRIBLE CIVIL WAR
IN AZADISTAN FIVE YEARS AGO,

53
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,367
YOU ALL HAVE
MY UNDYING GRATITUDE.

54
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,495
YOU STOPPED THE CONFLICT WITHOUT
RESORTING TO VIOLENCE.

55
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,080
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,541
I THINK THE COURSE OF ACTION
YOU DID CHOOSE WAS MAGNIFICENT.

57
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,750
THAT'S ALL
WELL AND GOOD,

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,961
BUT WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS NOW?

59
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,130
I SHALL RETURN TO
AZADISTAN.

60
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,298
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

61
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,924
THE SECURITY FORCES
WILL COME.

62
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,926
IT'S POSSIBLE
THE FEDERATION COULD INTERVENE,

63
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,430
USING YOU AS AN EXCUSE.

64
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,974
SINCE AZADISTAN HASN'T JOINED
THE FEDERATION,

65
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:30,353
THE REST OF THE WORLD
HAS ABANDONED US.

66
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,189
OUR ECONOMY HAS FAILED.

67
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,940
AND NOW THAT RASA,

68
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,901
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER,
HAS PASSED AWAY,

69
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,527
THEIR DISPUTE WITH
THE REFORMISTS

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,281
HAS REACHED A STALEMATE.

71
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,868
BUT THAT IS WHY I'M NEEDED.

72
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,286
I UNDERSTAND.

73
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,497
WE'LL HAVE PTOLEMY
SET A COURSE FOR AZADISTAN.

74
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,998
SETSUNA.

75
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,459
ROGER THAT, SETSUNA.

76
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,836
I'LL HEAD TO THE BRIDGE.

77
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,546
EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING,
BUT,

78
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,465
BY ANY CHANCE,
ARE YOU TWO LIKE, LOVERS?

79
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,424
WE'RE NOT.
THAT IS NOT SO.

80
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,092
OH! HMM.

81
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,303
THEN, MY FEMALE INTUITION
WAS WRONG.

82
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,765
WHAT ABOUT MISS SUMERAGI?

83
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,058
Ian:
WELL, I GUESS

84
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,144
SHE'S STILL NOT READY TO
PUT ON THAT UNIFORM.

85
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,108
(Grunts)

86
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,785
(Exhales)

87
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,911
HARO,

88
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,828
WHAT'S MY HIT RATE?

89
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,207
78%. 78%.

90
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,083
HMM.

91
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,504
I CAN'T SEEM TO REACH
MY BROTHER'S LEVEL.

92
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,505
HMM.

93
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,674
(Gasps)

94
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,467
HI. IS SOMETHING
THE MATTER?

95
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,594
NOTHING'S WRONG.

96
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,972
I THINK YOUR NAME IS FELDT,
RIGHT?

97
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,057
I KEEP FEELING LIKE
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME.

98
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:49,683
WHY IS THAT?

99
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,684
(Embarrassed gasp)

100
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,310
I'M JUST,
YOU KNOW‐‐

101
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,604
FELDT LIKED LOCKON!
FELDT LIKED LOCKON!

102
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,481
HARO!

103
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,024
YOU KNOW I'M NOT MY BROTHER.

104
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,235
HMM?

105
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,778
I DIDN'T MEAN TO‐‐

106
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,989
YES, I KNOW.

107
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,699
(Gasps)

108
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,033
BUT IF YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
WITH THAT,

109
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,702
WE COULD SPEND
SOME TIME TOGETHER.

110
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,120
(Startled gasp)

111
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,167
IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT,
SWING BY MY ROOM‐‐

112
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,674
YOU STRUCK OUT!
YOU STRUCK OUT!

113
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,051
I JUST OPENED HER EYES.

114
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,721
I COULDN'T STAND
BEING COMPARED TO HIM.

115
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,850
HUH?

116
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,729
SO, DO YOU FEEL UP TO HAVING
A LITTLE DRINK WITH ME?

117
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,730
HMM.

118
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,524
SO YOU LOST THE GUNDAM PILOT
WE WERE HOLDING CAPTIVE

119
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:44,859
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

120
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,945
YOU WERE OUTMANEUVERED BY
KATHARON.

121
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:49,072
IT'S A DISGRACE, COLONEL.

122
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:52,867
I UNDERESTIMATED THE COMBAT
CAPABILITIES OF CELESTIAL BEING.

123
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,285
SAVE YOUR EXCUSES.

124
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,872
THE A‐LAWS HAVE NO USE
FOR INCOMPETENTS.

125
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:59,457
WELL, MAJOR RINDT.

126
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:01,626
YOU WILL BE IN CHARGE OF
THE NEXT OPERATION.

127
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:04,420
THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR, SIR.

128
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,089
I'D BE MORE THAN
HAPPY TO TEACH YOU

129
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,924
HOW WE DO THINGS HERE
IN THE A‐LAWS,

130
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:09,634
COLONEL.

131
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,761
AND I'LL DO MY BEST TO LEARN.

132
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:14,722
Goodman:
THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU MAY GO.

133
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:17,350
YES, SIR.

134
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,310
MAJOR ABER RINDT.

135
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,063
A SPECIALIST
IN MOPPING‐UP OPERATIONS.

136
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:25,858
FOR THEM TO BRING
SUCH A NOTORIOUS MAN HERE.

137
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,443
I UNDERSTAND THAT
ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY

138
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:29,445
FROM SECURITY AGENCY MEMBERS,

139
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:31,656
THE GUNDAMS TOOK
THE AZADISTAN PRINCESS

140
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,157
WE WERE DETAINING.

141
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:35,159
SO WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT?

142
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,453
WELL, SIR, I HEAR THAT
ONE OF THE GUNDAM PILOTS

143
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:39,747
IS FROM
A MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY.

144
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:42,375
HE CAME TO
THE PRINCESS'S RESCUE.

145
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,294
HE THINKS HE'S SOME KIND
OF KNIGHT RIDING A WHITE HORSE.

146
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:46,462
THESE DAYS,
IT SEEMS THAT

147
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:48,214
CELESTIAL BEING IS
DRIVEN MAINLY

148
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,383
BY ITS MEMBERS'
PERSONAL FEELINGS.

149
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,051
THE FACT THEY SAVED
THEIR FELLOW PILOT

150
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,387
IS JUST PROOF OF THIS.

151
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:55,638
IF SO,

152
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,098
I'D SAY OUR BEST BET
WOULD BE

153
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:59,934
TO SPREAD OUR NET
RIGHT HERE.

154
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:01,310
VERY WELL, THEN.

155
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,813
I HEREBY AUTHORIZE
USE OF THE TRILOBITE.

156
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:05,189
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

157
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:06,566
ONE OTHER THING.

158
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,484
I FEEL IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL

159
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:11,779
IF HE WERE TO
JOIN THE OPERATION.

160
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:13,448
Goodman:
MR. BUSHIDO.

161
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:19,495
A BLITZKRIEG OPERATION

162
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:22,290
THAT LASTED
LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES.

163
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,127
THEY PLUNGE THEIR SHIP INTO
THE SEA TO CREATE A TIDAL WAVE.

164
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:28,504
THAT THROWS OUR FORCES
INTO CONFUSION,

165
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:30,715
AS WELL AS RAISING
THE HUMIDITY TO THE LEVEL

166
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:33,801
WHERE THE POWER OF
OUR BEAM WEAPONS IS HALVED.

167
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,680
THEN, THE FOUR GUNDAMS WORK
TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

168
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,059
A STRATEGY THAT COMBINES
BOLDNESS AND FINESSE.

169
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,644
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

170
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:46,022
Announcer:
TRILOBITE, PREPARE FOR LAUNCH.
TRILOBITE, PREPARE FOR LAUNCH.

171
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:47,023
HUH?

172
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:48,775
LAUNCHING THE TRILOBITE?

173
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:51,444
THAT'S THE NEW MODEL
I READ ABOUT.

174
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:57,283
THEY'VE EVEN DEVELOPED
MOBILE ARMORS

175
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:58,993
THAT HAVE BEEN
EQUIPPED WITH GN DRIVES.

176
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:01,037
RUMOR HAS IT SOME WOMAN
HAS BEEN PROVIDING US

177
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:03,581
WITH GENEROUS DONATIONS.

178
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:05,333
SOME PEOPLE HAVE
STRANGE HOBBIES.

179
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:11,631
TEAM FOUR HAS BEEN ORDERED

180
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,174
TO MAKE ITS WAY
TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE.

181
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:14,509
WARRANT OFFICER HALEVY,

182
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:16,594
PLEASE REPORT TO
THE BRIDGE IMMEDIATELY.

183
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:17,637
ROGER THAT.

184
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,350
Announcer:
MOBILE SUIT TEAMS,
PREPARE FOR LAUNCH!

185
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,644
WE'VE RECEIVED INFORMATION
FROM JEAN ONE.

186
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:27,021
APPARENTLY,
THEY'RE GOING TO AZADISTAN.

187
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:29,399
KLAUS, ARE WE REALLY
GOING THROUGH WITH THIS?

188
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,442
CELESTIAL BEING IS
A NECESSARY ELEMENT

189
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,402
FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF
OUR GOALS.

190
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:35,446
BESIDES, IF WE HELP THEM
GET WHAT THEY WANT,

191
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:38,658
WE CAN THEN BRING
PRINCESS MARINA WITH US.

192
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:39,742
BUT,
KLAUS, I‐‐

193
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:42,078
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO SAVE HER.

194
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,372
SHE'S AN IMPORTANT FRIEND
OF YOURS.

195
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:45,456
HMM.

196
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,127
MARINA.

197
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,879
YOU'RE LEAVING
THE ROYAL PALACE?

198
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,964
YES, PRINCESS.

199
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:54,215
WITH THE CURRENT

200
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:55,842
FEDERATION GOVERNMENT
POLICIES,

201
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,885
EVEN IF OUR COUNTRY COULD
JOIN THE FEDERATION,

202
00:09:57,885 --> 00:09:59,929
THERE WOULD STILL BE
NO FUTURE FOR US.

203
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,305
AND FOR THAT REASON,

204
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:02,682
I'VE DECIDED TO TRY AND
CREATE A FUTURE

205
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,684
FOR THIS COUNTRY
IN MY OWN WAY.

206
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,269
CAN'T YOU DO THINGS
YOUR OWN WAY

207
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,312
WHILE STAYING RIGHT HERE
IN AZADISTAN?

208
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:10,064
REBUILDING JUST
THIS ONE COUNTRY

209
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:11,607
WON'T DO ANY GOOD.

210
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:15,987
(Determined grunt)

211
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,655
KLAUS,
LET ME ACCOMPANY

212
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,157
THE TEAM
ON THIS MISSION.

213
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:20,408
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

214
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:21,617
I WON'T GET IN YOUR WAY,

215
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,953
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU,
KLAUS!

216
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,292
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
I CAN DO

217
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:32,211
TO MAKE THINGS
BETTER AT HOME.

218
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,671
THERE YOU ARE.

219
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:34,964
SETSUNA.

220
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:36,632
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

221
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:37,425
(Gasps)

222
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:40,636
HMM.

223
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:43,306
SETSUNA, I WANT YOU TO
COME BACK WITH ME.

224
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,641
TO AZADISTAN.

225
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:46,642
(Grunts)

226
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:48,019
I WANT TO REBUILD
MY COUNTRY.

227
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,687
TO MAKE IT A PLACE

228
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:52,231
WHERE PEOPLE CAN HAVE
NORMAL LIVES FREE OF CONFLICT!

229
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,066
AND I WANT YOU TO HELP ME!

230
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,776
I CAN'T DO THAT.

231
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:56,861
WHY NOT?!

232
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,529
I'M GOOD AT ONE THING.

233
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,072
ALL I KNOW IS FIGHTING.

234
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:02,283
THAT'S SO SAD,
DON'T SAY THAT!

235
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:04,035
SETSUNA,
THERE IS NOTHING GOOD

236
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:05,578
THAT CAN COME FROM FIGHTING!

237
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,622
ALL IT DOES IS DESTROY!

238
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,709
(Sighs)

239
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,294
I USED TO THINK THE SAME WAY

240
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:15,463
BEFORE I JOINED
CELESTIAL BEING.

241
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:16,881
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS

242
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:18,591
THAT CAN BE BORN
FROM DESTRUCTION.

243
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:19,800
GUNDAM CAN CUT OUT

244
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,594
THE TWISTEDNESS
OF THE WORLD,

245
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,763
FOR THE SAKE OF THE FUTURE.

246
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,389
AND THAT'S WHY,

247
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,183
GUNDAM AND I
WILL KEEP FIGHTING!

248
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:28,643
(Gasps)

249
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:39,779
Feldt:
HOLDING STEADY AT
DEPTH OF 3200.

250
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,530
Saji:
UM,

251
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,949
IS THIS ALL RIGHT?

252
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,284
YOU KNOW, SHOWING ME
ALL THIS SECRET STUFF OF YOURS?

253
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:46,869
Ian:
WE'RE SHORT‐HANDED.

254
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:49,789
AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR CLASS TWO
SPACE ENGINEER'S LICENSE, RIGHT?

255
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:50,790
WELL, YEAH.

256
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,375
THE SAYING GOES,

257
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,876
IF A MAN'S NOT WILLING TO WORK,

258
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:55,336
THEN HE'S NOT GOING
TO BE EATING.

259
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:56,963
YEAH, OKAY, I GET IT.

260
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,130
UH, MISTER?

261
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,841
CALL ME IAN.

262
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:03,427
IT'S IAN VASHTI.

263
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:04,637
MISTER IAN,

264
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:07,390
SO, WHAT'S A GUY LIKE YOU
DOING HERE ANYWAY?

265
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,642
I'VE SEEN MY FAIR SHARE
OF BATTLEFIELDS.

266
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:10,893
AND I'M SICK OF THEM,

267
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:12,895
SO I WANTED TO GET RID
OF WAR.

268
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:15,064
EVERYONE HERE FEELS THE SAME.

269
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:17,984
SOME SERVED ON
THE FRONTLINES OF A BATTLEFIELD.

270
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:20,361
SOME HAD THEIR BODIES
REBUILT BY THE MILITARY.

271
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:23,030
SOME LOST THEIR FAMILIES
TO TERRORISM.

272
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,658
SOME WERE MADE
INTO GUERRILLA FIGHTERS.

273
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:29,996
WE'VE ALL LOST SOMETHING
PRECIOUS BECAUSE OF WAR.

274
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:33,416
THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE WORLD
WE LIVE IN NOW.

275
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,542
BUT YOU'RE...

276
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,002
(Grunts)

277
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,253
I KNOW.

278
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,171
THAT STILL MAKES US CRIMINALS.

279
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:40,631
WE'LL TAKE OUR PUNISHMENT,

280
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:43,384
BUT ONLY AFTER
WE'VE STAMPED OUT WAR.

281
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:47,471
SOMA PERIES.

282
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:48,681
I SEEM TO RECALL,

283
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:52,059
SHE WAS AN HRL
SUPER SOLDIER, RIGHT?

284
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,395
WHY DIDN'T I MAKE
THE CONNECTION SOONER?

285
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:56,022
MARIE IS REALLY
THE ONLY PERSON

286
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,648
WHO COULD POSSIBLY DISRUPT

287
00:12:57,648 --> 00:13:01,819
MY QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES
LIKE THAT.

288
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:04,113
WHEN I WAS CAPTURED
BY THE UN FORCES,

289
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:05,865
I FELT THE TIME
HAD FINALLY COME

290
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:08,701
WHEN I WAS GOING TO
PAY FOR MY SINS.

291
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:11,912
I EVEN THOUGHT IT'D BE OKAY TO
JUST ROT AWAY IN THERE.

292
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:14,123
BUT EVERYTHING IS
DIFFERENT NOW.

293
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:17,126
I WANT TO GO
AND GET MARIE BACK.

294
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:19,045
BUT SHE'S YOUR ENEMY.

295
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:20,171
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

296
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,464
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

297
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:24,675
YOU DESTROYED THE SUPER‐HUMAN
INSTITUTE LABS.

298
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,677
I KNOW.

299
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:29,805
I KILLED
OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

300
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:33,851
IF MARIE FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT,
SHE'D BE SURE TO HATE ME.

301
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:36,479
AND I'VE DONE ENOUGH THINGS
TO DESERVE IT, TOO.

302
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:39,482
BUT EVEN IF
SHE DOES DESPISE ME...

303
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:40,649
(Sighing)
I ENVY YOU.

304
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,443
WHAT?

305
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:44,445
YOU HAVE A REASON
TO FIGHT NOW.

306
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:46,072
I WONDER
IF I'VE HAD A REASON

307
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:48,032
FOR ANY OF MY BATTLES.

308
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:51,869
BUT DIDN'T YOU SUPPORT
AEOLIA'S IDEALS

309
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,454
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO JOIN?

310
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:55,373
YES, OF COURSE I DID.

311
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:58,292
AND I REALLY WANTED
TO DO AWAY WITH FIGHTING.

312
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,460
BUT YOU KNOW,

313
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,504
ANOTHER REASON
I DID ALL THIS WAS BECAUSE

314
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:03,089
I WANTED TO ERASE
THE LOATHSOME THINGS

315
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,965
I DID IN MY PAST.

316
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:07,343
LOATHSOME THINGS
IN YOUR PAST?

317
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:09,720
AND I WAS ALWAYS FIGHTING
WITH THAT IN MY MIND.

318
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,889
THAT'S RIGHT, I'VE SACRIFICED
ALL THESE LIVES

319
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:14,350
FOR THE SAKE OF MY OWN EGO.

320
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,519
MISS SUMERAGI.

321
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,978
BUT WHATEVER I DID,

322
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:20,523
I COULDN'T ERASE MY PAST.

323
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:23,859
THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW,
I'VE NO REASON TO FIGHT.

324
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:27,071
OR ANY REASON TO BE HERE.

325
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,489
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL

326
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:31,033
BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS A REASON
FOR YOU TO BE HERE.

327
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:33,202
NO, I DOUBT IT.

328
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:34,495
Allelujah:
IF THAT'S TRUE,

329
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,871
THEN WHY DID YOU COME
TO SAVE ME?

330
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:36,831
(Gasps)

331
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,876
I KNOW YOU'LL FIND A REASON
TO KEEP FIGHTING.

332
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:42,461
YOU CAN DO IT.

333
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,674
ARIOS GUNDAM.

334
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:48,509
THE SUCCESSOR TO KYRIOS.

335
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:49,969
WITH THIS MACHINE'S HELP,

336
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,429
WITH THIS GUNDAM,

337
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,639
I'M GOING TO BRING MARIE BACK.

338
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,266
EVEN THOUGH
HALLELUJAH'S GONE,

339
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:58,477
AND I CAN'T USE
MY QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

340
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:03,023
A REASON TO FIGHT.

341
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:05,025
IN THE PAST
I WOULD HAVE DISMISSED IT.

342
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,992
Sumeragi:
LOCKON, CHRIS, LICHTY,
DR. MORENO.

343
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:15,995
I WONDER IF I CAN
GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

344
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,873
MAKE MYSELF
FACE THE REAL WORLD,

345
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:20,666
AND DO MY BEST
TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE

346
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:24,211
WHO ARE IMPORTANT TO ME.

347
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,046
EMILIO.

348
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:28,507
Mileina:
PTOLEMY IS PREPARING TO EXIT
THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ.

349
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,261
HUH?

350
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,763
THE WATER'S
TOO CALM OUT THERE.

351
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:36,432
THERE'S NO SIGN OF ANY FISH.

352
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:37,808
AND AT THIS DEPTH?

353
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,685
(Gasps)

354
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:43,063
Mileina:
E‐SONAR READING!
WE'VE SIX ENEMIES CLOSING FAST!

355
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:44,356
THOSE ARE TORPEDOES!

356
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:45,357
FELDT!

357
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:47,359
GN FIELD,
MAXIMUM OUTPUT!

358
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,323
(Surprised cry)
WHAT THE?!

359
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:54,241
ENEMY ATTACK?!

360
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,243
Feldt:
THE TORPEDOES WERE CARRYING
A HEAVY CHEMICAL COMPOUND!

361
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:57,995
Mileina:
THE SONAR'S BEING JAMMED!

362
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:00,289
Lasse:
AN ENEMY THAT CAN MANEUVER
AT THIS DEPTH?!

363
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,291
THEY HAVE A NEW MODEL?!

364
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,295
Soldier:
HALT THE ENEMY SHIP
AT THE DESIGNATED POINT.

365
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:07,630
WE'RE LAUNCHING
SOMETHING SPECIAL!

366
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,968
MOVE TO THE CENTER OF THE SHIP!

367
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,220
SETSUNA!

368
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,721
Feldt:
SECOND WAVE APPROACHING!

369
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:17,264
TWO LARGE TORPEDOES
HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED!

370
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,435
Mileina:
THEY'VE BROKEN THROUGH
THE GN FIELD!

371
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:22,811
IT'S A NEW WEAPON!

372
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,403
Feldt:
THE LOWER CONTAINER'S FLOODING!

373
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:37,368
WE HAVE TO LAUNCH THE GUNDAMS,
BUT WE'RE STILL TOO DEEP!

374
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:39,161
Lasse:
I'M BRINGING PTOLEMY UP!

375
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:40,913
WE'VE GOTTA REACH A DEPTH
WHERE WE CAN LAUNCH!

376
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:42,540
(Startled scream)

377
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,543
(Grunts)

378
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:47,419
DROPPING DEPTH CHARGES
FROM ABOVE.

379
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:49,588
AND MORE THAN LIKELY
THEY'RE USING

380
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,048
CHEMICAL BOMBS!

381
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,510
Rindt:
AFTER TWO MINUTES OF
BOMBARDMENT,

382
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,722
THE TRILOBITE WILL ENGAGE
AT CLOSE QUARTERS.

383
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,683
IT'S A PITY I WON'T BE ABLE TO
WATCH THE SHIP

384
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:02,643
BEING CRUSHED BY THE PRESSURE.

385
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:04,019
MAJOR RINDT.

386
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:05,479
HE'S HANDLED THE SEARCH

387
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,189
AND THE FIRST STAGE OF
THE OPERATION WELL.

388
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:08,649
BUT WHAT WILL
THE ENEMY COMMANDER

389
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:09,817
DO IN RESPONSE?

390
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:15,864
Feldt:
A RESIN ON THE HULL

391
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,950
IS KEEPING
THE GUN PORTS FROM OPENING!

392
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,201
Lasse:
I'VE LOST STEERING, TOO!

393
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:20,911
DAMN IT,
WHERE'S THE ENEMY?!

394
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:22,746
THE E‐SONAR'S
STILL NOT WORKING!

395
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:24,331
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

396
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:26,166
Sumeragi:
CALM DOWN!

397
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,167
THERE'S A WAY OUT!

398
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:28,335
MISS SUMERAGI!

399
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,588
THE BOMBARDMENT WILL
STOP SOON!

400
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:31,755
(Grunts)

401
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,466
HMM.

402
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:37,011
ONCE IT DOES,

403
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,929
THE UNDERWATER ENEMY WILL
APPROACH US.

404
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:41,473
THEN THEY'LL LAUNCH
A DIRECT ATTACK.

405
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:44,602
(Screams)

406
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:46,979
Feldt:
THE ENEMY HAS IMPACTED
THE HULL ON THE PORTSIDE!

407
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,439
SEVERE DAMAGE!

408
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,399
(Siren blaring)

409
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:52,901
ANY MORE OF THIS,
AND THE HULL COULD FAIL!

410
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:54,153
Sumeragi:
ARE WE EVER LUCKY!

411
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:55,154
HUH?

412
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,614
WHAT? LUCKY?

413
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,991
NOW, THE ENEMY WE COULDN'T
LOCATE IS RIGHT HERE!

414
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,451
AND THE PTOLEMY
HAS CLIMBED TO A DEPTH

415
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:02,620
WHERE WE CAN LAUNCH
THE GUNDAMS!

416
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,663
AND WHAT'S MORE,
THE ENEMY'S ACTUALLY HELPED

417
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:07,458
SPEED UP THE FLOODING
OF THE LOWER CONTAINER!

418
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:16,383
TRYING TO FIGHT OFF
OUR TRILOBITE

419
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:20,095
WITH JUST
THE THRUST OF A MOBILE SUIT?

420
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:21,639
I HAVE AN ACE IN THE HOLE!

421
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,057
Tieria:
TRANS‐AM!

422
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,772
WH‐WHAT IS THIS?!

423
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:31,440
(Grunts)

424
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:37,529
I'M UNDERWATER BUT
AT THIS RANGE...

425
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,073
(Screaming)

426
00:18:39,073 --> 00:18:40,783
LET'S FIRE TORPEDOES!

427
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,660
BACK AWAY!

428
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,702
SETSUNA!

429
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:46,163
Setsuna:

00, ELIMINATING‐‐

431
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,833
I WANT YOU TO
COME BACK WITH ME

432
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,085
TO AZADISTAN.

433
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:52,252
(Tense gasp)

434
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,463
ELIMINATING TARGET!

435
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,228
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

436
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:10,854
THE TRILOBITE IS GONNA‐‐

437
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:12,022
(Screams)

438
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:18,779
GET READY SETSUNA,
WE'RE GOING UP TOP!

439
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:19,822
ROGER!

440
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:23,242
TRANS‐AM!

441
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,626
WHAT IS THAT?!

442
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:35,587
Crew member:
IT‐IT'S A GUNDAM!

443
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:37,297
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE TRILOBITE?!

444
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:38,799
THE SHIP HAS TO WITHDRAW NOW!

445
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,008
LAUNCH THE MOBILE SUITS!

446
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:41,844
IT'S TOO LATE!

447
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,471
(Frightened cry)

448
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,185
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?!

449
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:51,603
Rindt:
MR. BUSHIDO!

450
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:56,442
IT'S THAT
NEW A‐LAWS' SUIT!

451
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,195
THOSE MOVES!

452
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,530
I'VE FOUGHT HIM BEFORE.

453
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,240
Graham:
HIS SWORDPLAY.

454
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,700
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

455
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,702
THAT'S THE YOUNG MAN
I MET!

456
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,078
I THANK MY STARS

457
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:09,663
FOR GIVING ME
A CHANCE TO MAKE UP

458
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:11,457
FOR THESE YEARS
WHEN I'VE LIVED IN DISGRACE!

459
00:20:20,174 --> 00:20:21,008
Peries:
THAT MACHINE!

460
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:22,468
IT'S SUBJECT E‐57!

461
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:28,390
Allelujah:
(Yelps in pain)

462
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,058
IT'S NOT THE SUIT'S FAULT.

463
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:31,810
IT'S MY ABILITY!

464
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,353
(Grunts)

465
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:34,688
SHE'S COMING!

466
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:36,440
Peries: (Aggressively)
FALL, GUNDAM!

467
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:42,780
WHO ARE THEY?

468
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:46,450
ARE THEY KATHARON?

469
00:20:50,037 --> 00:20:52,372
THESE ARE...

470
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,458
Graham:
ANTI‐GOVERNMENT SCUM!

471
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,918
GET OUT OF MY WAY, FOOLS!

472
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:57,461
Kati:
WE'RE FALLING BACK
AND REGROUPING!

473
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,462
WE'RE WHAT?!

474
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:00,714
HUH?

475
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:01,840
(Disappointed sigh)

476
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,467
YOU REFUSE TO FIGHT ME.

477
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:09,181
Kati: (Smugly)
WELL, THAT WAS
QUITE THE LESSON, MAJOR.

478
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:10,182
(Gasps)

479

Setsuna:
THE ANTI‐GOVERNMENT GROUP,
KATHARON.

481
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:24,761
YOU HAVE QUITE THE FORCE HERE.

482
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,638
SO, WHO'S THIS PERSON?

483
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:29,391
THE ONE YOU SAID
