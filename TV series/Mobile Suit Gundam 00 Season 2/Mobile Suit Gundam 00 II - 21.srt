00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,845
WASN'T THERE
SOME OTHER WAY?

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,431
THERE WASN'T.

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,603
SEE, AT THAT MOMENT,
SHE...

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,980
SHE WAS SOMEONE ELSE,
NOT ANEW.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,274
BUT HOW CAN YOU
BE CERTAIN OF THAT?

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,276
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,529
BUT I WAS ABSOLUTELY
SURE OF IT.

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,616
IF I HADN'T ACTED,
LYLE DYLANDY WOULD BE DEAD.

Saji:
REALLY?

10
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,248
IT'S THE SAME WITH
LOUISE HALEVY.

11
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,793
I CAN SENSE SOMETHING
HAS TAKEN HOLD OF HER.

12
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,963
I FEEL THESE THINGS.

13
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,548
THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING
A LITTLE ODD ABOUT YOU LATELY,

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,384
LIKE MAYBE
SOMETHING'S CHANGED.

EVERYTHING'S ALL GREEN.

ANY SIGN OF AN ENEMY FLEET,
MILEINA?

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,784
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE'S

STAY ALERT.

THEY MIGHT TRY
SOME DESPICABLE TRICK

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,414

THE LAST TIME.

MISS SUMERAGI,
IT LOOKS LIKE

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,672
WE MIGHT'VE RECEIVED
AN URGENT CODED MESSAGE

32
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,048
WHILE THE SYSTEM
WAS DOWN.

00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,675
WHAT'S IT SAY?

34
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,636
ALL IT CONTAINS ARE
COORDINATES IN SPACE.

THE POINT IS LAGRANGE FIVE.

36
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,975
IT'S ECLIPSE,

37
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,312
AN UNFINISHED COLONY WHERE

I'M JUST FINE.

I HAVE TO.

WE'RE RESPONDING TO SOMEONE
WHO SENT US NOTHING

45

BUT COORDINATES IN SPACE?

THAT'S BOTHERING ME, TOO.

47
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,223
IT'S BECAUSE SETSUNA INSISTS
ON GOING THERE TO CHECK IT OUT.

ARE CONTINUING THEIR RESEARCH

IF EVERYTHING'S ON TRACK,

WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PICK UP
THE NEW EQUIPMENT.

YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO
KEEP ME OFF THE BATTLEFIELD.

THIS IS ABOUT THE PROMISE
I MADE TO COLONEL SMIRNOV.

IT'S TO HELP PEOPLE,

SOUNDS GOOD,
I'LL DO THAT.

157
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,336
THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING
A LITTLE ODD ABOUT YOU LATELY.

158

00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,556
MAKE THE CHANGE.

163
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,725
NO MATTER WHAT AWAITS ME
AT THE END.

166
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,535
OH, IT'S YOU.
(Grunts)

167
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,662
KLAUS! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?!

168
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,123
YEAH, IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

169
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,084
I WAS SO GLAD
YOU MADE IT OKAY.

170
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,046
Shirin:
GO UP INTO SPACE?

171
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,340
Klaus:
I MADE CONTACT WITH SURVIVORS
OF THE ATTEMPTED COUP

172
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,716
AGAINST THE FEDERATION.

173
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,551
WITH OUR BRANCH
NEARLY WIPED OUT,

174
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,221
IT'S DANGEROUS FOR US TO
REMAIN ON EARTH ANY LONGER.

175
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,472
YES,

176
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,807
BUT KATHARON DOESN'T HAVE

177
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,266
AS MUCH FIGHTING STRENGTH
IN SPACE.

178
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,352
ACTUALLY, I'M OPTIMISTIC.

179
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,562
THE REALITY IS, THERE ARE
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE

180
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,564
WHO ARE TRYING
TO FIND A WAY TO SPEAK OUT

181
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,316
ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS
IN A DIFFERENT WAY

182
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,777
FROM US AND CELESTIAL BEING.

YOU MEAN THIS SONG?

185
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,114
THAT'S RIGHT.

186
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,743
PRINCESS MARINA'S SONG IS
SPREADING AMONG THE PEOPLE.

187
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,913
Shirin:
MARINA'S SONG IS SPREADING
AROUND THE WORLD? WHY?

188

Klaus:
I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE ARE
WISHING FOR PEACE.

189
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,710
THEY WISH THAT THROUGH
PRINCESS MARINA'S SONG,

190
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,879
THE FIGHTING WILL STOP,

191
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,965
AND PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE
TO LIVE TOGETHER.

192
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,509
WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED
ON OPPOSITION,

193
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,927
WE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT

194
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,555
PEOPLE CAN STILL
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER,

195
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,933

UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

198
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,274
MARINA HAS ALWAYS
WISHED FOR THAT,

STOP ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS
AND THINK FOR YOURSELF!

210
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,184
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR FLAWS

211
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,186
THAT I WAS FORCED TO BECOME
THE HEAD OF THE WANG FAMILY!

BEING TWISTED LIKE THIS!

215

THAT'S THE REAL REASON WHY I
WANT TO SEE THE WORLD REFORMED!

IF THE INNOVATORS FOUND OUT
ABOUT THIS,

THEY'D QUICKLY MOVE VEDA
TO SOME OTHER LOCATION.

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,187
GIVE ME CONTROL!

323
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,605
Saji:
YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT HIM?!

324
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,733
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN AVOID IT.

325
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,613
THIS IS THE PATH
I WISH TO TRAVEL UPON.

326
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,826
THE PATH OF BLOODSHED!

327
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,161
Setsuna:
DOUBLE 0 RAISER!

328
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,121
Graham:
THE REBORN MASURAO,
SUSANOWO!

329
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,372
ELIMINATING...

330
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,874
FINALLY, WE CROSS SWORDS...

331
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,125
...THE TARGET!

332
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,501
...IN EARNEST!

333
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,795
(Metal clashing)

334
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,842
Liu Mei:
I OFFER UP CELESTIAL BEING
AND THE INNOVATORS,

335
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,511
AND EVEN THE LIFE OF
MY DEAR OLDER BROTHER

336
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,514
TO REALIZE MY REFORMATION!

337
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,558
ALL FOR THE BRILLIANT FUTURE

338
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,018
THAT LIES BECKONING
AHEAD OF ME‐‐

339
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,437
Nena:
DON'T YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE NO FUTURE.

340
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,522
NENA!
BUT WHY?!

341
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,109
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
I DESPISE YOU.

342
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,196
I ONLY OBEYED YOU BECAUSE
I HAD TO SURVIVE SOMEHOW.

343
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,950
I JUST HAD TO BE A LITTLE
FRIENDLY AND YOU BELIEVED ME.

344
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,743
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

345
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,870
YOUR USEFULNESS IS OVER!

346
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,713
Nena:
(Laughing)

347
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,132
SHE'S BLOWN TO PIECES!

348
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,884
THAT'S YOUR PUNISHMENT
FOR TREATING ME

349
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,344
LIKE SOME KIND OF POSSESSION!

350
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,138
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO
SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD.

351
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,225
AND WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO BE HAPPY, AS WELL.

352
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,685
THAT'S THE REASON,

353
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,646
AND THAT'S WHY I'M OBEYING
THE INNOVATORS FOR NOW.

354
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,692
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T YET AVENGED
THE DEATHS OF MY BROTHERS!

355
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,027
AND WHEN THE TIME COMES
FOR MY VENGEANCE,

356
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,363
I'LL GO STRAIGHT FOR
THE JUGULAR!

357
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,782
(Ribbons' voice) DESPITE YOUR
WORDS, YOUR USEFULNESS IS OVER
AS WELL.

358
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,117
HARO?

359
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,160
THOSE WHO ACT SELFISHLY
MUST BE PUNISHED.

360
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,620
(Gasps)

361
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,038
AN INNOVATOR!

362
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,206
(Chuckles)

363
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,543
THE ONE TO PASS JUDGMENT ON YOU
WILL SOON BE ARRIVING.

364
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,003
THE ONE WHO'LL PASS JUDGMENT?!

365
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,089
(Gasps)

366
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,090
COULD IT BE...

367
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,925
HE'S THE ONE?

368
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,427
THAT'S JUST PERFECT!

369
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,596
I'LL HAVE VENGEANCE
FOR MY BROTHERS!

370
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,807
YES. I SUPPOSE YOU COULD
CALL IT VENGEANCE.

371
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,100
(Nena screaming)

372
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,206
WH‐WHAT?!

373
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,442
Louise:
THAT'S THE ONE!

374
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:33,154
THAT'S THE GUNDAM I WANT!

375
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,490
THE ONE THAT KILLED
MOM AND DAD!

376
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,242
THAT'S THE GUNDAM THAT DID IT!

377
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,748
Nena:
WHAT THE...?!

378
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,125
Setsuna:
THAT MACHINE! IT'S A THRONE!

379
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,669
(Gasps)
LOUISE'S FAMILY WAS‐‐

380
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,046
Setsuna:
LOUISE HALEVY, STOP IT!

381
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,297
LOUISE?!

382
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,423
REVENGE SOLVES NOTHING!

383
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,966
LOUISE!

384
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,760
Graham:
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO
HOLD NOTHING BACK!

385
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,762
(Setsuna and Saji screaming)

386
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,641
Nena:
TAKING REVENGE
FOR YOUR FAMILY?!

387
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,060
I'M DOING THE SAME THING!

388
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,103
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
SUFFERING HERE!

389
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,487
(Nena screaming)

390
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,657
(Thinking)
I WAS CREATED FOR THIS
AND FORCED TO FIGHT.

391
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
I REFUSE TO DIE LIKE THIS!

392
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,328
THIS ISN'T HOW I WANNA DIE!

393
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,247
(Gasps)

394
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,667
Louise:
I KNOW. I'M SURE
YOU DON'T WANNA DIE.

395
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,088
BUT, MY MOM AND DAD...

396
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,090
WEREN'T EVEN GIVEN THE CHANCE
TO SAY THAT

397
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,466
BEFORE YOU KILLED THEM!

398
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,177
(Screaming)

399
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,721
(Coughs)
DAMN YOU, YOU BITCH!

400
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,976
THE THRONE'S GONE!

LOUISE!

402
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,105
Graham:
KEEP YOUR MIND ON THE BATTLE!

403
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,860
MISTER BUSHIDO AND THE GUNDAM
ARE FIGHTING IN THAT DIRECTION.

404
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,904
WHERE'S THE WARRANT OFFICER?

405
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,572
OVER THERE!

406
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:04,120
Louise:
(Giggling)

407
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,748
I DID IT!
MOM, DAD.

408
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:12,253
I AVENGED YOU!
I DEFEATED THE GUNDAM!

409
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,796
WARRANT OFFICER.

410
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:19,301
(Hearty laughter)

411
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,053
LOOK, MOM!
LOOK, DAD!

412
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,680
SEE?

413
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,974
I FINALLY DID IT.

414
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,268
I DID IT, SO...

415
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,229
SAY SOMETHING.

416
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,273
TELL ME I'M GOOD!

417
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,650
TELL ME THAT I DID...

418
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,901
THE RIGHT THING.

Graham:
I SURVIVED FOR THIS!

423
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,266
THIS IS WHY I SURVIVED
UNTIL THIS DAY!

424
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:34,395
EVEN IF I SHOULD BE REDUCED TO
A PUPPET OF THE INNOVATORS!

425

Graham:
WE'RE TOO EVENLY MATCHED!

432
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,202
IN THAT CASE...

433
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,495

WHERE THE HELL AM I?

443
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,700
COULD IT BE THAT I'VE ALREADY
MADE THE PASSAGE TO NIRVANA?

444
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,911
Setsuna:
NO.

YOUNG MAN.

446

I BELIEVE THIS IS THE PLACE

447
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,375
WHERE THE QUANTA
CONVERGE TOGETHER.

448

WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS THIS?

00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,130
Setsuna:
I FEEL THAT I UNDERSTAND

450
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,050
WHY AEOLIA SCHENBERG CREATED
THE GUNDAMS.

451
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,176
OR RATHER,

452
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,803
WHY HE CREATED THE GN DRIVES.

453
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,680
WHAT?!

454
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,142
THE ARMED INTERVENTIONS
WERE TO PREPARE FOR THIS.

455
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,061
AEOLIA'S GOAL

456
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,064
WAS TO GUIDE HUMANITY TO
REFORMATION.

457
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:00,981
AND SO,

458
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,400
I'M READY.

459
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,736
I'M GOING TO REFORM MYSELF.

TO RECOVER VEDA,
AN OPERATION TO FORCE THEIR WAY

GETS UNDERWAY.

NEXT EPISODE:
"FOR THE FUTURE".

463
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,373
EVEN IF THIS BATTLE
BURDENS THEM WITH SIN,

464
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,708
IT IS WORTH IT
IF IT LEADS TO TOMORROW.
