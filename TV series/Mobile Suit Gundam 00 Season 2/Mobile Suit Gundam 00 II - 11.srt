1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,171
ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T
YOU ALL TELL ME

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,632
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,009
I WANT TO WEAR PRETTY CLOTHES
ALL THE TIME!

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,386
I WANT TO EAT AS MUCH
AS I REALLY WANT TO!

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,513
I WANT TO
GO INTO SPACE!

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,098
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
LEANNE?

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,894
HUH? I'D SURE LIKE TO
SEE MY MOM AND DAD AGAIN.

8
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,189
YOUR MOM AND DAD?
WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,274
IN SUILLE.

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,414
(Sergei groans)

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,416
WH‐WHAT HAPPENED?

12
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,341
(Al‐Saachez laughs)

13
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,176
THAT WAS AMAZING!

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,054
BOSS, WITH THIS THING THERE
WON'T EVEN BE A WAR!

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,015
MAYBE NOT.

16
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,017
(Gasps)

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,228
(Nena giggles)

18
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:05,023
SO, THIS IS HOW
THE INNOVATORS ROLL.

19
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,025
THAT MADE MY DAY!

20
00:01:07,025 --> 00:02:38,825
♪

21
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,579
Katharon Leader:
WIPED OUT?!

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,122
THE WHOLE
CAPITAL DISTRICT?!

23
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,834
YES. THE KING OF SUILLE AND
OUR COMRADES ARE GONE,

24
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,087
ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

25
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,048
BRANCH CHIEF MAHAL...

26
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,509
DID THE FEDERATION
USE A NUCLEAR WEAPON?

27
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,927
THAT WASN'T IT.

28
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:01,139
IT WAS A HIGH‐POWERED LASER
THAT STRUCK FROM SPACE.

29
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,893
A SATELLITE WEAPON?

30
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,853
HMM.

31
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,190
Goodman:
THE MEMENTO MORI,

32
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,110
IT HAS MORE THAN EXCEEDED
MY EXPECTATIONS.

33
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,569
WITH THIS KIND OF POWER,

34
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,073
THE ANTI‐GOVERNMENT FORCES WILL
BE DEALT WITH IN NO TIME.

35
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,034
YES, THIS IS WHAT WILL
LITERALLY ELIMINATE

36
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,911
ALL WARS FROM THE WORLD.

37
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,460
DOUBLE 0 RAISER,

38
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,296
IS APPROACHING
TRANS AM'S TIME LIMIT!

39
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,305
HMM? WHAT HAPPENED?

40
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,307
(Grunts)

41
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,480
WHAT WAS
I JUST SAYING?

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,566
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

43
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,735
WHY DID I TELL THE COLONEL
TO RUN AWAY?

44
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,362
Mileina:
INCREDIBLE!

45
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,073
IT PERFORMED BEYOND
THEORETICAL LIMITS!

46
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,450
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

47
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,742
THIS IS JUST NUTS!

48
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,286
NOT EVEN IN OUR
WILDEST DREAMS

49
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,163
DID WE EXPECT THIS FROM
THE TWIN DRIVE!

50
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,875
THIS THING'S
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

51
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,587
SO, THIS IS WHAT
THE DOUBLE 0 RAISER HAS...

52
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,630
THE POWER TO CHANGE
THE WORLD.

53
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,343
LASSE...

54
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,179
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR PHYSICAL CONDITION.

55
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,055
I WAS LOOKING AT
YOUR DATA.

56
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,683
IF YOU KEEP PUSHING YOURSELF
LIKE THIS, YOU COULD‐‐

57
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,269
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF LEAVING
THE SHIP NOW.

58
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,897
LOOK, LET'S JUST TAKE IT
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

59
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,857
BUT...

60
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,984
MISS SUMERAGI,
OUR OBSERVATION SYSTEM

61
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,445
DETECTED AN ABNORMAL HEAT
SOURCE IN THE EARTH'S SPHERE.

62
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,988
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

63
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,115
PLEASE COME TO THE BRIDGE
IMMEDIATELY.

64
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,117
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

65
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,621
Sumeragi:
THIS WAS CAUSED
BY A SATELLITE WEAPON!

66
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,080
IT WAS PROBABLY A DEVICE

67
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,291
THAT UTILIZED
THE SOLAR POWER SYSTEM.

68
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,044
BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE VERY
MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THIS.

69
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,629
WHAT WAS THE TARGET?

70
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,756
THE MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY,
SUILLE.

71
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,591
NOT SUILLE...

72
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,426
IS THIS THE A‐LAWS'?

73
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,180
OR RATHER, IS THIS RIBBONS
ALMARK'S WAY OF DOING THINGS?

74
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,348
MISS SUMERAGI.

75
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,183
OKAY.

76
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,019
PTOLEMY WILL HEAD OUT AS SOON AS
THE REPAIRS ARE FINISHED.

77
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,189
OUR MISSION IS TO DESTROY THE
FEDERATION'S SATELLITE WEAPON.

78
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,357
JUST A MOMENT!

79
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,150
BEFORE WE GO...

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,528
THERE'S SOMETHING
EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW.

81
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,530
THE FEDERATION IS BEING
MANIPULATED

82
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,115
BY A SECRET GROUP THAT WANTS TO
CONTROL THE WHOLE WORLD.

83
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,326
A GROUP?
CONTROL THE WORLD?

84
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,329
AND HOW IS IT YOU CAME BY
THIS INFORMATION?

85
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,831
BECAUSE I'VE MET THEM.

86
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,044
THEY CALL THEMSELVES...
INNOVATORS.

87
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:40,215
A LASER ATTACK FROM A SATELLITE
USING THE SOLAR POWER SYSTEM.

88
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,260
THE SCALE
OF THE ATTACK...

89
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,011
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO, KLAUS?

90
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,597
KATHARON SPACE FORCES HAVE
ALREADY BEGUN

91
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,183
TO MOBILIZE
TO DESTROY THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

92
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,768
SPLIT OUR FLEET INTO
TWO GROUPS,

93
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,770
AND ATTACK
SIMULTANEOUSLY...

94
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,021
USING TWENTY‐THREE
WARSHIPS

95
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,440
AND FORTY‐THREE
MOBILE SUITS.

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,110
THAT'S THE FIGHTING STRENGTH OF
OUR ENTIRE SPACE FORCE.

97
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,028
YES, BUT THE A‐LAWS FLEET
WILL BE WAITING

98
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,280
ON HIGH ALERT FOR THEM,

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,824
ALL AROUND
THE SATELLITE WEAPON.

100
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,618
EVEN IF WE USE ALL
THE STRENGTH THAT WE HAVE...

101
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,621
IKEDA, HAS THERE BEEN ANY
RESPONSE FROM CELESTIAL BEING?

102
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,332
NO, NOTHING SO FAR.

103
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,044
THEN KATHARON HAS NO CHOICE
BUT TO DO THIS ALONE.

104
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,055
LIVING TERMINALS CREATED
BY VEDA

105
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,765
CALLED INNOVATORS.

106
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,059
SO THEY'RE THE ONES GIVING
A‐LAWS ITS ORDERS

107
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,228
AND THEY EVEN
HAVE CONTROL OF VEDA.

108
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,647
WELL THEN THAT MEANS
BACK WHEN WE STARTED DOING

109
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,899
OUR ARMED INTERVENTIONS
FIVE YEARS AGO‐‐

110
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,445
THEY WERE ALREADY BUSY...
INTERFERING WITH THINGS.

111
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,864
TRINITY. SO THEY
WERE THE ONES WHO HAD

112
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,908
THE THREE GUNDAM THRONES DOING
ARMED INTERVENTIONS.

113
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,620
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN THE ONES
WHO SUPPLIED THE UNITED NATIONS

114
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,580
WITH THE THIRTY GN‐X MACHINES

115
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,707
THAT WERE EQUIPPED WITH
PSEUDO GN DRIVES.

116
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,959
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

117
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,503
THESE GUYS WENT AND CHANGED
AEOLIA'S PLAN.

118
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,715
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, LOCKON,
CHRIS AND THE OTHERS...

119
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,592
WHY WAIT UNTIL NOW BEFORE
TELLING US

120
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,427
ABOUT SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT?

121
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,304
THEY SAID THAT
THEY'RE THE ONES

122
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,140
WHO ARE CONTINUING TO FOLLOW
AEOLIA SCHENBERG'S PLAN.

123
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,933
AND IF WHAT THEY SAY
IS TRUE...

124
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,685
THEN THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY THE ONES

125
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,520
WHO ARE GUILTY OF HERESY.

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,605
THAT CAN'T BE!

127
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,106
THAT'S RIGHT!

128
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,151
I MEAN, THEY CREATED A‐LAWS TO
SLAUGHTER DISSIDENT GROUPS!

129
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,779
THERE'S NO WAY REAL PEACE
COULD EVER BE ACHIEVED

130
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,947
THROUGH SUCH
BRUTAL METHODS!

131
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,699
Setsuna:
I'LL DESTROY THEM.

132
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,328
I'LL DEFEAT THE A‐LAWS
AND ELIMINATE THE INNOVATORS.

133
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:37,165
I'LL DO IT.
THROUGH MY OWN WILL.

134
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,043
I'M WITH YOU, SETSUNA!

135
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,169
ME, TOO.

136
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,379
OOOH, I'M IN!

137
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,673
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT!

138
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,133
EVERYONE,
I'M THE SAME AS‐‐

139
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,053
I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN, BUT...

140
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,888
RIGHT NOW, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING

141
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,599
IS FOR US TO DESTROY
THE ENEMY'S SATELLITE WEAPON.

142
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,102
SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA.

143
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,063
NO MATTER WHAT,
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE ONE OF US.

144
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,528
(Sighs)

145
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,907
ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS PRAY FOR
THE SUCCESS OF OUR SPACE FLEET.

146
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,039
NOTHING'S CHANGED FROM THE DAYS
WHEN I WAS IN AZADISTAN.

147
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,541

♪

150
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,601
EXCUSE ME MISTRESS,
I WAS WONDERING ARE YOU

151
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,603
GOING TO GIVE UP ON
CELESTIAL BEING

152
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,398
AND GIVE THE INNOVATORS
YOUR FULL SUPPORT?

153
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,067
IF YOU VIEW THINGS
ON SUCH SIMPLE LEVELS,

154
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,737
THEN TRUE REFORMATION
WILL NEVER ARRIVE.

155
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,905
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN?

156
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,158
IT CAN MEAN MANY THINGS,
BUT IN THIS CASE

157
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,910
IT MEANS YOU'RE NOT AS
SPECIAL AS YOU THINK YOU ARE.

158
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,622
AND THIS WOMAN IS COOPERATING

00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,338
Operator:
3266 UNTIL ARRIVAL AT LAGRANGE
THREE'S ASTEROID FIELD.

161
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,674
NOW THEN, THE QUESTION IS
HOW DO WE GO ABOUT

162
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,551
FINDING THEIR HIDEOUT?

163
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,802
DON'T WORRY,

164
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,721
YOU CAN LEAVE THAT
LITTLE DETAIL UP TO US.

165
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,765
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN
OF SOME SORT?

166
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,933
WELL, OF COURSE
WE HAVE A PLAN, COLONEL.

167
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,356
AH, WARRANT OFFICER HALEVY,

168
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,942
SO TELL ME HOW ARE YOU
FEELING THESE DAYS?

169
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,527
NO PROBLEMS, SIR.

170
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,906
I SEE.

171
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,701
THAT PHOTO, SIR,
IS SHE YOUR WIFE?

172
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,537
YES. UNTIL TWO MONTHS AGO,
THAT IS.

173
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,997
SHE WAS KILLED IN
ONE OF

174
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,541
KATHARON'S ACTS OF
ANTI‐FEDERATION TERRORISM.

175
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,335
(Sighs sympathetically)

176
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,128
Announcer:
GADESSA, GARAZZO, LAUNCHING.

177
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,092
WELL DONE, COLONEL MANNEQUIN.

178
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,762
YOU'VE COME UP WITH
AN AMUSING STRATEGY HERE.

179
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,931
ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
FOR A MERE HUMAN.

180
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,778
LOOKS LIKE BOTH MY MACHINE
AND TIERIA'S

181
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,113
HAVE NEW SYSTEMS
INSTALLED, TOO.

182
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,032
MRS. VASHTI HAS A LOT OF
CONFIDENCE IN THEM.

183
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,034
WE'RE EXPECTING GREAT RESULTS.

184
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,662
SO, CAN THE 0 RAISER
SORTIE AS WELL?

185
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,288
NO, NOT JUST YET.

186
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,083
RIGHT NOW IT'S BEING
TRANSFERRED TO THE PTOLEMAIOS

187
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,544
SO IT CAN BE ADJUSTED
TO DOUBLE 0'S TRANS AM SYSTEM.

188
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,381
WELL, I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE.

189
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,591
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE
SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME

190
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,134
TALKING WITH YOU.

191
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,637
ACTUALLY, IT ISN'T GOODBYE!

192
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,097
WHAT?

193
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,849
I'M GOING TO BE COMING
ON BOARD WITH YOU.

194
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,600
BECAUSE OF
MR. IAN'S RECOMMENDATION,

195
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,185
I'LL BE JOINING THE PTOLEMAOIS.

196
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,896
OH? GOOD TO HEAR.

197
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,112
LET'S GET STARTED.
RESPOND TO MY SIGNAL.

198
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,369
QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES!
BUT FROM WHERE?

199
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,414
I'M NOT THEIR TARGET.
THEN WHO?

200
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,332
Revive:
ENEMY BASE LOCATED.

201
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,461
SEND A CODED VISUAL MESSAGE
ALERTING THE FLEET.

202
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,463
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE MAKING YOUR WAY

203
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,424
TO THE BRIDGE?

204
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,758
SOMETHING WRONG?

205
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,469
WHAT? NO!
NOTHING'S WRONG!

206
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,305
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT THIS?

207
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,349
YEAH, I GUESS I AM.
A LITTLE BIT.

208
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,601
LET'S GET GOING.

209
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,770
OKAY!

210
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,148
HOW'S THE RESUPPLYING
GOING, FELDT?

211
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,816
IT'LL BE FINISHED
IN 0032.

212
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,735
RIGHT.

213
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,028
THIS IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT

214
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,822
FOR ALL PERSONNEL
NOT ASSIGNED TO PTOLEMY.

215
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,075
PTOLEMY WILL DEPART IN 0032.

216
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,328
UPON COMPLETION OF
THE RESUPPLY,

217
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,039
WORKERS WILL DELETE ALL DATA,
DESTROY THE BASE,

218
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,043
AND LEAVE ON TRANSPORT SHIPS
USING ROUTE Y45.

219
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,795
AT 0037, PTOLEMY
WILL BEGIN A MISSION

220
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,174
TO DESTROY THE FEDERATION'S
SATELLITE WEAPON.

221
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,092
YOU BE SURE TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, MILEINA.

222
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,469
FOR SURE, MOM!

223
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,803
AND YOU, TOO.

224
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,972
WE'LL BE FINE, DEAR.

225
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,515
YOU'RE STAYING WITH
THE PTOLEMY?

226
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,643
YEAH. I'M NOT SURE HOW,

227
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,770
BUT THERE HAS TO
BE SOME WAY I CAN HELP.

228
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,814
SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO
WITHOUT FIGHTING.

229
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,650
(Rumbling)

230
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,027
WHAT WAS THAT?!
AN ATTACK?

231
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,612
ENEMY ATTACK?!

232
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,614
(Boom)

233
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,826
I'M GOING TO HEAD OVER
TO HANGAR TWO, OKAY?

234
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,912
UNDERSTOOD!

235
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,288
THIS IS...

236
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,124
THE BASE IS UNDER MISSILE ATTACK
FROM THREE DIRECTIONS!

237
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,626
WE WERE ONE STEP TOO SLOW.

238
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,502
ENEMY FIGHTING STRENGTH?

239
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,504
CAN'T DETERMINE!

240
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,010
CONTINUE WITH
THE ATTACK ON THE BASE

241
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,012
AS SOON AS WE'VE SMOKED OUT
THE ENEMY SHIP,

242
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,932
WE'LL SWITCH
TO MISSION PLAN SA77.

243
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,934
NO ESCAPE.

244
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,064
(Loud explosions)

245
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,024
WE HAVE TO HURRY TO
HANGAR THREE!

246
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,567
(Screaming)

247
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,986
(Explosions continue)

248
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,198
Linda:
THE TRANSPORTS ARE
GOING TO LEAVE IN ORDER!

249
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,450
HURRY UP!

250
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,495
(Panicked chatter)

251
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,663
SORRY FOR BEING LATE!

252
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,289
YEAH,
I'M SORRY, TOO!

253
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,458
HMM.

254
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,128
YOU TWO, YOU CAN TAKE THOSE
SEATS RIGHT OVER THERE!

255
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,839
ALL GUNDAMS, PREPARE TO LAUNCH
IMMEDIATELY! ANEW...

256
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,757
PLEASE TAKE OVER
AT THE HELM.

257
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,259
ROGER, I'M ON IT.

258
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,303
THANK YOU, NOW I CAN FINALLY
CONCENTRATE ON FIRING BACK!

259
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,473
CANCEL THE RESUPPLY AND HAVE
PTOLEMY EMERGENCY LAUNCH!

260
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,350
WE'LL DRAW THE ENEMY'S
ATTENTION TO US.

261
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,601
UH, ROGER THAT.

262
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,186
CANCELING THE RESUPPLY.

263
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,522
DISCONNECTING ANCHOR ARMS
FROM PTOLEMY.

264
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,107
MOM...

265
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,525
ALL GUNDAMS HAVE LAUNCHED.

266
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,698
IAN, WHAT'S THE STATUS
OF THE 0 RAISER?

267
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,700
I NEED A LITTLE
MORE TIME WITH IT.

268
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,077
ROGER.

269
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,620

ATTACKING IN WAVES?!

310
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,953
THESE TACTICS
WON'T BE ENOUGH!

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,066
HAVE TIERIA AND LOCKON

YOU'RE GOING TO LET HIM?!

00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,279
THE ENEMY WILL KEEP ATTACKING IN
WAVES UNTIL THEY GET US.

375
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,573
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
PLACE OUR BETS ON THE TWIN DRIVE

AND ALSO TO THWART

CANNOT AVOID FIGHTING.

382
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,095
