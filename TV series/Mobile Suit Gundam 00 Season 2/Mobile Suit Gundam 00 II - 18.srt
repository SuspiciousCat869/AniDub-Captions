Secretary General:
IT HAS BEEN FOUR MONTHS
SINCE "BREAK PILLAR",

00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,051
THE UNPRECEDENTED ACT OF
MEGA‐TERRORISM

3
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,594
BY ANTI‐FEDERATION FORCES.

COUNTLESS VICTIMS AND
THEIR FAMILIES

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,350
ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO COPE
WITH THIS TRAGEDY.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,644
HOWEVER, THANKS TO
THE MEMENTO MORI,

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,562
THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF
THE ORBITAL ELEVATOR

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,564
WAS AVERTED.
WE ARE ALSO SEEING

THE UNUSUAL WEATHER
CAUSED BY THE DISASTER

10

BEGINNING TO SUBSIDE.

A NEW DAY OF REVIVAL!

CONCURRENTLY WITH THIS REVIVAL,

20
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,639
A NEW BATTLE BEGINS TODAY!

00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,766
TO PREVENT FURTHER ACTS
OF TERRORISM,

THE COMMAND STRUCTURE
OF THE FEDERATION FORCES

23
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,353

HAS MADE AN APPEARANCE IN SPACE?

INTENDED TARGET?!

00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,785
WHO TAKE WEALTH AND POWER
FOR GRANTED

160
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,161
AND LOOK DOWN ON THE MASSES,

161
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,789
EVEN THOUGH
THEY'RE OF THE SAME KIND.

162
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,583
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME
PERSONALLY?

163
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,462
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
TIME WILL LEAVE YOU BEHIND.

164
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,130
SIMILAR TO THE WAY

165
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,175
THAT YOUR BEAUTY
WILL WITHER AWAY WITH TIME.

166
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,969
IN ORDER TO CLING
TO THE GLORIOUS PAST,

167
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,972
PEOPLE ACHIEVE PEACE
BY HURTING OTHERS.

168
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,058
PEOPLE KNOW IT ISN'T
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

169
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,852
BUT THEY'RE UNABLE
TO STOP ANY OF IT.

170
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,564
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE THAT SOMEONE
NEEDS TO TEACH THEM A LESSON?

171
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,983
AND YOU FEEL
YOU'RE THE ONES TO DO IT?

172
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,779
HUMAN VALUES ARE
FAR TOO LIMITED.

173
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,909
WE CONSIDER THINGS FROM
A MUCH BROADER PERSPECTIVE.

174
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,537
IS THAT RIGHT?
WELL THEN,

175
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,789
HERE'S TO THAT
BROADER REFORMATION.

176
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,624
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

177
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,668
LET ME JUST TELL YOU
ONE THING.

178
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,003
YOU CAN NEVER
BECOME AN INNOVATOR.

179
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,381
(Gasps)

180
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,799
SAD AS IT IS,

181
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,593
I'M MERELY TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

182
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,849
Regene:
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S WISE?
PUSHING HER AWAY LIKE THAT?

183
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,476
I NO LONGER HAVE
ANY USE FOR HER.

184
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,603
BUT IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN LOOK AFTER HER.

185
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,355
HEAVENS, NO.

186
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,982
BUT OVER
THE PAST FOUR MONTHS,

187
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,692
YOU HAVE MET WITH HER
QUITE OFTEN.

188
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,277
HMPH.

189
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,363
I WAS COLLECTING INFORMATION
FROM HER ABOUT CELESTIAL BEING.

190
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,698
OH REALLY?

191
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,284
FINE THEN,
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

192
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,703
(Angry growl)

193
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,584
I HEARD THAT YOU WERE PROMOTED
TO FIRST LIEUTENANT.

194
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,878
YEAH, IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE
ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT

195
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,589
THE MACHINE I SHOT DOWN DURING
THE "BREAK PILLAR" INCIDENT

196
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,884
BELONGED TO THE RINGLEADER OF
THE WHOLE COUP D'ÉTAT.

197
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,760
AND SO THE TOP BRASS
REWARDED ME FOR IT.

198
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,179
CONGRATULATIONS, LIEUTENANT.

199
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,724
I HAVE TO SAY, BEING
CONGRATULATED BY YOU IS‐‐

200
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,477
Revive:
WELL, A PROMOTION FOR
KILLING YOUR OWN FATHER.

201
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,479
THE A‐LAWS ARE REALLY
AN ELITE GROUP,

202
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,772
YOU SHOW
A LOT OF PROMISE.

203
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,316
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

204
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,276
Louise:
IS IT TRUE, LIEUTENANT?

205
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,278
YOU KILLED YOUR OWN FATHER?

206
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,779
(Sighs)

207
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,074
I HAD NO CHOICE,
HE WAS A REBEL SYMPATHIZER.

208
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,039
ALL I DID WAS PERFORM MY DUTY
AS A SOLDIER.

209
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,416
YOU KNEW IT WAS YOUR FATHER
AND YOU STILL KILLED HIM?!

210
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,334
BUT WHY?!

211
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,419
FOR PEACE!

212
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,088
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
PRAYING FOR AN END TO WAR!

213
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,924
THOSE WHO SPLIT FROM
THE MILITARY

214
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,885
TO THREATEN THE GOVERNMENT
MUST FACE JUDGMENT.

215
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,595
AS HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD,

216
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,096
I THOUGHT IT WAS
AN ACT OF KINDNESS

217
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,182
THAT I BE THE ONE TO BURY HIM.

218
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,475
BUT THAT'S...

219
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,352
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST...

220
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,270
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE
IN THE SAME SITUATION?

221
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,481
(Gasps)
I'M NOT SURE.

222
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,066
SO YOU CAN TAKE
THE LIFE OF STRANGERS,

223
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,234
BUT NOT THAT OF
A BLOOD RELATIVE?!

224
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
(Sighs)

225
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,236
(Hiling laughs)

226
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,863
HUH?

227
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,531
A MAN WHO KILLED HIS FATHER,

228
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,534
AND A WOMAN SEEKING REVENGE
FOR HER FAMILY.

229
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,453
YOU'RE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER!

230
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,704
(Grunts)

231
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,122
WELL, IF SHE'S
THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU,

232
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,124
DO YOUR BEST TO PROTECT HER.

233
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,842
LISTEN.

234
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:45,306
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR IDEALS,
WARRANT OFFICER.

235
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,975
TO ACHIEVE THEM,

236
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,145
SOMETIMES WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE TOUGH CHOICES.

237
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,148
(Gasps)

238
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,487
ONE DAY, YOU'LL BE IN
THAT SITUATION.

239
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,037
I WONDER IF I CAN DO IT.

240
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,083
TO HIM.

241
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,752
WILL I BE ABLE TO FIRE AT SAJI?

242
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,465
Saji:
I HAVE TO.

243
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,968
Setsuna:
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO
GET LOUISE HALEVY BACK,

244
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,511
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT.

245
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,556
YOU'LL JUST BE FIGHTING
TO BRING HER BACK.

246
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:34,188
Saji:
THAT'S MY BATTLE.

247
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,785
SO THE A‐LAWS HAVE FINALLY TAKEN
OVER THE FEDERATION FORCES.

248
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,871
IN THE PAST FOUR MONTHS ALONE,

249
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,249
WE'VE COME UNDER ATTACK
FROM THE A‐LAWS OVER 20 TIMES.

250
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,918
THINGS JUST KEEP
GETTING WORSE FOR US!

251
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,295
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M STARTING TO THINK

252
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,298
THE ENEMY KNOWS
OUR EXACT POSITION AT ALL TIMES.

253
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,675
Mileina:
IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE!

254
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,886
SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA,
PERHAPS IT'S TIME

255
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,388
WE PUT THAT PLAN
WE DISCUSSED INTO ACTION.

256
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,765
WHAT'S THE PLAN ABOUT?

257
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,099
ABOUT VEDA.

258
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,350
YOU SEE,

259
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,686
WE'VE CONCLUDED THAT
THE FEDERATION, OR RATHER,

260
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,773
THE INNOVATORS HAVE BEEN USING
VEDA TO CONTROL INFORMATION.

261
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,941
IF WE CAN TAKE VEDA BACK...

262
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,485
BUT THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH
WE CAN DO

263
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,987
WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE VEDA'S
LOCATED NOW, IS THERE?

264
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,197
Setsuna:
IN WHICH CASE,

265
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,823
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO ASK SOMEONE

266
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,408
WHO HAS THAT INFORMATION.

267
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,452
Lasse:
WHAT? YOU MEAN AN INNOVATOR!

268
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,703
THAT'S RIGHT.

269
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,705
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

270
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,123
HMM.

271
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,460
Anew:
HEY, LYLE,
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

272
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,003
ABOUT WHAT?

273
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,757
I WANNA KNOW MORE
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

274
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,759
I DON'T REMEMBER HIM SO WELL.

275
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,805
WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR SCHOOL,
I MOVED TO THE DORMITORIES.

276
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,058
WHY'D YOU LIVE IN A DORMITORY?

277
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,229
Lyle:
BECAUSE I COULDN'T STAND BEING
COMPARED TO MY GIFTED BROTHER.

278
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,565
RATHER THAN FIGHTING IT,
I CHOSE TO RUN AWAY.

279
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,445
Anew:
BUT YOU BECAME A GUNDAM MEISTER,
JUST LIKE HIM.

280
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,446
HMPH.

281
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,408
OUR MOTIVES WERE VERY DIFFERENT.

282
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,994
HEY, SPEAKING OF
FAMILY AND SUCH,

283
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454
WHAT ABOUT YOURS, ANEW?

284
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,790
MY FAMILY?

285
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,125
YEAH.

286
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,086
(Sighs)

287
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,048
WELL, I...

288
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,134
THAT'S KINDA...

289
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,553
HMM.

290
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,141
(Lyle sighs)

291
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,144
IT'S OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

292
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,479
YOU'RE HERE RIGHT NOW, ANEW.

293
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,149
AND THAT'S
ALL I NEED TO KNOW.

294
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,110
LYLE.

295
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,907
(Gasps)

296
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,827
(Grunts)
WHAT THE?

297
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,580
ANEW.
ANEW, ANEW!

298
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,581
ANEW!

299
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,249
(Gasps)

300
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,043
UH...
WHAT DID I...

301
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,421
DON'T FADE OUT LIKE THAT
WHEN WE'RE KISSING!

302
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,173
OH, SORRY.

303
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,682
ENEMY SHIP LOCATED.
INFORM THE FLEET.

304
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,058
THAT'S OUR DEAR REVIVE!

305
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,269
YOU'RE LIKE A DOG
SNIFFING OUT A BONE!

306
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,562
WHAT WAS THAT?

307
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,355
JUST EXPRESSING MY GRATITUDE.

308
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,905
Liu Mei:
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM NENA TRINITY?

309
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,239
Hong Long:
NOTHING YET.

310
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,241
USELESS LITTLE GIRL.

311
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,367
(Gasps)

312
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,710
MY MISTRESS.

313
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,836
THIS IS IT!

314
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,837
HUH?

315
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,255
DEAR BROTHER,

316
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,466
SET THE SHIP'S COURSE

323
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,233

324
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,404

ROGER!
HALEVY UNIT, TAKING OFF!

333
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,520
IT'S BEEN FINE‐TUNED
TO PERFECTION.

334
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,399
I'VE EVEN IMPROVED THAT SYSTEM
YOU CALL "THE SECRET".

335
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,733
THEREFORE‐‐

336
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,112
DON'T SAY IT.

337
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,365
I KNOW WHAT HAS TO BE DONE.

338
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,118
Feldt:
VISUAL SENSORS ARE DETECTING
MOBILE SUIT TEAMS!

COMBAT AIRSPACE.

340
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,330

JUST DO WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO!

343
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,503
Feldt:
MILEINA, THAT'S TOO CASUAL!

344
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,505
SETSUNA,
HOW'S YOUR SHOULDER FEELING?

345
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,966
HMM,
IT'S DOING ALL RIGHT.

346
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,301
Lyle:
ANEW.

347
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,595
HMM? WHAT'S UP?

348
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,054
NEVER MIND.

349
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,889
IT'S NOTHING IMPORTANT.

350
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,475
(Gasps)

351
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,852
ARE YOU HEADING OUT?

352
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,687
YES, OF COURSE.

353
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,941
OKAY THEN.

354
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,484
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

355
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,821
WE'VE DETECTED A TOTAL OF 12
A‐LAWS MOBILE SUITS APPROACHING.

356
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,740
THAT'S SURPRISINGLY LOW.

357
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,991
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

358
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,409
THIS IS OUR CHANCE!

359
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,495
THERE'S AN INNOVATOR
AMONG THE ENEMY FORCES!

360
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,332
(Gasps)

361
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,675
SO, SAJI CROSSROAD.

362
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:59,055
I NOTICED THAT LOUISE'S MACHINE
IS WITH THE A‐LAWS FORCES.

363
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,350
WE'VE BEEN RUNNING AWAY FROM THE
ENEMY FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS

364
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,311
TO RECOVER
OUR FIGHTING STRENGTH.

365
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,730
BUT WE'RE GONNA STAND AND
FIGHT NOW, AREN'T WE?

366
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,482
YEAH.

367
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,901
ARE YOU GONNA SHOOT LOUISE DOWN?

368
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,736
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

369
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,196
HUH?

370
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,948
DESTRUCTION ISN'T THE ONLY THING
THAT BATTLES CAN BRING.

371
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,451
THEY CAN ALSO CREATE THINGS.

372
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,578
I BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE.

373
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,748
I THINK OUR GUNDAMS ARE CAPABLE
OF DOING THAT.

374
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:30,544
THE REST IS UP TO YOU.

375
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,754
LISTEN,

376
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,506
I CAN'T PULL A TRIGGER.

377
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,591
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

378
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,094
ALL I CAN DO IS
KEEP TRYING TO REACH LOUISE.

379
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,471
I UNDERSTAND.

380
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,223
BUT EVEN SO,

381
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,516
I'LL TRY...

382
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,434
I'LL TRY.

383
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,270
LET'S GO SEE LOUISE HALEVY.
