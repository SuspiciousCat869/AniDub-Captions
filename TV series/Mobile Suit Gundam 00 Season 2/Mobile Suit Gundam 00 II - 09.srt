00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,197
AND HE'S THE MAN
WHO TOOK LOCKON'S LIFE.

161
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,699
THIS ALI AL‐SAACHEZ...

162
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,825
(Both gasp)

163
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,161
I WANT TO HEAR
ALL THE DETAILS.

164
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,544
Operator 1:
SECOND LIEUTENANT SMIRNOV
AND WARRANT OFFICER HALEVY

165
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,046
ARE SAFELY ABOARD, MA'AM.

166
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,255
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE.

167
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,257
PLEASE CONTINUE.

168
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,593
CONSIDERING THE POINT
WHERE WE LOST THE GUNDAMS,

169
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,596
THE TIME THAT'S PASSED
AND THEIR SHIP'S SPEED...

170
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,516
WE ESTIMATE THAT IT'S MOVING
ALONG THE OCEAN FLOOR

171
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,476
SOMEWHERE IN THIS REGION.

172
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,854
MY TEAM WILL SURROUND THE AREA
WITH SIX TRILOBITES,

173
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,482
AND LAUNCH AN ATTACK AS SOON AS
IT'S DISCOVERED.

174
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,359
AND HAVE YOU
SECURED THE AIRSPACE?

175
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,444
I FEEL THAT TWO TEAMS
OF MOBILE SUITS

176
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,029
SHOULD BE
MORE THAN ENOUGH.

177
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,781
AFTER ALL, THE CHANCES
OF THEM EVEN GETTING OUT

178
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,324
OF THE OCEAN ARE SLIM.

179
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,245
RESPECTFULLY, I DISAGREE
WITH YOUR TACTICS HERE.

180
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,038
AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

181
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,123
THAT SHIP CAME DOWN TO THE
EARTH'S SURFACE

182
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,417
BY BREAKING THROUGH
THE ATMOSPHERE ON ITS OWN.

183
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,545
I'D ASSUME THE OPPOSITE
IS ALSO POSSIBLE.

184
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,004
IT CAN'T BE DONE!

185
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,673
THAT THEORY
MAKES SENSE.

186
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,925
THE GUNDAMS' GN DRIVES HAVE
SOMETHING CALLED

187
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,386
A TRANS AM SYSTEM
THAT RELEASES LARGE AMOUNTS

188
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,513
OF HIGHLY COMPRESSED PARTICLES
ALL AT ONCE.

189
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,723
IF THEY MAKE USE OF IT,
THEN POSSIBLY‐‐

190
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,809
I RECOMMEND THAT WE
CONTACT OUR FORCES

191
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,312
DEPLOYED IN
GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT.

192
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,606
SINCE IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY THE
ENEMY IS GOING TO BE READY

193
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,317
FOR THE PREDICTABLE TACTICS
THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED‐‐

194
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,652
THE AUDACITY!

195
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,863
YOU DARE MOCK
A SUPERIOR OFFICER?

196
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,823
YOU SHOULD KNOW
I HAVE A LICENSE.

197
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,366
YOU HAVE A WHAT?

198
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,953
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE
A ONE‐MAN ARMY AS WELL?

199
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,746
BUT UNLIKE MISTER BUSHIDO...

200
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,707
I PROMISE I WILL BE
MORE THAN HAPPY

201
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,667
TO FOLLOW YOUR TACTICS,
COLONEL.

202
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,294
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
TO HEAR THAT.

203
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,297
(Frustrated grunting)

204
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,341
I SEE. TO AVENGE THE DEATHS
OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS,

205
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,468
MY BROTHER WENT UP
AGAINST THIS AL‐SAACHEZ.

206
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,720
(Laughing)

207
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,263
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

208
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,433
PLACING REVENGE BEFORE
REFORMING THE WORLD...

209
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,518
THAT SOUNDS LIKE MY
BROTHER ALL RIGHT.

210
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,978
GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

211
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,647
NO. I RESPECT
HIM FOR IT.

212
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,151
BUT OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE
KILLED OVER TEN YEARS AGO.

213
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:37,113
I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN
BROODING OVER WHAT HAPPENED.

214
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,407
Setsuna:
EVEN IF THE ONE RESPONSIBLE IS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?

215
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,783
SAY WHAT?

216
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,038
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

217
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,373
I WAS A MEMBER
OF THE KPSA...

218
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,250
THE TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION THAT TOOK

219
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,835
YOUR PARENTS AND LITTLE
SISTER FROM YOU.

220
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,337
(Shocked)
HMM?

221
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,671
(Tense breath)

222
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,132
SETSUNA‐‐
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL HIM THIS.

223
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,635
HE NEEDS TO HEAR THIS.

224
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,136
OF COURSE I AM.

225
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,388
I'M GOING TO CARRY OUT
MY DUTY IN THE NAME OF GOD.

226
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,723
NO, YOU CAN'T!
YOU'LL DIE!

227
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,392
WHAT'S WRONG?
ARE YOU AFRAID OF DYING?

228
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,811
THAT'S A BLASPHEMY
AGAINST GOD!

229
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,605
(Licking)

230
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,943
Al‐Saachez:
THIS BATTLE...IS A HOLY WAR
IN THE NAME OF GOD...

231
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,655
WE SHALL STRIKE DOWN THE
INFIDELS WHO DISRESPECT

232
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:23,159
OUR TRADITIONS AND LAY WASTE
TO THE LAND OF GOD.

233
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,745
(Boom)

234
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,960
(Horrified gasp)

235
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,714
Setsuna:
IF ONLY I'D STOPPED
MY COMRADE THEN...

236
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,174
LOCKON...

237
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,593
OR, I SHOULD SAY,
NEIL DYLANDY...

238
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,428
WOULD NEVER HAVE
BECOME A MEISTER.

239
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,013
SETSUNA...

240
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,432
EVEN IF YOU HAD STOPPED
HIM AT THAT TIME,

241
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,893
THE TERRORISM
WOULD HAVE CONTINUED.

242
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,396
A STREAM OF EVENTS
THAT WAS INEVITABLE.

243
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,438
YES, BUT‐‐

244
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,399
IT'S ALL IN THE PAST NOW.

245
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,776
THERE'S NO POINT
IN DWELLING ON WHAT HAPPENED.

246
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,278
IT'S TRUE,
WE CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST,

247
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,197
BUT WE CAN STILL FIGHT
FOR THE FUTURE.

248
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,824
(Gasping)

249
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,128
STRIVING IN ACCORDANCE
WITH MY OWN SENSE OF JUSTICE.

250
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,548
BUT WILL THAT LEAD US
TO THE FUTURE?

251
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,301
WILL OPPOSING THE INNOVATORS
LEAD US TO THE REAL FUTURE?

252
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,233
SO IT'S TRUE, YOU ARE WORKING ON
DEVELOPING NEW MODELS.

253
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,277
HELLO, GRA‐‐

254
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,653
OH, WAIT...

255
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,864
YOU GO BY MISTER BUSHIDO NOW,
DON'T YOU?

256
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,490
THEY JUST LIKE TO
CALL ME THAT.

257
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,367
BIG FUSS OVER NOTHING, REALLY.

258
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,703
I GOT THE IMPRESSION
YOU LIKED THE NAME.

259
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,997
SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU TO
MY OFFICE TODAY?

260
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,167
I CAME TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON
BECOMING HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT.

261
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,626
WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT.

262
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,961
ONE OTHER THING...

263
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,797
I WANTED TO HAVE
YOUR PROTOTYPE MACHINE...

264
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,800
TAILORED TO MY
PERSONAL COLORS.

265
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,012
I GET THE SENSE THAT'S THE REAL
REASON YOU CAME TO VISIT ME.

266
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,598
SO WHAT ARE
YOUR PERSONAL COLORS?

267
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,808
I WANT THIS MACHINE TO BE
THE FASTEST EVER

268
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,852
AND POSSESS THE
STRONGEST SWORD.

269
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,313
CONSIDER IT TAKEN CARE OF.

270
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,191
BUT IN EXCHANGE,
I WANT YOU TO SWEAR TO ME...

271
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,401
THAT YOU'LL DESTROY
CELESTIAL BEING.

272
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,070
(Gasps)
BUT OF COURSE.

273
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,031
THESE DAYS DESTRUCTION IS
THE ONLY THING I LIVE FOR.

274
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,365
HMM.

275
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,410
COME TO THINK OF IT, YOUR
TEAM SHOULD BE JUST BEGINNING

276
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,245
AN OPERATION RIGHT NOW.

277
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,498
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN
FLEET BATTLES.

278
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,792
YOU SEE THEIR
STRATEGIES THAT CLEARLY?

279
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,377
I'VE BEEN DEVELOPING
MY MIND'S EYE.

280
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,300
Operator 2:
ALL MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
HAVE LAUNCHED.

281
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,552
Operator 1:
ALL TRILOBITES MACHINES
HAVE MADE THEIR ENTRY

282
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,304
INTO THE SEARCH
AREA, MA'AM.

283
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,765
RIGHT. THE OPERATION
WILL COMMENCE

284
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,975
ONCE WE'VE
LOCATED THE ENEMY SHIP.

285
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,394
I'D LIKE IT ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT I HAVE NOTHING

286
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,438
TO DO WITH THIS
OPERATION AS IT STANDS.

287
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,981
IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANT IT.

288
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,108
HMM.

289
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,028
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PROUD,
COLONEL!

290
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,366
THAT MUST BE THE GADESSA...

291
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,368
YET ANOTHER NEW MODEL.

292
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,371
WHAT KIND OF BUDGET AND MANPOWER
ARE THE A‐LAWS WORKING WITH?

293
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:20,503
WELL THEN, THE QUESTION IS HOW
WILL YOU REACT, CELESTIAL BEING?

294
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,260
YOU HAVEN'T FILED A REPORT
WITH SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA,

295
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,678
HAVE YOU TIERIA?

296
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:34,016
WELL... I'M STILL ORGANIZING
MY THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW.

297
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,727
TELL ME MORE ABOUT
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER.

298
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,148
WHAT IS THIS
TWISTEDNESS YOU FOUND?

299
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,524
IT'S...

300
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,817
(Troubled sigh)

301
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,194
(Voices echoing)

302
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,780
Regene:
BUT REFORM IS NEVER PAINLESS.

303
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,491
DO YOU THINK WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
DOING IS HARMLESS?

304
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,327
Lockon:
DON'T SQUEEZE YOURSELF INTO A
SPECIFIC MOLD LIKE THAT.

305
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,164
Regene:
ALL OF US WERE CREATED
FOR THE SAKE OF THE PLAN.

306
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,915
Lockon:
I MEAN AFTER ALL...
OLD MAN AEOLIA

307
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,001
ENTRUSTED THE GUNDAMS
TO US, RIGHT?

308
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,503
Regene:
YOU PEOPLE... HAVE BECOME
OBSTACLES TO AEOLIA'S PLAN.

309
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,297
I JUST DON'T‐‐

310
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,798
(Alarm buzzes)

311
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,051
Feldt:
SIX ENEMY UNDERWATER
MOBILE ARMORS CONFIRMED!

312
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,554
ALL HANDS TO
PRIMARY BATTLE STATIONS!

313
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,722
WE'LL TALK LATER!

314
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,182
RIGHT!

315
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,435
ENEMY IS CLOSING IN AND
PREPARING TO ENCIRCLE PTOLEMY!

316
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,020
Sumeragi:
ESTIMATE TIME UNTIL ATTACK.

317
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,147
Mileina:
0024!

318
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,982
THE ENEMY
ACCURATELY PREDICTED

319
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,358
WE'D BE OVER THE
EQUATOR RIGHT NOW.

320
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,736
THAT'S NOT BAD.

321
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,529
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO TO HELP OUT?

322
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,281
Sumeragi:
SIT IN THE
AUXILIARY CHAIRS.

323
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,824
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET
A BIT ROUGH.

324
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,075
LASSE.

325
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,535
ROGER THAT.

326
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,706
Lasse:
PTOLEMY... ENTERING RAPID
SURFACING MODE.

327
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,875
AHHHHHHHHHH!

328
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,546
HEADING TO SPACE WHILE THE
MIDDLE EAST IS IN CHAOS...

329
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,882
JUST SO WE CAN GET AWAY
FROM THE A‐LAWS.

330
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,931
0004 LEFT UNTIL THE ESTIMATED
TIME OF ATTACK, MISS SUMERAGI!

331
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,433
NOT JUST YET.
TRY TO LURE THEM IN CLOSER.

332
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,310
Feldt:
ENEMY FORCES
TAKING ACTION!

333
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,520
Feldt:
THEY'RE HEAVY TORPEDOES!

334
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,397
ARIOS! CHERUDIM! SERAVEE!

335
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,982
INITIATE TRANS‐AM!

336
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,901
ROGER THAT!
TRANS‐AM!

337
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,114
Sumeragi:
INCREASE GN FIELD
TO MAXIMUM OUTPUT!

338
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,075
PTOLEMY,
BEGIN EMERGENCY ASCENT!

339
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,284
RIDE THE EXPLOSIONS!

340
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,703
HERE WE GO!

341
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,624
(Boom)

342
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,668
(Mileina screaming)

343
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,879
CHANGE PTOLEMY OVER
TO FLIGHT MODE!

344
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,472
THE ENEMY SHIP HAS
SURFACED AT HIGH SPEED!

345
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,057
IT'S STILL HEADING UP!

346
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,601
A‐ARE THEY TRYING TO BREAK OUT
OF THE ATMOSPHERE?

347
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,395
THEY'RE FASTER THAN
I PREDICTED.

348
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,815
THE TRILOBITE ATTACK MUST HAVE
BOOSTED THEIR INITIAL VELOCITY.

349
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,150
CALCULATE THE SHIP'S
ASCENSION ROUTE!

350
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,903
HMM...

351
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,699
WHAT...INCREDIBLE SPEED!

352
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,534
SHIPS DON'T MOVE THAT FAST!

353
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,411
COMMENCE INTERCEPTION!

354
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,704
Andrei:
ROGER!

355
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,211
OUR WEAPONS ARE USELESS!

356
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,713
Feldt:
ALL GUNPORTS OPEN!

357
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,172
FIRE A BARRAGE!

358
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,095
DAMN IT...

359
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,722
NOT AGAIN!

360
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,017
STOP RUNNING...

361
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,560
CELESTIAL BEING!

362
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,233
WHAT AN INCREDIBLY
BOLD STRATEGY!

363
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,776
IT MUST BE‐‐

364
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,361
Operator 1:
WE'VE CALCULATED THEIR
INTENDED ORBIT, MA'AM!

365
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,030
CAPTAIN REVIVAL!

366
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,744
Revive:
I ONLY NEED TO CHANGE THEIR
ANGLE OF ASCENT

367
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,287
BY THREE DEGREES.

368
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,081
FORTUNATELY THAT WON'T BE MUCH
OF A PROBLEM FOR MY GADESSA!

369
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,460
(Blast)

370
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,754
(Screaming)

371
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,255
A DIRECT HIT?!

372
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,548
Peries:
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

373
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,886
WE'VE PASSED
THE 600 KILOMETER MARK!

374
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,072
Lasse:
A LITTLE BIT MORE AND WE'RE OUT
OF THE ATMOSPHERE!

375
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,268
(Rapid beeping)

376
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,270
OUR ASCENT ANGLE'S
BEEN CHANGED!

377
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,397
THE ENEMY COMMANDER IS
REALLY GOOD!

378
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,442
WE'VE JUST REACHED THE END
OF THE FIRST SEQUENCE.

379
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,112
AND THE ENEMY'S TRANS AM SYSTEM
HAS A FIXED TIME LIMIT.

380
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,490
THE REST IS UP TO
COLONEL ZHEJIANG.

381
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,539
Feldt:
PTOLEMY IS AT 10000 KILOMETERS.
NOW PASSING LOWER ORBITAL RING.

382
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,375
ATTACK FROM ENEMY FORCES!

383
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,876
NO WAY! AN AMBUSH?!

384
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,212
WE JUST EXCEEDED THE
TRANS‐AM'S TIME LIMIT!

385
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,758
WE'RE GONNA LOSE THE GN FIELD
UNTIL IT RECHARGES!

386
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,177
(Yelling)

387
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,721
Mileina: (Gasping)
THE OUTER HULL IS TAKING HITS!

388
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,306
HOW MANY ARE THERE?

389
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,684
ENEMY CONSISTS OF ONE CRUISER
ESCORTED BY SIX MOBILE SUITS!

390
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,728
OKAY...

391
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,398
THEIR STRENGTH IS
WITHIN MY FORECAST.

392
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,566
THE ENEMY HAS USED UP ITS
PARTICLE SUPPLY...

393
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,151
HIT IT WITH
EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!

394
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,824
WHAT... WHAT WAS THAT?

395
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,784
Operator 3:
ENEMY MOBILE SUIT
APPROACHING!

396
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,954
Operator 3:
IT'S A GUNDAM!

397
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,539
THEY HAD REINFORCEMENTS?

398
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,791
NO, THAT SUIT IS DIFFERENT.

399
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,460
DID THEY... PULL OFF AN
EMERGENCY LAUNCH

400
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,213
WHILE THEY WERE
ESCAPING THE ATMOSPHERE?

401
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,882
I'LL CRUSH THEIR MOTHER SHIP
WITH ONE BLAST!

402
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,470
Setsuna:
00... ELIMINATING TARGET!

403
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,724
(Frightened gasp)

404
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,564
Mileina:
ENEMY SHIP HAS BEEN DESTROYED!

405
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,607
Feldt:
FOUR MOBILE
SUITS REMAINING...

406
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,568
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE RETREATING!

407
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,361
YOU READ THEM PERFECTLY!

408
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,821
SOMEHOW WE MADE IT.

409
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,202
HUH?

410
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,079
MISS SUMERAGI.

411
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,499
AN ENEMY MOBILE SUIT HAS SENT US
A MESSAGE VIA VISUAL SIGNAL.

412
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,126
IT'S TRYING TO COMMUNICATE?

413
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,294
WHAT'S IT WANT?

414
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,879
SHOULD I READ
THE MESSAGE?

415
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,755
PLEASE DO.

416
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,966

00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,078
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

I KEEP TRYING BUT
I CAN'T SEEM TO BREAK FREE...

(Heavy sigh)

432
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,075
COLONEL ZHEJIANG
HAS BEEN KILLED IN ACTION...

433
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,998
HMM...I CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP
MAKING SUCH SACRIFICES.

434
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:40,085
I HAVE NO CHOICE

ITS MODEL NUMBER

IT'S CALLED
THE 0‐RAISER.
