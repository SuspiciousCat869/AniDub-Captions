display of force!

332
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,375
Such utter destruction!

333
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,875
With that attack,
Starjohn secures victory!

334
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,291
Starjohn will advance
to the second round!

335
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,958
[CROWD cheers]

336
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,875
He stays on the move
until the very last minute,

337
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,083
wearing his foe down
the whole time.

338
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,625
And then, Zeus' final blow.

339
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,708
He walks away unscathed,

340
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,666
with his opponent
absolutely defeated.

341
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,583
[VAHATON] Hm... I can't say I
much admire the way he fights,

342
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,166
not the slightest bit.

343
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,416
Maybe, but a win is
still a win, is it not?

344
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,125
How you win is of
no consequence.

345
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,916
Thanks, guys.

346
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,750
You all did the best you could.
I truly appreciate it.

347
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,666
[footsteps]

348
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,500
Uh?

349
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,416
You know what?

350
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,625
No matter how hard I try, I'll
never be like you, Mister.

351
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,833
Let's face it.

352
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,375
I'd have to be a born loser!

353
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,541
So I guess, I can't
become a wimpy,

354
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,375
pathetic, embarrassing excuse
for a Dragon Caller.

355
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,416
It's just not in my cards.

356
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,125
[growls]

357
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,333
[STARJOHN]
Let's go, Zeus.

358
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:46,291
[STARJOHN]
Oh, one more thing.

359
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,916
Don't ever come back here again.

360
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,958
[gasping]

361
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,541
Starjohn.

362
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,375
Ladies and Gentlemen!

363
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,250
This ends the first round
of the Battle Cup!

364
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,625
After a short break, the second
round of matches will begin!

365
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,791
[GARNET]
What's up, you guys?

366
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,333
Sorry to keep you waiting.

367
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,958
All-star performer Garnet,
at your service!

368
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,458
Be sure to keep your eyes peeled
for my shiny new Soul Armor!

369
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,458
Next time: "Valkyrie Awakens."

370
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,333
I'm going to win this
tournament for sure!
