00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,666
[NUDO] It was on our radar
until it fell to 16 feet

162
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,375
above sea level.

163
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,791
That was when the
observation post in Cape Horai

164
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,333
reported spotting a uniquely
massive water column.

165
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,708
[COMMANDER YAMAKI] So what
does this information tell us?

166
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,541
That this particular meteor
was anything but ordinary.

167
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,708
Shall we notify the mayor?

168
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,833
He wouldn't know what to do
with the information if we did.

169
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,000
I've already reported
the abnormal Drop readings

170
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,625
to the man, but he
didn't seem to care.

171
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,833
Once the people have
actually seen the danger,

172
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,541
they'll learn to fear.

173
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,125
[sighs] And judging by the
energy response on our sensors,

174
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,583
they won't have
to wait for long.

175
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,041
[NUDO] The Sci-Techs
are making solid progress.

176
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,333
They're certainly
earning their funding.

177
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,041
We should be able to show it
on screen in the near future.

178
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,583
Make it our top priority.

179
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,583
[phone rings]

180
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,458
[COMMANDER YAMAKI]
What's wrong?

181
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,750
It's the final report from
the captain of the patrol boat.

182
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,500
According to him,
a Dragon Caller,

183
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,291
along with his sea-dragon-type
monster were seen searching

184
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,416
for the meteor's landing site.

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,333
[HARU] But it may be something
I just kinda grow into.

186
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,041
[ACE] I've been seeing more
and more of them recently.

187
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,625
[VOICE]
Ace!

188
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,791
[gasps]

189
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,750
Here! For helping me.

190
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,875
Thank you.

191
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,916
Hey... Has Happy ever,
like, spoken to you?

192
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,583
[HARU]
Hmm... Huh.

193
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,083
[ACE]
What's up?

194
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,875
Well, the good news is at
least you don't have a fever.

195
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,541
[ACE] Yeah, I could've
told you that!

196
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,125
Tell me, how long has the
patient been hearing voices?

197
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,458
Do they tell you to burn things?

198
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,708
Ugh. Just forget it.

199
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,791
No way!

200
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,125
Uh, yes way.

201
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,208
[HARU] This is so exciting!
I can't believe it!

202
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,125
Happy, come with me!
Hold these, Ace!

203
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,000
[grunting]

204
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,791
Whaddaya think you're doing?!

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,916
[HARU]
Excuse me!

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,208
You're Mr. Lance, aren't you?
You're so cool!

207
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,833
What brings you to Vienna City?

208
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:03,958
So that's Lance?

209
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,208
They call him the
Crown Prince of Ice!

210
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,833
That's awesome!

211
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,666
[ACE]
He's famous?

212
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,833
Is he a Dragon Caller?

213
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,125
And guess what? I'm trying
to be a Dragon Caller, too!

214
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,291
Like her?
This is my cat, Happy!

215
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,958
Do you think she has what it
takes to work with

216
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,500
a hotshot Dragon Caller
such as yourself?

217
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,625
This guy's exceedingly annoying!

218
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,750
Calm down!

219
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,958
You have the wrong guy.

220
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,083
Devi.

221
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,666
--[DEVI] Devi!
--[HARU gasps]

222
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,666
Wait... Mr. Lance...
He really is as cold as ice...

223
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,791
--So cool!
--[HAPPY screeches]

224
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,250
What's wrong, Master?

225
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,416
[LANCE]
Nothing.

226
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,958
[ACE]
That guy's just a show off.

227
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,250
[VOICE]
Ace!

228
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,416
[gasps]

229
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,083
Now that's an egg.

230
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,541
[LENA]
Thanks! See you soon!

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,083
[gasps]

232
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,041
Hey there!
Where have you been?

233
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,541
Haru is furious!

234
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,208
She said you abandoned her
on your little date-- [gasps]

235
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,708
Oh? Yeah, right.
But that wasn't a date.

236
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,291
[LENA]
And what have you got there?

237
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,583
U-Uh... [chuckles]

238
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,500
Oh, this? It's nothing.

239
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,500
[LENA growls softly]
Inside now, mister.

240
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,750
[ACE]
Yes, ma'am...

241
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,916
[ACE] She said she was gonna
buy me some ice cream

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,166
as a thank you.

243
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,500
You can't really call
that a date, can you?

244
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,833
I don't think that's the most
pressing issue here,

245
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,916
is it, Ace?

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,416
Y-Yeah? Okay, what's up?

247
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,041
Huh? [gasps]

248
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,750
Oh, wow!
Where'd that come from?

249
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,083
Talk about bizarre!

250
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,333
What is it?

251
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,916
Don't play dumb!

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,416
[laughs] I found it floating in
the ocean, near the breakwater.

253
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,375
I've never seen
anything like it!

254
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,375
[gasps softly]

255
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,083
[ACE]
Wonder what'll hatch.

256
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,583
[LENA]
N-O spells no, mister!

257
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,666
It might've been
my imagination,

258
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,958
but I could've sworn I heard
it calling out my name!

259
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,041
We're running a
café slash grill--

260
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,291
there's no way we
can keep a pet here.

261
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,458
Do you get what I'm saying?

262
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,375
Yes, ma'am...

263
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,333
[LENA] Now take it back
where you found it, okay?

264
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,375
[ACE] I was really hoping
I could keep it.

265
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,375
[KING] We can go
find monsters together,

266
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,625
once you're a little
older, I promise.

267
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,083
[ACE]
I wish...

268
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,708
[gasps]

269
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,375
This guy's about to hatch!
What should I do?!

270
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,500
Am I supposed to try to
keep it warm, or--?

271
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,750
[gasps]
Huh?

272
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,916
Drops?

273
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,833
[roars]

274
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,583
[OPERATOR A]
Drop Impact confirmed, sir!

275
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,958
[OPERATOR B] Scanners indicate
it's a dragon-type monster.

276
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,125
Located two clicks
north of area B-9.

277
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,125
Then let's try to keep
him out of the city!

278
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,958
Deploy gates B-8
through 10!

279
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,750
It's exactly like
Adjutant Nudo predicted.

280
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,750
DFS Barrier! Activate!

281
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,708
[COMMANDER YAMAKI]
Your foresight comes in handy

282
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,291
once again.

283
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,083
The evacuation of the remaining
residents is in its final phase.

284
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,500
Once we've been given the
green light to stage an attack

285
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,916
against the creature with live
ammunition, it could get messy.

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,250
Just make sure that
no civilians are harmed

287
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,458
in the operation.
That would be unacceptable.

288
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,833
Understood, sir. I'll be in
the command center preparing.

289
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,208
Collateral damage to
the surrounding structures

290
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:32,083
seems unavoidable,
wouldn't you say?

291
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,333
Which could affect the
mayor's next election.

292
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,458
Your words, not mine.

293
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,541
Yes, of course, Commander.

294
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,958
[SDF B] Please head to the
central plaza for evacuation.

295
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,041
There's food and water...

296
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,666
This is the final
group to evacuate!

297
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,333
[SOLDIER E] Good! Time to
leave it to the SVO team.

298
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,833
We've been given orders
to fall back

299
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,583
to Rally Point Bravo as well.

300
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,083
[CO A]
Let's get moving!

301
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,291
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

302
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
[ACE]
What's going on down there?

303
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,958
Target moving out from B-3!

304
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,708
AFS Tank 2!
It's moving towards you!

305
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,375
Can you see it?

306
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,625
It's closing in!

307
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,333
Where? I don't see--

308
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,500
[grunts]

309
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,208
Target sighted!

310
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,666
[TANK COMMANDER A]
Astro-Particle Cannon! Fire!

311
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,875
We knocked it down, sir!

312
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,916
Good! Turn on the Anti-Rave!

313
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,708
[LANCE] Hmph.
Guess his element's fire.

314
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,333
[DEVI]
It's just a stray, Devi!

315
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,041
The big oaf doesn't even
have control over himself!

316
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,125
[LANCE] You're right.
Let's show him the way back.

317
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,708
--[ACE] Hey, show-off!
--[DEVI] Devi?

318
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,583
Make him stop right now!

319
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,166
Using monsters
to wreck the place,

320
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,041
what's the matter with you?!

321
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,291
Devi.

322
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,208
Yeah, the kid's got our egg!

323
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,041
[ACE] Well?
Why don'tcha say something?

324
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,583
Whatever you do, don't
let it out of your sight.

325
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,500
[DEVI]
Devi!

326
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,541
[ACE]
Wait! Come back!

327
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,458
[DEVI]
Hey, listen!

328
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,208
And just you might
learn a thing or two!

329
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,125
Now pay attention, Devi!

330
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,833
Don't be afraid. I've come
to ease your pain--

331
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:01,666
I'll be quick.

332
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,166
[yells]

333
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,916
[LANCE]
Calling my monster allies.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,791
I command you by
our ancient agreement,

335
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,583
and the right granted
by my blood.

336
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,750
Unleash your might on
my enemy and bring him down!

337
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,166
Release!

338
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,541
[roars]

339
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,708
[roars]

340
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,833
Is that monster with
the Dragon Caller?

341
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,250
It is indeed!

342
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,791
He absorbed the Drops!

343
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,333
Right! He transferred
Drop Power to it.

344
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,000
[gasps] Wait,
you can see them, Devi?!

345
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,625
[screeches]

346
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,958
Game over.
It's time for you to leave.

347
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,958
Idiot.

348
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,541
Here we go--

349
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,958
[gasps]

350
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,583
Well, that's no good, Devi!

351
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,291
What's no good?

352
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,958
[DEVI] There aren't enough
Water Drops to pull from!

353
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,166
Drops come from the
elements found in nature,

354
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,208
but the boss is surrounded
by a bunch of buildings

355
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,708
and energy shields!

356
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,541
[ACE]
So... he needs more Water Drops?

357
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,416
[ACE]
Drops...

358
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,375
What are these?

359
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,875
[gasps]
That kid...

360
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:04,958
Did he do this? He formed these
Drops from that distance?

361
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,333
Huh...

362
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,791
Well, well...

363
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,500
Drop Surge!

364
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,875
[DEVI]
Five combos, Devi!

365
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,791
I knew there was more!
I'm coming, Boss!

366
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,541
Devi!

367
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,625
It's near.

368
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,166
Time for a good
old-fashioned Boss Fight!

369
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,166
[DEVI]
Armor Drop, ready!

370
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,583
[LANCE]
Prepare yourself, Devi!

371
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,750
That monster's gigantic!

372
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,541
Dragon Lord Zaerog Armor!

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,083
Cross-On!

374
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,791
[DEVI] Master Lance,
you were as cool as ever, Devi!

375
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,708
I can't wait to Cross-On
the Soul Armor, Bossman!

376
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,000
[VOICE] Yours truly will be
coming up huge, Tama!

377
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,500
[DEVI]
Who's "yours truly"?

378
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,583
[BOTH]
Next time:

379
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,875
--"Cross-On" Tama!
--"Cross-On" Devi!

380
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,041
[VOICE]
Ace'll lend a helping hand, too!
