I brought my
extra-special Studmon.

Be a dear, and give me
all you got, okay?

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,875
What's a Studmon?

36
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:14,000
Short for Stud-Monster.
Sounds more marketable that way.

37
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,666
Yeah, well, we have an entire
team of Studmons on our side!

So, think you can
win this, Ace?

Uh-huh! I just have
to defeat her.

Then I'll become a

00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,125
If his next strike hits us,
we're done for, Tama!

167
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,125
This battle isn't over yet.
Do you hear me?

168
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,666
Your team is still with you!

169
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,500
Yeah! With all of them
helping out, we can do this!

170
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,083
[TAMAZO] Count me in on
this next round, partner!

171
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,375
Okay, Cross-On, Tama!

172
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,791
Oh! Awesome!

173
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,958
Cute.

174
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,458
Cross-On!

175
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,708
[yells]

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,916
Your Soul Armor's skill
is ready! Activate it!

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,708
Now. Dark Dragon Knight, go!

178
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,708
[gasps]

179
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,750

00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,041
Way to go, Tama!

[gasps]

[OUKA grunts]

187
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,791
No! Ouka!

188
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,833
That was a big mistake!

189
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,791
[VAMPIRE LORD growls]

190
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,333
I won't let you! Gungnir Feast!

191
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,333
'Kay, let's go, Tamazo!

192
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,750
Armor Skill! Fire becomes wood!

193
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,833
Now!

[VAMPIRE LORD yells]

196
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,375
No! You can still
fight, can't you?!

197
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,958
Oh, come on,
you're embarrassing me!

198
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,458
I think we won.

199
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,458
We've passed the Guild's test.

200
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,708
[ACE] And I couldn't have
done it without you guys!

201
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,541
[OUKA squeaks]

202
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,291
[DARK DRAGON KNIGHT grunts]

203
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,208
You were brilliant!

204
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,166
You've really figured out how
to use your monster's powers!

205
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,916
[VAHATON] You've used your
Soul Armor's leader skill

206
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,833
to make the most out of your
Dragon-type monster's attacks.

207
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,916
And I especially liked the way
you and Tamazo worked together.

208
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,208
Nice!

209
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,375
Well, it was a total sink
or swim kinda thing.

210
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,125
And thank you. You really saved
my skin back there, Charo!

211
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,375
Ace...

212
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,875
[METAL]
Heartwarming!

213
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,958
This beautiful
affirmation of friendship

214
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,125
brings a tear to my eye!

215
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,000
Sadly, Ace is disqualified.

216
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,083
--[ACE] What?
--CHARO] Huh?

217
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,791
Disqualified? What for?

218
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,875
You heard the rules
in the beginning.

219
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,208
That was a one-on-one,
live or die battle, guys!

220
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,416
Your friends helping
you was very sweet,

221
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,041
but technically cheating.
So, you failed.

222
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,458
What?! But Ace is the one
who did all the fighting!

223
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,208
--Is he for real, Vahaton?!
--[CHARO sobs]

224
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,333
[VAHATON] If that's what the
rules say, then I suppose so.

225
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,875
Hey, you were one
step from the win.

226
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,416
Not bad for your first time.

227
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,208
That brings today's exam
to a close, and sadly,

228
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,291
no participants were
able to claim victory.

229
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,750
Without further ado, our
staff has come to escort

230
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,625
all non-members
from the premises!

231

[screaming]

233
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,416
Wait, what's up with these...?

234
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,791
I don't know but...
it ain't good...

235
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:04,875
[giggles] Better luck next time!
The door's that-a-way!

236
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,833
[ALL scream]

237
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,333
Until next time!

238
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,083
[GARNET]
Bye-bye, boys!

239
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,916
[rockets whistling]

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,916
[TAMAZO]
Ka-blooie! [laughs]

241
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,791
So you lost, huh?
Were you holding back

242
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,166
because he was a kid?

243
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,166
[MORGAN sighs] No, I planned
to play around with him

244
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,541
for a little while.

245
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,958
But those eyes... they
looked just the same as his.

246
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,333
So I had to take him seriously.

247
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,083
The flow of the Drops
is nice and gentle.

248
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,625
The Drop Impact
seems to have dissipated.

249
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,875
But we can't lower
our guards just yet.

250
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,375
Drop contamination is
causing these disturbances

251
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,250
to occur all around the world.

252
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:56,458
I'll go scope out the area.
You can go report to Vahaton.

253
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,875
[LANCE]
Hmph. Why do I have to?

254
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,833
I think he wants to see you.

255
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,125
You should visit him
once in a while.

256
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,708
[DEVI] Hah! Master Vahaton is
really counting on you,

257
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,166
isn't he, Master Lance?

258
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,125
It's almost as if
he thinks of you as

259
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,500
his actual son or
somethin', Devi.

260
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,958
[LANCE]
Quiet down.

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,291
[ANGENE] Quite beautiful today,
if I say so myself!

262
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,041
[VAHATON] Why, thank you!
I'm flattered.

263
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,541
Don't be silly, old man!
I was talking about the Drops.

264
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,916
I remember how it always
used to be like this.

265
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,125
The Drops had a
certain airiness to them,

266
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,541
which I found invigorating!

267
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,250
[VAHATON] Yes. Back when
we were both much younger.

268
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,583
Drops are the planet's energy
in a more tangible form.

269
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,416
They bring life to our world.
But now, they pose a threat.

270
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,333
It's as if the planet is
trying to tell us something.

271
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,041
We Ancients don't have
quite enough power to keep

272
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,583
the Drops under control like
we did back in the old days.

273
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,791
But there's still some hope!

274
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,375
The next generation
will take our place!

275
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:16,583
The Guild Dragon Callers--
and Ace, too!

276
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,750
[LANCE gasps]

277
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,625
Devi...

278
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,958
[VAHATON] King may have
disappeared long ago,

279
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,375
but he forged some
solid paths in his time.

280
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,875
He set an example for the other
Dragon Callers on how to live.

281
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,500
And I think young Ace is already
following in his footsteps!

282
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,375
Even though he apparently
failed the exam?

283
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,041
Think of it as an opportunity
for him to grow stronger.

284
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:45,125
[sighs] Well, I suppose it's
about time I was heading home.

285
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,000
Until next time.

286
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,833
Nice to see you again, Lance.

287
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
[VAHATON] Oh! Lance! You've
finally come back to visit me!

288
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,291
I don't need to follow
footsteps to find my way.

289
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,166
[VAHATON]
Oh, but Lance...

290
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,416
King abandoned his mission,
and then he disappeared.

291
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,833
We're in the middle of a crisis,

292
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,041
and this hero of yours
is nowhere to be found!

293
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,625
[VAHATON groans]

294
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,708
Dragonoids are more
than capable,

295
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,375
and we're actually here.

296
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,791
[DEVI]
We'll take our leave now, Devi.

297
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,708
Is this the tree
from the other day?

298
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:33,500
Yeah, that's right. This tree's
kinda like a memento of my dad.

299
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,750
[gasps]

300
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,500
I just have to plant
one and it'll grow?

301
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,416
[KING] I'll find the
perfect spot to plant it.

302
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,458
[ACE] It's proof my dad
remembered the promise

303
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,208
he made to me back then.

304
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,750
He planted the seed here for me.

305
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,500
Wow. That's pretty
cool. I can hardly believe

306
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,708
the thing's still standing after

307
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,750
that last monster
attack came through!

308
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,958
Even though I failed the exam,
I feel connected to my dad

309
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,666
through this tree,
and I know he'd be proud

310
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,375
of how far I've come.

311
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,500
It's like he's watching
over me, and believes in me.

312
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,750
[CHARO]
Mm-hmm. I believe in you!

313
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,041
Thanks, Charo.

314
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,166
[LANCE]
So this is where you've been.

315
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,541
[CHARO]
Lance...

316
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,958
Thanks for saving us
the other day.

317
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,458
[LANCE] Dragoza Island
is for dragonoids.

318
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,791
I'll do what it takes
to keep it safe.

319
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,666
You outsiders should
keep out of the way!

320
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,541
And you should mind
your manners!

321
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,083
Why do you dislike outsiders?

322
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,791
Keep quiet, kid!
You might learn something.

323
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,416
I'll explain it to you.

324
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,291
Master Lance is a
genuine dragonoid, Devi.

325
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,166
Which means he's not a
normal human being

326
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,541
like you and your friend are,
you understand?!

327
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,583
Dragonoid?

328
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,083
I'll have you know, Ace here is
not just any normal human being!

329
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,875
He's more of the
persistent, weakling kind!

330
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,458
I'd say you're being
something short

331
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,208
of charitable to Ace right now.

332
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,166
You wanna rumble,
you softboiled punk?!

333
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,041
I sure do,
burnt marshmallow!

334
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,458
Come. Let's go.

335
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,791
Wait a sec!
I'm not helpless, okay?

336
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,958
There's gotta be something I can
do that would help you out!

337
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,833
Of course. You can
go back to Vienna City.

338
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:04,708
[ACE]
What?!

339
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,458
Now stay outta my way.

340
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,500
Shoo, Devi.

341
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,583
Tama!

342
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,583
Where are you all going, huh?

343
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,375
[gasps] Grandma. I wanna
go learn more about our world.

344
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,208
And about the Drops--
how they work.

345
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,458
So I've decided to leave
Crocus and visit some

346
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,583
of the other areas to
further my training.

347
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,833
There's still a lot for me
to learn, so I'm going, too!

348
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,916
Tamazo, too, Tama!

349
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,125
Good luck, Ace. Your power
to control Drops is a gift,

350
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,250
always use it
to protect the innocent.

351
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,125
Keep that in mind wherever
your path takes you.

352
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,291
[ACE]
Hm.

353
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,291
[CHARO] I say we should
go somewhere a little bit

354
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:02,250
warmer next. How about we
make our way to the fire city?

355
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,750
Tama!

356
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,583
Oh! You're so soft and cuddly,
I'm gonna freaking die!

357
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,125
[ACE]
Ms. Herriot!

358
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,333
I brought this.
You left it behind.

359
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:17,791
[CHARO gasps] Thank you!
I was afraid that it was lost!

360
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,958
I'm sorry about
my little sister.

361
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,208
It might not seem like it,

362
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,791
but she's actually
pretty sweet at heart...

363
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,791
...I think.

364
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,333
You think, huh?

365
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,750
She might be a couple
screws loose upstairs,

366
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,625
but all in all
she's pretty good.

367
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,416
But even though I'm
her twin sister,

368
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,333
I still don't have any idea
what's going through her head.

369
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,333
You guys aren't alike in the
slightest, so it makes sense.

370
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,583
Yup.

371
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,750
Come take the exam
again sometime.

372
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,416
And, if you
really want training,

373
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,333
I've got plenty of
exercises to make you tough!

374
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,500
[BOTH laugh]
Thanks for your offer.

375
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,333
What's with the attitude?!
Harness your spirit!

376
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,833
Tama!

377
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,041
When she gets that
look in her eyes,

378
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,500
she's as scary as her twin!

379
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,666
[yells] Let's get
outta here, Tama!

380
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,958
Thanks! See you around!

381
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,791
[TAMAZO]
C'mon, Tama!

382
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,791
Thanks Ms. Harriet!
See ya later!

383
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,041
Show the world you got guts!
You hear me?!

384
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,125
[ACE, CHARO]
Yes, ma'am, we will!

385
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,416
[ACE] Here we are,
in the Fire City, Geyser!

386
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,958
What is the
Dragon Caller's mission?

387
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,291
Wait. A part-time job?
Are you kidding me?

388
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,750
Next time!
"A Man from Geyser."

389
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,208
Dragon Callers in Geyser
are hot with passion!
