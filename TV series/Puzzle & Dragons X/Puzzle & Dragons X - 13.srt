00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,791
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,791
there have been powerful
warriors who fought

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,833
against the various crises
that threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,375
They harnessed the
power of the monsters

5
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,916
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,750
They were: The Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,375
Dragon Callers are born
with the special power

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,041
to bridge the gap
between the realms of

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,125
nature, mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:39,750
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us,

11
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:43,250
the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters,

12
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,416
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,208
I was wondering if
I would see you guys.

14
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,166
Oh, yeah hey.

15
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,833
Who's this?

16
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,583
Hi, I'm Donny.

17
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,833
Apll right. It's time.

18
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,875
Let's get this
Guild Exam started!

19
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,125
I can't believe we're about
to take that first step

20
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,625
toward becoming full fledged
Guild Dragon Callers!

21
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,833
This'll be your first
time, right Charo?

22
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,791
This'll be Tiger's
eleventh time, tama.

23
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,333
Shut your face!

24
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,541
This is happening.
I'm about to take the exam.

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,083
[knocking]

26
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,041
It's me, the pop idol
Dragon Caller!

27
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,125
Garnet the triple-threat!

28
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:00,041
Welcome one and all to the
Guild Dragon Caller's exam!

29
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,583
[CROWD cheers]

30
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,416
I'm Herriot, and I'll
be supervising today.

31
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,666
So what do you say?

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,291
Do you guys wanna be
Guild Dragon Callers?

33
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,208
[CROWD cheers]

34
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,166
[HERRIOT]
Good!

35
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,166
Looks like you're all fired up!

36
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,833
[CROWD cheering]
Yeah!

37
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,875
Now then, will any
of you pass the test?

38
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,583
[HERRIOT] Question Number One:
A Guild Dragon Caller's duty

39
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:36,875
is to protect, maintain, and or
restore the balance of Drops.

40
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,625
True or False?

41
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,708
[ELDORA]
She's so lively!

42
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,083
I do love Herriot!

43
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,791
[JEST] The atmosphere does
appear rather cheerful.

44
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,500
[VAHATON laughs]

45
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,333
We have a pretty interesting
selection today.

46
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,666
To say the least. Do these
buffoons really think

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,583
they're fit to serve
in our Guild?

48
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,833
It's good to have people
with different points of view.

49
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,375
Yes, of course.

50
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,041
Still, don't these candidates
seem a bit unconventional.

51
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,375
To be a good Dragon Caller,

52
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,416
one must have knowledge
as well as power.

53
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,458
Neither "knowledge" nor
"power" come to mind

54
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,083
when I look at these
of candidates.

55
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,958
One cannot face
the world's crises

56
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,041
without both of
these attributes.

57
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,500
[DAFNES]
And they have them?

58
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,833
You must be joking.

59
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,583
[VAHATON laughs]
Don't be so quick to judge.

60
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,625
I'm looking forward to
what these young souls

61
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,958
might bring to the Guild.

62
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,375
[HERRIOT]
Question Three:

63
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,750
A Basudora leaves Geyser
at eleven thirty...

64
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,541
Hello, Lance.

65
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,333
Master?

66
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,500
The exam's prime task is to find
outstanding Dragon Callers

67
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,958
to bolster our ranks.

68
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,291
However, humans are a
comparatively weaker species.

69
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,250
We Dragonoids are the only ones
who can save this planet.

70
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,750
But Master Vahaton
seems to highly value

71
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,875
the abilities of King's son.

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,458
[VAHATON]
But there's still some hope!

73
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,250
The next generation
will take our place!

74
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,750
The Guild Dragon
Callers and Ace, too!

75
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,125
Can the humans
protect our planet?

76
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,583
Can they even protect Dragoza?

77
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,833
Naturally, I'm concerned.

78
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,250
Then I'll go and oversee.

79
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,000
You would do that for me?

80
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,125
[LANCE]
I will travel to Libria,

81
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:20,375
and see how tough these human
Dragon Callers really are.

82
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,708
[JEST]
I'm counting on you, Lance.

83
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,791
You're the Dragonoids'
last hope.

84
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,000
[GARNET]
All right!

85
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,708
Show's over, folks!

86
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,791
They should be done by now.

87
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,375
There, look!

88
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,541
[HERRIOT] Ha, ha. I had a pretty
good feeling about those three.

89
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,750
[MORGAN]
Oh! This is wonderful!

90
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,000
They survived long enough

91
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,708
to give me the chance to
defeat them personally!

92
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,125
I can hardly wait!
It's been way too long

93
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,583
since the last time I got
to put on my game face!

94
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,916
[MORGAN] Let's take
real good care of them.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,750
[MORGAN, HERRIOT laugh]

96
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,625
Congratulations on passing
the first stage of the test!

97
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,416
Oh boy, tama!

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,708
I feel like I used up an
entire year's worth of luck

99
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,041
in one afternoon!

100
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,875
I'm just psyched all three
of us actually passed.

101
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,250
Me too! I'm exhausted,
but thrilled!

102
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,000
It's still a bit early
to be thrilled, boys.

103
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,750
I suppose it's time
to jump right in

104
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,791
to the final portion
of the exam.

105
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,416
Here we go, guys.

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,208
Stay on guard. This test
is an anything goes fight

107
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,541
with a Guild Dragon Caller.

108
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,916
Best of luck!

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,375
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

110
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,208
[ACE, TIGER]
Hm?

111
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,041
[CHARO gasps]

112
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,833
[CHARY, ACE]
Ahh!

113
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,333
I knew it!

114
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,958
[MORGAN]
Hi!

115
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,958
[TIGER groans] I call dibs
on the stone cold fox

116
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,583
in the pink and purple outfit!

117
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,125
[MORGAN laughs]

118
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,125
Well, I guess that
totally proves that Tiger

119
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,583
is a terrible judge
of character.

120
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,750
Big time.

121
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,083
Uh? What're you goofballs
talkin' about?

122
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,833
Soon, you'll learn for yourself.

123
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,166
Since my twin sister Morgan
got to have all the fun

124
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,333
during the last exam,

125
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,875
it's only fair that I
get to play today!

126
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:01,916
Agreed?

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,208
What?!

128
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,041
No way! I wanna play!

129
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,083
I wanted to see how much
of a man he's become

130
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,000
since the last time we fought.

131
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,833
Somehow, I knew you
were gonna say that.

132
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,541
Let's settle this.

133
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,750
Very well.

134
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,416
There's only one way
to sort this out.

135
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,708
[HERRIOT, MORGAN grunt]

136
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,791
[MORGAN]
Rock, paper, scissors!

137
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,166
One more time! Shoot!

138
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,750
One more time! Shoot!

00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,333
And one more time! Shoot!

140
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,833
And one more time! Shoot!

141
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,500
[TAMAZO] This's how you
know they're twins...

142
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,958
[HERRIOT, MORGAN]
...shot!

143
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:35,833
[LANCE]
Heh.

144
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:36,958
[HERRIOT]
Huh?

145
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,208
That's Master Lance
for the win, devi!

146
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, come on!

147
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,541
I'll handle this fight,
if you don't mind.

148
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,291
Can he do that?!

149
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,708
[TORLIE]
Now, Lance. Hold on.

150
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,583
[DEVI]
A win is a win, devi!

151
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,416
He's supposed to be one of the
best Dragon Callers around.

152
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,041
Things are getting interesting.

153
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,041
But I wanted to
have a little fun!

154
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,416
Oh, what, really?

155
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,291
So our final test is a full
on battle against Lance?

156
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,041
Let's do this.

157
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:06,166
I'll take all of you rookies
down without breaking a sweat.

158
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,125
Wait, they have to
fight Lance now?

159
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,791
He's gonna pulverize them.

160
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,500
Looks like no one's gonna
pass this test, either.

161
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
What are you trying
to prove, Lance?

162
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,125
Humans aren't as powerful
as Dragonoids--

163
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,500
that's common knowledge.

164
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,458
Master Lance has never
been the kind of fighter

165
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,541
who holds back, devi.

166
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,291
Don't start now.
That would be a mistake.

167
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,458
[DEVI]
Devi?

168
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,833
[SONIA] That young man
has more potential

169
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,000
to be a great Dragon Caller
than many Dragonoids.

170
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,875
I'll be the judge of that.

171
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,708
I'm going to see if
they have what it takes

172
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,125
to carry this planet's future.

173
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,791
[ACE]
Lance.

174
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,791
[TAMAZO]
He's staring right at Ace, tama!

175
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,583
[grunts] This stinks.

176
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,041
Is he gonna try to kill us?

177
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,500
It's just a test!

178
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,875
I seriously doubt they'll
let him take things too far!

179
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,083
At least, y'know probably...

180
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,500
That's not reassuring!

181
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,916
Hey guys, listen up.
I've got a plan!

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,083
There were like, a dozen other
people out here today.

183
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,166
I think we should ask to borrow
their monsters for a minute,

184
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,875
and then just release
them all like a swarm!

185
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,125
Uh...

186
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,916
If we could gather about
a hundred Egg Drops,

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,875
then we could take
Lance out, no problem!

188
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,458
[TAMAZO gasps]
You're onto something!

189
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,083
Let's go grab as many
of 'em as we can, tama!

190
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,750
Are we even allowed to do that?

191
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,125
Of course not.

192
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,000
And D-Gears only have enough
slots for five monsters.

193
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,208
Oh, yeah.

194
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,250
I knew that, tama.

195
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,416
[TIGER]
Aw! Dang.

196
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,750
I thought it was the
idea of the century!

197
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,750
The fact that someone as
clueless as him could make

198
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,000
it past the first trial of the
test is nearly inconceivable!

199
00:09:59,083 --> 00:09:59,875

No, why don't you go first?

I've got an errand to run.

He's only bringing out
three monsters?

235
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,708
He thinks one monster for each
of us is going to be enough.

He won't fight us

completely crush them.

medical assistance,

You're right.
We've come a long way.

325

What're you so impressed
with yourself for?

326
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,666
[laughs] Because.

327
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,083
I finally have an
understanding of Drops.

[TAMAZO]
Tama?

329

[ACE]
For far too long,

330
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,500
I've been trying to force
combo after combo

331
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,875
by creating the necessary Drops.

332
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,000
But that obviously isn't enough.

333
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,791
I have to treat
them with respect

334
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,208
and listen to the flow,

335
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,750
to listen to the voice
of the Drops.

336
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,500
That's what makes a
Guild Dragon Caller.

337
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,500
It's a part of who they are.

338

I'm still absolutely amazed by
how far we've come together.

And I'm beyond thankful

340
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,375
for being able to see the Drops
as clearly as I do now.

341
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,500
Hang on, guys how do we know
this isn't all just a dream?

342
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,958
I can't believe we made it
to the end of the exam!

Yeah.
