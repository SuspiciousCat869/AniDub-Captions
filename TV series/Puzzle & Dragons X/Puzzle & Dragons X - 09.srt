[TAMAZO]
Whatcha doing, Tama?

162
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,250
You boiled up some
tasty eggs, Tamazo.

163
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,416
Yum! Thanks.

164
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,208
So, Tiger, do you call
the Fire City your hometown?

165
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,208
Sure do. Born and raised
right here, in Geyser.

166
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,708
What about you two? Is this
your first time visiting?

167
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,125
[CHARO]
Mm-hmm.

168
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,583
We've got a ton of geothermal
hot-springs around here.

169
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,666
The food's delicious
and the people are warm.

170
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,583
It's a heckuva place!

171
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,708
You should stick around!

172
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,541
You're right.
The locals are friendly.

173
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,125
I'm glad we met. Each of
us is an unwilling member

174
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,666
of the Fraternity of
Guild-Exam-Failers, after all.

175
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,041
Y'know, I never really thought
about it that way, little buddy.

176
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,666
It's nothing to be proud of.

177
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,708
[gasps]
I just remembered!

178
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,625
We were supposed to secure
the building for Miss Garnet's

179
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,958
meet and greet thingy!

180
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,125
She's going to kill us!
I can't believe we forgot!

181
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,000
A Meet and Greet?

182
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,208
Tama!

183
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,250
There's bound to be
some fans there already,

184
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,000
even if it is just
to meet Garnet!

185
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,583
We'd better
get a move on, Ace!

186
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,666
Yeah!

187
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,666
--[TIGER chuckles]
--[TAMAZO] Tama...

188
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,916
Nobody came.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,708
--[CEO laughs nervously]
--This is humiliating.

190
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,791
So, there was a bit of
a communication breakdown

191
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,291
with the printing service,

192
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,416
and they put the wrong place
and time on all the flyers.

193
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,666
"Meet singing sensation
Garnet in Hell"?

194
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,333
This had better be a joke!

195
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,625
It was supposed to say

196
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,375
"Meet Garnet in
Hell Valley Hot Springs."

197
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,958
But this makes it sound
like you're awaiting

198
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:07,416
their arrival in the depths
of the underworld. [laughs]

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,083
Hello? Oh, hi!
I'm glad you called!

200

What's that? Hello?

201
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,083
[CEO] How strange.
Bad reception? Can you hear me?

[GARNET groans]

203
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,416
No one's coming? Seriously?

205

[ELDERLY MAN] Excuse me.
I'm trying to get here.

206
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:37,041
Oh, uh... Take this
exit, go straight,

207
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,083
and then make your way
towards the right.

208
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,833
Follow the pathway
and you should find it.

209

Thank you, miss.

The city is safe, and

All thanks to the
heroic efforts of Lance.

It's not anything
like that at all!

Why would you assume
something so ridiculous?!

229
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,666
But I thought Garnet's
show was the entire reason

you came here
in the first place.

Everything else is
merely a distraction!

I don't have time for girls.

the very same day I failed

You really didn't care?

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,583
I wondered about why I
was unable to pass the exam.

289
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,291
I figured it was because
I didn't have any Soul Armor.

290
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,750
So I constructed
a suit of my own!

291
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,666
There's no other set
like it in the whole world!

Wait. It's hand-made?

00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,166
Yeah, that's right.
I got myself all psyched up,

295
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,291
put my armor on at home,
then I hit the road,

ready to take the exam.

297
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,833

Oh, man! Check out
that guy's Soul Armor!

00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,083
[TIGER] I thought about
giving up on my dream

305
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,833
of becoming a Guild

and reflective, Tama.

[TIGER] That's when
I first saw Garnet.

308
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,750
She had just started
her career as a singer.

309
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,208
At the time, Garnet
didn't have any fancy outfits.

310
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,208
She was up onstage singing and
dancing in her ugly clothes.

311
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,541
How lame!

[giggling]

313
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,708
[TIGER] She didn't care
how other people saw her.

314
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,791
The only thing she brought to
the table was her passion.

315
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,500
But that was all she needed.

316
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,833
And when I realized that,
my life changed.

317
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,083
I swore that day to
never give up on anything

318
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,125
I loved just because
someone might laugh at me.
