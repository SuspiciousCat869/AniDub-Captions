Utilizing the technique,

Dragon Callers become
one with their monsters.

Which was how the Dragon
Callers of old used to fight.

The awesome power
gained from uniting

118
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,041
the monster's soul to their
own allowed Dragon Callers

119
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,125
to enter into combat themselves!

120
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,416
Which means: a literal fight
between Dragon Callers!

121

with your Soul Armor

153
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,250

Not even close, nerd!

I just hope you last
long enough for me

to be the one to take you
out of the tournament!

knocked out in a weird place!

actually trying to tell us

be waiting for us?

Why doesn't she just
say it, then?

Wow. it looks like Class C

the other two combined.

one we know in Class B.

Starjohn is in there too.

Uh? They really put someone
like Mr. Klein in Class B?

175
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,875
No way. I thought for sure

176
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,208
someone like him would've
ended up in Class A.

Who'd they rank as Class A?

Lance. Well, I'm not surprised.

He isn't just last year's
Battle Cup champion.

He's been undefeated for years.

With that new Soul Armor
you've got, Ace,

you could be real
contender too, tama!

You can even defeat
Lance, I bet!

I don't know if I
would go that far.

That's me!

So, who're you facing off
against in the first round?

It seems the pleasure is mine.

But never did I imagine I'd be
facing off against Charo. Heh.

Have we met somewhere before?

It says your opponent for
the first round is Donny?

Don't be obtuse.

I've simply matured
since last I saw you.

And since I'm a man now,

I've brought the trendiest
monsters I could find.

I've also customized my
D-Gear to look extra-dashing.

00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,083
[ANGENE]
That's impressive.

316
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,750
So, his Soul Armor is strong?

317
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,333
Horus is a monster with
the power of a god.

318
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,750
They're extremely rare.

319
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,625
Then Ace is bound to
be a shoo-in, right?

320
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,666
Wow, Horus?

[TAMAZO]
The Red Krull we got that day

324
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,458
evolved into a Red
Carbuncle, tama!

325
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,416
[ACE] And that Flare Drall is
an evolution of Agdrall, too!

Looks like he really
was hardcore training.

So, those are the Drops?

This is the world Ace sees?

[GIRL 27B] It's like a

He really did get Horus!

Horus? That's a twist.

345
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,625
It looks like your rival

346
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,875
might make for a decent
challenge after all, eh?

347
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,125
That kid isn't my rival.

348

Yeah, devi! He's way below
Master Lance's level, devi!

Wow, Ace. So cool!

C'mon. Brace yourself!

[CHARO]
U-Uh...

[CHARO]
Mega Bubblie's element is water,

353
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,166
and water elements are
vulnerable to wood.

354
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,500
I'd better gather
some Wood Drops.

355

Yeah.

Quickly, we must attack!

into Fire Drops!

that skill halve the damage,

00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,250
it also enhances his fire Drops!
