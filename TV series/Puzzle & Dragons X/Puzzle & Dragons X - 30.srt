The Battle Cup,

00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,916
where ambitious young Dragon
Callers come to compete against

one another and determine
who's the best of the best.

It's a high-stakes tournament
where matches are fought

based on fighter classes.

of Light, Master Jest.

and various monsters,

That's why I'm giving this

Do me a favor, and don't
hold back on me, Ace.

Fight me like you fought Tiger.

Not to mention, that Ace
is using Soul Brave.

179
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,375
I wonder how Charo plans to turn
this bad situation around?

180

the upper hand!

Charo's stronger than I thought!

He's definitely clever.

207
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,666
He's preventing
Horus' leader skill

208
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,791
by making a constant barrage
with his monster's skills.

Ace is having difficulty
finishing the match

265
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,666
because he's afraid
he might hurt Charo.

Which is why he's unable
to synchronize with Horus.

Yo! Charo! Hey!

326
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,541
[BOYS cheering, laughing]

327
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,000
You guys.

328
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,250
We're sorry for when
we called you a liar!

329
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,583
Come back to Libria
soon, Charo!

330
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,250
We'll be waitin' for ya!

331
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,041
Yeah, you've got it!

332
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,541
You showed the world

333
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,125
the strength of your
fighting spirit.

334
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,625
And that changed the way
those boys felt about you.

335
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,041
You both did very well,
and should be proud.

336
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,083
Thanks, Torlie.

337
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,708
I found the strength I
needed because of Charo.

338
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,708
It was the only way I could
became one with Horus.

339
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,166
Really?

340
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,666
Charo's spirit is what made
us find Soul Brave, tama!

341
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,875
You know, you're even
stronger than I expected.

342
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,000
Hold onto that strength
the rest of the way.

343
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,291
'Cause I know you
can win this, Ace.

344
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,041
[ACE] Yeah. Thanks for
believing in me.

345
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,750
I should thank you.

346
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,541
You fought me with
everything you had,

347
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,625
which means you
believed in me, too!

348
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,833
[CROWD cheering]

349
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,875
[footsteps]

350
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,625
Charo.

351
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,333
[CHARO]
I never expected this.

352
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:49,625
I had no idea losing
would be so frustrating.

353
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,375
Hey, man, that's proof you
tried your very hardest.

354
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,708
The best thing for you
right now is a good cry!

355
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,625
To scream at the
top of your lungs!

356
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,250
No, I just can't.

357
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,416
I'm not like you, Tiger.

358
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,041
[cries]

359
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,875
I'll cry with you!

360
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:06,875
'Kay buddy?

361
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,583
[cries]

362
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:14,666
[BOTH sob]

363
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,041
Now!

364
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,750
That brings us to the final
match-up for Class C!

365
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,125
The fighters are Ace, the
up-and-coming young rookie,

366
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:26,000
and his opponent: from the
Dark City, it's Kroell!

367
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,833
[VAHATON] So, it would appear
that Ace has mastered Soul Brave

368
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,375
just in time to advance
into the finals.

369
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,166
I'd expect no less
from King's son.

370
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,750
But his next opponent
is tricky to say the least.

371
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,416
This boy, Kroell,

372
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,625
he's quite dangerous.

373
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,333
[DAFNES] Consumed by
the forces of darkness.

374
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,916
[METAL] Class B has also
moved on to their finals!

375
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,041
Garnet versus Starjohn!

376
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,875
Which of them will take
the crown of victory?!

377
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:06,125
And the next match
in Class A will be...

378
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,875
...Morgan versus Herriot!

379
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,750
A battle between sisters!

380
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,083
[MORGAN] I've won 15 times
against my sister,

381
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,083
and lost 15 times, but today,
I'm ending the deadlock!

382
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,791
Using my Soul Brave, of course.

383
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:55,791
Next time:

384
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,500
"Dragon Caller of
Light and Dark."

385
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:58,791
Grab your popcorn,

386
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,666
I'll show you what a
Class A battle looks like!
