00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,791
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,875
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,833
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,291
They harnessed
the power of the monsters,

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,833
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:25,333
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,166
[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers
are born with the special power

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,041
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature,

9
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,041
mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:39,791
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us...

11
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,291
...the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters

12
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,916
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,916
Another mission well done!

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,625
Guess you've gotten the
hang of this line of work

15
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,708
faster than most others do.

16
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,375
In fact, you're starting to
build quite a reputation!

17
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,958
For real?

18
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,500
That's pretty cool.

19
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,583
That is cool!

20
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,791
And it's all thanks
to Tamazo, tama!

21
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,583
Whatever you're doing is
working, so please keep it up!

22
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,875
--Sure!
--Tama!

23
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,583
[CHARO]
Ace! Tamazo!

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,416
Charo! Tiger!

25
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,208
Reporting in the
completion of your mission, huh?

26
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,833
Is that what
you guys are doing here?

27
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,375
Yeah.

28
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,916
It's not easy being a full-time
Dragon Caller for the Guild.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,541
We decided to
take ourselves a little break

30
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,166
here in Libria.

31
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,083
And I thought this
would be a great opportunity

32
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,500
to drop in for a
visit with Torlie.

33
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,083
Oh. Him.

34
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,583
The Ancient of Wood?

35
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,375
I wanted to say hello
and see how he's doing.

36
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,958
Tiger decided he would
tag along with me.

37
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,666
You wanna join us, too?

38
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,125
Sounds fun!
Of course, I will!

39
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,000
Tama will tag along, too!

40
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,708
Charo?

41
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,041
[CHARO]
Hi, Torlie!

42
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:37,958
[ACE]
Hello!

43
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,500
[TAMAZO]
Tama, tama.

44
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,458
Hello, everyone!

45
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,375
Welcome back to Libria!

46
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,583
What's the deal
with that big backpack?

47
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,458
Are you moving somewhere, sir?

48
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,458
[TORLIE gasps]
Oh, this?

49
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,625
I'm just
heading into the forest.

50
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,333
[TORLIE] I heard a lot of good
things about you boys.

51
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,291
That you're all
working really hard.

52
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,125
Yeah! After all...

53
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,958
...we carry the future of
the Dragon Callers' Guild

54
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,500
on our shoulders, don't we?

55
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,791
Right now, you're
carrying me on your shoulder!

56
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,416
--Tama!
--Wasn't talkin' literally.

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,333
But please, tell me honestly:

58
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,416
Was it all right that we
asked to join you, Torlie?

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, of course!

60
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,666
Plus, this gives you the chance
to see the forest spring!

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,625
And I don't mind
having the company.

62
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,583
[ACE gasps]
Wait. Drops?

63
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,625
[CHARO]
Huh?

64
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,750
There, you see 'em?

65
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,458
Dude, you're right!

66
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,291
Think it's a Drop Impact?

67
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,125
No, that doesn't
seem like what's happening.

68
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,833
Yeah. There aren't
enough Drops for that.

69
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,208
Once I became the
Ancient of Wood,

70
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,208
a lot of things
needed my attention...

71
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,500
...but I finally
managed to catch up,

72
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,500
and I decided to visit the
spring since it's been a while.

73
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,666
Look! More Drops, tama!

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,541
It's just as I thought.

75
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,958
There are more.

76
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,416
[GROUP gasps]

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,375
This forest has areas
where Drops surge into existence

78
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,750
like water welling
up from a spring.

79
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,250
But recently,

80
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,250
I've heard rumors that the
amount of Drops is on the rise.

81
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,625
Do you think it's
some sort of sign

82
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,625
of the next Drop Impact?

83
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,000
I haven't
reached any conclusions,

84
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,708
but it certainly seems
to be some kind of

85
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,583
recurring phenomenon.

86
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,333
Ah. Tamazo.

87
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,958
You're strangely quiet.
What're you doing?

88
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,541
I'm catching a big one.

89
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,166
Do what now?

90
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,208
[TIGER]
Huh? Woah.

91
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,958
Hey guys it looks like
he's fishing with his tail!

00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,375
Your nose caught one, tama!

And he's a big 'un!
You're a real angler, tama!

It may not be all that much,
but please help yourselves!

--[ACE] Sure!
--[GROUP] Thanks for the food.

97
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,583
[TAMAZO]
Tama, tama, tama!

98
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,541
Fantastico!

99
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,208
And even better, because it's
being shared by our friends!

100
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,416
Yup!

101
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,375
Still, seems kinda strange.

102
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,250
You're the Ancient:
Can you just suddenly leave

103
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,375
the city and go camping?

104
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,375
[TORLIE] If something's
wrong with the forest,

105
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,458
I need to figure it out.

106
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,250
It's the most
important part of my job.

107
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,583
I have to keep Libria safe.

108
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,833
Glad to hear it.

109
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,875
It really takes a burden
off of my mind to know

110
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,208
that my hometown is under your
watchful protection, Torlie.

111
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,375
So, will the amount
of Drops in the forest

112
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,125
keep increasing?

113
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,791
Well... I'm not sure.

114
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,000
The spring is the water
source for all the plant life

115
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,291
in the area.

116
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,750
I hope I'll be able
to find something there,

117
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,208
but unfortunately, it may end up
being quite the long shot.

118
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,958
The spring's water is
the life source of the forest.

119
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,416
We have to try.

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

121
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,708
Wow. That's complicated, but I'm
picking up that we need to do

122
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,541
whatever we can to take care of
this spring, is that right?

123
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,875
[TAMAZO giggles]
Way to use your noggin, tama!

124
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,708
[laughs]

125
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,958
Yes, and that's
my main reason for going,

126
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,333
but it's also because of this!

127
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,666
Wait, what?

128
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,916
That must be
Master Tinbell's Egg Drop!

129
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,000
Master Tinbell and I
first met one another

130
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,125
when I was
investigating the spring.

131
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,500
I used to travel from
one end of Dragoza Island

132
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,791
to the other for my
archaeological research.

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,666
[gasps]

134
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,375
Is that another Drop Impact?

135
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,250
It must be.

136
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,666
[TORLIE] Drop Impacts were
randomly occurring all across

137
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,708
the island, and when
compared to older reports,

138
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,833
they were occurring
with greater frequency.

139
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,541
But why was that?

140
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,166
What was causing it?

141
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,500
To find the answer I needed,
I came to this forest.

142
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,625
Beautiful!

143
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,541
[TINBELL] You mean,
you can see the Drops, child?

144
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,166
[TORLIE gasps]

145
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,958
[TORLIE] That's when
I first met Master Tinbell.

146
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,041
What are Drops, anyway?

147
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,375
And how do they transfer their
energy to the monsters?

148
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,791
Have you ever
considered such thoughts?

149
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,041
Yes.

150
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,208
I've been on expeditions
researching just that!

151
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,083
Drops are nature's
power manifested

152
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,541
in the atmosphere.

153
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,166
A limited energy
that is generated

154
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,583
from within the world itself!

155
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,875
[TINBELL]
Correct.

156
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,708
Try to think of it
as the blood of this planet.

157
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,791
Drops are blood?

158
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,166
Then there must be a reason
we've had so many Drop Impacts.

159
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,958
Because this planet's been hurt.

160
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,416
It's wounded.

161
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,916
[gasps]
So, then if that's the case,

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,875
I think I understand the
way Charo is feeling right now.

328
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,208
You do?

329
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,375
That failed...

330
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,750
I failed...

331
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,083
Everyone can return.

332
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,333
[gasps]
But why?

333
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,250
Uh... How're you gonna fight
without your monsters?

334
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,625
[TIGER]
Okay, I think I get it!

335
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,125
He's gonna hit 'im
with some Fire Drops!

336
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,666
Charo.

337
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,791
[gasps]
Water Drops?

338
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,166
He's got it mixed up, tama!

339
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,250
It's Fortoytops's skill.

340
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,875
[TORLIE] He can turn Water Drops
into Heart Drops.

341
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,250
[gasps]

342
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,750
Charo!

343
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,750
Thank you, friend.

344
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,916
[CHARO]
You understood.

345
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,833
I was just trying to help.

346
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,791
I'm a Guild Dragon Caller,

347
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:08,125
and my duty is to restore the
Drops to a state of balance.

348
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,125
[CHARO] I would never do
this just to hurt monsters.

349
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,500
[FORTOYTOPS sighs]

350
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:19,625
I promise,
and of course, it takes time...

351
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,208
...but I swear...

352
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,750
...I'll make this forest
just like it was.

353
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,583
[gasps]
Uh... Tops?

354
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,208
Good news, guys!

355
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,875
I think that Tops
understands me!

356
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,416
It sure looks that way.

357
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,125
Always had faith!

358
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,083
I never doubted you
for a second, Charo!

359
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,166
[CHARO]
Yeah, I can see that.

360
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,541
[ACE]
Honestly, I was worried.

361
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,166
Try not to be so reckless!

362
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,833
[CHARO] I'm not afraid
to do something like this

363
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,416
because I know you guys
will always have my back!

364
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,333
[TAMAZO]
That's what teamwork is, tama!

365
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,958
[ACE]
Yup!

366
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,208
[TIGER]
We do have your back.

367
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,875
You can count on that.

368
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,916
[TIGER]
Far out!

369
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,625
[ACE]
Your own Soul Stone!

370
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,416
He accepted you, Charo!

371
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,750
[CHARO]
He accepted me?

372
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,041
For real?

373
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,500
[TIGER] Yeah! Old Fortinbras
really liked you!

374
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,125
[TORLIE]
Charo, I'm very proud of you!

375
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,875
[TORLIE]
The Drops are dissipating.

376
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,166
Soon, it will all be
back to normal.

377
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,541
[CHARO] Does that mean
the forest's problems

378
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,125
will start to fade away?

379
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,250
[TORLIE]
Yes!

380
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,416
[TAMAZO]
Well, c'mon!

381
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's make that
Soul Stone shine!

382
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,583
Awm! Tama!

383
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,666
[TAMAZO]
Armor Drop, Tama!

384
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,041
Here you go!

385
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,625
[CHARO]
Thank you, Tamazo.

386
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,625
[TAMAZO]
Tama.

387
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,500
[ACE]
Well? What's it look like?

388
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,583
[TIGER] It's time to rock
your new Soul Armor!

389
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,291
[CHARO]
Heh! Right!

390
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,208
[CHARO]
Fortoytops!

391
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,875
Lend me your power!

392
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,625
[CHARO]
Cross-On!

393
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,666
[TIGER]
Wow!

394
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,666
[ACE]
That's cool!

395
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,500
[TAMAZO]
Looking so fresh, tama!

396
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,375
[CHARO]
It's almost like.

397
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,958
I can feel the
Fortoytops's soul!

398
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,000
[TORLIE] One day, we may
have another burst of Drops

399
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,791
to deal with here.

400
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,916
And next time,
it might trigger a Drop Impact.

401
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,625
--It's great!
--Yeah!

402
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,208
--Cool!
--Is the head heavy?

403
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,041
[TORLIE]
And yet... there's hope.

404
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,625
These children are
the key to our future.

405
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,291
And they won't face it alone.

406
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,833
I'm not letting this
planet die, either!

407
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,166
Please watch
over us, Master Tinbell!

408
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,583
We need it!

409
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,333
[TIGER]
Tiger here!

410
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,000
Born and raised in
the Fire City Geyser,

411
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,916
I live a life of
reaching for the top,

412
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,208
and having fun hanging
out with my buddies!

413
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,458
[TIGER] But then, a certain
someone shows up.

414
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,958
Next episode:
"Tiger's Tough Time."

415
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,083
I have my own path
to walk in this world!
