00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,250
[SECRETARY]
Master Eldora!

473
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,750
What is it?

474
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,458
[SECRETARY] It's an emergency!
You need to come quickly!

475
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:18,041
[gulping]

476
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,041
[sighs]
Yummy, tama!

477
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,541
[CHARO]
Oh, yeah! That was perfect!

478
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,375
[TIGER] This is the stuff
we Geyser-ites live for!

479
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,333
[CHARO]
Heh, we should visit again!

480
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,583
[ACE]
Agreed!

481
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,375
[TIGER] Yeah. I'm sad to
leave my home behind,

482
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,250
but I'll definitely
come back one day.

483
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,208
[BOTH]
Huh?

484
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,708
We're a good team!

485
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,958
I figure I might as well tag
along with you for a while!

486
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,333
Together, we can
go for the top!

487
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,333
--[CHARO] What?
--[ACE] Are you serious?

488
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,875
Now that that's all
been settled, where to?

489
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,458
Man! I'm so excited!

490
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,291
Goin' for the top
on a global scale! Whoo-hoo!

491
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,083
[CHARO] Rule one of traveling
with us:

492
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,291
you have to stop roaring
and yelling like a maniac

493
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,083
all the time!

494
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,833
[ALL laugh]

495
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,416
[D-Gear beeping]

496
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,458
[ACE]
Hey Garnet.

497
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,500
[GARNET]
Is Charo with you?

498
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,791
[CHARO]
I am.

499
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,208
[GARNET] The Ancient of Wood
isn't doing well,

500
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,500
and Libria's in
some serious trouble!

501
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,750
What?

502
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,000
What's this Libria place?

503
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,250
It's my... my hometown.

504
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,875
Bad news.

505
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,125
[TIGER] They say Charo's
hometown is in real trouble!

506
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,791
I don't really understand all
this "Ancient's post" business,

507
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,541
but I'm positive we'll
figure it out eventually!

508
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,000
Next time!
"Wood City Libria."

509
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,000
You know I'm gonna be double
gung-ho next week, too!
