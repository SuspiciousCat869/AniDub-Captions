00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,541
[ACE] Ms. Herriot, would you
please help me train again?

2
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,708
Yes, please, tama!

3
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,625
Now where's this coming
from all of a sudden?

4
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,458
You're already a Guild
Dragon Caller, kid.

5
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,791
I mostly train people
up to that point.

6
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,916
But you gotta help! I have
to train to become stronger!

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,625
Somethin' happen to you?

8
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,875
It was awful!

9
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,375
We got totally creamed
by some evil brat, tama!

10
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,916
So frustrating, tama!

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,083
A kid?

12
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,250
That's just sad.

13
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,083
All the more reason
for you to help me!

14
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,625
Hit the gym if you really
wanna get stronger, Ace.

15
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,666
Focus on free weights.

16
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,583
I'm being serious, you know.

17
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,166
Yeah, so am I.

18
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,041
Any Dragon Caller worth his
salt strives to become stronger.

19
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:33,416
But there are different
ways to achieve that goal.

20
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,583
True strength comes from
figuring out what works for you.

21
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:40,041
Everybody's gotta find
their own path in this life.

22
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,708
'Cause I have my own path
to walk! That's why.

23
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,625
It's time I headed
out on my own!

24
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,250
Find my own path? But what?

25
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,250
I found my way through
muscle development.

26
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,666
Your way might be
completely different.

27
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,291
[MORGAN]
My sister's being cruelly vague.

28
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,250
But I'd be glad to offer
you a helpful hint, Ace.

29
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,791
If you really want
to be stronger,

30
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,250
learn to listen to the
monsters' voices.

31
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,958
The monsters' voices?

32
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,208
See, now you got the
poor kid all confused!

33
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,000
That's why I was trying not
to get too into the specifics.

34
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,291
Well, excuse me!

35
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,166
[TAMAZO]
Tama...

36
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,791
And just so we're crystal clear,

37
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,916
I'm not talking about
voices like this one.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,083
Huh?

39
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,958
Oh, by the way, Herriot,

40
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,500
Master Dafnes wants us ASAP.

41
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,625
Time for us to head out!

42
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,958
And you're just now telling me?

43
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,416
No, wait, please!

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,958
Sorry, kid. It's Guild business.

45
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,500
See ya around.

46
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:43,958
[TAMAZO crying]

47
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,791
I can't believe the ley line

48
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,750
has become
contaminated so quickly.

49
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,666
I can't force it down!

50
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,083
[roaring]

[DAFNES]
Calamity Immortal Dragon.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,875
It would be disastrous
if he got out.

53
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,708
There's so many, but why?

54
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,250
If it comes down to it, I'll be
forced to use my Reversion.

55
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,375
Oh, yeah!

56
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,291
The cavalry's arrived,
Master Dafnes!

57
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,166
[HERRIOT] That's right,
run back to your nest!

58
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,708
[DAFNES] I appreciate you
two showing up so quickly.

59
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,041
You asked for us,
and we came runnin'!

60
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,833
You shouldn't push
yourself so hard,

61
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,000
trying to settle
things on your own!

62
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,041
You might still look young,
but we know you're not.

63
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,666
How I've missed
the catty back-talk

64
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,208
you girls bring to the table.

65
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,583
All right, let's get to work.

66
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,458
[MORGAN] Looks like
that's all been settled.

67
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,750
[DAFNES]
Though only temporarily.

68
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,791
The ley lines are the arteries
the Drops flow through,

69
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,250
and something's stopping the
energy from traveling further.

[CALAMITY IMMORTAL
DRAGON A roars]

71
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,208
And we can push it back
the next time, too.

72
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,958
That's what we
Dragon Callers do.

73
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,041
Talk about a let-down!

74
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,375
I came just to watch
you fight the dragon.

75
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,041
If you don't take him on, it
will have been a wasted trip.

76
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,791
Who does this annoying
brat think he is, exactly?

77
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,541
Hello, Zeus.

78
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,000
A boy served by a god?

79
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,750
Then that must
make you Star John.

80
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,875
The Master's not as tough
as she's hyped up to be

81
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,708
if she's afraid to
fight that thing!

82
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,416
For a guy who came to watch,

83
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
you got an awful
big mouth on ya.

84
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,416
That'll be enough, Herriot.

85
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,958
Yeah, watch what you say.

86
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,166
Old Zeus here
only fights for me.

Well, let's hope you're right.

00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,666
Huh?

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,583
We're leaving.

90
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,291
I'll always hate the Guild.

91
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,666
Those jerks.

92
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,958
If they were so great,
they would've saved my town.

93
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,083
They'll get what's
comin' to 'em.

94
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,750
The monsters' voices.

Ace, he's saying he wants
to fight them, together!

96
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,208
[ACE]
Ouka was my very first monster.

97
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,833
I was so excited
when he came with me.

98
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,041
Then there were the
monsters that trusted me,

99
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,125
and became my allies.

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,458
[ACE] Monsters that I battled,
who accepted me as their friend.

101

[VOICE A] Forging a strong bond
helps mark the path toward hope.

102
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,208
[ACE]
And of course,

103
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,333
the Ancient Dragon Knight
that made me more powerful

104
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,458
by entrusting his soul to me.

105
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,291
Forge strong bonds?

106
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,750
I wanna understand
the monsters better.

107
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,458
To listen to their voices,

108
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,583
and hear what
they're trying to say.

Tama!

117
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,333
[DAFNES] Not being able to
deal with this on my own

118
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,666
is so frustrating.

119
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,958
[JEST] Are you whining?
That isn't like you.

120
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,583
It's the sad truth,

121
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,083
and as loathe as I may
be to admit the fact,

122
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,083
my power is waning.

You are and always
shall be lovely.

124
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,625
I think I'm beginning
to understand why Vahaton

125
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,583
has high hopes for humans.

126
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,166
Each year, more and more humans

127
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,541
are learning to become
Dragon Callers.

128
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,666
[JEST] But placing too much
of our hope on humans

129
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,583
is running away
from the problem.

130
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,416
I'd also heard that King's
son Ace battled Star John

131
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,375
and was soundly defeated.

132
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,375
[DAFNES]
Yes, this time.

133
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,458
But who can tell what
will happen next time?

134
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,458
The humans are evolving
at an alarming pace, Jest.

135
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,041
Only we, the Dragonoids,

136
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,583
can save the future of
Dragoza and our world.

You know that, don't you?

138
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,791
[DAFNES]
I hope you're right.

139
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,750
[TAMAZO] Okay! Let's do
some training, tama!

Get it together Ace! I'm not
even breaking a sweat, tama!

No, that's gross.

You might be deficient
in the guts department

if you give up so easily, tama!

This isn't real
training, anyway.

This is just you goofing
around, instead.

153

It's better than not
doing anything, tama!

154

Yeah, whatever.

00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,000
"Dear Ace, I know
you're in the market

162
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,833
for a stronger monster
than what you've got,

163
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,500
and I'd like to offer you some
assistance in the matter."

164
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,041
It isn't Charo,
and there's no name.

165
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,458
Seems pretty fishy, tama!

166
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,833
But I received this
message on my D-Gear,

167
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,791
which means a
Dragon Caller sent it.

168
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,583
Someone's pranking you,
tama. Just ignore it.

169
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,208
[TAMAZO]
Here we go anyway, tama!

170
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,750
Ace, you're naïve.

171
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,833
That was totally gross!

172
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,625
That fruit's disgusting.
So yucky, tama!

173
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,625
Fruit that grows where
the Drop flow is stagnant

174
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,625
tastes extra-yucky, tama!

175
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll take your word for it.

176
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,541
This place feels eerie, Ace.

177
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:18,125
Like something terrible is
about to appear, tama-ma!

178
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,416
[ACE] The Drops feel like
they did that one time.

179
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,791
You remember?

180
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,791
When we almost
experienced a Drop Impact

181
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,625
on the outskirts of Libria?

182
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,583
[BOTH gasp]

183
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,541
Ta-Tama?

184
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,291
I told you it was a trap, tama!
Let's get outta here!

185
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:37,833
No way!

186
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,166
Are you nuts?

187
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,583
We'll just get caught up
in the Drop Impact, tama!

188
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,333
It's a Dragon Caller's
job to try and stop it!

189

[gasps]

190
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,041
[ACE]
It's like what Torlie said.

191
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,750
The Drop Impacts are proof
that the planet is hurting!

192
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,458
If the source of the
Drops dries out,

193
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,041
then this planet and all
the monsters will die!

194
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,458
That's why we've got
to do something!

195
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,916
If that's the way you feel,
then so be it, tama!

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,875
I'll be right here by your side!

197
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,041
Here, Ace! Your Armor
Drop is ready, tama!

198
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,666
Cross-On!

199
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,208
Release!

200

[yells]

201
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,833
Awesome!

00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,500
Here they come, Ace!

203
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,541
Right! Go-time!

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,875
Light beats out Dark!

205
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,208
Holy Ball!

206
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,458
Yes!

207
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,041
Heck, that was pretty easy!

208
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,000
What the--?

209
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,791
Can you sense it too, Ace?

210
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,916
I can. Something
isn't right here.

211

[BOTH gasp]

212

[ACE]
That isn't good. What now?

213
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,291
We're up for a fight if you are!

214
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,125
Good. Let's go!

215
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,791
[TAMAZO]
The Drop disturbance is massive!

216
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,291
Can you handle it, Ace?

217
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,666
I have to.

218
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,958
The Drop flow needs to
return to its natural state.

219
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,958
[gasps]

220
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,208
Good lookin' out!
Thanks for the assist.

221
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,500
Now it's our turn to hit back!

222
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,833
Yeah! Nicely done!

223
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,291
Let's go.

224
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,375
[roars]

He can use his own roar
to power up? Amazing!

226
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,083
We need to strike first!

227
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,666
Then we shall!

228
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,458
It's no good.
I fear we're too late.

229
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,958
Then it's time to
break out Gungnir.

230
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,750
You're right about that!

231
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,041
Follow me, everyone!

232
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,250
I'll combo!

233
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,916
Tama!

234
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,250
Do it!

235
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,916
That's it!

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,166
Now give him
everything you've got!

237
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,958
Great work, guys!

238
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,250
Indeed!

239
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,625
This should help to
dissipate the Drop Impact!

240
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,916
What's this?

241
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,541
Is that?

242
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,916
How can there be
so many of them?

243
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,708
This is bad.

244
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,333
[chuckles]

245
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,791
And now what?

00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,958
Ace, something's coming, tama!

247
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,500
How strange.
That thing... could it be?

248
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,541
[TAMAZO]
Tama!

249
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,750
Tama! So many Dark Drops!

250
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,708
Tama?

251
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:16,041
The Drop Impact's
dispelled! Incredible.

252
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,250
This power... it's familiar.

[gasps]

00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,583
It was you!

00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,041
The Ancient of Dark, tama!

256
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,708
Are you all right?

257
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,458
Wow! You were scary, tama!

258
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,875
How intriguing.

259
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:47,125
You used your Reversion
to save that human boy.

260
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:51,541
So be it then. I'll proceed
with my plan alone, if need be.

261
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,708
[DAFNES] I'm sorry you
had to see me like that.

262
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:05,625
What? No. You don't need
to apologize for saving me.

263
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,791
The only reason I was even here
was to settle the Drop Impact.

264
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,916
No offense, but I didn't
come to save you.

265
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,875
I know, but thank you anyway.

266
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,083
And what brings
you to this place?

267
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,750
It isn't on any
sight-seeing tours.

268
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,875
Um, because--

269
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,541
Someone conned us
into coming out here

270
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,458
to find a mighty monster!

271
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,666
So you walked
right into a set-up.

272
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,500
That's remarkably stupid.

273
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,333
I was just looking for another
way to become stronger.

274
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,166
I warned him not to go, tama!

275
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,708
But would he listen to
Tama? Of course, not!

276
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,875
After watching the way
you fight, Master Dafnes,

277
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,958
I think I know what kinda
strength I'm trying to achieve.

278
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:42,916
Tama?

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,375
Oh?

280
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,166
I wanna get in on
the action too!

281
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,000
To fight, just like
you and Tamazo!

282
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,208
Impossible.

283
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,416
Or at best, improbable.

284
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,208
Human beings lack
the ability to Revert.

285
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,583
What's the big idea, Ace?

286
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,125
Are you trying to steal the
spotlight from me, tama?

287
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,041
[yelps]

288
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,541
I just...

289
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,333
[ACE]
I'll always lag behind.

290
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,083
I don't wanna hold
anyone back anymore.

291
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,791
I'm done with that.

292
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,125
I need to learn
how to see things

293
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,458
from the monsters' perspectives.

294
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,208
Developing stronger
bonds with monsters

295
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,958
is where my path takes me!

296
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,208
Following that path
may not be easy.

297
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,500
I'll need more
training, but I...

298
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,000
...I wanna fight
alongside my monsters.

299
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,583
I see.

300
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,750
Then there's somewhere
that you should visit.

301
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,166
Where's this place I need to go?

302
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,125
Would you please stop
being mysterious

303
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,416
and spit it out, tama?

304
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,208
First, head to the Duen Desert.

305
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,000
Trek across the sands to the
edge where the sun rises,

306
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,500
and you will find a monster
as powerful as a god.

307
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,916
Really?

308
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,250
Do not fear.

309
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,666
That Tamadra will lead you
in the right direction.

310
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,666
Who, Tamazo?

311
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,583
Perhaps you might
succeed on this quest

312
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,708
where many others have failed.

313
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,375
I saw how all of your monsters
were filled with happiness

314
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,833
when fighting together
for your sake.

315
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,875
Although, this chubby one has a
tendency of getting too cocky.

316
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,875
Would you please let go
of my scalp, already?

317
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,750
[SONIA]
When the planet faces a crisis,

318
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,958
the one who embodies the
will of our planet appears,

319
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,166
and the bond between people
and monsters will cross.

320

Next time.
"Surviving the Storm."

Do you really think you're
ready to face this, Ace?
