[NARRATOR]
The Battle Cup,

2
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,250
where ambitious young Dragon
Callers come to compete against

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:26,000
one another and determine
who's the best of the best.

4
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,583
It's a high-stakes tournament
where matches are fought

5
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,833
based on fighter classes.

6
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,750
They're all competing
for the glory,

7
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,458
as well as the Golden Egg.

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:42,166
The late Ancient of Light,
Master Lukes, banned Soul Brave,

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,583
an ancient Dragon
Caller technique.

10
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,250
However, that ban was lifted

11
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,958
by the current Ancient
of Light, Master Jest.

12
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,833
Utilizing their Soul Armor
and various monsters,

13
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:57,541
these Dragon Callers are aiming
to bring home the big win!

14
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:01,583
Ready yourselves, challengers,
for the moment of truth!

15
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,041
I'll wipe the floor
with that jerk!

16
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,250
I swear it!

17
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's do it, tama!

Before you have the opportunity

25
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,708
to face off against Starjohn,

26
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,833
you'll have to win
the finals of Class C.

27
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,208
However, I don't plan
to just let that happen.

28
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,416
And you are...?

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,083
My name is Kroell, boy,
and I'm not afraid

30
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,875
to get my hands dirty,
if it means winning.

Soul Brave!

34
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,041
A technique which had
been banned for years,

35
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,625
has made this tournament
one for the record books!

36
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,166
The contestants have really
stepped up to the challenge,

37
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,333
the thrill of victory pushing
them to greater heights!

38

Now, before we move on
to the next match,

39
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,166
it's time for a status report
on Classes A, B, and C!

40
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,791
We'll begin with Class A!

41
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,291
Championship contender Lance
has moved up to the finals

42
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,500
without breaking a sweat!

43
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,541
He'll be facing off
against Herriot,

44
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,083
the winner of the
sister-versus-sister battle!

45
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,708
Moving on to Class B!

46
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,208
Just as expected, Garnet cruised
through the early rounds

47
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,625
with ease, certain she had the
championship in her pocket!

48
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,333
But instead, she was in
for a rude awakening.

49
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,000
With Starjohn's fierce attack,

50
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,333
Garnet was injured,
and she lost the match!

51
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,166
That turn of events
made Starjohn

52
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,458
the undisputed
victor of Class B.

53
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,041
And last but not least,
the crowd has gone wild

54
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,500
for the meteoric rise of the
young stars of Class C!

[METAL]
A newcomer to the tournament,

58
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,750
and also the first
to use Soul Brave,

59
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,625
it's Ace from Vienna City.

60
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,541
He won a hard-fought battle
against his friend Charo,

61
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,875
and advanced to the semi-finals!

62
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,166
You can see how far his
training has taken him.

[METAL]
Against Ace in the finals

64
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,833
is another new
challenger, Kroell.

65
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,208
Since round one,

66
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,375
he's defeated his opponents
in the blink of an eye,

67
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,458
which means we've only seen

68

a handful of the cards
he has to play!

69
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,916
He looks tough.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,333
I hope Ace will be all right.

it to the finals!

there with him, tama!

I know, but your next
opponent is a mystery.

What's the word on
this Kroell guy?

in the blink of an eye while
keeping his distance.

And he... I'm not
sure how to say it.

Is there something
else I need to know?

[CHARO]
Yes.

Kroell's way of fighting
is rather unsettling.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,708
He's very cold and dark,
like a shadow.

92
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,041
That could just be
the Dark attribute.

I hope that's all it is.

accomplishment, Kroell.

[KROELL]
Hmph.

anyone pull the rug out

You're reckless, and that's
precisely why I had to give you

a failing grade in the Guild
Dragon Caller's Exam.

103

of my power.

If you use fear to

become desperate.

00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,208
by using Hino Kagutsuchi.

325
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,916
And so he's done just that.

326
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,458
[KROELL]
I don't... believe it!

327
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,500
Tricked by a mere human!

328
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,083
I'm not finished yet!

329
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,250
Wha--?! Ace's combo is
generating multiple Cross Drops

330
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,666
with which to attack Kroell!

331
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,666
I'm bringin' this match
to an end, right now!

332
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,875
We'll see about that!

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,416
Good gravy!

334
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,958
Kroell has just materialized
some Cross Drops of his own!

335
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,708
Prepare yourself!

336
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,333
Uh? Curses.

337
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,250
I only have Hades.

338
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,708
That's the price you pay
for rejecting your monsters.

339
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,208
[growls] I don't care!

340
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,541
Hades, you should be more
than enough for this one!

341
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,416
Dark Hell Scythe!

342
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Now Ace, attack him from above!

343
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,083
[yells]

344
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,666
You got it!

345
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,458
Huh?!

346
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,041
[squawks]

347
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,041
[CHARO laughs]

348
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:40,833
God Burning Attack!

349
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,250
[KROELL yells]

350
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,416
[gasping]

351
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,291
[screams]

352
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,708
[METAL] Using their
individual Soul Braves,

353
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,666
the two mega-attacks collided!

354
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,500
Ace's God Burning Attack has
put Kroell down for the count!

355
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,083
Which makes Ace the ultimate
victor in this match-up!

356
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,916
Which also makes him this year's
Battle Cup Class C Champion!

357
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,541
[CROWD cheers]

358
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,541
We did it!

359
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,458
We won, tama!

360
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,000
[ACE]
We won, Tamazo!

361
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,208
[BOTH laughing]

362
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,791
--You guys were amazing!
--Oh yeah! Victory!

363
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,000
[BOTH laughing]

364
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,833
[HARU]
I knew Ace could do it!

365
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,625
[gasps]

366
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,541
Master Lance,
is somethin' wrong, devi?

367
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,875
Nothing.

368
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,208
Ace was in there focusing
on his monster's voices.

369
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,750
He seems to become stronger
with every passing day.

370
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,083
Think so, devi?

371
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,291
[METAL] Now that Ace is
the Class C Champion,

372
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,250
he's earned the opportunity

373
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,833
to battle the respective
winners of Classes A and B

374
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,875
in the ultimate winner
take all combat round!

375
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,500
[CROWD cheers]

376
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,041
Ace, well done out there.

377
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,208
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

378
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,791
It was a spectacular fight,

379
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,000
and you lived up to the
code of the Dragon Caller.

380
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,041
Watching you rise through
the tournament ranks

381
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,000
reminded me of King.

382
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,541
Master Jest, you knew my father?

383
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,291
Naturally, King was a
great Dragon Caller,

384
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,333
and our rivalry pushed
me toward excellence.

385
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,416
And I remind you of him?

386
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,458
Yes, and I hope you'll grow
to be even more like him

387
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,375
as time goes by.

388
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,416
You and me both, sir.

389
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,250
[TAMAZO whimpers]
Tama.

390
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,833
I still think he's
super scary, tama.

391
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,666
It makes no sense.

392
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,625
How could a human beat me?

393
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,208
[DAFNES]
You still don't get it, do you?

394
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,791
Instead of using fear,

395
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,708
Ace won because of his
bond with his monsters.

396
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,166
If you can't understand
something so simple,

397
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,458
you'll never be a
true Dragon Caller.

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,333
[KROELL growls]

399
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,333
[KROELL]
Ace, I won't forget you,

400
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,541
and someday, I'm going
to make you pay!

401
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,958
[CHARO]
Ace!

402
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,125
--[ACE] Huh?
--Tama?

403
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,000
Hey, guys!

404
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,541
You finally did it, man!

405
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,041
Congratulations, Ace!

406
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,500
You're really making a name
for yourself out there.

407
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,125
Now nobody can
stand in your way!

408
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,916
It isn't over yet, boys.

409
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,291
--Huh?
--Uh?

410
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,208
You're right!

411
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,125
And I need to
become stronger.

412
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,333
The real fight hasn't started.

413
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,166
The true battle is still
right around the corner!

414
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,041
[CROWD cheers]

415
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,666
--[ALL] Uh?
--[TAMAZO] Tama?

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,250
Ladies and Gentlemen!

417
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,875
The finals for Class A will be
getting underway momentarily!

418
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,750
Lance versus Herriot,
and here they come now!

419
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:01,041
[CROWD cheers]

420
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,833
[DEVI]
Ace, White Dumpling,

421
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,375
don't get too cocky just
because you won

422
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,250
the Class C bracket, devi!

423
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,333
The bond between Master Lance
and me is stronger, devi!

424
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:58,500
Next time: "The Strongest
of All Dragon Callers."

425
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,583
Master Lance, are you
gonna do it, devi?
