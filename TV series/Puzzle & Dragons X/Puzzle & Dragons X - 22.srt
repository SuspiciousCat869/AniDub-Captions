[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,083
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,916
the various crises
that threatened our world.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,375
They harnessed the power
of the monsters,

5
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,916
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,875
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,333
Dragon Callers are born
with the special power

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,875
to bridge the gap
between the realms

9
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:35,208
of nature, mankind,
and monsters.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:39,958
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us,

11
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,416
the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters,

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,458
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:29,333
Okay, so where are we
headed off to next?

14
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,416
To the Light City.

Something the matter?

320
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,375
[GARNET]
You guys can go on ahead.

321
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,666
I have one last piece of
business to attend to.

322
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,708
--Huh?
--Tama?

323
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,500
[GARNET] Hello, Valkyrie.
Still here guarding the academy?

324
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,458
Long time no see.

325
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,500
Thanks for being so hard
on me while I was here.

326
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,416
I want to show you exactly
how strong I've become!

327
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,208
Prepare yourself!

328
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,916
Now! Release!

329
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,250
Today's the day that
Angelion and I are gonna

330
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,666
defeat the mighty Valkyrie!

331
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,250
[GARNET]
Angelion!

332
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,125
[ANGELION cries]

333
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,416
I'm not falling
for it this time!

334
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,916
You sent me flying head first

335
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,791
into so many different
things over the years

336
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,000
with that old move of yours!

337
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,583
And it was super annoying!

338
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,750
But after I became a
Guild Dragon Caller,

339
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,375
I started fighting monsters
all over the world.

340
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,291
I finally realized that
you'd been holding back.

341
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,958
That you were only trying
to make me better!

342
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,916
But you can stop that now!

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,166
Test my might! Come at me!

344
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,875
[GARNET]
Like I told you,

345
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,541
I'm not the same
person I used to be.

346
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:06,500
[GARNET] Valkyrie. You were the
best rival a girl could ask for.

347
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,916
[GARNET]
And well, I...

348
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:23,541
[GARNET] I owe you so much.
For everything you've done!

349
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,583
[VALKYRIE] I've been
waiting for this moment.

350
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,791
I'm proud of how much
you've grown, Garnet.

351
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,916
You've achieved your potential.

352
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,125
Let me entrust my soul
into your hands.

353
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,625
I swear, we'll fight
evil together.

354
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,916
And we can be sparkly too!

355
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,541
Hey, cut it out!
What are you up to, egghead?

356
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,625
Tama!

357
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,750
An Armor Drop. There you go!

358
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,416
How'd you do that?

359
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,958
Uh, never mind. I think the
less I know about it the better.

360
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,750
But, all the same, thank you!

361
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,666
[ACE]
A horrifying island inhabited

362
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,583
by monsters called Death.

363
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:51,875
And it was there
that we discovered

364
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,041
the SDF's secret base.

365
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,166
I wonder what those
guys're up to.

366
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,833
Next time! "Breaking
into SDF's Secret Base."

367
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,000
Great, Lance is gonna be there.
