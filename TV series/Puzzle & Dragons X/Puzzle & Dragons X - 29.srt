The Battle Cup,

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,916
where ambitious young Dragon
Callers come to compete against

who's the best of the best.

It's a high-stakes tournament
where matches are fought

Master Lukes, banned Soul Brave,

However, that ban was lifted

[ELDORA] I wonder if lifting
the ban on Soul Brave

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,083
was really the wisest choice.

I was thinkin' the same thing.

But it was rather exciting
to see Ace pull off

36
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:12,291
that Soul Brave. It was almost
like watching King fight.

37

I'm against the decision.

38
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,000
It's unfair, and it's dangerous.

that the strong will win.

However, I'm not as
worried about a rookie

am about Starjohn.

[JEST]
What do you mean?

44
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,666
If something were to go awry,
we could end up losing

one of our Dragon Callers
in this tournament.

for the Dragon Callers
of yesteryear.

In such a high-stakes struggle,

certain concepts like fairness
cease to be relevant issues.

The mighty Dragon

faces off against
Libria's own Charo!

[AGET] Are her monsters
really all Wood element?

I can beat her in
two seconds, flat.

Oh, man! What a gun show!

It seems like he's
gotten even stronger

against him back in Vegahs!

[MAN 29A] But if this Garnet
girl is really such a celebrity,

194
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,958
how come Klein seems to have
so many more fans than her?

195
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,583

She might be a celebrity back in

got the upper hand here.

Hang on.

00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,666
I thought you needed to have
a monster's Soul Armor

204
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,250
if you wanted to use Soul Brave?

205
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:41,041
[MAN 29B] So I guess that means
Klein can't activate Soul Brave.

206
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,375
It's not that I'm incapable.

I just choose not to.

This stage is all ours,
now let's get to work!

324
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,875
[GARNET]
Soul Brave...

325
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,583
...Valkyrie!

326
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,416
[gasps]

327
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,500
What's Garnet doing?

328
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,791
[HERRIOT] She's not fighting
for her own sake.

329
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,291
This time, she's
finding the strength

330
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,583
to fight for someone else.

331
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,000
Uh? Miss Herriot?

332
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,208
That emotion connected with
Valkyrie on a deep level.

333
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,250
That emotion...?

334
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,166
That's right. My guess is

335
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,416
she's fighting for those
who've always supported her.

336
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,250
[GARNET]
Here we go!

337
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:58,458
[METAL] Incredible! Garnet's
Soul Brave is spectacular!

338
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,458
Wow. Amazing!

339
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,208
[CROWD cheers]

340
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,625
[METAL]
She truly is

341
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,833
the strongest celebrity
Dragon Caller!

342
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,875
[METAL]
There it is! The Cross Drop!

343
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,750
It can't be! [growls]

344
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,458
[yells]

345
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,875
Prism Feather Sword Attack!

346
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,416
[yells]

347
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,708
[KLEIN screams]

348
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,916
[panting]

349
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,166
Thank you!

350
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,208
For everything!

351
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,041
This one's for you!

352
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,750
[CROWD cheers]

353
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,166
[FANS]
Garnet! Garnet!

354
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,750
Master!

355
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,833
[METAL] Garnet moves ahead
to the third round!

356
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:09,083
[groans] I can't believe
I was beaten by a human.

357
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,666
[AGET]
Hmph.

358
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,541
The cool hero of justice!

359
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,875
[groans]

360
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,333
[AGET]
Plop...

361
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,375
[METAL] Charo advances
to the third round!

362
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,041
[CROWD cheers]

363
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,041
I just won.

364
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,958
Dude! You defeated Mister Aget!

365
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,166
You're amazing, Charo!

366
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,416
[TAMAZO]
How much longer, tama?

367
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,708
[ACE] I'm startin' to get
really tired of waiting.

368
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,083
[METAL] Surprisingly,
Ace's opponent, Logan,

369
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,833
has yet to make his appearance.

370
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,083
Maybe he got spooked after
Ace used Soul Brave,

371
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,166
but who could blame the
guy for being scared?

372
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,208
Well, what happens if
this opponent of his

373
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,541
doesn't ever show up?

374
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,250
Then Ace is the winner of
the match by default!

375
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:59,416
If so, then it looks like his
next opponent is going to be...

376
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,416
[gasps]

377
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,041
What's the matter?

378
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,458
If his opponent, Logan,
fails to show up,

379
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,375
then Ace's next match is...

380
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,208
[laughs]

381
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,375
[HARU]
...against Charo!

382
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,958
[CHARO] It's been my dream
to become a Dragon Caller,

383
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,791
and entering the Battle Cup
was a dream within a dream!

384
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,416
But me being here
definitely isn't a dream.

385
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,333
Next time:
"Our Friendship Battle."

386
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,041
Ace, let me show
you how I fight!
