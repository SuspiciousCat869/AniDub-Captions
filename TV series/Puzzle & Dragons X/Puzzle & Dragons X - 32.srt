The Battle Cup,

where ambitious young Dragon
Callers come to compete against

who's the best of the best.

of Light, Master Jest.

to know when to use them.

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,375
[STARJOHN]
Attacking her?

165
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,666
You're mistaken.

166
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,000
I wouldn't dream of doing
something like that.

167
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,958
[METAL] The winner of the Class
B Finals is Starjohn!

[CROWD]
Garnet! Garnet!

169
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,125
The crowd is going crazy for
the bravery Garnet showed

170
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,750
in that last battle!

171
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,583
What are you looking at, loser?

172
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,750
I'm ganna take you down,
for Garnet's sake!

173
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,666
[laughs] You say that
with a straight face,

174
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,458
but we both know, I've
beaten you before!

175
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,375
Now that's what I call a battle!

176
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,833
Garnet fought like
a little lioness!

177
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,166
Right, Morgan?

178
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,333
Uh? Morgan?

00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,125
Morgan?

[GARNET whimpers]

181
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,958
Okay. That should
just about do it.

182
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,625
Are you okay?

183
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,833
No. I'm far from okay.

184
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,958
I was dead on arrival.

185
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,916
[TIGER]
Huh?

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,375
[TAMAZO]
Tama?

187
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,000
That goofy expression was
broadcast across the world!

188
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,166
That face killed my
career as an idol!

189
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,333
Oh, that.

190
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,000
Now, now, at least you
have your health!

191
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,791
That's a relief, isn't it Ace?

192
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,375
Oh, yeah!

193
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,791
You realize, it's nearly time
for the next battle to begin.

194
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,875
Huh?! Well, then I've gotta go!

195
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,666
If you win this next round,
you'll be the Class C champion!

196
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,166
Go for it!

[ACE]
Mm-hm.

00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,625
Good luck in the final.

199
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,625
I'm sorry we won't get
our chance to battle.

200
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,416
Oh. Thanks.

201

Take care of yourself, now.

[TAMAZO]
Tama.

203

I'll wipe the floor with
that jerk! I swear it!

204
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,625
Let's do it, tama!

[KROELL chuckles]

209

I'm afraid that's going
to be impossible.

210
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,000
What?

211
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,666
[KROELL] Before you have the
opportunity to face off against

212
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,416
Starjohn, you'll have to
win the finals of Class C.

213
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,583
However, I don't plan
to just let that happen.

214
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,833
And you are...?

215

My name is Kroell, boy,
and I'm not afraid

to get my hands dirty,
if it means winning.

...didn't wash his hands, tama.

220

[DAFNES] Starjohn Junior.
Do you have a minute?

221
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,041
[STARJOHN] Oh, you're
that old lady from before.

222
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,625
I'm not an old lady.

223
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,416
I'm an Ancient!

224
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,625
I knew your father, he was
a capable Dragon Caller.

225
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,625
The sort of man that was
up for any challenge,

226
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,166
and was well respected for
his sense of fairness.

227
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,666
I have better things to
do than get lectured.

228
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,333
I was reminiscing about
Starjohn Senior.

229
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,875
Thinking about what he would
say if he could see you now.

230
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,208
What do you think?

231
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,041
[STARJOHN] You have no right
to talk about that!

232
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,833
Well he's touchy.

233
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,083
I wonder why all
Light-attributed men

234
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,291
have to be so difficult.

235
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,666
[TORLIE] I've never seen
the crowd get so excited

236
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,000
during the matches.

237
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,583
It's because of the SDF's
Drop display technology!

238
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,333
I'd like to thank you
for all your assistance!

239
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,166
I half-expected the
Ancients of the Guild

240
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,208
to roundly reject our
offer of help.

241
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,833
I'll come out and say it.

242
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,291
I was afraid you'd believe
the ability to see Drops

243
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,541
was a privilege reserved
for Dragon Callers.

244
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,416
I personally think this
is an awesome device!

245
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,416
I want everyone to see the
dangers related to the Drops,

246
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,625
and this will help more people
understand how Drops work!

247
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,875
I believe that this is the first
step to a better tomorrow.

248
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,500
Which is precisely what
we believe, Master Torlie.

249
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,958
[NYUDO] Competent, energetic,
though far too ideological.

250

He's a fine young man.

251
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,708
But, he's also quite naive.

252
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,916
With this tech, the
people will gain power

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,583
equal to the Dragonoids and
they'll have the SDF to thank.

254
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,166

Hey, Morgan!
I finally found you!

I wasn't hiding.

Who was that?
You got a new friend?

258
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,416
None of your business.

259
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,541
Come on, who was it?
Just tell me!

260
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,333
What are you doing
all the way out here?

261
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,458
Oh, right!

262
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,875
I was so proud of Garnet,

263
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,166
she saw that battle through
all the way to the end!

264
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,083
Ugh. Such a horrible spectacle.

265
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,208
Oh yeah, that Starjohn kid did
take things a little too far.

266
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,708
No, not him!

267
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,458
I was talking about Garnet!

268
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,250
That fight was so pathetic,
I couldn't even watch it!

269
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,958
She got beaten to a pulp!

270
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,208
Huh?

271
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,958
It's her own fault if
she got herself hurt.

272
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,333
All of those weaklings
should just give up.

273
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,458
What's going on
with you, Morgan?

274
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,541
I see things clearly now.

275
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,291
Only the strong
should be allowed

276
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,958
to become Dragon Callers.

277
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,041
So, what?

278
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,208
You're siding with
that little weasel

279
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,708
who thinks strength
is all that matters?

280
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,500
Oh, my sweet sister.
Life must be nice and simple

281
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,958
for somebody as soft in
the head as you are.

282
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,000
Are you trying to pick
a fight with me?

283
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,750
You want to? Is that it?

284
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,500
You can't actually be serious.

285
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,625
Oh! Of course,
I'm totally kidding.

286
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,083
You never could take a
joke, Herriot. [laughs]

287
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,000
What's gotten into her?

288
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,750
Man, I hope she didn't start
going out with some weirdo.

289
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,875
[JEST] By lifting
the ban on Soul Brave,

290
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,583
the world as we know
it will change.

291
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,458
Everyone has now
witnessed the power

292
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,458
of this age-old technique
for themselves.

293
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,750
No matter how much of a
fuss the Ancients make,

294
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,791
they can't hope to
change this flow.

295
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,416
I'm glad the ban is done.

296
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,958
I've always been pro-Soul Brave.

297
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:52,291
[laughs] And yet, you've never
once used it in real combat.

298
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,291
That's because all of my
opponents were unworthy.

299
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,791
But everything has changed now.

300
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,750
Lance won't need it.

301
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,166
Sorry, Devi. Would you
give us some room?

302

You seem kinda down
in the dumps, devi.

311
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,166
So where's your boss, Lance?

312
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,708
You're always with
him, aren't you?

313
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,958
What about you?!

314
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,875
Don't I usually see you
with your twin, devi?

315
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,041
[BOTH sigh]

316
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,291
If you need someone
to talk to, I'm here.

317
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,583
That's supposed to
be my line, devi.

318
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,375
I've had a plethora
of life experiences!

319
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,625
Yeah, right.

320
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,041
Like I'd spill my problems
to a stress ball.

321
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,583

[screaming]

323
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,500
Stop it.

324
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,541
[gasps] No! Stay away!

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,583
[screams]

326
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,958

[yells]

328
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,750
You should just
do that next time!

329
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,375
Yeah, I guess so.
But isn't that kinda mean?

330
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,916
That kind of
wishy-washy attitude

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,166
is the reason the monsters
keep disrespecting you!

332
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,791
It'll work out anyway, because
you'll always be there for me.

333
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,916
Oh, boy.

334
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,000
[JEST]
Master Lukes!

335
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,083
Yes? What's the matter, Jest?

336
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,708
Something awful
happened to Starjohn.

337
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,666
He was wounded during a battle.

338
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,250
He's desperately in need
of your help, Master Lukes.

339
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,875
[LUKES grunting]

340
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,541
[sighs] That should
take care of it,

341
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,916
but you've pushed yourself
too hard, Starjohn.

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,500
I know, Master.

343
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,708
This time, I couldn't afford to
lose, or to back down at all.

344
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,125
The pride of our tribe
was at stake.

345
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,333
What good is pride to
the tribe if one of their

346
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,500
greatest warriors is
consumed by Soul Brave?

347
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,625
As ever, you speak truly.

348
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,000
This is proof that Soul
Brave is dangerous.

349
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,291
From now on, I intend to
ban its use in the Guild.

350
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,916
But Master, if you ban the use
of Soul Brave within the Guild,

351
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,125
you'll limit the powers

352
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,166
of future generations
of Dragon Callers!

353
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,833
But power isn't everything,
even for a Dragon Caller.

354
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,291
[STARJOHN'S DAD]
I understand.

355
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,958
It's been nice
knowing you, Jest.

356
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,041
Say goodbye to King for me!

357
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,125
So what do you plan to do now?

358
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,875
Develop a new strategy.

359
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,083
I'll work out one that's much
safer to use than Soul Brave.

360
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,166
I see.

361
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,958
I look forward to your success.

362
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,166
[BOTH]
Bye, Starjohn!

363
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,166
Ancient Lukes! I brought
these flowers in for you!

364
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,583
Thank you very much, Morgan.

365
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,333
[HERRIOT]
And this is from me!

366
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,416
Oh, yeah?

367
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,000
I wonder what it could be!

368
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,875
[laughs]

369
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,583
[BOTH gasp]

370
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:29,958
[laughs]

371
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,250
[BOTH laughing]

372
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,500
So, my friends.

373
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,583
I've been thinking about

374
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,375
relinquishing my title
to my disciple.

375
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,166
So then pick me, Master!

376
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,833
I wanna be the next Ancient!

377
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,375
Yeah, Sis would be
a great Ancient!

378
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,750
[laughs] Well, you're still a
little too young, dear child.

379
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,750
But she's gonna grow
up in no time, right?

380
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,916
[HERRIOT]
Mm-hm!

381
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,500
[HERRIOT]
Not long after that,

382
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:59,208
Master Lukes passed away and
our lives completely changed.

383
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,541
Morgan and I had
always been together.

384
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,583
But suddenly, we were separated.

385
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,125
I was reunited with my sister

386
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,208
after graduating
from the Academy.

387
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,416
I saw her for the first time in
years at the Guild Exam site.

388
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,250
[gasps] Morgan.

389
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,000
Is that really you?

390
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,916
Long time no see, Sister!

391
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,125
Wow, Morgan!

392
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,083
It's hard to believe
how grown up you look!

393
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,041
It's been so long!

394
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,583
And I became a Dragon
Caller just like you!

395
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,250
Now, wherever they send
you, I can come too!

396
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,000
I can fight right beside you!

397
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,750
Oh, yeah!

398
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,666
[BOTH sigh]

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,625
She used to be such an
adorable little girl.

400
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,166
Stop squeezin' me!

401
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,250
[HARU]
Ace!

402
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,791
[ACE]
Uh.

403
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,500
Hey, Haru!

404
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,000
I can't believe you made
it to the finals!

405
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,375
Just don't push
yourself too hard.

406
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:00,666
I won't, but I can't afford
to get knocked out.

407
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,083
I get it.

408
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,000
Best of luck in your next match!

409
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,458
Thanks!

410
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,583
Gee, Ace. You're
such a cool guy!

411
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,125
Wha...?

412
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,541
He's the second coolest guy
around here. After me, that is.

413
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,375
Yeah?! I don't think I could
handle Ace being any cooler!

414
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,250
[laughs]

415
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,541
I gotta go.

416
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,291
Good luck out there!

417
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,708
I'm cheering for you
with all my heart!

00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,583
--Thank you!
--Tama!

419
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,583
[TAMAZO] Everybody's
pretty worried, tama.

420
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,333
Especially after watching what
happened in Garnet's battle.

421
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,083
Hey Ace, are you scared
at all, tama?

422
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,500
You could really
get hurt, you know.

423
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,750
Yeah. What's new?

424
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,208
Lukes was misguided.

425
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,958
[LUKES]
But power isn't everything,

426
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,583
even for a Dragon Caller.

427
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,291
You can't hope to achieve
anything that will last

428
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,333
without power to back it.

429
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,791
[METAL]
All right!

430
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,833
The finals for Class C
are about to begin!

431
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,375
It'll be a guaranteed must-see!

432
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,833
[JEST]
So, dawns a new era

433
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,166
for a stronger breed
of Dragon Callers.

434
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,041
Okay! Let's win this!

435
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,291
Tama!

436
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,791
Time to show the world
what I'm made of.

437
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,458
I'll start by taking you down.

438
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,458
[ACE] We've finally reached
the Class C finals.

439
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:52,250
Tamazo, everyone,
we have to win this!

440
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,166
But as it turns out,
my opponent, Kroell,

441
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,333
is a seriously
dangerous guy.

442
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,208
Next time: "Appalling!
Kroell's Whip."

443
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,791
The way he fights is
totally unforgivable!
