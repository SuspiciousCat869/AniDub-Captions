[NARRATOR]
The Battle Cup,

2
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,125
where ambitious young Dragon
Callers come to compete against

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,875
one another and determine
who's the best of the best.

4
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,458
It's a high-stakes tournament
where matches are fought

5
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,708
based on fighter classes.

6
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,625
They're all competing
for the glory,

7
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:38,333
as well as the Golden Egg.

8
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,958
The late Ancient of Light,
Master Lukes, banned Soul Brave,

9
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,458
an ancient Dragon
Caller technique.

10
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,125
However, that ban was lifted

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,916
by the current Ancient
of Light, Master Jest.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,625
Utilizing their Soul Armor
and various monsters,

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:57,416
these Dragon Callers are aiming
to bring home the big win!

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,333
Ready yourselves, challengers,
for the moment of truth!

15
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,666
[METAL] This year's Battle Cup
has been an intense competition.

16
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,000
Lance is the Class A champion.

17
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,458
In Class B, Starjohn,

18
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,958
and after rising
through the ranks,

19
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,625
Ace is the champion of Class C!

20
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,833
And now, Ace and
Starjohn will square off

21
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,750
the winner will be Lance's
opponent in the last battle.

22
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,625
Who will become the
strongest Dragon Caller?

23
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,500
Lance?

24
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:16,000
Starjohn? Or could it be Ace?

25
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,166
[CROWD cheers]

26
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,208
[METAL] Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

27
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,250
The penultimate match of the
tournament will begin shortly.

28
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,166
You only have a few minutes
to return to your seats.

29
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,541
[TORLIE] Ace's power
has grown exponentially

30
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,458
and more rapidly than
I'd ever imagined.

31
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,541
He turned things
around on Kroell,

32
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,833
he might even have as
much skill as luck.

33
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,708
Oh. Yes.

34
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,125
He might at that,
maybe he'll even win!

35
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,000
[ELDORA]
But Starjohn is in Class B,

36
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,916
an entire rank ahead of Ace,

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,541
so it will be quite a challenge.

38
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,000
[JEST]
I suppose anything's possible.

39
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,083
In any case, it will be
an interesting battle.

40
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,541
The real battle's
about to start.

41
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,291
I refuse to let him win.

42
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,291
Just don't give up, and always
remember to go for the top!

43
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,625
Our objective is to pulverize
that obnoxious brat, tama!

44
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,791
You're so much stronger
than you were.

45
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,833
I know you've got what
it takes to defeat him!

46
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,500
Yeah.

[STARJOHN]
The way you fight.

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,208
I think it's really cool!

52
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:45,375
You must've trained really
hard to get to where you are.

53
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,166
So awesome!

54
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,083
I wish I could become a cool
Dragon Caller like you!

I am a god.

You're stubborn, aren't ya?

[ACE]
I won't let him off easily.

72
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,958
It's payback time.

73
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,625
[GARNET] You can't afford
to underestimate him

74
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,166
just because you've
gotten stronger.

[CHARO]
Garnet?

76
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,083
[GARNET]
Starjohn's strength is palpable.

77
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,791
He can't be overcome
with willpower

78
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:58,208
or fighting spirit alone.
He'll back you into a corner.

79
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,125
How will you react when he does?

80
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,250
That's the key to victory.

81
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,333
Garnet's actually dishing
out good advice, tama.

82
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,333
That's strange.

83
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,708
She doesn't seem like herself.

00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,875
I know.

85
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,708
Maybe she took too many
blows to the head?

I'll be watching.

I'll even half-heartedly
wish you "good luck."

Of course, I don't
expect you to win.

93
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,666
[ACE] This must be so
frustrating for her.

94
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,833
And still, she gave you
that little pep-talk.

95
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,708
You'll have to fight
for Garnet, Ace,

00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,625
and for the rest of
us who are out.

a crowd for the next fight.

Nefer, and Verche!

164
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,541
[METAL] Ace was able to make
the first strike, however,

165
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,916
all of his attacks were avoided
or blocked by Starjohn!

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,375
Now that was just adorable.

167
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,541
It's like you really
think a Class C loser

168
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,500
stands a chance against
someone like me.

169
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,666
That's right. I've gotten
stronger since last time.

170
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,083
And I'm going to stop you here!

171
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,541
[yells]

172
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,791
Tamazo! Dark Dragon Knight!

173
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,333
Let's go!

174
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,666
[DARK DRAGON KNIGHT roars]

175
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,333
[TAMAZO yells]

176
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,416
[yells]

177
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,000
Ouka! Blast him!

178
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,083
[STARJOHN screams]

179
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,291
[ZEUS]
Huh?

180
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,250
[METAL]
That one was a clean hit!

181
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,416
Ouka's attack makes it through
Starjohn's defenses!

182
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,333
[CROWD cheers]

183
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,458
[BOTH laugh]

184
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,500
Way to go out there!

185
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,208
Now, keep it up!

186
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,833
He had his heart set on letting
his monsters hit first,

187
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,750
so he waited to use Soul Brave.

188
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,458
But from here on out,
it's different.

189
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,458
All right! Come back!

190
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,833
[TAMAZO]
Yeah!

191
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,833
Horus! Soul Brave.

192
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,958
There it is!

193
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,041
Ace's Soul Brave is active!

194
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:05,375
[ACE yells]

195
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,708
[METAL]
Uh-oh, swing and a miss!

196
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,375
What?

197
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,375
[LENA, HARU gasp]

198
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,750
[ANGENE]
Uh!

199
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,958
No, Ace.

200
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,458
I'm afraid it won't
be that easy.

201
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,750
Huh. So now you've
activated your Soul Brave.

202
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,750
Good work.

203
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,625
Really. I'm impressed.

204
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,875
[STARJOHN]
But you're still just a Class C.

205
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,416
You can't hope to defeat me,
even with Soul Brave.

206
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,166
You knocked me down
in front of this crowd,

207
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,041
you're gonna pay for
that humiliation.

208
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,583
Wrath of God.

209
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,041
[screams]

210
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,666
[METAL] Zeus lands his
Wrath of God attack!

211
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,500
That's gotta hurt!

212
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,500
Ace!

213
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,833
Come on!

214
00:12:58,916 --> 00:12:59,958
I knew it.

215
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,791
Backed into a corner.

216
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,583
[gasps] Oh, my Drops.

217
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:10,500
Don't even think about it!
Go Verche! Nefer!

218
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,291
[ACE groans]

219
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,833
[HARU gasps]

220
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,250
[METAL] Starjohn's leader
skill multiplies Nefer

221
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,208
and Verche's attack power
to be eight times higher!

222
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,666
Didn't you say you'd
changed since I beat you?

223
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,083
'Cause you're still
pretty weak in my opinion.

224
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,375
I expected you to put up a
better fight than this, though.

225
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,541
But then, you are a Class C.

226
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,458
No. I'd say you're a D...

227
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,625
E... F...

228
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,208
Class G or H. Who knows?

229
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,000
Maybe they'll start
a Class Z for ya!

230
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,750
[exhales] Cute.

231
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,375
I'm not going to waste
Zeus's attack on you.

232
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,500
Nefer!

233
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,000
Verche!

234
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,958
[METAL]
Ace is under assault again!

235
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,333
[ALL gasping]

236
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,708
[METAL] And he doesn't have
access to his monsters!

237
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,833
[VERCHE roars]

238
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,916
[METAL] He's really got his back
against the wall this time!

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,625
[panting]

240
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,333
[panting]

241
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:35,458
[ACE] No, am I going to
lose to him, again?

242
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,916
[TAMAZO]
Never give up!

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,083
[gasps]

244
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,166
Tamazo!

245
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,500
[TAMAZO]
Ace, we're still here for you!

246
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,958
Believe in us!

247
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,083
Believe in yourself!

248
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,916
In myself...?

249
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:54,250
[STARJOHN laughs]

250
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,458
Game over.

251
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,166
Don't underestimate us!

252
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,583
[yells]

253
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,333
[STARJOHN groans]

254
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,125
A last minute save!

255
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,166
What a beautiful counterstrike
coming from Ace!

256
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,000
All right!

257
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,958
The monsters reached
out to help him!

258
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,541
It's like their hearts are
joined as one fighting force!

259
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,125
His monsters made that
attack independently,

260
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,833
because their master
needed their help.

261
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,250
That's Ace's true power.

262
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,208
Wow, not bad, Ace.

263
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,750
No way!

264
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,541
[groans] Nefer, Verche, what
were you worthless idiots doing,

265
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,125
letting him get the drop
on us like that?!

266
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,833
Hurry up and come back here now!

267
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,833
That boy is the absolute worst.

268
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,458
Why is he so rude?

269
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,958
Starjohn doesn't
have a connection

270
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,708
to his monsters like Ace does.

271
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,041
[LENA, HARU]
Uh?

272
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,666
And not just the monsters.

273
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,458
That child has no one.

274
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,208
[ACE gasps]

275
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,625
[METAL] Ace's Soul Brave
is active again!

276
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,875
[ACE yelling]

00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,875
[STARJOHN screams]

279
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,041
It looks like Ace still
has plenty of fight!

280
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,875
[STARJOHN] How could you
wimps let this happen?!

281
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,958
I expected more
from you dummies!

282
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,166
Why don't you start
fighting better, huh?!

283
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,583
Hey, now!

284
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,166
Don't go takin' your mistakes
out on your own team!

285
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,625
He's right! That's just ugly!

286
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,958
[MAN 35B]
Hey, hotshot!

287
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,333
Why don't you take care
of your monster's health?

288
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,541
[STARJOHN]
Huh? What's that?

289
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,541
Hold on.

290
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,958
Why are all of those people

291
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,083
sitting in the
audience booing me?

292
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,166
Oh, I get it! I need to recover
my monster's health!

293
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,625
Easy enough.
Time for Holy String!

294
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,708
[gasps]

295
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,041
[STARJOHN]
Get him!

296
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,000
[STARJOHN]
What's wrong with you, Zeus?

297
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,291
Get the lead out, would ya?

298
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,416
Something's up with Zeus.
He's moving strangely.

299
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,041
I wonder if the Heart
Drops he pulled

300
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,375
weren't enough to heal him?

301
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,333
[ZEUS growls]

302
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,541
[ACE] He didn't receive the
healing benefits of Holy String?

303
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,166
Of course! I've got it!

304
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,916
[ACE]
You guys aren't a real team!

305
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,541
You've just been fighting
individually this whole time!

306
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,916
[gasps]

307
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,458
[METAL]
Unbelievable!

308
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,500
A shocking factoid has been
revealed at a critical moment!

309
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,208
Apparently, Starjohn didn't
release Zeus at all!

310
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,625
What?! Really?

311
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,500
[ELDORA] It looks like
Ace figured it out.

312
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,208
[DAFNES]
Yes, Starjohn's Achilles Heel.

313
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,916

00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,916
Go Ace! Go Ace!

Go Ace! Go Ace! Go Ace! Go Ace!

320
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,208
Thank you.

321
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,708
I can't accept
the way you fight,

322
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,375
that's why I have to beat you!

323
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,166
Right now!

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,166

Whatever! I don't need
you guys anyway!

326
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,333
I'll take him down
all by myself!

327
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,875
[JEST]
This battle is over.

328
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,000
[LANCE]
Let's go, Devi.

329
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,291
[DEVI]
Okie dokie, devi!

330
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,416
[squawks]

331
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,791
[ACE]
God Burning...

332
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,458
...Attack!

333
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,666
[screams]

334
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,083
[VERCHE groans]

335
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,625
[screams]

336
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,875
[ZEUS groans]

337
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,083
[STARJOHN whimpers]

338
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,875
[laughs nervously]

339
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,666
Okay, so now it's
my turn, right?

340
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,041
Zeus.

341
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,208
Hey, Zeus!

342
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,625
Get him!

343
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,541
[ZEUS]
I can't.

344
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,500
We are defeated.

345
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,750
What?! Uh?

346
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,166
What do you think you're doing?!

347
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,875
Get up and give him
the Wrath of God, already!

348
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,666
[ZEUS grunts]

349
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,500
Young warrior,
the victory is yours.

350
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,875
A concession. Ace wins!

351
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,833
Master Jest, the
Ancient of Light,

352
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,250
has just called the fight!
Congratulate our victor.

353
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,333
The Class C champion, Ace!

354
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,458
[CROWD cheering]

355
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,958
Lena! Ace did it!

356
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,291
I never imagined my boy
would make it this far!

357
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,333
Indeed.

358
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,875
He keeps surprising us,
doesn't he?

359
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,250
I feel I deserve a
little credit for his win.

360
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,666
[CHARO]
Ace!

361
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,791
[TIGER]
Ace!

362
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,541
That was a great battle!

363
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,125
You just put on a total
butt-kicking clinic, my man!

364
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,208
Just watching it got
me all fired up!

365
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,750
I heard you guys cheering
for me when I was struggling.

366
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,625
It gave me strength.

367
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,583
[ALL gasp]

368
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,791
We did it!

369
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,750
Did you see that, tama?

370
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,958
Want some more, tama?!

371
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,291
Starjohn...

372
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,916
This is your fault!

373
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,500
We lost the match,
and it's all your fault!

374
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,583
[ZEUS grunts]

375
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,791
[STARJOHN]
Did ya hear me?!

376
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,541
I said it's all your fault!

377
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,750
[TAMAZO] Looks like he didn't
change the slightest bit, tama.

378
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,583
Guess not.

379
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,166
[VAHATON] It seems like
our young Ace has a knack

380
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,458
for forging connections
with everyone.

381
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,708
[TORLIE] Person to person,
person to monster,

382
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,250
and maybe even human
to Dragonoid.

383
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,291
[VAHATON] Abilities like
his have the power

384
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,125
to change the world,
for the better, hopefully.

385
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,375
[TORLIE]
Yes.

386
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,250
The outcome is as expected.

387
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,916
[JEST]
The Ancients are all too naive.

388
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,750
One day, Dragoza Island will
have to face grave danger.

389
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,666
I wish to prevent that.

390
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,083
That's the truth.

391
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,458
I lifted the ban on Soul Brave
during this Battle Cup

392
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,875
for that very reason.

393
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,291
I will save Dragoza
Island from danger.

394
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,166
And I'll show the
Ancients my power.

395
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,666
The power to protect our home,
to keep it safe.

396
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,083
By defeating him.

397
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:11,458
At last, it's the final battle.

398
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,458
[ACE] It's almost time for
my match against Lance.

399
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,875
He's been cocky since
the first day we met.

400
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,875
And I was never able
to get ahead.

401
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,416
But maybe now...

402
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,791
Next time: "Battle!
Ace Versus Lance."

403
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,458
Lance, let's do this!
