The Battle Cup,

Callers come to compete against

who's the best of the best.

Utilizing their Soul Armor
and various monsters,

these Dragon Callers are aiming
to bring home the big win!

What's going on, Master Vahaton?

00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,916
His Soul Armor is reacting that
way because it cannot keep up

with the sheer magnitude
of Ace's power.

That's right.

31
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,416
The combination of his Tamadra's
power with Horus and the use

32
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,958
of Soul Brave has increased
Ace's strength exponentially.

Now that Ace's fighting with

Awesome! I never even knew
Soul Armor could evolve!

Ace's willpower seems to have
really resonated with Horus,

and brought him to
the next level!

Did he just evolve his armor
into Flame Deity Horus?

56
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,791
He resonates with Horus's power,

57
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,166
though perhaps some of the
credit should go to the Tamadra.

Ace and his team are
full of surprises!

60
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,333
The use of Soul Brave
has helped him connect

61
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:29,041
with his monsters and it seems
his Soul Armor followed suit.

00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,875
It's time to end this!

333
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,375
[yells]

334
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,166
These guys aren't holding back!

335
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,416
Oh, no!

336
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,375
Poor Ace doesn't stand
a chance against that!

337
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,958
[yells]

338
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,083
[DEVI] He's annoyingly
persistent, devi!

339
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,583
That's a ton of Cross Drops.

340
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:59,000
[ACE yells]

341
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,458
[yells]

342
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,666
[yells]

343
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,125
[ANGENE]
In his first Battle Cup,

344
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,458
Ace learned just how much
power he had inside of him.

345
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,208
Now, perhaps, the time
has finally come.

346
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,666
Next time:
"Their Separate Ways."

347
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,916
It's time you and I had
a much-needed chat, Ace.
