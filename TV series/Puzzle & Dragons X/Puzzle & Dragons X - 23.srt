00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,916
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,083
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,916
the various crises
that threatened our world.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,375
They harnessed the power
of the monsters,

5
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,958
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:26,916
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,333
Dragon Callers are born
with the special power

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,875
to bridge the gap
between the realms

9
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:35,166
of nature, mankind,
and monsters.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,916
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,375
the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters,

12
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,416
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,791
[ACE]
Sonia!

14
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,958
You're here.
Thank you for coming.

15
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,166
Do you feel that?

16
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,291
The flow of Drops on
this island seems weird.

17
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,458
Almost as if it's
restless, tama!

18
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,916
It feels like a Drop Impact
is about to happen, tama!

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,333
That's right.

20
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,291
With these conditions,
it could occur at any moment.

21
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,500
I need your help.

22
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,833
I'm trying to locate
a particular monster.

23
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,083
What are you trying to find?

24
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,625
He's named Hades.

25
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,625
He has been called
"God of the Underworld."

26
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,458
[ACE]
The underworld?

27
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,791
He has also been known as Death.

28
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,458
--Tama?!
--Are you kidding me?

29
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,583
He sounds like a
terrifying monster!

30
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,458
Hades tends to attack people
by controlling monsters' minds.

31
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,708
So I came here to stop him.

32
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,458
[ACE] Then he's
somewhere on this island?

33
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,916
[SONIA] Yes. The Guild received
a report that he'd been sighted.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,416
Let's split up and look for him.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,375
Count on us, ma'am.

36
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,916
Wherever he is,
it's nowhere nearby.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Sonia said the monster
was known as Death.

38
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm scared, tama.

39
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,583
What if he possesses us and
we join his undead army?

40
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,208
Hades, huh?

41
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,000
I think I've run into him
before, back in Vienna City.

42
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,666
But this place isn't
anything like Vienna City.

43
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,666
I mean, it's a
deserted island, tama!

44
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,666
[rumbling]

45
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,083
--[ACE gasps]
--Tama?

46
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,583
I guess it isn't deserted, tama.

47
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,625
It's the SDF!

48
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,166
I didn't know they
had a base here.

49
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,291
I wonder if the Guild knows
they're so close to Dragoza.

50
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,041
Security looks
pretty tight, tama!

51
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,375
[TAMAZO]
Tama!

52
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,125
Hey! Been a while,
White-Dumplin'!

53
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,875
Hiya, tama!

54
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,291
Of course I'd run into you here.

55
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,916
I could say the very same
thing about the two of you!

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,208
I was tracking down
a Drop disruption.

57
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,041
I knew that something
mysterious must be going on,

58
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,083
but I never expected that
the SDF would be involved.

59
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,583
Huh? What d'you mean?

60
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,750
It's clear to me now
that the Drop disturbance

61
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,958
and the SDF must be connected.

62
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,458
Time for us to learn how.

63
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,208
Okay, cool. You got a plan?

64
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,583
I don't think getting
inside is going to be easy.

65
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,666
Not an issue.

66
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,000
Leave it to Master Lance, devi!

67
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,583
He's already got everything
figured out, devi!

68
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,250
What's your plan?

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,208
Who goes there?

70
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,375
Hello. I'm a Guild
Dragon Caller.

71
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,083
You will let me inside.

72
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,125
Tama?

73
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,458
That's the plan you
came up with?!

74
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,000
Walk up and ask him?!

75
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,083
My, such a
straight-forward approach!

76
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,083
How very manly of you!

77
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,500
Are you kidding me?

78
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,041
I can't let anyone in without
the proper clearance.

79
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,125

80

I'm watching on the monitor.

83
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,833
Do you want me to
chase them away?

84
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,958
No, stand down. Open
the gate for our guests.

85
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,375
[GUARD A]
Sir?

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,833
[NUDO] This is a Research
and Development facility.

87
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,958
And I manage the various
projects we've been working on.

88
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,750
What kind of research
does the SDF need to do?

89
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,875
We study Drops
and monster biology

90
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,041
to better protect the people.

91
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,041
The more we learn, the
more efficient we'll become.

92
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,000
Hard to believe that's
all you're up to.

93
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,250
Huh. Just what are you implying?

94
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,625
[LANCE] You must know what's
happening

95
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,041
to the Drops on this island.

96
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,708
I'm inclined to think
you're the cause

97
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,500
of the Drop disturbance
in the first place.

98
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,458
It's no use lyin', devi!

99
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,958
Now spill the beans, what have
you guys really been up to?

100
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,500
I see.

101
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,625
So that's the true reason
distinguished guests

102
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,333
such as yourselves decided
to pay us a visit.

103
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,958
All right, I'll
make an exception,

104
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,750
and show you what
we've been working on.

105
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,875
Perhaps then we'll be
cleared of suspicion?

106
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,916
So what's this thingy?

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,958
A head-held television?

108
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,833
It's a prototype technology.

109
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,666
The visor allows the
wearer to see Drops

110
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,416
like a Dragon Caller would.

111
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,458
That's awesome!

112
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,833
Then people like Mom and Haru

113
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,750
could see the
beauty of the Drops!

114
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,833
That's right, and
in the near future.

115
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,708
[TAMAZO]
I can't see anything, tama.

116
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,666
I told you,
it's under development.

117
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,208
People believe in what they
can see with their own eyes.

118
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,375
This technology will make
the populace more aware

119
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,333
of the true danger
of Drop disturbances.

120
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,666
Does this put your mind
at ease? I hope so.

121
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,625
We are very proud
of our research,

122
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,541
and we at the SDF
will continue striving

123
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,041
to safeguard the
future of this world.

124
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,333
A device that would make
everyone able to see Drops.

125
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,708
That seems like a
worthwhile project.

126
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,958
I guess the SDF is
pretty useful, tama!

127
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,750
Yup!

128
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,916
We only saw one of the projects.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,791
He's hiding something.

130
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,041
So what should we do?

131
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:12,875
I'm not sure.

132
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:13,416
Devi?

133
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,791
Tama?

134
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,583
A monster! They caged him!

135
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,541
Lance, I didn't know
you would be here.

136
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,916
Yeah! We bumped into each other!

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,958
We weren't able to locate Hades,

138
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,625
but we stumbled
across an SDF base.

139
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,666
There's an SDF base?

140
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,875
That's right,

141
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,375
and I'm pretty sure
there's a correlation

142
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,333
between them and the
recent Drop disturbance.

143
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,500
I discovered something as well.

144
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,458
There are no monsters left on
this island. They've vanished.

145
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,750
What?

146
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,708
The SDF must be to blame.

147
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,458
We even saw a monster
they captured.

148
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,958
The monsters utilize Drops
as a food-like energy source.

149
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,500
Without monsters, the flow
of Drops is disturbed

150
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,541
and becomes imbalanced,
which leads to Drop Impacts.

151
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,583
How can they not understand
something so simple?

152
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,625
They do. It's intentional.

Wait, what are you saying?

155
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,458
They're causing
the Drop disturbance,

156
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,083
and they're doing
it purposefully?

00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:48,083
[alarm blaring]

163
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,208
[OPERATOR A] Systems have
detected a Drop Impact, sir.

164
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,708
It's located in the
Northwest forest.

165
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,833
We're picking up a rogue
energy signature now.

166
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,458
Sir! It's a monster!

167
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,916
Deploy all troops!

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,750
Don't let that monster
come near this base!

169
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,541
[beeping]

170
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,625
[OPERATOR C] Adjutant Nudo.
Cameras show an intruder, sir!

171
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,708
[DEVI]
Devi.

172
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,541
[roars]

173
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,000
They have all these poor
monsters locked up!

174
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,708
What a buncha meanies, devi!

175
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,000
Time to set you all free, devi.

176
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,958
[NUDO] I'm afraid I have
to stop you there.

177
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,500
Devi?

178
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,625
Sometimes you don't
get what you want.

179
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,666
Each of those monsters
is a test subject

180
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,125
vital to the furthering
of our research.

181
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,750
[DEVI]
Devi?

182
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,666
I demand that you
release them immediately.

183
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,583
Or I'll be forced to
report this to the Guild.

184
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,125
[NUDO]
Hm.

185
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,625
And what can the
Guild do about it?

186
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,750
[LANCE] Are you crazy?
You're a Dragonoid!

187
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,375
Why would you side
with the humans?

188
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,916
You take a great deal of pride
in being a Dragonoid, don't you?

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,541
It's almost as if you
consider our entire species

190
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,166
to be infallible.

191
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,458
I was much like you
when I was younger.

192
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,375
But I have watched
the Dragonoids' power

193
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,916
wane over the years.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,166
This planet is in
imminent danger.

195
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,875
Relying on old values
won't save us.

196
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,583
Let's look at things critically.

197
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,916
The Dragonoids' racial powers
aren't helping any of us.

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,791
The Guild is well on its way
towards collapse from within.

199
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:43,875
What was that?

200
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,666
[NUDO]
The humans aren't our enemies.

201
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,916
You need to determine
who the true foes are.

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,666
You don't want someone to
pull the rug out from under you.

203
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,875
Hey, Lance!

204
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,041
What is it?

205
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,166
I came to help you
rescue the monsters!

206
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,833
Button pushing time, tama!

207
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,416
[roars]

208
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,666
Opening all the cages, tama!

209
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,833
Now's our chance! Let's move it!

210
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,500
Take aim! Don't let any
of the monsters escape!

211
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,500
The monsters haven't
done anything to them!

212
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,208
Savages.

213
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,250
Halt! Who are you?

214
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,041
[SONIA] It's not enough that
you used the monsters,

215
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,583
now you have to cause them pain?

216
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll take on the lot of you!

217
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,791
[yells]

218
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,708
How dare you!

219
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,125
[ACE]
No, Sonia! Stop!

220
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,666
[roars]

221
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,250
Look out, Ace!

222
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,416
[yelps]

223
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,083
Sonia, no!

224
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,291
Ready? Engage!

225
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,083
[ACE]
Sonia!

226
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm okay. Just dazed.

227
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,333
Hades is using his mind
control on that Leviathan.

228
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,625
Now it's your turn.

229
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,583
I know you've got what
it takes to stop him.

230
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,708
Time to stand and fight, tama!

231
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll go take down Hades.
You guys handle the Leviathan.

232
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:20,916
Let's go, Devi!

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,291
[DEVI]
Devi

234
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,833
Armor Drop, devi!

235
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,250
[LANCE]
Cross-On!

236
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,500
[LANCE]

Tama, tama, tama, tama,
tama! Cross-On, tama!

240
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,250
Awesome!

241
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,000
[ACE]
Let's do this! White Dragon!

242
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,250
Ouka! Dark Dragon Knight!

243
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,458
Our attacks are no good!

244
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,333
[roars]

245
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,083
Are you recording everything?

246
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,250
[OPERATOR D]
Yes, sir.

247
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,875
Monitors are also
capturing Drop activity

248
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,583
thanks to our camera sensors.

249
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,583
Perfect.

250
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:26,291
We're paying a steep price,
but for significant returns.

251
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,791
Here he comes, Ace!

252
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,666
Blue Troll!

253
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,208
Your place is the
underworld. Return!

254
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,666
Now go. Aoyaiba!

255
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,250
Okay! Let's do this, Tamazo!

256
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,083
Gungnir!

257
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,708
This is your chance, Ace!

258
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,875
[yells]

259
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,291
He's back to normal.

260
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,416
He became an Egg Drop.

261
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Looks like we did it, tama.

262
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,875
[ACE]
Mh-hm.

263
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,708
[ACE gasps]

264
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:54,125
[HADES] You cannot defeat me.
I will always return.

265
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,583
Hades. What a
horrifying monster.

266
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,416
The SDF must have somehow
brought him to this island.

267
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,333
He shouldn't be here.

268
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,375
[KING]
Hello there.

269
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,541
Leave this place.
You humans are disruptive.

270
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,708
No, just listen.

271
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,083
I am not your enemy.

272
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,291
I came because I heard a
Dragon Caller lived out here.

273
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,750
[SONIA]
What do you want?

274
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,291
I came because our
planet is in peril,

275
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,500
and I need your
help to protect it.

276
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,625
I don't work with humans.
Now get out!

277
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,125
So you plan to stay in
this forest all by yourself?

278
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,666
You can only achieve
so much on your own.

279
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,416
[yells]

280
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,791
[gasps]

281
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:00,750
Don't let your talents go
to waste. That'd be a shame.

282
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,250
There's a place in the Guild
for people with your abilities.

283
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,625
Humans and monsters
can co-exist,

284
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,250
but it all starts with a choice.

285
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,125
So what's yours?

286
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,791
How are you feeling?

287
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,583
You had me worried.

288
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,666
[SONIA]
Did you carry me in here?

289
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,875
I did.

290
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,083
It's been so long since
I last had a dream.

291
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,416
I saw an old friend this time.

292
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,833
Easy, now. You're still injured.

293
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,625
It's just a scratch,
nothing serious.

294
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,875
I'll be just fine.

295
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,625
I'm the child of a union between
a Dragonoid and a monster.

296
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,958
Hybrid offspring aren't very
common in either world.

297
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,291
[ACE]
What?

298
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,000
The monster blood in my
veins gives me power,

299
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,916
but I can't live a normal life.

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,333
It's my curse, so I chose
to hide away in the forest

301
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,000
and live amongst the monsters.

302
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,166
But why'd you live with them?

303
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,666
Because I'm able to understand
the monsters' intentions.

304
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,458
Mostly. But I didn't know
how to use my power.

305
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,333
All I could really do was hate
those who ruined the forest.

306
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,708
Then I met someone who
put me on the path

307
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,125
to becoming a Dragon Caller.

308
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,375
But if I had never met him,

309
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,125
I might've used my powers
incorrectly, hurt somebody,

310
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,833
or even worse.

311
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,458
But that isn't you.

312
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,458
He saved me, and now you've
rescued me as well.

313
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,750
[chuckles]

314
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,958
What? Uh. Come on.
I didn't do that much!

315
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,041
Looks like the Drop
disturbance has settled down.

316
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,458
Hi, Sonia! Are you
feeling better, tama?

317
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,250
I am.

318
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,041
[TAMAZO]
That makes me happy, tama!

319
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,458
Good thing she's
all right, devi!

320
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,791
Let's go.

321
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,250
The entire balance of Drops

322
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,375
is maintained because
of the monsters.

323
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,708
Humans and monsters will have
to find a way to co-exist,

324
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:44,250
and the Dragon Callers are our
best hope to bridge that divide.

325
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,708
You're right.

326
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,916
There's still so much about
this job I have to learn.

327
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,625
But I...

328
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,458
I know one thing with
absolute certainty.

329
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:59,083
Whether you're a human or a
monster doesn't matter to me.

330
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,625
This is everyone's planet, and
we all have to fight for it!

331
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,791
Yes, that's right, Ace.

332
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,041
What do you say?
Want to fight for it together?

333
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,208
[ACE]
Yes.

334
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,625
[TAMAZO] Star John, a
Dragon Caller so powerful

335
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,750
that gods serve him!

336
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,541
But his identity
remains a secret.

337
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,041
He's powerful, but no
one knows him, tama?

338
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,375
Sounds fishy, tama.

339
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,000
Next time! "The One
Protected by Gods."

340
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,541
God only knows who
he really is, tama.
