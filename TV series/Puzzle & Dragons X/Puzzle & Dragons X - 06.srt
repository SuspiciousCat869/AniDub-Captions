[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,666
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,208
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,958
They harnessed
the power of the monsters

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:22,083
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,125
They were... the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,500
[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers
are born with the special power

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,250
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature,

9
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,625
mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:40,250
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us,

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,708
the Dragon Callers will rise up
with their monsters...

12
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,416
...and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,791
[ACE] This is
my hometown, Vienna City.

14
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,666
Not long ago, our city was
the site of a Drop Impact.

15
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,750
[ACE] This is a Guild
Dragon Caller named Lance.

16
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,041
And even though he's
responsible for saving our town,

17
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,833
I think he's also pretty rude.

[TAMAZO]
Taa...ma!

19
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,750
[ACE]
And this little guy is Tamazo.

20
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,958
He's a weirdo monster
who loves people food

21
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,958
that I hatched from a
strange egg I found.

22
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,666
Don't give up yet, Tama!

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,791
[ACE] From the moment
Tamazo and I met,

24
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:53,625
my power as a Dragon Caller
was awakened.

Jya-ha! As if I
would ever lose to you!

Why are you competing
with me, you weirdo?

Don't forget to set
the egg in your D-Gear.

you've really leveled up!

He won't let you down, Devi!

By the way,

I've sensed a great disturbance

dissipated a Drop Impact

Help me, Tamazo!

323
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,041
Tama? Behold! Gungnir!

324
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,416
That is not good.

325
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,958
[BALROG roars]

326
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,541
It's up to me!

327
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,125
[yells]

328
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,458
[ACE groans]

329
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,583
[BALROG roars]

330
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,416
He put in five combos
and it did nothing!

331
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Ace doesn't have
enough monsters to win...

332
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,791
[gasps]

333
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,208
Oh no! He's about
to use his Mirage Flare!

334
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,708
Ace, you have to run!

335
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,875
[BALROG roars]

336
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,208
[gasps]

337

[OUKA barks]

338
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,708
No... He's down!

339
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,666
And to have Soul Armor
on top of that?!

340
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,125
I bet you're unstoppable!

341
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,750
Whoa, unstoppable?

342
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,875
[CHARO]
You're a real big-shot now!

343
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,666
Evil-doers, make way for me!

344
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,166
[CHARO]
Awesome!

345
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,208
I'm amped up!

346
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,333
It's my fault...
I made him think that...

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,625
[TAMAZO whines]
Tama...

348
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,041
[ACE groans]
Just hang in there...

349
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,791
--[CHARO gasps]
--[ACE yells]

350
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,500
Oh no, Ace! [gasps]

351
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,750
Can you hear me?! Ace!

352
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,958
[gasps]

353
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,291
All these Drops. How?

354
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,416
This just proves that
Ace was trying his hardest.

355
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,041
[CHARO whimpers]
I see every color of Drop,

356
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,625
and I can't do anything to help!

357
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,833
[BALROG roars]

358

[gasps]

359
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,041
[CHARO]
Huh...?

360
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:39,083
[LANCE] Idiots. I told you
to stay out of my business.

361
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,791
You need to recognize
your own limitations.

362
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,458
You should've fought him
closer to the city.

363
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,416
You both have a lot to learn.

364
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,958
[CHARO whimpers]

365
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,083
[LANCE]
Stay back.

366
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,000
[DEVI]
Hah! Cross-On, Devi!

367
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,916
[DEVI yells]

368
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,333
Yeah, Devivebub, go!

369
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,000
Thank you, sir.

370
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,625
[LANCE] You misunderstand.
This is for the city.

371
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,375
Dragon Lord Zaerog Armor!

372
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,875
[LANCE]
Cross-on!

373
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,000
Black Dragon's Wrath, activate!

374
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,750
[LANCE yells]

375
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,625
Time for you to go back.
You're finished!

376
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,875
Please, Ace... Wake up!

377
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,208
[CHARO sobs]

378
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,291
You have to!

379
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,750
Ace!

380
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,333
[TAMAZO]
Ace is in trouble, Tama!

381
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:53,208
So, does this mean he's
stepping out of the spotlight?

382
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,000
No way, Tama!

383
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,166
Next time! "The Path to
Guild Dragon Caller," Tama!

384
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,291
You've got a lot to learn
before you're stronger!
