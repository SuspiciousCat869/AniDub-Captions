[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,750
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,708
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,166
They harnessed
the power of the monsters,

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,666
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,166
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,083
[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers
are born with the special power

8
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,916
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,958
mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,750
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us...

11
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:43,166
...the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,708
and restore balance
to our world.

This guy's gettin'

Tama.

Hi, and welcome to

Where the people come
to ask for assistance!

30
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,041
And am I right to assume

31
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,666
that you're Guild
Dragon Caller Ace?

32
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,166
Yeah, but how did you know that?

33
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,500
Master Jest told me.

34
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,000
The Ancient of Light
mentioned you specifically!

35
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,541
He said you were very promising!

36
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,500
Aw, shucks.
I don't know about that!

37
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,000
Someone's famous now!

38
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,291
Mister Big Shot!

39
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,250
Well, now that you're here, Ace,

40
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,166
we have a contract we
hoped you'd take!

41
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,916
[TAMAZO]
He looks scary, tama!

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,416
This dragon has been acting
quite aggressive lately,

43
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,916
and so we've had to
close certain roads

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,583
which has made travel
very inconvenient.

45
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,291
Which means you need
someone to put a stop to it.

46
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,583
You can count on me!

47
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,666
Wait, what?

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,250
Let's take on an
easier mission, tama!

49
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,625
I just knew we could count on

50
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,250
a hero like you to lend
a helping hand!

51
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,916
You'll be working
with Mister Lance

on this mission
as his assistant.

Tama doesn't
taste good, Mister Dragon!

And what's the big idea,
letting him spot you?

58
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,291
I can't help it
if my star-like qualities

59
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,916
shine through, tama!

[TAMAZO]
It's a dead-end, tama!

63
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,416
Then we have no choice.

It's time for us

That was awesome.

He was able to connect
with that monster so easy.

I thought
I told you not to move.

Next time, listen.

Bah! He totally
stole our thunder!

This case is now closed, devi.

report back to the Guild

You just calmed that

I need to find his

I gave him my word.

Sounds like the work of

Who are they?

Well, so far,
we've only heard rumors, devi.

But someone is making a
fortune selling the Egg Drops

165
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,708
Get offa me!

166
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,708
We need to continue
our investigation!

167
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,666
But he's definitely a bad guy!

168
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,958
Just forget it!

169
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,750
This, my friend, is a
White Dragon's Egg Drop.

170
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,958
In this region,

171
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,625
I've hunted down
almost all of 'em.

172
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:17,250
Which means anyone who wants
one has to get it through me.

173
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,500
[LIZARD chuckles] And it comes
with a hefty price tag!

174
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,250
All my hard work is paying off.

175
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,625
[LIZARD chuckles]

176
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,833
This here is my retirement fund.

177
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,041
Don't even think
about stealing it.

178
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,708
You've really
got it all figured out,

179
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,125
don't you, Brother?

180
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,333
Better track down and
capture a rare monster yourself

181
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,875
if you want what I've got here.

182
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,833
I would if I could,
but it's not in my skill set.

183
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,958
Oh, by the way.

184
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,208
I heard there's someone
asking around town about us.

185
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,416
It must be someone
from the Guild.

186
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,916
Well, you don't say.

187
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,333
Guess I'll just have to
lay low after I sell these off.

188
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,208
[TAMAZO] If only we could
find one good lead, tama!

189
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,833
Hey, we just got started.

190
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,916
Don't give up!

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,125
Right, Lance?

192
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,166
You two should stay here.

193
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,916
I'll handle this.

194
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,750
[ACE]
What's with him?

195
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,958
[TAMAZO]
He's so frustrating, tama!

196
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,208
[ACE] How does Devi
deal with him all the time?

197
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,666
I feel sorry for the little guy.

198
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,583
[TAMAZO]
Tama.

199
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,416
[sighs]

200
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,166
Heya, Brother!

201
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,583
That's a top-rate monster
you got there.

202
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,541
Huh?

203
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,416
Have you considered selling him?

204
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,208
I'll pay you 3,000 krene
for him right now!

205
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,375
[gasps]

206
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,625
[ACE]
It's him.

207
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,125
I can't sell Tamazo!

208
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,666
Wait, 5,000.
No, no, I can make it ten grand!

209
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,916
I don't need the money.

210
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,666
Fine, how about trading
it for another Egg Drop?

211
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,083
Is there, perchance, a monster
you want more than him?

212
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,250
'Cause the ones
I got are rarer than rare!

213
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:52,083
[ACE] You wouldn't happen to
have a White Dragon, wouldja?

214
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,250
Ooh! Brother,
you sure know your stuff.

215
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,166
Now I don't
have the Drop with me,

216
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,291
so meet me here later!

217
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,625
[TAMAZO wails]

218
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,666
There we go, bud!
Tamazo, we got ourselves a lead!

219
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,875
You horrible brute!

220
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,958
You're gonna sell me off
to a stranger, tama?

221
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,500
No way!

222
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,791
I was just counting on those
star-like qualities of yours!

223
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,916
Well, nevermind!

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,291
[ACE chuckles]

225
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,041
Far too many
people in this world

226
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,000
have turned to darkness.

227
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,958
[D-GEAR rings]

228
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,500
Go ahead.

229
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,958
How are you Master?

230
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,458
I know you don't
like crowded places,

231
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,916
so I'm getting worried
about you, devi!

232
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,416
Well, I'm fine.

233
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Let those two
handle the investigation!

234
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,708
And then all you have to do
is swoop in and save the day

235
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,375
like always, devi!

236
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,000
[beeping]

237
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,958
[ACE]
I think this is the place.

238
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,166
[TAMAZO]
Ace, look!

239
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,583
Hey, Brother. Hop in!

240
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,833
On this?

241
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,666
[LIZARD] I thought you
wanted to make a deal.

242
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,916
[ACE]
Yeah, right.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,541
[TAMAZO] But Ace, don't
you think we should wait

244
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,375
for Lance, tama?

245
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,208
[ACE] Where's the fun in
letting that rude jerk come in

246
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,958
and steal all the glory?

247
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,250
[ACE]
Let's go.

248
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,791
[ACE] So, that's where
they're doing business.

249
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,708
[LANCE]
He wouldn't.

250
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,416
[LIZARD] Now, White Dragons
ain't your average monsters,

251
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,125
I hope you realize.

252
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,791
[LIZARD] Finding them
is hard enough,

253
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,041
and turning them
into Egg Drops

254
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,458
is an even more
complicated process!

255
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,416
Well, I'm not exactly the one
who does the capturing, but...

256
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,791
[ACE]
So, how do you get 'em, then?

257
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,000
[LIZARD]
That's a trade secret!

258
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,666
--Huh?
--Tama?

259
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,583
It's not a very fun thing
to hear about anyway.

260
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,000
In fact, it's better
if you don't know.

261
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,083
[LIZARD] All I can say is that
the poor, trusting suckers

262
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,000
don't even know
they're being sold off!

263
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,166
[ACE] So then, the monsters
are actually being conned?

264
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,708
[LIZARD] It's their
own fault if they fall for it.

265
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,333
That's how I got my hands
on this White Dragon.

266
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,750
[LIZARD] No disrespect, but its
power level makes your monster

267
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,208
look like a marshmallow!

268
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,583
[TAMAZO]
Tama!

269
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,083
[LIZARD]
Whoa!

270
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,958
Not so fast there, buddy.
You haven't paid me for it yet.

271
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,000
[ACE]
Got any others you can show me?

272
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,791
[LIZARD] You bet I do, kid!
Just wait right here.

273
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,833
[LIZARD] And don't
wander away from this spot.

274
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,500
A scary man will give you
a whooping if you do!

275
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,375
[ACE]
Let's go, partner!

276
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,166
This is our chance
to search the ship!

277
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,541
[TAMAZO]
Tama.

278
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,083
[CAPTAIN A] Hmm. So, this is
the White Dragon, is it?

279
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,791
It's almost too good to be true.

280
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,625
S'real all right.
I caught it myself.

281
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,083
[CAPTAIN A chuckles]

282
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,916
[LIZARD] Brother, I need to
borrow something from you

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,125
for a minute, if you don't mind.

284
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,291
[LOGAN]
Not right now.

285
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,125
[LIZARD]
Oh.

286
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,791
[LOGAN]
This one's called an Ouka.

287
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,958
These guys are pretty rare, too.

288
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,583
[gasps]
So, that was all your fault?!

289
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,791
[LIZARD yelps]
Hey! What's your problem?

290
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,208
[TAMAZO]
Yeah! Get him, Ace!

291
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,208
[ACE] My Ouka was alone
because you hunted his friends!

292
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,583
Who is this kid?

293
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,500
He's a customer I sniffed out.

294
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,458
He sure doesn't act like it.

295
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,416
This is my ship,
and I don't want any trouble,

296
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,625
so no funny business.

297
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,375
The monsters should turn
into Egg Drops because

298
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,791
they've accepted you
as a comrade,

299
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,291
not because you've tricked them!

300
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,083
How dare you betray
these monsters' trust

301
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,375
when all they want is
to be your friend!

302
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,916
Tch. Yeah, that's real cute,

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,583
but there's no difference
between you and me.

304
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,708
Either way, you're still
using the monsters in the end.

305
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,791
But it's not the same!

306
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,958
And real Dragon Callers
know that!

307
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,541
Now, you free all of
these monsters immediately!

308
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,958
Or I'll make you.

309
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,458
A D-Gear?

310
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,583
Then that must make you
the Guild Dragon Caller

311
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,791
I heard was snooping around.

312
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,000
Hey, Lizard!

313
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,250
[LIZARD]
Yo?

314
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,875
He's no customer!

315
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,750
He's a Guild Dragon Caller!

316
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,625
Do monsters really
mean that much to you?

317
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,541
What? Of course they do!

318
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,208
Well then, I have
leverage in this negotiation.

319
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,416
If you attack us,
I'm gonna throw

320
