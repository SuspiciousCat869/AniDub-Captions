[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,791
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,500
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,083
They harnessed
the power of the monsters

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:20,250
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,125
They were the Dragon Callers.

[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers are
born with the special power

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,833
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature.

Mankind and monsters.

10

When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us...

11
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,125
...the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters

to our world.
