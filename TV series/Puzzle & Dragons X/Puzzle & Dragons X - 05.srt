[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,458
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,083
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,750
They harnessed
the power of the monsters

5
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,958
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,166
They were... the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,916
[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers
are born with the special power

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,625
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature,

9
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,500
mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,500
When fear and hatred
contaminate the elements

11
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,083
that surround us...

12
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,833
...the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,375
and restore balance
to our world.

14

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,750
Yeah, I can totally
handle this on my own.

So how's this all work?

38
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,416
I thought I'd start having cool
battles once I got my D-gear.

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,625
[CHARO] You've still got a long

Transform, Tama!

Tama? Tama.

43
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,333
He's quite the little
showman, isn't he?

44
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,375
Heh. You ain't seen nothing.

45
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,416
Well, he'll keep
pulling the attention.

46
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,416
Until you Cross-On
with some Soul Armor

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,083
and make people take notice.

48
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,875
But, that's a pretty
tall order for a rookie.

49
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,875
I can totally Cross-On
some Soul Armor!

50
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey, Charo, do you know
what Soul Armor is?

51
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,500
You haven't learned
about that yet?

52
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,666
Uhh...

53
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,750
[CHARO] When a Dragon Caller
equips Soul Armor,

54
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,291
they're able to use that
monster's Leader Skill.

55
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,375
Is that so?

56
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,000
There's only one way to
get a set of Soul Armor.

57
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,083
You're gonna have to go
to the Sacred Temple.

58
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,833
I gotta go where?

59
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,125
The Sacred Temple is a
dangerous place,

60
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,625
nestled atop Mount Linus,

61
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,083
with the most unforgiving
terrain in Crocus.

62
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,541
It's also called the
Dragon Caller's Tomb.

63
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,625
Because every foolish adventurer
who's dared to set foot

64
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,666
in the Temple has
ultimately perished from

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,625
one of its diabolical
booby traps.

66
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,166
No one who's ever gone
there has come back.

67
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,583
Man, that temple
sounds ultra-serious.

68
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,541
So the bottom line is, you
can't hope to get Soul Armor

69
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,458
unless you're ready to give it
everything you've got.

70
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,416
You better be willing
to risk your life

71
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,750
if you want to make
a good Dragon Caller.

72
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,583
[CHARO] Uh... That's a
little different from what

73
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,291

the ambitious go-getter!

Tamazo's not afraid
at all, Tama!

77
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,041
You should quit trying
to become a Dragon Caller

78
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,791
and start thinking about
managing Tamazo's touring show!

to get a Soul Armor!

It's Garnet! But why?

Maybe the grand prize
really is a Soul Armor!

we have to win this!

You did it, Tamazo!

206
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,750
I do all right when I try.

207
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,083
[ACE] And if this is the prize,
I'm glad I didn't win.

208
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,583
I don't know how you were able
to eat so many of those.

209
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:43,416
It's good, Tama! Delicious!
Yummy in my tummy!

210
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,833
I still can't believe I stuck
with it as long as I did.

211
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,250
It tasted so terrible I almost
passed out a couple of times.

212
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,375
So tell me, why were you
even participating

213
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,625
in a dumpling-eating contest
in the first place?

214
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,958
Garnet's trying to
expand her branding.

215
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,541
Now she's eating competitively!
Stay tuned for more details.

216
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,000
Competitive eating?

217
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,000
Being a multi-faceted celebrity
takes a lot out of you.

218
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,000
So, are these jelly dumplings
world-famous for being so gross?

219
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,375
No, not at all!

220
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,500
They stink now, but they
used to be really delicious!

221
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,166
I like 'em!

222
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,250
[CHARO] I wonder what
could have happened?

223
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,666
It's probably because the
water we use to make them

224
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,250
has gone bad recently.

225

It's almost like something

227
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,125
has contaminated the water.

00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,375
[TAMAZO] I almost forgot.
You were a worthy challenger.

--Let me share this.
--Oh, you really don't have to.

230

[ACE] You almost beat Tamazo
in an eating contest.

231
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,458
That's impressive!

232
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,041
Well, I was hungry.
And caught up in the moment.

233
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,541
Honestly, no one could be
more surprised than I am!

234
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,125
You can do anything if you
just believe in yourself, Tama!

235
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,833
The power was always inside you!

236
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,666
Right, and thanks again.
I'm stuffed.

237
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,250
Honestly, I was feeling
hungry and kind of down

238
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,333
before you came along.

239
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,458
So, I heard you won the contest!
You rock, Tamazo!

240
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,208
Hey, that intel you gave us
on the temple was no good!

241
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,333
We went up there, wasted our
time, and found nothing!

Why don't I give you this to
show there are no hard feelings?

be a treasure map!

247

[CHARO] Doesn't this
map seem kinda fishy, too?

248
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,916
Don't worry so much!

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,041
Would that nice old man
over there give it to me

250
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,375
if it was nothing?

251
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,625
Heh.

252
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,458
So what kind of treasure
does the map lead to?

253
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,333
[DONNY]
Wait for it. It leads...

254
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,708
...to a Dragon Knight!

255
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,125
What the heck's a Dragon Knight?

It's a super-rare monster!
It's a big deal!

Then it's settled. Let's go
and find the Dragon Knight's

will be extremely difficult.

possible, aren't they?

you're right.

Quick question.

Did you have some
kinda plan to obtain

Not really.

You didn't come up with
anything on the way here?

I'm sure it'll all work out.

point of view you have.

It always makes me feel like
we can accomplish anything.

Well, If I could
equip the armor.

into the mountains, Miss Garnet?

343

A nice man gave me a map.
So I'm following it!

344
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,583
I wanted to add
Treasure Hunter to my resumé.

345

So this is all just a PR move.

354

Something happened to make
the water fresh again!

Wow, it is good!

356
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,833
I wonder if all those
monsters were somehow

357
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,666
contaminating the headwaters?

358
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,250
Huh? That would
make me a hero!

[Garnet, dear! Where were you?

We've been following one

the entire day!

365

I know, but it all
turned out okay.

366
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,208
We didn't get the Soul Armor,
but I still had fun. And look!

367
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,250
That's neat.

368
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,875
So, Charo, do you have
any idea what this is?

369
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,125
Ohm! It's hard, Tama.

370
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,000
Would you stop chewing
on everything?!

371
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,500
That's a lovely Soul Stone
you have there, Ace.

372
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,583
Hey, Sally.

373
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,000
[CHARO]
A Soul Stone?

374
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,625
It's undeniable proof
that the Ancient Dragon Knight

375
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,208
has accepted you.

376
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,333
You know how an Egg Drop
is the physical body

377
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,583
of a monster, right?

378
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,125
The Soul Stone is tied
to the monster's soul.

379
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,000
Which means monsters
won't share it easily.

380
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,208
[ACE]
A monster's soul?

381
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,166
To obtain one,
you must prove in combat

382
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,875
that you are worthy
of the monster.

383
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,208
Only then will the monster
allow their Soul Stone

384
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,958
to come into your possession.

385
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,666
Follow me, I'll take you
to the Sacred Temple.

386
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,583
[ACE]
So this is the Sacred Temple!

387
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,125
[SALLY] History's greatest
Dragon Callers have come down

388
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,791
this same path to take part in
the Temple's Sacred Ceremony.

389
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,208
I am a priestess.

390
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,791
My duty is to bestow the energy
from the Soul Stone

391
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,333
to a worthy Dragon Caller.

392
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,625
In this way,
new Soul Armor is created

393
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,291
and we fulfill our purpose.

394
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,291
With our source of water
contaminated,

395
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,000
we were no longer able to
carry out our divine duties

396
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,583
here in the Temple.

397
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,708
The Sacred Ceremony explicitly
requires the use of pure water.

398
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,458
I convinced myself that
it was Heaven's will.

399
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,958
And I abandoned all of my
responsibilities as a priestess.

400
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,500
I decided to take
a hard look at my life.

401
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:32,041
I tried changing my clothes,
I gave cooking a go.

402
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,333
I also tried my luck
on the dating scene,

403
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,833
but it only led
to a broken heart.

404
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,166
Sometimes life can just
be funny that way, you know?

405
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,958
Like when you're ready
to throw in the towel,

406
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,208
and then fate gives you
exactly what you wanted.

407
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,166
[SALLY] All right, Ace,
it's time to come forward.

408
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,375
Have a seat, and then
set the Soul Stone

409
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,833
right there in front of you.

410
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,125
[ACE gasps softly]

411
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,083
[SALLY]
Now stay calm,

412
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,625
and be sure to listen closely
to the Soul Stone's voice.

00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,416
the path in life I have chosen.

425
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,458
I've learned that if you
force yourself to do something

426
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,958
that goes against your nature,

427
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,625
it can only lead you
to pain and heartache. Heh.

Oh? Okay?

There's no point to me
falsifying my public profile!

431
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,083
I'm just going to keep
on being myself

432
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,375
and continue dancing to
the beat of my own drummer!
