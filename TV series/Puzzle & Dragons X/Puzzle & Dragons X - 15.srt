00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,916
[ACE] After our
adventure in Vienna City,

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,458
we reported back to Libria,

3
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,500
and then headed off to the
Sand City to begin our training.

4
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,750
We're gonna
need all we can get

5
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,750
if we're going to enter
the upcoming Battle Cup.

6
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:59,333
Vegahs, the Sand City
oasis, tama!

7
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,916
Whoa! Look at that!

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,458
This says it's a town devoted
to entertainment and tourism!

9
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,708
A show-biz city where
people's dreams come true!

10
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,375
But while the main streets
are shiny and glamorous,

11
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,541
the back streets are rougher
areas and should be avoided.

12
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,791
Yeah, whatever.

13
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,500
I dare some fool to try
comin' at me, the Tiger!

14
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,250
Hey! Where's Tamazo?

15
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,083
--[crashing]
--[TAMA screaming]

16
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,666
Never ever go check out
the back streets, tama!

17
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,750
[ALL sigh]

18
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,916
Ah! These are azaleahs! Cool!

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,125
It's been forever!

20
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,583
That taste brings
back some memories!

21
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,750
Ugh, that's gross!
Is it okay to eat?

22
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,791
You better stop before
you get a stomach ache.

23
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,791
Man, I can't believe you guys
are acting like such babies!

24
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,833
Entetsu...?

25
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,583
[sighs]
What am I sayin'?

26
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,041
There's no reason he'd
be all the way out here.

27
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,333
[ENTETSU pants]

28
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,875
[DRAGON CALLER A] Hey,
if you could have your pick

29
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,500
of any Soul Armor right now,
what would you choose?

30
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,958
I'd probably have
to go with either

31
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,083
Horus or Berserk's Soul Armor.

32
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,583
Dude, nice choices!

33
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,875
And I think the ladies would
really appreciate the look.

34
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,791
Man, all I have right now
is a dumb Woodsie.

35
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,208
Huh? You should
appreciate Woodsie more!

36
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,041
Those guys are adorable.
I wish I had one myself!

37
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,041
I'll tell you what
I don't want, though.

38
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,416
An Entetsu.

39
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,250
[ENTETSU sighs]

40
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,375
[DRAGON CALLER A]
Entetsu's Soul Armor stinks!

41
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,125
I'd look really lame in it.

42
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,708
[DRAGON CALLER B]
Yeah, anybody would.

43
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,875
[DRAGON CALLER A]
I'd rather wear nothing

44
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,916
than Entetsu's Soul Armor.

45
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,375
Time to go for
the top in Vegahs, baby!

46
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,875
Calm down, tama!

47
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,333
So, where do we go?

48
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,333
Anywhere that isn't
the back streets...?

49
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,125
Hey, we should check out
the underground battle arena!

50
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,416
What's a battle arena?

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,708
That's where the Dragon
Caller battles take place.

52
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,583
it's a must-see attraction
here in Vegahs!

53
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,291
Yeah! Sounds fun!

54
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,458
[CROWD cheers]

55
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,041
The crowd's really pumped!

56
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,958
Go, Aget! Go, Aget!

57
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,375
[yells]

58
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,083
Prepare to receive
my just punishment!

59
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,041
[CROWD cheers]

60
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,208
Goooooooo! Aget!

61
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,125
[CROWD]
Aget! Aget! Aget!

62
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,083
[AGET]
Ow...

63
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,875
[groans]
My poor aching hip!

64
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,375
[knocking]

65
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,375
That was a really great
fight today, Mister Aget!

66
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,208
Would you possibly be available
to fight again this weekend?

67
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,916
Mr. Apollo seems to
have caught a cold

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,125
and sadly had to withdraw.

69
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,500
That hack Apollo
should be covering for me!

70
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,625
No, thank you.

71
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,500
Could you please help us out?!

72
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,416
Everybody who's anybody
knows Aget is the only

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,833
real Dragon Caller
Hero in this town!

74
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,958
You make Apollo look
like a total chump!

75
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,750
I can't argue with you there,

76
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,458
but I'm afraid I have
plans this weekend.

77
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,958
Justice never
slumbers, after all.

78
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,208
Oh, well, that's too bad.

79
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,625
Especially since the purse
has been tripled,

80
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,416
and you get to pick
your own opponent, but...

81
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,541
I guess I'll look elsewhere.

82
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,125
Fine.

83
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,166
If it'll really help you guys
out, then you can count me in.

84
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,625
Wow, you mean it?

85
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,500
A true hero could
never ignore someone

86
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,000
who's in distress!

87
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,000
[BOYS laughing]

88
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,916
[AGET]
Oh, man.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,583
[AGET]
Hmm...

90
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,500
[AGET grunts]

91
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,625
[AGET] My hip is killing me!
And my joints ache!

92
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,375
Huh?

93
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,875
[BOY B gasps]
It's Mister Aget!

94
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,708
How awesome!

95
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,833
[AGET]
Huh?

96
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,375
[BOY C]
That's so mean!

[AGET chuckles]

99
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,958
[AGET] Now I've got to
find some sucker to fight

100
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,333
that I can easily beat.

101

--[TIGER] Mr. Aget...?
--[AGET] Hmm?

[TIGER squeals]

103
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,875
You're really him!

104
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,750
You're the big-shot Dragon
Caller hero, Mister Aget!

105
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,833
[gasps]
Sir!

106
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,666
Pleeeeeeeease,
pick a hand to shake!

107
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,708
[AGET]
He seems like a total idiot.

108
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,250
[AGET] Ahem. You'll have
to excuse me, I'm busy.

109
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,708
Hmm? You kids
are Dragon Callers?

110
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,166
Oh, yeah!

111
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,833
We're three Dragon Caller
buddies out to see the world!

112
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,000
[AGET] He did say I can pick
my own opponent to face

113
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,666
in the fight.

114
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,000
So, have any of you young
bucks received a Soul Armor yet?

115
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,708
Huh? I have.

116
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,500
Ace here even got
an Ancient Dragon Knight

117
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,041
for his Soul Armor!

118
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,833
[AGET]
Ancient Dragon Knight?

119
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,666
Dude, I wish I had
a souped-up mega-cool

120
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,000
Soul Armor just
like my man Ace's!

121
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,166
Maybe I'll find one
lying around here somewhere.

122
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,875
[AGET]
He really is an idiot!

123
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,791
Soul Stones are the
embodiment of a monster's soul!

124
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,916
And the only way to get
one of those is for a monster

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,750
to respect your
strength of character!

126
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,666
In conclusion, you don't
find them "lying around"!

127
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,375
So then, you don't have
a Soul Armor yet, young man?

128
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,375
Well. He had a Soul Armor,
but it was made of cardboard.

129
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,708
Pipe down, would ya?

130
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,958
The days of my cardboard suit
of armor are over.

131
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,375
I'm rocking "Soul Armor:
None" right now.

132
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,875
[AGET]
He's perfect!

133
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,000
Welcome, boys...

134
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,083
...to the great
Sand City of Vegahs!

135
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,375
It's so nice to see
another Dragon Caller in town!

136
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,583
Would you care to tag along
for a leisurely drive

137
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,041
around the city?

138
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,208
Can we really?!

139
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,041
It's a great way
to see the sights!

140
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,625
Ah! Hold on!

141
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,541
Hasn't anyone ever told you not
to get into cars with strangers?

142
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:43,791
But he's not a stranger,
though, his name is Mister Aget.

143
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,875
[ACE]
What should we do?

144
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,666
[TIGER]
Are you kidding? We join him!

145
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,041
[TIGER]
Fine, then. To each his own.

146
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,625
Don't be that way.

147
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,708
I'm sorry sir.

148
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,250
I can't believe my buddies
shot down your friendly offer!

149
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,208
But, sadly, they're real dumb.

150
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,291
[AGET] It actually kinda
works out better this way.

151
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,500
Huh?

152
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,625
Look over there!

153
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,583
That statue is
a symbol of our city.

154
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:13,708
Huh...? Ah! That is so money!
I love this town!

155
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,000
--[TIGER] Cheers!
--[AGET] Cheers!

156
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,791
--[AGET] So, my friend--
--[TIGER] You can call me Tiger.

157
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,541
What would you say if
I told there's a real easy way

158
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,708
to make mega bucks
in just a few hours?

Wha...?

00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,166
There's a
big battle scheduled at

161
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,041
the underground
arena this weekend.

162
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,666
And the winner of
that battle will get paid

163
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,375
a whole lot of money.

164
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,625
Seriously?

165
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,416
I just so happen
to be looking for someone

166
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,333
to face off against
me in the arena.

167
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,291
You in?

168
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,208
You mean... me, you?

169
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,375
No way! I'm not a match
for you, Mister Aget, sir!

170
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,041
Naturally, I will be victorious.

171
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,958
And if you do your part to make
sure that's how it goes down,

172
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,291
I can certainly make it
worth your while.

173
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,041
Wait, what are you saying?

174
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,750
All you have to do is
throw the fight,

175
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,083
and I'll make sure you
walk away with 30 percent

176
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,000
of the prize money.
How's that sound?

177
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,166
That sounds crooked.

178

[AGET] You're travelling
the world, aren't you?

I bet you could use
the extra cash.

180
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,916
It's not a bad deal
if you think about it.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,416
But it's not good!

182
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,541
It means we'd have to
lie to everyone!

183
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,791
There's no honor
or justice in that!

184
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,208
I'd never be able
to forgive someone

185
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,958

Look, it's Mister Aget!

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,166
[BOY D] You're my favorite-est
Dragon Caller hero, sir!

193
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,750
I had planned to
donate the prize money

194
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,583
to the orphanage,
because they could frankly use

195
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,125
all the help they can get.

196
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,708
Maybe it was
just wishful thinking,

197
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,250
but I really wanted
to make a difference

198
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,958
in those kid's lives.

199
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,000
The kids look up to me
as a Dragon Caller hero,

200
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,958
and I also know how excited
they'd be if the purse money

201
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,208
went to buying them
some new toys.

202
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,625
But you're right, Tiger.

203
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,375
I shouldn't do something bad,
even if something good

204
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,708
will come from it.

205
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,708
It's dishonest,
just like you said.

206
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,125
Forget I even asked.

207
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,666
Is it still bad if your
intentions are just, though?

Okay. I'm in!

Forget about it, kid!
You were right.

It's a bad thing to do!

211
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,000
And even though their
lives would surely improve,

212
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,625
the orphans wouldn't
want dirty money!

213
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,333
But we don't have to tell them!

It can be our

How can you be so certain?
Didn't you just meet him?

I could tell by
the look in his eyes.

It was the same look
Entetsu had that day.

That's the name of a monster.

Oh, yeah.

It all happened back when
I couldn't see drops yet.

234
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,041
There was a nearby cave
that was lousy with monsters.

235
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,583
and the adults warned us
all to never go in there.

But I went anyway,
to snack on the honeydew

from the azaleahs that only
grew inside the cave.

was Entetsu's den!

318
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,583
Now! Release!

[AGET]
Mm-mm.

323
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,833
Oops. Not just yet.

324
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,916
Something seems wrong.

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's like he isn't
trying to shoot

326
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,541
for the top at all!

puts a combo together!

[TIGER]
Not like this!

00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,583
I'm not going down without
a fight, you hear me? Never!

[sighs]

Just wait.

337
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,041
I'll be a Dragon Caller
for the Guild.

338
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,166
And I'll climb right to the top!

339
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,916
I'm gonna show
all those naysayers

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
just how wrong they are!

341
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,791
I'm gonna prove myself!

I won't leave
any room for doubt!

343

[RED GIANT growls]

[ANNOUNCER A]
Oh, wow!

347
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,791
We're looking at a
whopping eight combos!

348
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,708
This looks to be a
devastatingly massive attack!

[ANNOUNCER A]
Oh, but what's this?

350
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,750
A monster has forced
his way into the battle!

351

Entetsu?!

352
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,666
What's wrong, buddy?!
C'mon, stay with me!

Ah, huh?

This is it, child.

00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,166
What are you saying...?

361
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,416
I know, you mean
our long-waited battle!

362
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,208
All right!

363
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,291
I promise to come at you
with everything I've got

after this battle has ended!

[ENTETSU]
I give my soul to you...

366
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,750
Use it and be safe...

367
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,666
We'll go to the top...
together...

368
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,791
Of course we will...

369
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,500
Is that a Soul Stone?

370
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,958
So, then Entetsu accepted Tiger?

What the heck, Tamazo?!

[TAMAZO]
TA-DAAAH!

Is this... Entetsu's Armor?

378
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,208
What's wrong?

379
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,958
Did you lose
your fighting spirit?

380
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,500
[ANNOUNCER A] Umm, it
appears Tiger has forfeited,

381
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,750
so I declare Aget
to be the winner.

382
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,791
[TIGER]
Not yet. The name's Tiger!

383
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,916
And I won't stop
till I reach the top!

384

[ANNOUNCER A]
Oh, yeah!

00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,791
It looks like
the battle is back on!

386
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:06,041
I'll win this thing either way.

387

Let's go, Entetsu!

00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,625
Wait, wha--?

390
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,125
Is that Entetsu's Soul Armor?

391
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,875
He looks so lame!

392
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,083
You can forget about
the concept of impossible!

393
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,458
Because I'm here to make
my dreams come true!

394
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,583
All right! Let's rock, Agdrall!

Yeah! Entetsu's soul and Tiger's
heart are working together

399
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,958
as one force!

Wow, Tiger's
Soul Armor is impressive!

the routine we rehearsed!

to lose, remember?

That's Entetsu's Soul Armor!

406
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,625
It might be okay.

How dare you be so cocky?!

Entetsu, your blazing
soul is firing up my own!

Here's to the top!

411
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,750
Receive my just punishment!

Fire Horn!

413

[ANNOUNCER A] He's activated
Entetsu's leader skill,

414
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,458
Fire Horn. Now, his monster
has boosted attack power!

[TIGER]
I am so sorry, Mister Aget!

418
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,416
[AGET] I was supposed
to win this fight!

419
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,833
I was just responding
to Entetsu's feelings.

420
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,750
If anyone can understand,
it's you, Mister Aget.

421
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,375
[AGET]
Of course I don't.

422
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,625
Are you okay? I feel terrible!

423
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,875
So, I've decided
the prize money isn't mine!

424
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,916
It's all yours, Mr. Aget!

425
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
[AGET]
Oh, really?

426
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,208
Well, if that's the case, Tiger,

427
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,333
I guess I'll have
to let it slide.

428
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:06,500
Wow, you mean it? That's good!
But then again,

429
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,833
I always knew you had
a big heart, didn't I?

430
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,666
[AGET laughs]
Great. Hand it over.

431
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,208
You just sit there
and get better!

432
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,250
I already donated
all of it to the orphanage,

433
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,958
just like you wanted
from the very beginning!

434
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,666
All under the name
MR. Aget, of course!

435
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,583
[AGET]
You did what with the money?

436
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,125
[TIGER] Mr. Aget was so happy
to hear the good news!

437
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,416
Y'know I guess I did all right!

438
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,708
Yeah, you were
really cool today, Tiger!

439
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,416
I actually respect you!

440
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,250
Yeah, well, it's all
thanks to Entetsu!

441
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,500
Hey, Tamazo.

442
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,958
How in the world did you
change the Soul Stone

443
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,541
to an Armor Drop back there?

444
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,875
That's right.

445
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,500
It meant we didn't have to
go back to Miss Sally

446
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,750
to ask for help.

447
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,208
[TAMAZO] It was Sally
herself who taught me

448
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,125
how to do it, tama!

449
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,708
The strands of
fate wove us together, tama.

450
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,708
For real?

451
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,333
Tamazo's full of surprises!

452
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,083
All things are
possible with me, tama!

453
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,041
[ACE, TAMAZO]
Believe in Tamazo!

[laughs]

455
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,250
Oh! Hey, Aget!

456
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,375
Oh, no! Tiger!

457
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,375
[TIGER]
See you later!

458
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,791
And thanks again
for showing me around!

459
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,875
Why don't we fight each
other for real next time,

460
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:11,916
whaddaya say, pal?

461
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,958
"Next time"?

462
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,833
I'm totally
coming back to Vegahs!

463
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,000
[AGET]
No! Just stay away!

464
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,000
[CHARO]
I'm so happy for Tiger.

465
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,875
He got Entetsu's Soul Armor!
Now it's my turn!

466
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,875
I've got to find my
dream-monster, too!

467
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,375
But he's at the haunted
house deep in the forest?

468
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,166
Next time:
"Charo and the Haunted Forest."

469
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,166
It's probably just
a trick of the light.
