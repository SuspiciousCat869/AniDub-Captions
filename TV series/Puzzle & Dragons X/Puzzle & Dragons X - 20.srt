[ACE]
What's up?

3
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,791
[CHARO] I'm still so
excited that I finally got

4
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,041
my Soul Armor!

5
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,250
[CHARO] And one as
awesome as Fortoytops!

6
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,916
[CHARO]
Do you wanna see it?

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,791
Because I could Cross-On now.

8
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,500
Eh? No, thanks.

9
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,416
I've already seen it,
like, 12 times.

10
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,375
[CHARO] It's almost time
for the Battle Cup!

11
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,291
I really want to get some more
powerful Egg Drops by then.

00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,625
[TIGER] Check it out,
I found something awesome!

16
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,791

Huh?

17
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,666

Is it a monster?

[TIGER]
Hmph!

00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,708
Unicorn Bug!

20
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,208
What now?

21
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,208
What's so great about it?
Does it turn into an Egg Drop?

22
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,458
Of course not!
Don't be silly, dude.

23
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,458
It's just for fun.
Fun only.

24
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,750
Unicorn beetles are cool!

25
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,208
Uh, neat.

26
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,208
So, why are we
in this forest again?

27
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,458
For the insect collecting.

28
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,000
That's what you
do in the forest!

29
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,125
I've never seen one of these
guys this big before.

[TIGER]
Unicorn beetle's horn strike!

32
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,333
[CHARO] Tiger always makes
whatever he's doing fun.

33
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,166
He doesn't have
a care in the world.

34
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,541
I know.

35
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,416
[TIGER]
Horn strike!

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,625

--[TAMAZO] Stop it, tama!

Now, what do we have here?

38
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,041
Huh...?

39
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,958
[ROSE] I heard a noise, and I
came to see what was going on.

41

No way! Rose?

[TAMAZO]
Tama?

43
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,041
Long time no see.

44
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,166
Tiger.

45
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,958
[ACE] So Rose, you and
Tiger have been friends

46
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,208
since you were children?

47
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,541
[ROSE]
Yes, but I have to say.

48
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,791
I never expected to bump
into you in this forest!

49
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,958
Guess what.

50
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,208
I've become a
Guild Dragon Caller, too!

51
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,375
That was your dream!

52
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,541
Good for you!

53
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,750
Yeah, thanks.

54
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,541
So is that why
you came to the forest?

55
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,500
Are you trying to find a
Red Carbuncle, like I am?

56
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,458
Yes?

57
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,416
[TAMAZO]
Tiger!

58
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,166
I found another
unicorn beetle, tama!

59
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,583
It's even bigger than
the one you found earlier!

60
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,625
Unicorn beetle?

61
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,208
Ah! No, no, no, no!

62
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,458
Don't listen to that egghead!

63
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,166
I came out here to find
the Red Crabapple thing,

64
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,416
just like you said!

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,541
But you said it
was about insect collecti--

66
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,958
[yelps]

67
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,583
You haven't changed,
have you, Tiger?

68
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,291
Well, old friend.

69
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,916
What do you say
to a little contest to see

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,583
which of us can find the
Red Carbuncle first?

71
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,500
[TIGER]
Huh...?

72
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,458
[ROSE]
All right!

73
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,416
And they're off!

74
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Wait! I'm not ready!

75
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,083
Doesn't seem like she's
changed much, either.

76
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,958
So, is your friend a
Guild Dragon Caller, too?

77
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,208
Her? Yeah.

78
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,458
Back in the day,
we used to train together.

79
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,916
You'd trained before we met you?

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,291
Yup, I was with Rose
when I found this little guy.

Hah! Looks like I win!

83
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,166
I guess so, but running's
the only thing your good at.

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,500
[TIGER]
C'mon, just let me enjoy this--

Oh, no! Agdralls!

And they're blocking off
our escape route!

Escape route?

Why would we need to get away?

89
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,083
They're bound to become
our allies when we show them

the iron-strength of

I almost pity
the poor thing,

having an ally who's
so dorkishly obnoxious!

It's called a Red Krull.

00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,666
Do you guys wanna play?

165
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,541
[TIGER]
Huh...?

166
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,041
[CHARO "However,
Red Krulls travel in packs,

167
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,375
which makes them stronger,
and therefore,

168
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,000
more difficult for a
neophyte to obtain."

169
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,875
[TIGER] I wish you'd gotten to
that part a little bit sooner.

170
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,750
[TAMAZO]
Tama.

171
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,500
[TIGER]
That stinking varmint!

172
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,166
[TAMAZO] His cuteness
was pretty deceiving, tama.

173
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,666
[CHARO] It just goes
to show, you should never

174
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,958
judge a book by its cover.

175
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,416
[ACE] We've gotta catch one
before he calls his friends in.

176
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,708
[CHARO]
There's one!

177
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,833
[GROUP screams]

178
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,791
[TAMAZO]
Red Krulls are like roaches.

179
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,708
If you see one, there are
probably five more, tama.

180
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,750
I won't stop.

181
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,000
I need to get that Egg Drop!

182
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,750
I think I know what to do.

183
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,416
When we track down a Red Krull,
the three of us will gather up

184
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,916
as many Fire Drops
as we possibly can...

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,250
...and hit him
with an ambush combo!

186
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,291
So like, a mass attack?

187
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,333
That could work!

188
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,625
Great idea, Charo!

189
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,791
[CHARO chuckles]

190
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,375
[TAMAZO]
Tama.

191
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,416
[TAMAZO]
He's up ahead, tama!

192
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,750
[TIGER]
I'm gonna get you this time!

193
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,416
[RED KRULL A squeaks]

[yells]

195
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,541
[TAMAZO]
Hurry, tama!

196
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,750
Before he gets a chance to
summon his friends, tama!

197
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:38,875
No way!

198
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,083
There aren't enough Drops!

199
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,208
I can help!

200
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,916
Let's always go
for the top together!

201
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,416
Go, Tiger!

202
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
Here it comes,
you little red menace!

203
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,458
My signature final attack:
The Cross-Counter Punch!

204
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,458
[grunts]

205
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,916
[TIGER]
I did it!

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,166
You're gonna make a great
addition to my team!

207
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,416
That was great!

208
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,041
And when did you come up
with that special attack

209
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,375
you just did?
It was so cool!

210
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,958
Oh, that?

211
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,541
I was just in the moment, and in
a fit of passion it came to me.

212
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,291
[TAMAZO]
In other words, you winged it.

213
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,125
Uh...

214
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,708
Well, that figures!

215
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,625
Randomly yelling out a string of
cool-sounding words isn't quite

216
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,666
the same as having a real
special attack, now is it?

217
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,041
[TIGER]
Pipe down!

218
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,541
[TAMAZO] It's so dorky,
it actually fits you, tama.

219
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,750
[CHARO]
Big time!

220
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,250
[TIGER]
Stop being so mean, you guys!

221
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,625
[GROUP laughs]

222
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,166
[TIGER]
Come on!

223
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:47,833
[TIGER]
Rose!

224
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,916
[gasps]

225
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,000
[TIGER] Say hello to my
freshly-caught Red Krull!

226
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,750
[ROSE]
Yeah, so what?

227
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,625
I thought the whole reason
you came here was to find

228
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,791
a Red Carbuncle!

229
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,333
Uh! Yeah, of course,
but he's gonna evolve

230
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,750
into a Red Carbuncle one day.

231
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,833
And when will that be?

232
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,000
Dunno.

233
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,500
Oh! Right!
I bet Charo would know!

234
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,375
Yeah! He was that
little short dude I was with.

235
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,000
He might be just a kid, but he
knows a ton about monsters!

236
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,166
[sighs]

237
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,500
I met my friends in Geyser

238
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,250
and started traveling
with them. It's the best!

239
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,333
And the other guy, Ace,

240
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,458
can generate Drops
from far away.

241
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,875
The two of them are
some of the nicest guys.

242
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,333
You'd like 'em, too, Rose!

243
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:35,083
Tiger. You really
haven't changed at all.

244
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,000
Huh?

245
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,333
You've made no progress.

246
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,041
I have so done stuff!

247
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:45,083
One: I've joined the Guild, and
two: I have my own Soul Armor.

248
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,625
I'm not the same guy
as I was before!

249
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,125
So then... you're
still going for the top?

250
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,500
Of course!

251
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,291
Very well. Let's have a battle!

where your mouth is.

stronger version of you.

255
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,125

concept of impossible!

I'm here to make
my dreams come true!

All right! Let's rock, partners!

263
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,083

[TIGER]
How's that?

265
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,083
It's pretty cool, I know.

266
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,833
[TIGER] I make Entetsu's
Soul Armor look good!

you're a real tough customer.

you had changed somehow.

head out for the next town?

[TIGER]
When I found my Red Krull.

310
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,833
[TIGER] Charo thought of
the plan to catch him,

311
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,041
and Ace provided
the Drops.

312

But what did I do to earn this?

where would you rather we go?

A hot spring resort
in the mountains

321
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,875
sounds pretty nice, doesn't it?

322

Melon splitting at the beach!

323
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,333
I want to feed Beetles
some watermelon.

324
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,541
--[TAMAZO laughs]
--[TIGER] Yeah...

325
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,958
[ACE]
What's wrong, Tiger?

326
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,333
[TIGER]

327
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,458
[ACE] I don't know,
you just seem down.

328
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,416
No, I'm totally fine.

329
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,333
You're such a cutie, tama!

330
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,833
Hey, Tiger!

331
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,333
Let's put out the syrup trap
again to catch more beetles

332
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,833
so that he has a couple
of friends, tama!

333
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,458
[TIGER]
Okay.

334
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,000
[BOTH]
Uh...

335
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,166
[CHARO]
Why don't we go here?

336
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,375
They have hot springs!

337
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,250
[ACE]
Sure, that sounds good!

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,125
[ACE]
What do you think?

339
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,458
--Tiger?
--[TAMAZO] Tama?

340
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,500
[ACE]
So, what's your vote?

341
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,500
The hot springs?
The beach?

342
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,458
Tiger. What's the
matter with you?

343
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,875
You've been acting really
strange since last night.

344
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,916
Are you coming down with a cold?

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,958
[TAMAZO] I hope it wasn't
food poisoning, tama.

346
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,166
[BOTH]
Hmm...

347
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,666
No, I... I'll go on my own.

348
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,000
Ah! You'll go on your own?

349
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,041
What does that mean?

350
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,208
[TIGER] From here on,
I've got to make my own way.

351
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,625
[BOTH gasp]

352
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,250
I've decided!

353
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,708
What're you saying?!

354
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,166
If we're all going to go
the same place,

355
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,666
then why can't we
go there together?

356
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,375
[TIGER]
We may share direction,

357
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,666
but that doesn't mean the path
you choose is right for me.

358
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,625
[TIGER] 'Cause I have
my own path to walk!

359
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,666
That's why... it's time
I headed out on my own!

360
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,875
Okay.

361
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,083
Are you serious?!

362
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,750
How is it okay, Ace?!

363
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't you want
Tiger to be with us?!

364
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,250
This is Tiger's decision, Charo.

365
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,416
But it's not!

366
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,666
[TIGER]
Thank you, Ace.

367
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,666
Well, I'm against it!

368
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,791
I think Tiger should stay with
us and continue having fun!

369
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,500
We've had great adventures!

370
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,333
Don't you want to share more
of them with your friends?

371
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,208
I can't get stronger
by just having fun.

372
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,583
That's not right!

373
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,666
What you're saying
doesn't make any sense!

374
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,458
You can have fun
and still keep getting stronger.

375
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,916
What part of having a little fun
means you can't be strong?

376
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,666
I'm not saying having
fun is a bad thing.

377
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,250
But after our time
traveling together,

378
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,625
I rely on you too much.

379
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,791
And I wanna be able
to do things on my own.

380
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,000
If I'm not goofing around,

381
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,125
I can focus more on training.

382
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,666
That's the only way
to become the strongest

383
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,791
and most fun version of myself.

384
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,333
I get it.

385
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,333
You sound
like a real know-it-all.

386
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,666
Charo!

387
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,791
Talking like that,

388
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,958
trying to sound like
you're so mature.

389
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,958
Like I'm a kid,
so I wouldn't understand.

390
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,750
Does talking down
to me like that make you feel

391
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,958
like a big-shot?

392
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,458
[ACE]
Charo!

393
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,708
[CHARO] Why are you changing
who you are all of a sudden?

394
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,083
Was the other you an act?
Are you a liar?

395
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,791
[ACE]
That's not how it is!

396
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,250
[TIGER sighs]

397
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,208
My bad! Don't be so upset!

398
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,291
I was only trying to yank your
chain a bit, you know?

399
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,333
And I think my little mop-top
friend here fell for it!

400
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,625
To be honest, I just did
this whole mature speech thing

401
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,208
to show off to Rose.

402
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,125
Basically, she mocked
me about hanging out

403
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,583
with my buddies all the
time, and so I said to her:

404
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,750
"Whatever!

405
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,458
Tiger will always be
a lone wolf, lady!"

406
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,250
Or somethin' like that.

407
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,833
Uh...

408
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,833
I need to tell Rose
I said all those things

409
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,375
to impress her, but she's
all the way back in the city.

410
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,625
Might take awhile,
you know how slow I can be.

411
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,500
I'll catch up with you guys.

412
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,416
No need to wait up, okay?

413
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,125
I'll be--

414
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,041
Oh, hey there, Tamazo.

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,166
Ouch, that hurts.

[TAMAZO whimpers]
Tama!

419
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,375
Tamazo!

420
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,083
Okay, well, I'll see ya soon.

421
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,458
All right. See you later.

422

[TIGER]
Land!

423
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,333
Bubbling over with
passion, I'm aiming for the top!

Geyser's fiery man about town.
They call me Tiger!

425
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,500
Don't worry about it,
little buddy!

426
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,875
Either way, you've got
guts and heart!

427
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,625
That's what counts.

428
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,958
Sounds like a plan.

429
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,333
Let's give it
everything we've got!

430

[CHARO whimpers]

431
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,666
Well then, I think I will!

432
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,125
It's time to go for the top!

433

[TIGER]
You guys!

435
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,041
Go for the top!

436
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,333
I'll see you there!

437
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,375
Heh.

438
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,000
[CHARO, ACE]
Yeah!

439
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,458
[ACE]
A lot of things have happened

440
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:52,041
since I first came to Dragoza.
Some were scary, some were fun,

441
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,916
and some of them
were a little sad.

442
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,291
[ACE] There are so many
things I'd like to say, but...

443
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,416
Next time:
"E-mail from Ace."

444
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Why are e-mails
so hard to write?
