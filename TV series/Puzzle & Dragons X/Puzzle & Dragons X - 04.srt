00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,333
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,458
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,083
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,708
They harnessed
the power of the monsters

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,916
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,333
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,833
[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers are
born with the special power

8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,583
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature,

9
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,500
mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,458
When fear and hatred
contaminate the elements

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,041
that surround us...

12
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,833
...the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters,

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,541
and restore balance
to our world.

14
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,125
The ocean!

15
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,208
That sea breeze feels great!

16
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,833
Hey! A dragon!

17
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,458
Looks to me like a Plesiel!
We've got to be getting close!

18
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,083
[TAMAZO]
Tama?

19
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,916
Wow... awesome!

20
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,333
There, on the horizon!

21
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,333
I see it.

22
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,916
Dragoza!

23
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,458
It would seem
the threads of fate

24
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,833
have brought him right to us.

25
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,000
[JEST] Though whether
or not King's progeny

26
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,000
is worthy of the Tamadora
remains to be seen.

27
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,208
The Ancients have decided
to leave that choice

28
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,375
in the capable hands of Vahaton.

29
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,708
I couldn't capture the Tamadora.
I failed you, Master Jest.

30
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,083
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:35,083
Lance, please. There's no need
for you to apologize.

32
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,583
Your failure, too,
was fated in the stars.

33
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,750
Yes...

34
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,041
[CHARO]
Dragoza Island is divided up

35
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,375
into five distinct areas.

36
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,250
Fire, light, wood,
water, and dark.

37
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,000
We're now in the
water-focused town of Crocus.

38
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,166
[ACE] It's way different
from Vienna City.

39
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,541
[TAMAZO] So many different
monsters here, Tama!

Tamazo?

43
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,625
[CHARO] Hmm? Don't worry,
that dragon isn't scary.

44
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,041
He's here to give
all the townspeople

45
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,083

46

Awesome.

Now let's see here.

48
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,458
Looks like your grandmother's

[VAHATON]
No need for us to rush.

55
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,375
We've been waiting
for this moment

56
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,708
ever since King's
disappearance, haven't we?

57
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,250
What's a few more hours in
the grand scheme of things?

[VAHATON]
What is it, Donny?

62
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,625
An Ouka's been spotted, Master.
It's a fire-type monster.

63
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,000
I've heard that it's
living in Rusk forest.

64
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,125
An Ouka?

65

Don't you worry.

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,166
I'll take care of him
before he has a chance

67
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,708
to burn the forest down.

68
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,625

Is that really you, Ace?

You've grown so much since

Let me introduce everyone!

I can't remember the last time
I had such a heartfelt greeting.

91
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,541
Well, I've got your
room setup already,

92
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,375
so go on inside,
drop your stuff off

93
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,666
and get a feel of the place.

Thank you very much, ma'am!

Any news on Dad?
Or where he might be?

103
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,208
Nothing.

104
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,666
[ANGINE] So much time has passed
without a word,

105
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,833
or even a simple clue
as to his whereabouts.

106
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,125
We thought he would be here

107
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,750
when your power as
a Dragon Caller awakened.

108
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,875
But I suppose you
can't fight fate.

Here, take this.

110
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,583
One of those?

111
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,875
This particular one
belonged to your father.

112
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,416
It was his D-gear, Ace.

113
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,541
And it should help guide you on
your path to become

114
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,583
a great Dragon Caller,
just like he was.

Hands off!

122
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,333
You're going to need
a monster companion

123
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,625
to activate the D-gear,

124
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,791
you won't be able
to operate it without one.

125
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,166
A monster, huh?
Let's find one!

126
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,666
[TAMAZO]
Tama!

127
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,000
Be careful out there, Ace.
It's not as easy as it sounds.

128
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,458
[CHARO] Oh, wow!
That's the real thing!

129
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,833
Can I hold it?

130
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,291
Yeah, why not? I don't know
how to use it anyway.

131
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,666
[CHARO] For starters,
you're going to need to

132
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,916
get a monster Egg Drop
just to get it functional.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,666
What's an Egg Drop?

134
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,250
That's what it's called
when a monster takes

135
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,625
the form of a Drop.

136
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,375
All you have to do is stick
the Drop in your D-gear

137
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,750
and then you can
summon that monster

138
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,333
to fight for you as an ally!

139
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,708
Okay. How do I get an Egg Drop?

140
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,500
[CHARO] Uh... The Dragon
Caller's Guide says

141
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,333
that the monster
has to accept you.

142
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,833
Then it'll turn into an
Egg Drop all on its own.

143
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,208
Okay, you lost me.

144
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,083
Unless I'm mistaken,
it basically means

145
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,958
becoming friends with
the monster in question.

146
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,208
Right on! If I've gotta
have a monster buddy,

147
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,458
I hope it's cool, like a dragon!

148
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,333
No, that's not super likely.

149

You're just learning, you need
something more entry-level.

[OUKA]
Hmm?

171
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,416

That guy there is
a fire-type monster.

175
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,916
It's called an Ouka,
and the fires it makes

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,041
could put this whole
forest in danger.

177

He doesn't really look
that dangerous to me.

I could've taken care of
the situation by myself.

189

I didn't mean to hurt him.

[CHARO]
What do we do?!

195
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,625
[SONIA]
Build a fire.

[ACE]
Ah. It's you!

Yes, it's nice to see you again.

198
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,791
Six months ago, word got
out that Oukas lived here.

199
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,500
Unscrupulous Dragon Callers
came to this forest

200
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,458
to seize their power.

201
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,125
Ouka used his fire to
chase them all away.

202
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,541
But now people fear it
as a dangerous monster.

203
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,916
In the end, all the
Oukas were captured.

204

All except for this one.

205
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,375
I can't believe I hadn't
heard about that...

206
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,416
This guy survived on his own.

207
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,916
That must've been
real tough on him.

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,333
I don't really know a
thing about my power.

209
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,958
About what it takes
to be a Dragon Caller.

210
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,958
He's fading into Drop form.
He might disappear!

211
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,125
[ACE gasps softly]

212
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,750
Eat this and get your
strength back, Tama!

213
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,041
I'm sorry...

214
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,666
Please get better, Ouka!

215
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,041
You have to!

216
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,416
[CHARO]
It became an Egg Drop!

217
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,083
That should make it easier for
him to recover his health.

218
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm so glad...

219
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,416
[TAMAZO] He must've been
able to sense the kindness

in your heart, Tama!

221
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,500
Is that red D-Gear yours?

222
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,833
Yeah, my grandmother
just gave it to me.

223
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,333
You can take care
of Ouka for now.

00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,416
When he gets his
strength back, release him.

225
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,416
That little monster's far
too strong for you to handle.

Okay...

227
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,916
How surprising!
I didn't expect you

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,291
to bring back an Egg Drop
on your first outing.

229

And an Ouka at that.

Well, it's only temporary.
Get well soon, little guy.

Rest up, Tama!

232

I wonder if he'll heal
faster if we warm him up?

233
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,125
Yeah! How about we
wrap him up in a blanket?

Anyway, what brings you here?

Master Vahaton sent me
here this morning.

He said he wants me to escort
you guys over to him.

The Master Vahaton,

the protector and backbone
of the township of Crocus?

Meeting with him is
beyond a big deal!

The Master's an
old friend of mine.

I let him know that
you were coming.

a little about the importance

But before we go to him,

we need to return this

321
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,500
[OUKA]
Hmm...?

322
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,625
Let's go...

323
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,125
[CHARO]
Yeah.

324
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,166

[howls]

326
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,625
Poor guy's calling out
for his friends.

327
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,583
He'll keep howling,
waiting for the other Oukas

328
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,041
to return to the forest.

329
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,625
Stop it, pipsqueak.

330
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,666
There's nothing we can do for
him, so let's just keep going.

331
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,333
[OUKA howls]

332
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,250

00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,750
[CHARO]
Huh? Hey, wait!

334
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,291
Oh, come on.

00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,750
[pants]

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,541
Hey, listen to me.

337
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,041
It's not just dangerous to stay
out here all by yourself,

338
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,291
it's also lonely.

339
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:44,666
I know I'm... I'm not a
Dragon Caller yet, or anything.

340
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,416
They say I can't handle you.

341
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,291
I'm sorry. "Handle you,"
you have a choice.

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,083
Would you lend me your power?
We'd make a great team.

343
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,791
[OUKA growls]

344
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,416
So, no?

345
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
Would you stop
prattling on and on?!

346
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,250
Ask him nicely, and then
say the stinking magic word!

347
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,250
Have you considered
kneeling down before him?

348
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,583
Pin the shoulders, Tama!

349
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,375
[ACE] Would you all stop
teasing and let me think?!

350
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,875
I actually was serious.

351
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,833
[DONNY]
Pest control, comin' through!

352
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,416
Not you guys again!

353
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,375
Not you again, back at ya!

354
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,958
You again, again, Tama!

355
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,916
Ouka's a dangerous monster--
it's time you realized that.

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,416
And there's no way
you can control him!

357
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,916
That's not true!

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,583
Ouka isn't a dangerous monster,
he's actually really nice!

359
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,166
Move aside!

360
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,666
I'm gonna defeat this Ouka.
Then his Egg Drop will be mine!

361
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,458
And I'll earn the
respect of the guild.

362
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,375
[yells]

363
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,750
Release!

364
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,375
Ace, this is bad!

365
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,458
[ACE growls]

366
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,875
I won't let you
threaten these woods!

367
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,541
Go, Aqua Fighter!

[WOODSIES screaming]

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,041
Whoa! What's going on?

00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,791
[CHARO]
That was a Woodsie nest!

371
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,333
[TAMAZO]
This is no good, Tama!

372
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,291
You blundering doofus!
Watch your aim next time!

373

[DONNY grunts]

374
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,375

[gasps]

379
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,708
You should try using
Ouka's power.

380
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,041
[ACE]
What?

381
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,791
Ace, he's saying he wants
to fight them--together!

Let's do this, Ouka!

385
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,875
[ACE]
Now! Lend me your power!

386
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,541

Now's your chance, Tama!

00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,083
[CHARO] He's right, Ace!
Shout "Inferno Blast!"

392
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,541

[WOODSIES screaming]

00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,000
Well done, Tama!

396
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,166
Nice job! You got 'em, Ace!
That was awesome!

[barks]

399
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,833
Couldn't have done it
without Ouka.

[DONNY sighs]

402
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,750
[VAHATON] Getting Ouka
to join you as an ally

403
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,083
was splendid on
your part, my boy!

404
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,833
[ACE]
Huh? Who's that?

405
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,708
[GARNET] The Ancient of Water--
Master Vahaton.

406
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,291
Purity antler guy?

407
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,458
[VAHATON] You sure do remind me
a great deal of King, you know?

408
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,916
And that Tamadora certainly
brings back memories.

409
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,500
My Tamadora?

410
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,666
It's a species of monster
that was quite prevalent

411
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,916
in ages past.

412
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,541
But it's been far
too long since any

413
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,125
were spotted out in the wild.

414
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,208
Then does that mean
you're, like, super rare?

415
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,500
Tamazo is special!

416
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,250
[VAHATON]
You fought with such bravery

417
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,000
to protect your friend, Ace.

418
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,375
Tamazo and Ouka could see
you had an open heart,

419
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,000
which made them willing
to give you a hand.

[thunk]

421
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,666
[VAHATON] The true purpose
of a Dragon Caller

422
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,875
lies not in fighting monsters
that appear among us.

423
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,375
Our world is full of Drops, and
therein lies our sacred duty.

424
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,666
It falls to the Dragon Caller
to maintain balance

425
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,041
between the elements,
creating order amidst the chaos.

426
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:19,333
King loved peace and gave
his all to save the world.

427
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,625
And to keep you safe, too.

That D-Gear you have there.

430
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,666
King left that because
he knew you'd need it.

431
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,791
Even now he's looking out
for his boy, it would seem.

00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,833
[VAHATON laughs]
Well, it seems like Ouka here

435
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,166
is rather fond of you!

436
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,791
And now it's my turn
to welcome you

437
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,041
to Dragoza Island, my dear boy.

438
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,208
If you'd like to stay here
and train in Crocus,

439
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,833
we'll do everything we can
to help you make

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,791
Okay!

442
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,666
You're practically
a Dragon Caller!

443
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,875
Tama, ta!

444
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,000
I never would've done it
without you, Charo!

Hi, Ouka, my name's Ace.

450
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,541
So! We can get to know each
other better while I study.

451
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,041
Sound good?

452
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,458
I never thought that
Ouka would save me.

453
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,958
Sorry... I guess...

[ACE chuckles]

455
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,916
[TAMAZO] But... we still
don't know who you are!

[TAMAZO] Ace is well on his way
to becoming a Dragon Caller.

457
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,333
But it's not all smooth sailing!

458
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,291
There is something Ace
is still missing, Tama.

459
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,500
Wanna know what it is?
I'm not telling, Tama!

Next ep!
"Soul Armor," Tama!

461
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,458
[gasps]
I accidentally told you!
