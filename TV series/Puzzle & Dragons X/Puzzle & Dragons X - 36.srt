00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,583
[NARRATOR]
The Battle Cup,

2
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,125
where ambitious young Dragon
Callers come to compete against

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,875
one another and determine
who's the best of the best.

4
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,458
It's a high-stakes tournament
where matches are fought

5
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,708
based on fighter classes.

6
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,625
They're all competing
for the glory,

7
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:38,875
as well as the Golden Egg.

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:42,166
The late Ancient of Light,
Master Lukes, banned Soul Brave,

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,458
an ancient Dragon
Caller technique.

10
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,125
However, that ban was lifted

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,833
by the current Ancient
of Light, Master Jest.

12
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,666
Utilizing their Soul Armor
and various monsters,

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,291
these Dragon Callers are aiming
to bring home the big win!

14
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:01,250
Ready yourselves, challengers,
for the moment of truth!

15
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,583
This is it!
You really made it, Ace!

16
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,833
You're in the final
battle against Lance!

17
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,208
And how cool is that, dude?

18
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,333
You did a great job,
and you should be proud!

19
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,583
[ACE] "Did"?! Why are you
talking in the past tense?

20
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,708
The battle hasn't
even started yet.

21
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,791
[laughs]

22
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,250
You're right, man.
Sorry about that.

23
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,916
You think we're going to lose
this fight, don't you, tama?

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No, you must've
misunderstood me, dude!

25
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,875
I bet it'll all work out as long
as you have a strong heart!

26
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,666
You just give it your
best and go for broke!

27
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,833
Well, I wasn't
planning on losing.

28
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,125
I'll do everything
I can to win this!

29
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,250
[BOTH]
Wha--?

30
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,666
Wait, what's up?

31
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,958
See? These guys do
think we're gonna lose.

32
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,125
Come on, man, give us a break.
You know that's not true!

33
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,500
Yeah, what he said!

34
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,958
We totally have faith
you'll win this thing, Ace.

35
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,750
Your face looks funny when
you're telling a lie, tama.

36
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,666
Oh, I know! Let's go
and talk to Miss Herriot

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,083
before your match begins!

38
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,583
Because, she's fought against
Lance a number of times,

39
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,791
and might even have some
insights on him to give you,

40
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,791
if we ask her!

41
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,625
Great idea! Hey,
nice going, Charo!

42
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,041
So, whaddya think, Ace?

43
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,666
Sure thing!

44
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,083
[HERRIOT] You're asking me
for a way to beat Lance?

45
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,583
That's right.

46
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,625
Does he have any weaknesses,
or maybe some hidden tricks?

47
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,708
I don't wanna goof up like you.

48
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,291
[HERRIOT]
I didn't goof up, kid!

49
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,500
[TAMAZO] So we don't embarrass
ourselves out there, then.

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,458
Are you morons trying
to pick a fight?!

51
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,166
Do you think I'd look like this
if I had that kind of info?

52
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,333
No, guess not.

53
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,166
[HERRIOT]
Try using your brains next time!

54
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,375
Come to think of it,
Miss Herriot has never

55
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,083
defeated Lance in any
of their previous battles.

56
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,375
If she's always lost to him,

57
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,208
how's she gonna give us
advice on winning?

58
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,416
Master didn't just lose
to him, he crushed her.

59
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Now would you simpletons
please stop rubbing salt

60
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,166
in the poor woman's
wounds, already?!

61
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,458
You just hurt my feelings
worse than they did.

62
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,208
[whimpers]

63
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh. I'm really sorry.

64
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,208
This whole thing is my
fault, Miss. I apologize.

65
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,916
[sighs] This squishy little
guy is just so darn comfy!

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,041
I'll forgive you boys
if you leave Eggy here.

67
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,166
You're heavy!

68
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,666
I'm not a pillow, tama!

69
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,666
This is our chance
to get outta here.

70
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,208
Right on.

71
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,750
Hey, do you have any idea why
a bunch of us Dragon Callers

72
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,375
refer to Lance as
the "Prince of Ice"?

73
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,791
[ACE]
Uh, no.

74
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,583
[TAMAZO] Is it because he
grew up in Ice City, tama?

75
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,083
No, that's not it.

76
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,666
It's 'cause he always
has his guard up.

77
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,250
When you're in the
midst of battle,

78
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,458
you can usually get some sense

79
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,083
of what your opponent
is feeling.

80
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,500
Anguish, joy, fear,
those sorts of things.

81
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,083
With Lance, I was never able

82
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,500
to get any kind of
read on that kid.

83
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:14,500
He remains cool under pressure,
and stays frosty on defense.

84
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,375
I see. So he really
earned that name.

85
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,291
Yeah. Bottom line, I don't know
what to expect from him,

86
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,166
let alone any specific
weaknesses he has.

87
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,000
But Ace, the most
important thing

88
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,416
isn't what your opponents
weaknesses might be.

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,625
It's about taking advantage

90
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,041
of your own strong
points in a fight.

91
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,875
If you can boost your attack
with Horus' multi-color-combos,

92
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,083
you might just stand
a chance against him.

93
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,500
[gasps]

94
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,291
Stay true to yourself and
the rest comes naturally.

95
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,791
That's the best
advice I can give.

96
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,291
Staying true to myself?

97
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,583
Right! Then get all
fired up and--!

98
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,333
[groaning]

99
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,208
[GARNET]
Master!

100
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,958
[TAMAZO]
Take it easy, tama!

101
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,833
Thanks a lot, Herriot!

102
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,541
I appreciate it!

103
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,541
[BOTH gasp]

104
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,166
I get that Lance is pretty
strong, but I don't care,

105
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,833
'cause I have my monster
friends to back me up!

106
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,208
I'll believe in
what they can do,

107
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,333
mixed with me giving
it all I've got!

108
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,333
Tamazo's with you
all the way, Ace!

109
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,666
Oh, yeah!

110
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,833
All right!

111
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,666
Good luck out there, kid!

112
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,625
[laughs] Thanks!

113
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,750
I can't believe Ace
is fighting Lance

114
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,916
for the Battle Cup championship!

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,416
It's all so exciting!

116
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,833
I don't even know which one
of them I should cheer for!

117
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,666
That's easy.

118
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,166
You Keep cheering for Ace.

119
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,375
He's become the pride of
Vienna City, after all.

120
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,625
If he beats Lance here, he's
going to become super famous.

121
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,375
I just hope he'll remember
all the little people

122
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,458
that helped him get where he is.

123
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,333
[LENA grunts]

124
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,958
Uh? Back in his younger days,

125
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,458
King used to lose
matches all the time.

126
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,958
[gasps]

127
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,125
[ANGENE] I even worried that
he didn't have what it takes

128
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,541
to be a real Dragon Caller.

129
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,333
I guess I never knew that.

130
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,833
Oh, yes. Well, he was
actually quite pitiful.

131
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,000
So, no one knows what the
future has in store for Ace.

132
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,833
Any mother would fear the worst,

133
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,208
but the sorts of things they
worry about seldom happen.

134
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,041
I don't that think Ace
is going anywhere.

135
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,250
I hope you're right.

136
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,500
And of course, nothing could
keep King from losing to you.

137
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,375
I-I don't know what
you could mean.

138
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,416
His father lost to me, too.

139
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
[BOTH laugh]

140
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,666
I wish you the very best
in your match, Lance.

141
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,125
Thanks.

142
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,500
The boy, Ace.

143
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,791
Master Vahaton holds the
abilities of that young man

144
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,125
in high regard.

145
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,708
Don't take him lightly.

146
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,833
You may need to unleash
everything you've got

147
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,375
on him in order to win.

148
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,625
Right.

149
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,875
But Soul Brave takes
a toll on the user,

150
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,291
both in body and spirit.

151
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,625
It's dangerous if you push
yourself too hard.

152
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,416
And you sometimes
have difficulty

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,000
remembering your
own limitations.

154
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,541
Yes. I'm aware.

155
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,083
Now, ladies and gentlemen!

156
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,916
The final match of the Battle
Cup is about to begin!

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,958
Ace, from Class C, defeated his
adversary in the last round,

158
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,041
which gave him the right

159
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,041
to battle against Lance,
from Class A!

Who will win this
year's tournament?

Will it be the reigning
champion, Lance?

Or the challenger, Ace?

You might even get lucky!

Don't get beaten
by some show-off!

170

Go, Ace! Go for the
top of the Battle Cup!

171

I never thought the final
round would be against you.

Yeah, what Master Lance said!

I can't believe you
made it this far!

We'll see if you have
real power, devi!

This isn't gonna go down
like the Guild exam.

Ha! You can talk that bunch
of smack all you want, devi!

We'll show you that you're
no match for us, devi!

Don't underestimate us!

You've got rotten

It's the finest dish in
the whole world, devi!

Wait. We're not supposed
to be bonding, devi!

Without further ado,

He chose to block
my first attack.

217
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,666
I guess he was just trying to
see what I was bringing.

218
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,041
Now, he won't even let me
close enough to touch him.

Right, guess I'll take my turn.

[TIGER, GARNET, CHARO growl]

228
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,791
Lance pulled that off well.

229
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,625
Harnessing Drop energy seems
to come as effortlessly

230
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,416
to that young man as breathing.

231
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,541
Lance has been able to read
the flow of the Drops

232
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,791
since he was little
more than a toddler.

233
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,708
That sort of talent is quite
uncommon, even among Dragonoids.

234
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,083
Well, when you put it like that,

235
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,958
things aren't looking
too good for Ace.

236
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,291
But this battle's
barely even begun!

237
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,166
And Ace never would
have made it this far

238
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,958
if all he had was blind
luck working for him.

239
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,916
I'm interested to see
how a mere human

compares to Lance's
natural talent.

I'm fine, but man, Lance
really packs a punch!

00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,416
But I'm not going to lose.

had to have hurt a ton.

away from giving up.

00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,833
even after that attack!

320
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,375
[ACE]
How can we hope to beat him?

321
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,333
Stay true to yourself and
the rest comes naturally.

322
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,583
[ACE]
How do I do that?

323
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,541
Is this the extent
of your power?

324
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,916
I'm somewhat disappointed.

325
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,083
[ACE grunts]

326
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:43,875
Let's go, Devi.

327
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,916
[DEVI]
Roger that, devi!

328
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,375
Go! Hell's Charge!

329
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,708
Devivebub's skill enhances

330
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,083
all Dark and Heart Drops
in Lance's field,

331
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,541
and now Lance can recover
any health that he's lost!

332
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,833
Time to end this.

333
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,250
[yells]

334
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,833
[screams]

335
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,291
[ACE groaning]

336
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,625
No! Poor Ace!

337
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,000
I can't bear to watch!

338
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,708
[crash]

339
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,541
Lena.

340
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,458
Sonia.

341
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,583
This isn't right!

342
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,916
What has the Guild
done to my boy?

343
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,416
This is all according
to Ace's choices.

344
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,750
But--!

345
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,708
[SONIA] He's giving this
fight everything he's got.

346
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,875
He has to be able
to endure this pain

347
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,916
in order to become a
true Dragon Caller.

348
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,166
Go back.

349
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,958
[LENA whimpers]

350
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,291
[ACE groaning]

351
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,916
[panting]

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,041
[LANCE]
What now?

353
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,166
Are you ready to give up?

354
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:28,166
As long as I can fight,
I'll never quit!

355
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,750
Come, my monster allies.

356
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,625
I command you by our
ancient agreement,

357
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,625
and the right granted
by my blood.

358
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,000
Unleash your might upon my
enemy, and bring him down!

359
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,375
Come forth, Aoyaiba!

360
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,333
Mirage Blade attack!

361
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,833
[AOYAIBA roars]

362
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,625
[ACE screaming]

363
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,583
[METAL] Aoyaiba's skill
strikes Ace hard!

364
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,416
[CROWD cheers]

365
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,083
[ALL gasping]

366
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,166
Ace. Come on.

367
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,500
I think it's time for
us to end this fight.

368
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,583
Ace's body can't take
much more of this abuse.

369
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,250
It can't be helped.

370
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,208
Will you make the announcement,
Master Jest?

371
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,333
I feel that ending the match
now would be premature.

372
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,250
We should give Ace a little more
time to rediscover the power

373
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,583
that brought him to this point.

374
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,208
Are you certain?

375
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,291
Ace! No.

376
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,875
[ACE groaning]

377
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,416
I can still fight! I can!

378
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,458
You've suffered enough, tama!

379
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,125
You gave this fight
your very best, tama!

380
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,666
'Cause I have you
fighting at my side!

381
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,333
So I know... I can... win!

382
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,916
Ace! No!

383
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,041
T-Tama?

384
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,708
Time to stand back up.

385
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,625
What? Tamazo?

386
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,833
We can't call it quits just yet.

387
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:22,083
Now get ready, Ace, 'cause the
real fight starts here, tama!

388
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:35,083
[yells]

389
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,333
That's a surprise.

390
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,000
[ALL gasping]

391
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:55,000
Holy Moly! Ace is revitalized
with immense willpower!

392
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:59,250
Is this the true power of Horus,
the eternal bird, phoenix?!

393
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:03,250
[CROWD cheers]

394
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,750
[ACE]
I can still fight!

395
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,041
My power, my friends' power,

396
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,500
we'll put 'em all together
to beat Lance!

397
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:54,416
Right?

398
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,375
So, what's the problem, Horus?

399
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,958
Next time: "Intense Battle!
Lance Versus Ace."

400
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,625
I need more power!
