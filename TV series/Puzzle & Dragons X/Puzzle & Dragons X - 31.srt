The Battle Cup,

of Light, Master Jest.

Utilizing their Soul Armor

these Dragon Callers are aiming
to bring home the big win!

with a two-element Soul Armor.

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,375
You can attack with your
main element Drops

75
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:46,125
and sub-element Drops by
converting them to your power.

Wha...? For real?!

You get more bang for
your buck, that way!

them such valuable armor sets.

quickly losing stamina!

However, this puts Herriot at
a significant disadvantage!

Huh. But why?

What's he mean?

120
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,291
He's referring to
the Leader skill

121
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,583
tied to Miss Herriot's
Soul Armor.

122
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:25,041
Her attack power is increased
the fuller her stamina is.

123
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,875
Alternatively, Miss Morgan's
Soul Armor boosts her attack

124
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,791
relative to how low
her stamina plunges.

125
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,250
As it stands, both of them are

126

expending enormous
amounts of stamina.

127
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,208
Which means Morgan's
attack power's been

128
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,708
increasing this whole time!

but this isn't a good look

164
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,875
for an up and coming
singer celebrity.

165
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,208
[HERRIOT groans]

166
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,250
[GARNET]
What?! Master Herriot is losing?

167
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,458
[MORGAN]
Take this!

168
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,916
[HERRIOT]
Think again, Morgan!

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,333
Armajin, my turn now.
Bright Wall!

170
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,916
[ARMAJIN grunts]

171
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,625
Oh, come on!

172
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,041
I forgot you had
one of those, too!

173
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,541
Oh, well. This one should
take you down for sure!

174
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,250
Did she just make
a Cross Drop combo?

175
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,125
She's gonna unleash a big skill!

176
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,125
[GARNET]
Master Herriot!

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,541
Let's finish this. Get ready.

178
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,666
[CROWD cheers]

179
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,208
And now, it ends!

180
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,541
Last Revolver Kiss!

181
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,791
[screams]

182
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,250
Miss Herriot!

183
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,958
[HERRIOT groaning]

184
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,125
[exhales]

185
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,625
[HERRIOT groaning]

186
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,333
[METAL] It looks like Herriot
is reeling from that one!

187
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,250
[GARNET]
It can't be. Come on.

188
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,208
You have to get up, Master!

189
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,750
Looks like it's all over.

190
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,875
You're wrong. We don't
know that yet.

191
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,166
If Miss Herriot was gonna lose a
fight, I don't think it would be

192
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,458
quite as one-sided as what
we've been watching.

193
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,916
I'd bet she's got at least one
trick hidden up her sleeve.

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,333
[CROWD cheering]

195
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,458
Oh, you wanna keep it up?

196
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,500
[HERRIOT]
Our fight isn't over yet.

197
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,041
No, but you certainly
look finished.

198
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,666
Why don't you quit, and
give me the win for today?

199
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,500
You know me, there's
no way I'll ever give up,

200
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,916
and remember it, Herriot
always comes in first!

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,166
I won our first fight.
I was the first born!

202
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,750
And when I'm the first one to
go to the Battle Cup finals,

203
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,916
you'll see who knows more.

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,708
Come out, Regulus!

205
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,791
Come, Arcline!

206
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,125
Use your Full Plasma Wave!

207
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,708
[roars]

208
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,125
[HERRIOT]
Holy Crest!

209
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,666
[BOTH]
Is Herriot fighting back?!

210
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,625
Give it all you've got, Herriot!

211
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,375
[CHARO] But she still
hasn't recovered enough

212
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,916
for her Soul Armor to boost
her attack strength!

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,416
[HERRIOT yells]

214
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,125
You're wasting your
time healing yourself.

215
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,250
You're never going to
have enough, you know!

216
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,916
It's more than I need
to finish this!

217
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,291
You've been acting so smugly,

218
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,291
like you know everything
there is to know about me!

219
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,708
[gasps]

220
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,583
[HERRIOT] But you have no
idea what I'm capable of!

221
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,041
[METAL] That maneuver just
boosted Herriot's stamina

222
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,750
back above 50%!

223
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,583
Her attack is now
12 times stronger!

224
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,916
No way!

225
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,250
All or nothing! Holy Rush!

226
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,250
[HERRIOT grunting]

227
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:19,833
[MORGAN screams]

228
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,541
[HERRIOT yells]

229
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,333
But how...?

230
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,666
[HERRIOT] Because you spent the
entire time on the offensive,

231
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,458
pushing forward with attacks.

232
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,875
Your body wasn't prepared to
handle that amount of stress,

233
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,000
and so your Soul
Brave dissipated.

234
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,666
Seriously?

235
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,333
[HERRIOT] You thought that you
had everything all figured out.

236
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,916
You were wrong, Morgan.

237
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,916
[gasps]

238
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,083
This'll be my 16th win.

[yelps]

240
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,666
[HERRIOT]
Now I'm in the lead again.

00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,916
[CROWD cheers]

242
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,541
[METAL]
It's over, folks!

243
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,208
The Class A semi-finals have
ended with Herriot's victory!

244
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,916
Which also means we've
arrived to the finals round

245
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,791
for each of the Class brackets!

246
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,125
Huh. [whistles]

247
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,041
Now that's a Battle Cup match.

248
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,708
Women's fights are
extra scary, tama!

249
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,125
Master Vahaton, sir?

250
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,375
What is it?

251
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,208
I don't think that continuing
to allow the use

252
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,833
of Soul Brave is the wisest
course of action.

253
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,916
Like just now, both competitors
were Dragonoids,

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,458
yet they still ended up
sustaining injuries.

255
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,833
If humans were to keep
up that kind of pace,

256
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,958
who knows what might occur.

257
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,458
You needn't worry, Torlie.

258
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,666
Is that right?

259
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,625
Soul Brave is our
heritage, and a power

260
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,750
Guild Dragon Callers may
need to use in the field.

261
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,708
But I...

262
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,916
[CROWD cheers]

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,708
With the semi-finals behind us,

264
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,166
we can now transition
to the finals to determine

265
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,416
the very best combatant
of each Class bracket!

266
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,625
In Class A,
Lance versus Herriot!

267
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,625
In Class B,
Garnet versus Starjohn!

268
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,791
And in Class C,
Kroell versus Ace!

269
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,541
Once the winners have been
established for each Class,

270
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,125
the victorious Callers will duke
it out in the final battle!

271
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,958
Who will emerge triumphant as
the champion of this Battle Cup?

272
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,625
These next few fights are
ones you don't wanna miss!

273
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,166
[MORGAN]
What a drag.

274
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,666
I thought today was my chance
to pull ahead and take the lead.

275
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,875
[HERRIOT] That ain't
happenin' for a while.

276
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,541
Make sure to win
your next round.

277
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,666
It's Lance, but I'll try.

278
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,250
[MORGAN] I was going to make
that hotshot pretty-boy cry.

279
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,541
So, I won't forgive
you if you lose.

280
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,791
Yeah, I know. I'll do
whatever I have to to win.

281
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,958
[MORGAN laughs]

282
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,500
But I'll need a break.

283
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,583
Soul Brave really takes
it outta ya, right?

284
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,291
You can say that again.

285
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:03,666
[CROWD cheers]

286
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,166
This may be the finals,

287
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,458
but you're lookin' like
you'll be a pushover.

288
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,833
Let's get this
over with quickly.

289
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,000
This kid's a real brat.

290
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,333
[METAL] And now, onto the
finals, starting with Class B!

291
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,833
Ready? Cross Fight!

292
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,166
Let's Cross-On!

293
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,500

[METAL]
Oh, no!

296
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,041
It appears that Garnet's
monsters haven't fully recovered

297
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,416
from their hard-won
battle against Klein!

298
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,833
Will they be able to
fight in this round?

299
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,791
Garnet! Hang in there!

Get to work, you two!

00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,708
[GARNET screams]

303
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,666
[STARJOHN] You shouldn't
be laying down on the job

304
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,708
just because you're injured!

[ACE] Time to return
the favor, Garnet!

308
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,708
[TIGER]
Yeah, hit him back!

309
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,958
Hey Cupid, activate Heal!

310
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,333
That didn't heal them enough.

311
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,208
I have to find a way
to help them some more!

312
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,291
[STARJOHN] Never take your
eyes off your opponent.

313
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,333
[GARNET screams]

314
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:36,583
[METAL] Starjohn lands
another blow on Garnet!

315
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,041
If he keeps pelting her
with attacks like that,

316
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,000
Garnet's injuries are
only gonna get worse!

317
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,500
That aint cool!

318
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,958
Is he intentionally hitting her
where she's been bandaged?

319
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,458
That jerk...

320
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,208
[STARJOHN chuckles]

321
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,916
[GARNET]
I have to use up these Drops.

322
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,500
More healing combos?

323
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,166
You sure seem to care a
lot about your monsters.

324
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,958
Just a little bit more and
they'll be back in the fight!

325
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,458
How's this?!

326
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,833
There we go!

327
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:33,541
[METAL] Once again, the mighty
Zeus makes an appearance!

328
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,083
Prepare yourself for
the Wrath of God!

329
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,416
[GARNET screams]

330
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Thanks, Zeus-y!

331
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,916
But what took you so long?

332
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,541
Try to hang in there, Garnet!

333
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,875
Don't give up!

334
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,500
[GARNET] I advanced all
the way to the finals,

335
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,500
but I still haven't
proven anything yet.

336
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,000
[GARNET] Am I going to
admit that I've lost?

337
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,250
That I was defeated so easily

338
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,041
by that rude little twerp?

339
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,791
No way! Not today!

340
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,416
I refuse to give up the fight!

341
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,166
Angelion!

342
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,916
Dear Mermaid!

343
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,250
[GARNET]
And of course...

344
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,583
...my Valkyrie!

345
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,000
She's summoned boat loads
of Light Drops, tama!

346
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,625
If she can make more
than six combos,

347
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,000
her attack power
will be amplified!

348
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,958
Use Valkyrie's Soul!

349
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,083
It's time, you guys!

350
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,916
[gasps]

351
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,375
[STARJOHN screams]

352
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,958
[BOTH groan]

353
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,500
[ALL]
She did it!

354
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,166
So how'd you like that?!

355
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,708
There's more where
that came from!

356
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,416
It's go time!

357
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,500
[HERRIOT] Did you see how pumped
up Garnet's getting in the ring?

358
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,250
I can't lose this battle,
either. Right, Morgan?

359
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,791
Wait, Morgan?

360
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,041
Where'd you go?!

361
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,291
Next time: "Twin's Memories."

362
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,291
You and I used to
always be together.
