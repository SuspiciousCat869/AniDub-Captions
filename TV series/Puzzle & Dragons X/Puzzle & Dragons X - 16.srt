00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,833
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,875
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,833
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,333
They harnessed
the power of the monsters

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,833
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:25,291
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,166
[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers
are born with the special power

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,041
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature,

9
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,083
mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:39,833
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us...

11
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,291
...the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters

12
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,000
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,333
[TIGER] So is this the place you
wanted to check out, Charo?

14
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,666
[CHARO]
Yes!

15
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,125
We're standing at the edge
of the Woodstorm Forest.

16
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,000
Several rare breeds of
monster call this place home!

17
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,791
And that includes Toyceratops,

18
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,958
one of my all-time
favorite monsters!

19
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,416
What's a Toyceratops?

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
[CHARO]
This is him.

21
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,916
It's the same kind of
monster Mr. Torlie uses.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,250
Whenever I dreamed about
becoming a Dragon Caller,

23
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,625
I've always imagined
having one of these guys.

24
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,958
Especially with the
upcoming Battle Cup.

25
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,000
So, I came here
and I'm going to do my best

26
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,583
to find that Egg Drop!

27
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,166
All right!

28
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,083
Let's find him, catch him, and
then head back home. Easy-peasy.

29
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,625
[GARNET]
Hold it right there!

--[GROUP gasps]
--Tama?

31
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,833
[CHARO] Garnet?
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,583
[ACE]
Are you, like, stalking us?

33
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,291
Why do you always seem to
suddenly appear out of thin air?

34
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,041
I know! She probably
wants to join our team!

35
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,125
Stop being ridiculous!

36
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,333
I came here to ask
you guys for some help.

37
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,708
I need the four of you
boys to get rid of something.

38
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,625
Yeah, get rid of what exactly?

39
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,666
Just some ghosts.

40
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,583
--[TAMAZO] Tama?
--[BOYS] Say what?

41
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:35,791
That's right! We're
going to a haunted mansion!

42
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,625
[ALL scream]

43
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,541
[TIGER] I'll admit, this place
certainly feels haunted.

44
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,666
It's almost like...
Like we're being watched.

45
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,333
[TAMAZO]
I curse you, tama!

46
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,041
[yelps]

47
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,875
[screams]

48
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,916
I never had you pegged
as a scaredy-cat, Tiger.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,958
I'm not scared!

50
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,125
He just surprised me,
that's all!

51
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,833
I ain't afraid of no ghosts,
and you can tell 'em I said so!

52
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,625
And besides, ghosts don't exist.

53
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,333
I'm just telling
you guys what I heard.

54
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,541
If you follow this path, it
leads to a huge, old house.

55
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,958
They say it's
the most haunted place

56
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,541
in the whole forest.

57
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,375
--[BOYS gasp]
--[TAMAZO] Tama.

58
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,375
Some say they've heard
sobbing coming from inside,

59
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,833
but no one has lived there
for some time now.

60
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,791
Others say a
female ghost roams the halls

61
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,583
of the mansion.

62
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,333
The people living
in the surrounding area

63
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,625
are terrified, so they reached
out to the Guild for help.

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,958
They want us
to get rid of whatever's

65
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,458
haunting the place.

66
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,833
But why us?

67
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,791
That's kinda outside
our job description.

68
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,000
Ace is right!

69
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,750
We came here to try to
find rare monsters,

70
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,666
not to fight off poltergeists
and specters and stuff.

71
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,250
What are you talking about?!

72
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,125
Just like we settle the
disruption of Drops,

73
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,916
it's our sacred duty
to do the same for

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the disturbed souls
of the world!

75
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,458
So, we have to do exorcisms now?

76
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,166
Are you just trying to scare us?

77
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,583
Oh, come on!

78
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,041
Since when did you become
"Miss Expert Ghostbuster?"

79
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,041
This is official Guild
business, I didn't ask for it!

80
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,500
Let's get a move on.

81
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,375
Or are you gentlemen going
to send a sweet little girl

82
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,708
out to fight ghosts all alone?

83
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,541
Excuse me,
you aren't sweet, tama!

84
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,625
Oh, just zip it!

85
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,250
Keep quiet and follow me!

86
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,333
You could just admit to
being scared, or ask nicely.

87
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,875
That's never happening.

88
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,458
So, this is it.

89
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,750
We've found the allegedly
haunted mansion of Woodstorm.

No, they're just monsters.

I don't see any ghosts
around here, do you?

We still have to check
the inside of the house.

I figured the Guild would
finally recognize me.

I just had to be brave and prove
that there were no ghosts here.

But no.

I wonder who used to live here?

for generations.

[TIGER] Maybe that was
some kind of ghost warning.

we shouldn't go any farther!

No way! They're applauding!

a dingy, old house
deep in the forest!

That's not the kind of attention
you should be looking for!

Would everyone please
calm down for a minute?
