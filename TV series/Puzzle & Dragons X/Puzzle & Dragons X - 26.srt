00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,833
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,041
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,875
the various crises
that threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,333
They harnessed the power
of the monsters,

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,833
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:26,791
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,291
Dragon Callers are born
with the special power

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,875
to bridge the gap
between the realms

9
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:35,083
of nature, mankind,
and monsters.

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:39,875
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us,

11
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:43,333
the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters,

12
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,250
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:39,625
Duen Desert. Home to a rare
monster with god-like powers.

14
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,166
Right.

15
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,583
If the monster accepts you,
things will be heavenly, tama,

16
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,875
but those forsaken turn
to sand and disappear.

17
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,625
Anyway, what's with that
outfit you're wearing?

18
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,125
I bought it at the gift
shop over there, tama!

19
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,208
Cool, huh? Took a picture in it!

20
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,875
We didn't come this
far to fool around!

21
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,416
[DAFNES] Trek across the sands
to the edge where the sun rises,

22
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,750
and you will find a monster
as powerful as a god.

23
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,375
Really?

24
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,291
Perhaps you might
succeed on this quest

25
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,541
where many others have failed.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,833
[ACE]
I want to become stronger,

27
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,666
to be able to fight
alongside my monsters!

28
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,958
Let's go meet this
monster god, tama!

29
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,333
She said he's at the
Cavern of the Dragonoids.

30
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,875
Do you know where that is?

31
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,875
You bet I know the way!
Follow me, tama! Tama, tama!

32
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,333
Are you sure you're not
going to get us lost?

33
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,333
Yuck, it's so hot, tama!

34
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,291
I'm gonna turn into
a boiled egg, tama.

35
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,541
I know. How much longer
till we get to the cavern?

36
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,250
We'll be there real soon.

37
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,333
Now keep quiet
and follow my lead.

38
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,000
Ah! I found it, tama!

39
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,416
Wait for me!

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,958
Look at all this food, tama!

41
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,000
So delicious! I feel refreshed!

42
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,625
I thought you were leading
me to the god-monster!

43
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,583
Instead, you led me to food.

44
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,250
Don't be ridiculous.

45
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,458
In the desert, food and water
are gifts from the gods.

46
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,958
That really hit the spot, tama!

47
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,750
Hey!

48
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:39,041
Empty? Did you really just
finish off all our water?!

49
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,625
That was good,
and now I feel full.

50
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,666
You selfish little brat!

51
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,416
We still have a long way to go!
We were supposed to ration this!

52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,583
Take it easy,
I just needed a pit stop.

53
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,708
Getting so livid about
such a trivial matter

54
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,375
is a bit of a
character flaw, tama!

55
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,375
You're making me angry, Tamazo.

56
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,958
That's too bad,

57
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,083
'cause you don't have a hope

58
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,083
of finding the place
without me, tama!

59
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,166
And if you've got a problem
with that, go find it yourself!

60
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,625
Yeah? Fine. I won't ask
for your help anymore!

61
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,250
It isn't my fault if
you end up lost, tama.

62
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,583
And there aren't
any dumpling shops

63
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,208
or ice cream vendors out there.

64
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,583
That's enough!

65
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,875
Tama.

66
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,833
I'm serious about this, Tamazo!

67
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,208
I'll find it on my own. I will.

68
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,583
You'll be sorry. Tama's
being serious about it, too!

69
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,833
I'm so thirsty.

70
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,333
Where is this place?
I've gotta find it.

71
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,958
[ACE] Whaddaya want?
I told you not to follow me.

72
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,166
I'm fine. I don't need Tamazo.

73
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,583
[TAMAZO] Hmph. There's no way he
can find the cavern by himself!

74
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,000
He should just give up and
come back to me, tama!

75
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,791
I'm getting bored!

76
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,291
Oh, I know!

77
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:36,125
Time for a little fun!
Chase the tail, tama!

78
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,500
Oh boy, I'm super
dizzy now, tama!

79
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,416
[screams]

80
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,625
[gasps]

81
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,083
Wait, you're not
doing anything either!

82
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,541
Wanna play with me, tama?

83
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,375
Are you tellin' me to bug off?

84
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,458
[gasps]

85
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,583
A bug saying "Bug off"?

86
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,333
[laughs]

87
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,916
Come on, that pun's gotta be
worth a little chuckle, Ace.

88
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,041
[TAMAZO]
Oh.

89
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:17,416
You're really lucky to have
a place to go home to, tama.

90
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,791
[TAMAZO]
Tama.

91
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,041
Ow!

92
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,416
He was chowing down on these
like they were delicious.

93
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,250
Tamazo is such a total weirdo.

94
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:57,458
Maybe I was too
harsh. I'm sorry.

95
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,375
[TAMAZO]
Ace. Ace!

96
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,791
Wake up, tama! Now's not the
time to be playing dead, tama!

97
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,166
Tamazo?

98
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,208
[TAMAZO]
Right over here, Ace!

99
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:30,083
[TAMAZO]
Ace. Look! I'm over here, tama!

100
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,875
Hey, Tamazo!

101
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,416
Just face it, Ace, you can't
do anything without my help!

102
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,208
That's not entirely true.
I can do plenty on my own.

103
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:47,083
But what I said to you was
too harsh. Please forgive me.

104
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,333
[TAMAZO] Drink this,
and let's head back.

105
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,791
I got more water from
the oasis for you, tama!

106
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,166
Dude, thank you!
I was seriously thirsty.

107
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,125
Drink this and
let's head back home.

108
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,166
I need you to promise me, tama.

109
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,958
But why? We came
here to find him.

110
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,416
We won't leave until we've
found the god monster.

111
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,333
We don't even need him, tama!
Everything's fine the way it is!

112
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,833
We came out here because
I'm trying to become stronger!

113
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,583
Time to head home!
I'm not going any further!

114
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:23,583
Cut it out! Why are you
behaving like this?

115
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,333
Because you already have
us on your side, tama!

116
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,083
You get this god,
then more will join,

117
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,791
and they're all gonna be strong.

118
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,583
When that happens, you'll have
plenty of tough monsters!

119
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,625
And when you have enough,
you won't need me anymore!

120
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,916
Tama.

121
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,375
[ACE]
You've got it wrong.

122
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,041
Tama?

123
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,541
I do?

124
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,833
It isn't like that.

125
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,166
It's backwards.

126
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,166
I'm dragging you and the
other monsters down with me

127
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,208
because I'm not strong enough.

128
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:10,750
You, Ouka, and the others, you
always end up having to save me.

129
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,541
Hey, wait a sec. Is that why
you kept acting so obnoxiously?

130
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,208
That's right, tama!

131
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,375
I was trying to make
you cry, tama!

132
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,291
I was gonna keep doing it until
you gave up and went home!

133
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,083
Because... I didn't wanna
get thrown off the team.

134
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,500
Turned back into a Drop.

135
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,333
Tucked away somewhere
and forgotten about, tama!

136
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,708
Don't be dumb, Tamazo.

137
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,083
You called me dumb!
You think I'm stupid, tama?

138
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,458
No, it's just--

139
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,833
No! I heard you! I'll be
the first one off the team!

140
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,208
Calm down!

141
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,708
[SONIA]
It's you.

142
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,208
What are you doing
all the way out here?

143
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,041
Sonia?

144
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,000
[ACE]
That hit the spot!

145
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,625
You're a real life saver, Sonia!

146
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,083
Thanks for your help.

147
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,583
I came here to check on
the condition of the Drops.

148
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,708
It's lucky I found you.

149
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,708
Why are you here?

150
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,750
The Ancient of Dark, Master
Dafnes, told me of this place.

151
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,625
And that in this cavern
lived a god-like monster.

152
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,875
So I traveled here to find him.

153
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,708
Dafnes? I see.

154
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,083
I know this place, tama!

155
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,916
This god is
definitely here, tama.

156
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,916
You're in the Cavern
of the Dragonoids,

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,833
the god's sacred resting ground.

158
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,125
We've been protecting
it for generations.

159
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,791
This is it.

160
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,666
That one looks like Tamazo.

161
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,916
Well, they're both Tamadras.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,916
Scores of them used to
live here in days gone by.

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,583
So there were a
bunch of Tamazos?

164
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,250
Sounds like a headache.

165
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:25,041
Sonia, what happened to Tamazo's
friends? Where'd they go?

166
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know.

167
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,750
One day they all
just disappeared.

168
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,291
Something's written
on it, tama!

169
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,708
[SONIA] "When the power of the
world's Drops becomes tainted,

170
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,958
the planet shall will its
messenger into action.

171
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,250
He will awaken all creation,

172
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,958
unlocking power beyond
comprehension."

173
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,916
It's an ancient legend
about the Tamadras.

174
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,916
I'm confused.

175
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,458
Tamadras are very
mysterious monsters.

176
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,000
They can speak with
Dragon Callers

177
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,875
and enhance their skills.

178
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,125
It is said that they carry
the planet's will with them.

179
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,833
Come to think of it, you fell
from the sky, didn't you?

180
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,208
I don't remember much, tama.

181
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,916
I guess you wouldn't.

182
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,125
Does that mean Tamadras
are the god-like monster

183
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,041
Master Dafnes told me about?

184
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,458
No, there is another monster.

185
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,958
Called Horus.

186
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,458
Horus?

187
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,666
[SONIA]
He guides Dragon Callers,

188
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,000
and blesses them with his power,

189
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,000
but gaining Horus' acceptance
is not an easy task.

190
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,750
And if he doesn't
accept you? What then?

191
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,333
The flame of his disapproval
will burn you to ashes.

192
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,291
You'll find Horus
down this hall.

193
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,833
Are you ready to face him, Ace?

194
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,750
You're gonna be
just fine, tama!

195
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,333
I'll be beside you
the whole time!

196
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,208
Right. Let's go.

197
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,416
A dead-end?

198
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,583
[TAMAZO]
Tama.

199
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,458
[ACE]
That must be Horus.

200
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,416
[HORUS]
Why have you come here?

201
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,250
[ACE gasps]

202
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,541
Because I'm trying
to become stronger.

203
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't wanna just
rely on my allies.

204
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,791
I would rather fight
alongside them!

205
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,916
Please bless me with your power!

206
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,833
[HORUS] You already have the
powers of a Dragon Caller.

207
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,375
However, that still
won't be enough.

208
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,541
What is it that I'm lacking?

209
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,875
[ACE gasps]

210
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,333
Hey, is that Ancient Dragon
Knight's Soul Armor

211
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,583
you got there?

212
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,708
You can't hope to
take me on with that.

213
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,916
Is it my Soul Armor?

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,375
Sir, would a new Soul
Armor do the trick?

215
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,125
[HORUS] True power cannot
be viewed outwardly.

216
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,416
If you don't even
understand that much,

217
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
then you don't belong here!

218
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,041
No, please wait!

219
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,416
Mighty Horus,
tell me what I need!

220
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,083
Time to fight, tama!

221
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,625
Show him your true power,
and he's got to accept you!

222
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,083
Release!

223
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,500
Cross-On!

224
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,166
Water beats fire. Leviathan!

225
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,541
Blizzard Rise Charge!

226
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,500
He's strong!

227
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,958
[screams]

228
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,416
Ace! No!

229
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,666
Not so fast, tama!

230
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,750
Cross-On, tama!

231
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,166
Awesome!

232
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,541
Tamazo!

233
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:42,208
Soul Armor skill, go!
Wood Drop change!

234
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,458
We did it!

235
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,375
Oh, no.

236
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,125
[gasps]

237
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,750
[screams]

238
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,125
Tamazo!

239
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,583
You okay?

240
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,291
Please, no.

241
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,833
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

242
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,041
Wake up, Tamazo!

243
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,166
Oh, Ace.

244
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,208
Tamazo is just fine, tama.

245
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,750
I can... I can
still fight, tama.

246
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,541
It's finished.

247
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,416
I can't keep fighting like this.

248
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,208
[TAMAZO] Ace, tama. You have
more strength than you realize.

249
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,500
Tamazo believes in
your power, Ace.

250
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,541
You can do it, tama.

251
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,500
Tamazo.

252
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,208
We all believe in you, tama.

253
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,041
You guys.

254
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,750
They're all saying,
"Don't give up," tama.

255
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,291
They want to work together.

256
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,625
I'll fight alongside you guys.

257
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,708
Now please, lend me your
power one more time!

258
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,625
I sense a significant
amount of energy.

259
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,416
Ace, grab that orb, tama!

260
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,875
I never knew Soul Armors
had such power.

261
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,708
All right! Let's go!

262
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,125
[ACE yells]

263
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,208
How the heck did I just do that?

264
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,750
[HORUS]
You've obtained the Cross Drop.

265
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,625
It's created when
the Dragon Caller

266
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,333
and the monsters' powers
work in perfect harmony.

267
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,375
But I was just desperate.

268
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,458
[HORUS]
You were so focused

269
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,541
on seeking out
strength for yourself,

270
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,625
you forgot one of the
most important things

271
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,416
a Dragon Caller can know.

272
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,208
What important thing is that?

273
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,958
[HORUS]
The strength of the bond.

274
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,250
Dragon Callers cannot become
more powerful on their own.

275
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,916
They must listen to the
voices of the monsters.

276
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Only then can they hope
to unify their powers.

277
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,083
That is the true way.

278
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:58,458
And now, boy with the Tamadra,
I shall grant you my soul.

279
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,416
Protect this planet with
the strength of the bond!

280
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,583
[ACE]
I will.

281
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,750
[TAMAZO]
We did it, tama!

282
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,208
You got his Soul Stone!

283
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,708
Yeah.

284
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,208
It looks like you
found your answer.

285
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,625
Oh, hey Sonia.

286
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,291
Fire, wood, water,
light, and darkness.

287
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,875
When the individual
powers unite as one,

288
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,375
they'll complement one another,

289
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,166
and create an immense
amount of energy.

290
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,666
That's Horus' ability.

291
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,166
But weaving the different
energies together?

292
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,333
That's all up to you.

293
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,791
Right!

294
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,500
[gasps]

295
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,125

Tama.

296
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,750
This is so comfy, tama!

297
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,541
I remember.

298
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,291
Oh, I've got it!

299
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,916
I can feel the power
flowing into my tail!

300

301
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,708
[TAMAZO]
Oh! Awesome!

302
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,791
Hino Kagutsuchi Tamazo!

303
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,875
Yo!

304
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:54,500
[ACE gasps]

305
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,958
Whoa! He changed?

306
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,000
Those are all
Tamadra egg shells.

307
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:02,333
The spirit of Hino Kagutsuchi
is embedded in the empty husks.

308
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:06,666
So Tamazo's got his own
Soul Armor now? Awesome!

309
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,041
[TAMAZO]
Yo!

310
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:08,916
[ACE chuckles]

311
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Ow, that's hot!

312
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,416
Learn to use your new
power. Become stronger.

313
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,958
Impress me.

314
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,416
Armor Drop, tama!

315
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,708
I have Horus' power!

316
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,750
And you also still
have me too, tama!

317
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:42,166
Tamazo will make a great Dragon
Caller out of Ace yet, tama!

318
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,791
And I'm gonna stick by
your side until I do, tama!

319
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,208
Thanks, buddy.

320
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,833
First off, we need to
win the Battle Cup, tama.

321
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,250
You can do it if you put
your heart in it, tama.

322
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,333
Yeah. We'll do it
together, Tamazo.

323
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,750
[TAMAZO]
Tama!

324
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,541
[stomach growls]

325
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,250
Man, my stomach's super
growly all of a sudden.

326
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,000
I have a sunny-side up
egg ready to go!

327
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,125
What? How?

328
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,541
I cooked it using
Horus' flame, tama!

329
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,916
Fresh and tasty!

330
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,875
[TAMAZO chuckles]

331
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,208
[ACE]
You mean during--?

332
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,041
You need to take this
more seriously, you know!

333
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,708
[TAMAZO]
Oh, I am, tama.

334
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,416
That's why I only cooked
it over easy, tama.

335
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,458
[TAMAZO] The mighty Horus
has accepted Ace, tama!

336
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:52,041
I'm pretty sure it's all
thanks to me, tama.

337
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,833
Now that we've got
Horus' Soul Armor,

338
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,791
we're gonna win this
tournament, tama!

339
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,166
Next time. "Battle Cup Begins!"

340
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,625
Tama! Our opponent is
very surprising, tama!
