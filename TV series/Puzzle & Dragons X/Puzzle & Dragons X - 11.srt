[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,875
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,500
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,166
They harnessed
the power of the monsters

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,125
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,541
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,375
[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers
are born with the special power

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,166
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,208
Mankind and monsters.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:39,833
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us...

11
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,333
...the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters

12
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,541
and restore balance
to our world.

The deep blue sea.

It reflects the distant
blue of the sky above.

00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,458
The sun is warm. It's as
if the longer I stay here,

The more likely my wounded
heart might find love.

He's also one of the strongest
Dragon Callers around!

The general consensus is that
he's the one most likely

an alternative to this guy?
