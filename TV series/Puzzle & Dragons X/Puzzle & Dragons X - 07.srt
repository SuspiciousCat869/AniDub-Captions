1
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,666
I don't know why,
but I saw Drops that day.

2
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,833
[gasps]

3
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,250
I failed... I wasn't
strong enough...

4
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,416
Well. Callers who can draw
that many Drops at once

5
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,958
are few and far between.

6
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,583
Interesting.

7
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:18,041
[ACE] I wasn't good enough.
I can't let that happen again!

8
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,791
I need to get stronger.
I have to!

9
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,375
[HERRIOT]
You wanna be stronger?

10
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,541
[gasps]

11
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,750
[ACE]
Who're you?

12
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,125
When I toss this mapple,

13
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,541
gravitational forces
will pull it down.

14
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,625
But Dragon Callers
control Drops.

15
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,416
By matching Drops, we can
channel the various energies

16
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,250
that make up the natural world.

17
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:46,500
That's where the power that
Dragon Callers wield comes from.

18
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,166
And you are...?

19
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,000
This is my Dragon Caller
master, <i>the</i> Ms. Herriot!

20
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,750
If you really wanna be stronger,

21
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,916
the only way to do it
is through training.

22
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,125
Training? If you train me,
I'll be stronger?

23
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,791
Montage time!

24
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,125
Tama?

25
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,166
[whimpers]

26
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,875
So, uh...

27
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,708
Sorry, what?

28
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,333
Will you train me? I promise to
give it everything I've got!

29
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,666
Maybe I will.

30
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,541
But there's something
I need you to do for me

31
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,250
before we get started.

32
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,666
There's so many of them, Tama!

33
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,000
[HERRIOT] The locals call
this place Seashell Bay.

34
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,708
From what's washed ashore
I'm sure you can see why.

35
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,666
[ACE] And you only want me to
bring you the seashells

36
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,458
that have the moon mark on them?

37
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,666
No way we could
ever do that, Tama!

38
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,625

39

--[ACE wails]
--[TAMAZO] Tama!

40
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,875
[MORGAN giggles]

41
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,625
[gasps]
Hey, careful with that!

42
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,458
Are you being naughty
and talking back to me?

43
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,625
I might have to punish you
if that's the case.

44
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,500
I told you to stop pointing
that dangerous D-Gear at people!

45
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,541
It's completely unprofessional!

46
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,375
Sister, dear, you're
always such a wet blanket!

47
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,875
I just like the sound,
so I loaded it with blanks.

48
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,750
No need to worry.

49
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,791
I want you to bring me as
many of these moon-shells

50
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,375
as you can find, and I'll
make an adorable necklace!

51
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,875
Won't you help me?

52
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,250
Ugh. Yes! Okay,
I'll do it! Sure thing!

53
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,125
But you're gonna train me
once I find them, aren't you?

54
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,541
I suppose.

55
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,750
Man. I haven't found any
seashells with moon marks.

56
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,041
Have you?

57
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,416
[HERRIOT]
What are you doing?

58
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,833
[TAMAZO]
Why did you do that, Tama?!

59
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,833
Ace spent a whole lot of time
sorting through those, y'know!

60
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,583
Waste of time.
Just look at it and see it.

61
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,000
Just look?

62
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,250
Yeah, right. There's no way
that's gonna work!

63
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,375
[GARNET]
Hmph.

64
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,208
Don't just give up and
say you can't do something

65
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,875
when you haven't even tried.

66
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,041
[gasps]

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,083
Come back tomorrow.

68
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,958
Huh?

69
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,041
Well, that's strange.
It turned all foggy.

70
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,125
[CHARO] Ace?
Are you feeling any better?

71
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,333
[ACE] Yeah, a little
ache-y here and there,

72
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,916
but I'm fine.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,541
You helped me to safety after
I got knocked out, didn't you?

74
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,000
Thanks, Charo!

75
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:44,333
No need! Besides... I, uh...

76
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,541
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,083
Huh?

78
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,083
I just... I kinda feel guilty
for everything I said.

79
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,333
You thought you could win
and it's all my fault.

80
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:58,708
No way! It's my fault for
letting my power go to my head!

81
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,958
You haven't even filled your
D-Gear up with monsters yet.

82
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,916
There's no way you could've
taken down a monster

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,875
of that size with
an incomplete roster.

84
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,333
Charo...

85
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,333
[HERRIOT] Today, you're going to
weed the yard around my cottage.

86
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,541
[TAMAZO] She's just making
you do her chores for her!

--Bang!
--Tama! I'm sorry!

Don't talk back, cue ball.

00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,208
Phoo.

90
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,083
[HERRIOT] And my little sister
also has a task

91
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,625
for you to complete.

92
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,666
[MORGAN] Since you're going to
be weeding her yard anyway,

93
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,083
could you keep an eye out
for a four-leaf clover?

94
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,375
Lucky clovers are going
to be all the rage

95
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,375
in women's fashion this season!

96
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,333
[ACE] And you'll train me
if I find it for you?

97
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,708
[HERRIOT]
Maybe we will.

98
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,875
[growls]

99
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,500
[ACE]
None here... None here.

100
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,875
Man! These are all
three leaves.

101
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,875
[HERRIOT] What? Are you ready
to throw in the towel?

102
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,541
[ACE grunts]
No!

103
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,791
But aren't ones with
four leaves really rare?

104
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,375
So...

105
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,625
If you listen to the voice of
nature, I know you can find it.

106
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,916
Oh, yeah?
Is the grass gonna say

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,875
"There's a four-leaf clover
over here, Ace"?

108
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,291
What a buncha hogwash.

00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,375

Tama!

110

squishiest little cutie-pie

113
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,708
in the whole wide world, huh?

[gasps]

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,041
I could see them again
for a second...

116
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,208

[ACE] Oh, man, I'm calling it
for today. I'm exhausted!

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,041
[TAMAZO] What point
is there in weeding

120
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,875
that weirdo's yard, Tama?

121
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,666
Look, I'm afraid she's
just using you, buddy.

122
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,708
[GARNET]
You want training, don't you?

123
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,083
[TAMAZO]
Tama?

124
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,958
Don't you want to be a certified
Guild Dragon Caller?

125
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,333
[slurps]

126
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,083
Of course you want that.

127
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,000
I dunno, maybe.

128
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,958
How's Guild Dragon Calling
different from what I'm doing?

129
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,958
Man, you don't know
anything, do you?

130
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,791
One's Guild-affiliated
and the other's solo.

131
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,250
When you join the Guild,
they try to assign you tasks

132
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,666
suited to your
specific skill set.

133
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,875
Then... Lance came to
Vienna City on Guild business?

134
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,375
Resolving a Drop Impact
is one of the most

135
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,791
important tasks assigned
to a Guild Dragon Caller.

136
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,208
Could you help me out
with something?

137
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,083
One of my monster's
Egg Drops is all cloudy.

138
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,291
You see?

139
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,458
Yes, that certainly
is a problem.

140
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,958
This Mystic Dark Knight
wants to become stronger.

141
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,083
But I'm afraid you aren't
strong enough for him to grow.

142
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,000
But I can change that...

143
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,916
If I just train to be stronger,

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,583
the Mystic Dark Knight
will get stronger, too?

145
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,375
It's all up to you.

146
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,541
[ACE]
My poor belly's rumbling.

147

I can't really explain why.

149
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,000
Some of 'em just sparkle.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,458
[ACE]
I see it! It's the same sparkle!

151
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,250
[TAMAZO gasps]
Tama!

152
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,541
Found one!

153
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,166
With the moon mark!

[beeping]

155
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,541

[beeping]

157
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,375
Huh? I got a message.

158
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,250
Oh, yeah, that's right, the
Guild Dragon Caller's exam

159
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,541
is this week.

160
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,291
So are you planning to try out?

161
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,916
[DRAGON CALLER A]
No way!

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,416
The Guild Dragon
Caller's exam?

163
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,000
[ACE] "Attention prospective
Guild Dragon Callers:

164
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,291
there's an exam at
the glacier tomorrow."

165
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,416
I wish I was ready
to go and take the exam.

166
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,791
[HERRIOT]
You're not gonna try?

167
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,458
Uh. Well, no. I still
have to go through training.

168
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,666
You just finished
your training, Ace.

169
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,583
[ACE]
Huh?

170
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,083
Wow, nicely done!

171
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,250
[TAMAZO]
I knew it, Tama!

172
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,083
They were just taking
advantage of you!

173
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,208
You worked the whole day
without complaint.

174
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,458
Driven on by your focus
on your given mission.

175
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,666
You followed your instincts
and you never gave up.

176
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,583
Important traits for
pro Dragon Callers.

177
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,541
You'll be able to control
the flow of Drops

178
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,666
with more training, and then
you can bend it to your will.

179
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,041
Never forget this lesson.

180
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,666
Uh? Sure...

181
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,250
And now here's a little reward

182
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,416
for all the hard work
you've done.

183
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,416
[ACE]
That's an Egg Drop! Awesome!

184
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,333
Now I've got another
monster in my D-Gear,

185
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,166
which means my team's
even stronger!

186
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,833
Don't let it go to
your head, Tama...

187
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,416
Whoah--Oh!

188
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,041
You're such a trouble-maker!

189
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,625
I could say the same
thing about you, Tama!

190
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,000
What's up with the jacket?

191
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,875
Well, tomorrow's
exam site is some place

192
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,250
that's supposed
to be pretty cold.

193
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,416
[knocking]

194
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,291
Charo.

195
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,833
Hey, so, I guess you're
planning to take the exam?

196
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,708
You, uh, wouldn't mind if I
tagged along for it, would you?

197
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,083
You, too?

198
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,291
I can't see the Drops
clearly most of the time,

199
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:24,291
and I don't have my own D-Gear,
so I can't take the exam.

200
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,208
But I still want to
come along and help you out

201
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,958
in any way I can!

202
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,666
Of course you can come!

203
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,208
With you on my team,
I know I'll pass the test!

204
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,791
[CHARO]
Heh. Yeah!

205
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,375
It's--It's freezing!

206
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,083
[sniffs]
My nose is stopped up!

207
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,375
[CHARO]
It's Mister Metal!

208
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,625
Hello, all! I'll be
proctor in charge

209
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,625
of directing today's
Guild Dragon Caller

210
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,791
Glacier Examination Event!

211
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,291
My name is Metal.
It's a pleasure to meet you!

212
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,333
Look! That's the Ancient
of Water over there!

213
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,916
Oh, heya, Vahaton!

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,500
If you're here
to take the exam,

215
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,458
please head to the indicated ice
cave, where we can get started.

216
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,916
Uh! Excuse me!
I'm not taking the exam!

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,583
[gasps]
Oh, no!

218
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,083
[ACE]

219
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,333
[CHARO]
They barricaded the entrance...

220
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,666
Aw, these little
tykes are too cute!

221
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,416
So, you kids wanna grow up
to be Dragon Callers?

222
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,083
Yeah, we're just kids.

223
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,708
But that doesn't give you the
right to be condescending!

224
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,625
Are you planning to take
the exam, too, old timer?

225
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,750
Yes, and I'm hoping this year,

226
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll have what it takes
to pass the exam.

227
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,708
Heya, pops. Wanna clue us in on
what the exam's gonna be like?

228
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,500
Come on, you can share.

229
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,625
Well, the exam's actually
been completely different

230
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,750
every single time I've taken it.

231
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,250
It's nothing to brag about,
but I've taken this test

232
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,083
many times over the
course of 20 years,

233
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,583
and they have yet
to recycle anything.

234
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,583
Heh. Then you're useless.

235
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,250
You mean you've taken
this exam hundreds of times?

236
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,833
No. It used to only take place
every four to five years or so,

237
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,916
as I recall. But now they hold
the exam more frequently

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,625
than they did in the old days.

239
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,125
Which is good news
for me, really.

240
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,916
All right, it's time to
get this exam underway!

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,416
If you'd all please pick one of
the rooms in front of you

242
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
and step right in.

243
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,708
I had no idea
so much showmanship

244
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,666
was involved in the exam.

245
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,250
[DONNY] 
Hmph. So what is this?

246
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,541
[METAL] Now, there should be ice
walls in front of everyone.

247
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,541
You'll need to get to the
other side if you want to

248
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,791
move on from this room.

249
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,666
[VAHATON] Be sure to
choose a course of action

250
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,083
based on the very nature of
what you see before you.

251
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,333
For those of you
who choose correctly,

252
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,666
you'll reach the other side
of the Ice Cave Wall

253
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,708
and the next part of the test.

254
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,291
[WALTER grunting] All you have
to do is get to the other side?

255
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,458
Then I'll break it down!
[grunts]

256
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,500
[METAL] Please, proceed
carefully however,

257
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,875
as you will be
penalized any time

258
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,125
the action you
take is incorrect.

259
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,333
I wish you'd said that sooner...

260
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,833
[DONNY sighs]

261
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,125
[groans]
No. It won't budge!

262
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,541
[DONNY] Did the rock
next to it slide over?

263
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,416
I get it! It must work
the same as Drops!

264
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,041
So all I've gotta do is line up
the same colors up like always!

265
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,666
[groans] That's weird.
I-It won't slide!

266
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,000
[DONNY groans]

267
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,000
[screams]

268
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:32,541
It must behave like
a Drop. Here goes!

269
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,708
[HENDERSON grunts]

270
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,958
[HENDERSON groans]
I failed again!

271
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,833
[TAMAZO] It won't line up
like the usual Drops do.

272
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,708
And adding a third Drop doesn't
make it disappear either, Tama.

273
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,458
[CHARO]
What should we do now, Ace?

274
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,458
[VAHATON] Be sure to
choose a course of action

275
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,583
based on the very nature
of what you see before you.

276
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,458
For those of you
who choose correctly,

277
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,875
you'll reach the other side
of the Ice Cave Wall

278
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,833
and the next part of the test.

279
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,208
The nature... of what you see.

280
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,875
I want to make that plant grow.

281
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,333
But I'm not getting
any Wood Drops in here.

282
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,750
I've got it!

283
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,583
The Ancient Dragon Knight has a
skill that transforms

284
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,833
Fire Drops into Wood Drops,

285
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,541
and that just might be
your way outta here!

286
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:28,833
'Kay. It's time for
me to Cross-On! [yells]

287
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,083
Drop Change skill! Wood!

288
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,291
You did it, Ace!

289
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,625
Well done, Tama!

290
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,208
I thought I should listen
to nature's voice,

291
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,958
like in training!
Looks like I was right!

292
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,708
You did a great job, Ace!

293
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,458
[laughs]

294
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,666
[MYERS groans]
What are we supposed to do?!

295
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,000
There's no way
we can get across this!

296
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:58,500
[FRANK growls] I'll swim across
easily using my ninja magic!

297
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,833
[yells]

298
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,291
[grunting]

299
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,416
[screams]
I was wrong!

300
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
[METAL] That option
never would have worked!

301
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,041
[ACE] Ice all around...
Wait, that's it!

302
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,625
[ACE] I can use the Water Drops,
make all of it.

303
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,791
Go!

304
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,708
Come on! We don't
have much time!

305
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,125
--Right!
--Tama.

306
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,083
Well, then. That's one way
to get things done!

307
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,333
[VAHATON] There's always
more than one solution.

308
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,583
But the method they chose
is a little less

309
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,750
conventional than most.

310
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,125
[CHARO grunts]

311
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,500
We made it, Tama!

312
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,958
You just flew the whole time!

313
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,708
[ALL laugh]

314
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,750
Now! Everyone here
has passed the trials so far,

315
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,166
but, it's time for us to move on
to the next section of the exam!

316
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,875
[VAHATON] Your task is to make
your way through this room

317
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,291
without using any
of your monsters.

318
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,583
[BLUE TROLLS growl]

319
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,916
[MYERS]
So what?

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,166
Are they just gonna
stand there and not attack?

321
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,666
[BLUE TROLL A growls]

322
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,541
[MYERS growls, yells]

323
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,666
Hah! Guess I was
too strong for him!

324
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,375
Now for the rest of 'em!

325
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,666
No need! You've done enough
for us to make our decision!

326
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,916
Please step into the
adjoining room, sir.

327
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,666
Yeah? Seriously?
Well, then, adios, amigos!

328
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,833
Nice! It looks easier than
any of us were expecting!

329
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,375
Hey, what's the big idea?
Just take down one,

330
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,708
that way there's enough left
over for the rest of us!

331
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,625
[laughs] Sometimes the
wisest choice in competition

332
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,208
is to thin the herd.

333
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,416
If you boys hope to catch up,
then you'd better hurry,

334
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,583
or else there won't be
any Blue Trolls left!

335
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,833
I'm up next, right?

336
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,916
No way! I'm gonna go next!

337
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,333
Why won't the Blue Trolls
attack to push these guys back?

338
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,291
They just keep standing,
huddled around the same spot.

339
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,750
They're probably making a
barrier to protect the weaker,

340
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,083
smaller Blue Troll
in the back row.

341
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,416
[gasps]

342
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,583
Please stop!

343
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,250
Huh? What's wrong?
That coat cook your brain?

344
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,750
They're just trying to protect
the weakest ones in their group.

345
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,833
They aren't even fighting back!

346
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,958
It isn't fair! Leave them alone!

347
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,458
[MEADOWS] Hah!
Who cares about these wimps?

348
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,083
You came here to pass the exam
like everybody else, didn't ya?

349
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,291
Now move!

350
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,375
[ACE grunts] I told you
to leave them alone!

351
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,750
[grunts]
Get offa me, ya little freak!

352
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,208
Let go of me.
I said hands off!

353
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,458
[ACE grunts]

354
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,708
--Careful!
--Tama!

355
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,916
Yeah, don't mess with me, kid!

356
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,333
Charo, Tamazo!

357
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,416
Tama!

358
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,916
[CHARO grunts]

359
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,833
[BLUE TROLL B growls]

360
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,041
No, don't!

361
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,083
[ACE grunts]

362
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,791
[gasps softly]
The Troll...

363
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,125
Huh?! What the
heck was that?

364
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,750
I would've blasted that monster
for sure if this weirdo

365
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,458
hadn't run out in
front of my attack!

366
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,208
[VAHATON] Mm-hmm. If the
Blue Troll hadn't turned

367
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,041
into a Drop just now,
you would've defeated him,

368
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,083
there's no question about it.

369
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,416
Then...

370
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,708
Then please make your way
into the adjoining room.

371
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,458
That's that!
Smell ya later, kid!

372
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,625
I guess we were supposed
to defeat those Blue Trolls,

373
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,958
and we've failed the exam
because we didn't.

374
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,625
[ACE chuckles]

375
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,791
[ALL gasp]

376
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,875
[MYERS] It's about time!
So, what's the next test?

377
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,375
Well, that's it.
Your exam is over!

378
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,833
Uh? So does that mean what
I think it means, sir?

379
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,416
[VAHATON]
Yes, it does indeed.

380
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,416
I'm afraid the lot of you
ignored the voice of nature.

381
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,458
And that means you also
fail as Dragon Callers.

382
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,875
[gasping]

383
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,958
[ACE gasps]

384
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,208
This test is done,
and you have passed!

385
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,000
[ACE]
Huh?!

386
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,333
You passed the test, Ace!

387
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,333
I knew you could!

388
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,083
Looks like all your
training really paid off!

389
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,583
Hi, Ms. Herriot!

390
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,083
[HERRIOT]
Searching for the right seashell

391
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,666
and listening to what the
voice of the plants had to say.

392
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,583
Wasn't such a waste
of time, was it?

393
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,375
[ACE] Oh, so you used that
yard work to train me?

394
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,541
[HERRIOT] Yep. Well, that
and my yard was a mess.

395
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,291
Huh...?

396
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,333
I told you she was using you
to do her chores, Tama.

397
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,833
[VAHATON] Now that you've
proven that your heart's

398
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,666
in the right place, you may
proceed to the final test.

399
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,708
Wah! I wonder
what's gonna hatch?!

400
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,625
[CHARO] Whoa!
Your Mystic Dark Knight evolved!

401
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,333
Wow, I guess I really did
get a little bit stronger!

402
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,875
[MORGAN laughs]

403
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,750
[MORGAN] Jeez.
You are so naïve.

404
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,750
And the Guild
is no better, really.

405
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,166
That wasn't a real test at all.

406
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,166
[ACE growls]

407
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,750
[MORGAN]
Well, then.

408
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,125
I guess I'll have to be the one
to put you through the wringer,

409
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,416
you silly little boy.

410
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,208
[growls]

411
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,083
[ACE] I finally made it
to the last test!

412
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,916
And sure, I'm facing off against
a strong-looking Dragon Caller,

413
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,083
but I've got Tamazo, Ouka
and the rest on my side!

414
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,875
Next time!
"King's Footsteps."

415
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,458
I'm going to become
a Guild Dragon Caller!
