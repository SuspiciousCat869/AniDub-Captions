Well, thank you. But the TV
gave all the credit to the SDF.

322
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,958
Tama! I'm all revved up!

323
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,166
One combo? That's baby stuff!

324
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,000
Keep working on it for
another million years,

325
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,875
and maybe you'll have
a shot at me then.

326
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,666
[GARNET]
Where did those come from?!

327
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,083
[GARNET growls]

328
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,458
Never mind.

329
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,125
Tama?

330
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,333
You can't walk away!

331
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,041
I'm overflowing with
power over here!

332
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,208
Oh, hush! As if I'd ever take
this pipsqueak seriously!

333
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,916
[ACE]
Hey, Garnet!

334
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
[GARNET] At least you know
my name now, don't you?

335
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,500
I'll let it slide this time.

336
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,875
Uh, wha...?

337
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,125
Wow, Ace! You lined up
the Drops on your first try!

338
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,250
You're a natural!

339
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,541
Oh, yeah? You mean it?

340
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,916
Yeah, and...

341
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,375
...I wanted to say thanks
for sticking up for me.

342
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,583
Sure, kid! No prob!

343
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,875
[BOTH chuckle]

344
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,500
[GARNET growls]
What was that?!

345
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,625
[SONIA]
Garnet.

346
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,625
Hey Sonia! Why're you here?

347
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,500
No way... Not him!

348
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,625
Why did you stop your
battle with him?

349
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,083
That's simple--because
if two Dragon Callers

350
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,125
fought it out in the courtyard,
we would've made quite a mess,

351
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,625
wouldn't we?

352
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,000
Good thinking, Garnet.

353
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,375
Thank you.

354
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,791
[LENA]
But the egg he found,

355
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,458
it was the same kind
of egg King had.

356
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,041
I thought it was
only my imagination,

357
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:58,083
but no--it looks like Ace has
too much of his father in him.

358
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,166
[ANGINE]
Remember to breathe, Lena.

359
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,333
Why don't you send
the boy to us?

360
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:06,125
There's a lot we can
teach him on Dragoza Island.

361
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,375
[ACE gasps] Where'd the
egg-head run off to?

362
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,541
We've made contact
with the monster!

363
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,708
Tama?

364
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,250
[TAMAZO]
I hatched, Tama!

365
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,541
Now that I'm outta my shell,

366
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,166
I'm going to try all
the yummy food I can find!

367
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,375
Wait, this place
doesn't look right-- Ace!

368
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,250
Save me from these weirdos!

369
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,916
Next Episode:
"Operation Tamazo Rescue."

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,625
I wonder what sort of grub
they'll feed me here, Tama.
