[LANCE]
Hmm. Like it?

166
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,666
[DEVI]
It's a perfect name, devi!

167
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,166
Devi will be Devi from
this point onward, devi!

168
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,250
Devi, devi!
Devi-devi, devi-devi!

169
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,291
[sighs]
I need to call it a night, devi.

170
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,333
Leader says we're going to
perform in the next town over

171
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,500
tomorrow morning, devi!

172
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,958
[LANCE]
You're awesome, Devi!

173
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,166
[DEVI]
Devi is pretty amazing, devi.

174
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,333
[LANCE]
Are you tired?

175
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,666
[DEVI]
Nah, not at all!

176
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,083
I can do this kind of thing
all day long, devi!

177
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,041
I think Leader and the others
take too many breaks, devi.

178
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,333
That's just because
you're full of energy!

179
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,750
Is that a problem?

180
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,416
[laughs]
Thank you for everything.

181
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,291
I appreciate what you've done.

182
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,125
Appreciate, devi?

183
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,166
So, Lance appreciates Devi?

184
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,500
Sure, I do.

185
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,250
[DEVI] Then, maybe Devi is
Master Devi, now, devi.

186
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,833
What's that?

187
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,791
[LEADER A] Remember,
our customers are patrons

188
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,041
of the arts.

189
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,750
We should be respectful
to them and appreciate

190
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,916
what they provide.

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,708
Treat 'em like you
would a master.

192
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,333
[DRUMMER A] So you
gotta stop telling them to

193
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,666
"enjoy the show or else."

194
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,333
You're killin' the creative
spirit, little dude!

195
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,375
[DEVI]
Devi?

196
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,250
[BAND MEMBERS laugh]

197
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,291
Okay, then.

198
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,458
Master Devi!

199
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,791
Devi!

200
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,416
I'm starting to feel pretty
important now, devi.

201
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,750
Master Devi.

202
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,166
Thanks for your help!

203
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,500
Oh, I forgot!

204
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,500
I borrowed these
from Leader, devi!

205
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,708
Why?

206
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,875
A haircut!

207
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,375
I want to see Lance's
face better, devi.

208
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,916
Uh! No, thanks!

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,125
[DEVI] Leader and the other
fellas do it all the time, devi!

210
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,166
They even taught me how!

211
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,333
[LANCE]
But I don't want a haircut!

212
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,875
[DEVI]
Stop moving, devi!

213
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,000
[LANCE]
No! Don't!

214
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,708
[gasps]

215
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,541
[BOTH whimper]

216
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,958
[LANCE]
Sorry, did I frighten you guys?

217
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,000
It's okay. I'm not scary.

218
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,208
[gasp, laugh]

219
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,500
[LANCE chuckles]

220
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,375
[DEVI]
Lance!

221
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,333
[gasps]
Welcome back.

222
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,000
We can really treat
ourselves today, devi!

223
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,416
What would you like to eat?

224
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,666
Huh? Pearapple's fine.

225
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,583
Yeah, but these
are for dessert, devi.

226
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,208
What if you and I have
T-bone steak instead?

227
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,041
Whatever Master
Devi decides to have, I'll eat.

228
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,333
Devi? Then I'll
head to the store!

229
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,791
Dev-vi!

230
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,750
[DEVI]
Uh-oh!

231
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,833
One of our pearapples
has escaped!

232
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,416
Oh! Whoops!

233
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,166
[LANCE]
Devi! Not there!

234
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,041
Oh, no!

235
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,416
I guess Devi will have
to eat this one now, devi!

236
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,333
[DEVI]
Devi?

237
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,708
You know what?

238
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,416
You can keep it, devi.

239
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,333
[LANCE]
Devi!

240
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,625
[gasps]
What was that?

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,875
[LANCE]
Devi?

242
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,166
Devi! Devi!

243
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,750
Is something
the matter, Master Dafnes?

244
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,625
[DAFNES]
Summon the carrier dragon.

245
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,541
[DEVI]
Devi...?

246
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,125
Devi? Who are you?

247
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,208
[DAFNES sighs]
It looks like you survived.

248
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,750
Hey! Let go of my friend!

249
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,000
Watch your tongue!

250
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,125
This is the Ancient of Darkness,
Master Dafnes!

251
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,916
I never expected
to find a Devidra.

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,833
I find it rather hard to
believe you're serving the boy.

253
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,750
Were you cast away?

254
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,250
[DAFNES]
Look around.

255
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,083
He did this to protect you.

256
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,666
[DAFNES] I thought it was
another Drop Impact.

257
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,791
We simply can't
allow someone with this kind

258
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,833
of raw power to run loose.

259
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,583
He won't make it
without our help.

260
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,833
[DEVI whimpers]

261
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:54,875
[DAFNES] We're taking him
to the Water City.

262
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,166
You can't, devi!

263
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,416
Lance belongs here
with his Devi, devi!

264
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,666
Enough!

265
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,375
This all happened
because of you.

266
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,375
[LANCE pants]

267
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,958
[DAFNES]
Am I wrong?

268
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,666
But he's...

269
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,625
[DAFNES]
We must hurry.

270
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,166
Yes, ma'am!

271
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,708
Please wait!
He needs his hat and PJs!

272
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,791
They're still
in the wooden box

273
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,666
where he puts all his treasures!

274
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,291
The hat was his dad's!

275
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,916
And his mom sewed
those PJs for him, devi!

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,250
Also, something else-- Lance...

277
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,000
He's likely to catch a cold
if he sleeps with his tummy

278
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,916
not covered up, devi!

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,541
One of his back
right teeth is starting

280
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,125
to come loose, devi!

281
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,208
And sometimes, he scrunches
his face up and pretends

282
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,083
to be annoyed even though
he's really having a good time!

283
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,375
He also prefers to
have his eggs scrambled

284
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,208
instead of served
sunny-side up, devi!

285
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,875
But most importantly...

286
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,666
He's my friend.

287
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,166
[DEVI]
Lance!

288
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,833
[DEVI] Please, sir, can you just
tell me how he's doing, devi?

289
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,291
[DRAGON CALLER A] Master Dafnes
said that she doesn't

290
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,083
have time to see you.

291
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,541
[MAN A] Boss! I rounded
everyone up, like you wanted.

292
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,166
[DEVI] We've got all the
delinquents in town here.

293
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,250
Listen up. I just need you
to create a commotion

294
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,166
outside the mansion, devi.

295
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,916
[DEVI] But if you fools do
anything more than that,

296
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,791
you'll have earned yourself
a quick Devi-Devi-Punch

297
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,500
to the gut, devi.

298
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,125
[MAN B]
We definitely don't want that.

299
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,708
[DEVI] Time to get one
over on old lady Dafnes!

300
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,416
[MAN B] Uh, boss? There's a
Guild Dragon Caller out there,

301
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,833
and he's headed right for us!

302
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,791
[MAN A]
What the--?

303
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,083
[MAN C]
Was our plan leaked?

304
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,541
[MAN B]
What do we do?

305
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,250
[DEVI] We're not gonna let
some stinkin' Dragon Caller

306
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,625
scare us away!

307
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,000
[MAN A]
He's all alone!

308
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,458
[MAN B]
Then if we both attack him-

309
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,750
[LANCE]
Release!

310
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,958
[LANCE]
You overdid it.

311
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,291
[MEN scream]

312
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,666
I'm afraid that all
your scheming ends here.

313
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,750
Dafnes wants to see you.

314
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,375
Come along quietly.

315
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,000
But I can't...

316
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,000
I just... devi.

317
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,125
Just hurry it up.

318
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,083
[DEVI whimpers]
Devi!

319
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,125
He's all grown up, and
he's a Guild Dragon Caller...

320
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,833
Even without Devi
around, he's fine.

321
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:23,875
Lance doesn't need Devi anymore.

322
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,041
[DEVI]
Devi...

323
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,041
How long are you
gonna make me wait?

324
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:54,083
[DEVI whimpers, cries]

325
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,583
[LANCE] Master Dafnes
made a special request

326
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,166
to the Guild about you.

327
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,916
[LANCE] You're to work
for us now, as my assistant.

328
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,375
[DEVI wails]
Devi! I'm so happy...!

329
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,416
And from now on...

330
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,041
...you're my Master.

331
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:26,250
And I'm never leaving
your side again, I swear! [sobs]

332
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,875
[ACE]
Wait, when did he get shot down?

333
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,833
[CHARO]
Just now.

334
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,041
He asked her out?

335
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,083
[CHARO]
That's right.

336
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,916
On the first day
we arrived in town.

337
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,833
Poor guy.
I didn't know any of that.

338
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,166
That's just classic Tiger, tama.

339
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,375
[ACE]
Hey, Lance. You here to eat?

340
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,333
Or you could just ignore me.

341
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,833
He's as annoying as usual, tama!

342
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,791
[CHARO]
Looks like Devi's not with him.

343
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,916
[ACE] He went to check in
on Master Vahaton.

344
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,375
[CHARO]
That was nice of him!

345
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,500
[TAMAZO]
He hurt his hip, tama!

346
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,791
'Cause he's older
than dirt, tama!

347
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,083
[ACE]
Stop that!

348
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,708
[DAFNES]
Do you fully understand?

349
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,250
Your role is crucial.

350
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,458
[DEVI]
Devi!

351
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,416
[DAFNES] You should
return to him quickly.

352
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,375
The last thing we want
is for Lance to catch on.

353
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,625
[DEVI]
Understood, devi.

354
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,791
[TORLIE]
What are Drops?

355
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,208
And how do they
give energy to monsters?

356
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,083
[TORLIE]
The world faces a crisis,

357
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,708
and I want to
explain things to you,

358
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,625
the Guild's newest
Dragon Callers.

359
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,916
Next time,
"The Secret of Drops."

360
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,041
Which is the secret
of our very world.
