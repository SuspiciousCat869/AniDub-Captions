00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,791
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,916
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,833
the various crises that
threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,291
They harnessed
the power of the monsters

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,833
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:25,375
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,125
[NARRATOR] Dragon Callers
are born with the special power

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,041
to bridge the gap between
the realms of nature,

9
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,125
mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:39,833
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us...

11
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,291
...the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters.

12
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,958
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,083
There will be an increase
in activity in the coming days.

14
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,583
So it's fortunate that
the mayor has thrown

15
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,208
his full support
behind our initiative.

16
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,666
Then he's finally
decided to take action.

17
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,125
Sure took his sweet time.

18
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,875
All right, let's start the test!

I wonder if he's become heroic,
just like Mister Lance?

[MAYOR]
Welcome!

00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,333
Nice to see you again,
Adjutant Nudo.

42
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,166
I appreciate you taking
the time to make this trip!

43
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,375
[NUDO] No problem
whatsoever, Mr. Mayor.

44
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,416
What was it you wanted
to discuss with me?

45
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,708
[MAYOR] Rumor has it
more Guild Dragon Callers

46
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,708
are coming to us from Dragoza.

47
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,458
Yes, sir, our
intel says the same.

48
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,000
The Guild assures
me they're only sending

49
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,833
their Callers to settle
an imminent Drop Impact.

50
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,458
But I'm more concerned
about them coming here, frankly.

51
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,750
Controlling monsters
is sure to bring harm

52
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,708
to our fair city it all
seems so reckless.

53
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,791
[MAYOR] And I don't
intend to fully entrust

54
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,125
our people's lives to strangers.

55
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,125
[NUDO] That's a prudent
choice on your part, sir.

56
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,000
The council of Ancients,
who serve as the heads

57
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,583
of the Guild,
are losing their powers.

58
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,416
The days of absolute
reliance on the Guild

59
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,291
are now behind us.

60
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,750
[MAYOR] Coming from a
Dragonoid such as yourself,

61
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,791
it must be true.

62
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,458
I can't trust this
city's protection to

63
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,791
a bunch of monster
summoning maniacs.

64
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,708
Which is why I created the SDF.

65
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:02,333
[NUDO] Yes. And with this city's
protection ever in mind,

66
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,416
we've nearly completed a suite
of anti monster weaponry.

67
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,708
[MAYOR] You can see the
Drops, can't you Newdo?

68
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,666
We're relying
on that ability of yours

69
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,833
to keep us in the loop.

70
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,791
I'll do everything in
my power not to let you down.

[BASUDORA roars]

I'd heard that
Guild Dragon Callers got to

sounded really awesome,

it's not for me.

Whoa, really?

[METAL] Now, try pushing
the "Search" button.

128
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,416
It made Drops appear!

129

This allows the user
to scan for nearby Drops

130
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,000
and it also points out
monsters in the vicinity

[CHARO] The Battle Cup

How are you?

162
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,666
I was just thinking about
stopping by your mom's shop.

163
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,416
I'll introduce myself.

164
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,000
The name's Tiger.

165
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,833
My dream is to climb to the top,
and meet a nice girl like you--

166
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,416
Yeah, yeah. I already heard
about both of Ace's new friends.

167
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,000
We've actually met before,
but that was a while ago.

Nice to meet you!

169
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,666
Our fate, like me
reaching the top is--

170
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,541
[HARU]
Right. I got it.

171
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,375
Hey, Haru. What's that?

172
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,208
[HARU] It's some kinda
Drop monitoring device.

173
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,375
You remember how right
before you left the city,

174
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,583
there was that monster
that attacked us.

175
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,875
[HARU]
Well, ever since then,

176
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,625
the SDF has seriously
beefed up their security.

177
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,708
With all these soldiers around,
the whole town's on edge.

178
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,708
That's probably 'cause the food

179
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,583
the soldiers
had was disgusting!

180
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,083
[ACE] Them capturing you
must've left a bad taste.

181

Tama.

182
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,166
It's the sworn duty
of a Guild Dragon Caller

183
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,750
to maintain the
balance of Drops.

are you not?

[ACE]
Uh... That's right.

189

[NUDO]
There's a storm on the horizon.

190
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,250
You should be careful.

and what was that about?

now that Ace is back.

Sonia! You startled me!

Long time no see!
What brings you by?

197

199

As the days go by,
Ace will grow stronger.

200
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,041
He shares King's potential.

201
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,375
Dragonoids and humans,
humans and monsters.

202
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,125
Like King,
he might bridge the gap

203
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,041
between the species.

204

[LENA sighs]

205
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,125
[SONIA] Which worries you
because then he might

206
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,041
disappear the way King did.

207
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,083
King was a good man.

208
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,875
We may have been
different species,

209
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,083
but he was like
my older brother.

210
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,250
King felt the
very same way about you.

211
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,250
He also respected you
as a Dragon Caller.

212
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,208
[SONIA] And yet I could
do nothing to save him.

Sonia...

214
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,708
I won't let the same
thing happen to Ace.

215
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,125
I promise to return
him to you one day.

All right!

337
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,125
We really did it, Ace!

338
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,958
We saved the city!

339
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,375
Uh-huh.

340
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,000
[DEVI] They actually did
a pretty good job, devi.

341
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,625
[MAYOR] Thankfully, we were
able to minimize the damage,

342
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,250
and for that, we are eternally
grateful to the SDF.

Who, I assure you, will always
guarantee Vienna City's safety.

[REPORTER A]
Reports indicate you had help

345
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,625
from some Guild Dragon Callers.

346
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,625
Yes, they were present.

347
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,041
But I think we would've had
the situation in hand sooner

348
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,083
if they hadn't
gotten in our way.

349
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,500
So that's the thanks
we get for helping them?

350
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,958
They're the real guilty
get-in-the-wayers!

[LANCE] Stop. This

Did they hurt you, tama?

00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,541
I'm fine it's just a scratch.

356
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,083
And how about you?

357
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,375
It got close for a second.

[HARU] Um... I'll go
return the first aid kit.

Yes. Thank you, Haru.

You really are

I only wish your father
were here to see you.

you saved our city.

for everything, Ms. Lena!

We'll take good care
of our pal Ace, here.

Hey, Ace.

Huh?

You were pretty cool.

Well, not quite as cool
as Mister Lance, of course.

But you still
caught my attention!

whispering about over here?

about it! It's nothing!

for the top by flying

as low as possible?

Maybe I'll come
visit you on Dragoza!

[TIGER] It's a city of dreams
and desires called Vegahs.

And in the city of sand,
the underground battle arena

397
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,583
is a big deal.

398
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,625
It was there that I met my past.

"Entetsu's Soul."

will the thirsty soul go?
