00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,333
[JEST]
Enter.

2
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,625
I didn't pull you away
from anything did I?

3
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,208
No.

4
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,458
Devi?

5
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,166
Someone told me it
had been a while

6
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,166
since the last time
he'd seen you,

7
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,458
so I thought I
would call you in.

8
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,000
[BOY]
What's up, Devi?

9
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,666
Have you changed your mind?
You decide to come with me yet?

10
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,208
[DEVI] It's been "no" since
the first time you asked.

11
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,583
Now let go, devi!

12
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,041
Aw, come on. Please?

13
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,500
You seem to be
doing quite well.

14
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,875
I hear that you
recently saw Sonia.

15
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, and Ace as well.

16
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:52,875
[BOY]
Ace?

17
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,708
Is that someone I should know?

18
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,333
Ace is the son of King,

19
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,208
and like Lance here,
he has a Tamadra of his own.

20
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,375
Wait, King? Tamadra?

21
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,458
And you know him?

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,041
Humans are so foolish.

23
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,000
Till next time, Devi.

24
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,166
See ya around.

25
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,416
Oh, yeah? Well, not if
I see you first, devi!

26
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,291
He hasn't changed at all.

27
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:26,041
Try not to be too put-off
by his childish behavior.

28
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,291
His finer qualities
outweigh the rest,

29
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,875
and he's needed for
the future of our planet.

30
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,791
The Guild is on its way towards
collapse from the inside.

31
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,291
I heard that from Nudo.
So what does it mean?

32
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,083
Oh? He told you that?

33
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,708
I'm afraid what he said was true

34
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,833
and time, sadly,
is not on our side.

35
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,375
You've known this whole time?

36
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:52,125
If the Guild collapses, then
who's left to save the world?

37
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,875
We are, of course.

38
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,166
The Dragonoids were always
meant to save the world.

39
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,000
It's our birthright.

40
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,625
When the time finally comes
to ascend to our destiny,

41
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,416
I'm going to need
your assistance.

42
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,250
Can I count on you?

43
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,916
Yes.

44
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,041
[ACE] This trip to
Shining Town's been fun.

45
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,000
It's such a lively place!

46
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,666
It's known for something else.

47
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,875
A mighty Dragon Caller
named Star John lives here.

48
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,750
Star John? I've never
heard of him.

49
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,916
Wait, you seriously don't know?

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,541
[ACE]
Mh-hm.

51
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,791
Believe it or not,

52
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,416
but I haven't heard of
this guy either, tama.

53
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,666
[CHARO chuckles]

54
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,041
According to the rumors,
he's incredibly strong.

55
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,708
He's also very elusive, because
no one's ever seen him before.

56
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,083
But if no one's
ever seen the guy,

57
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,750
how do we know how strong he is?

58
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,750
Seems like a weird rumor.

59
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,166
That's actually a
very good point.

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,916
[stomach growls]

61
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,541
My tummy's grumbling, tama!

62
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,500
Time to find something yummy!

63
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,708
Hey, come back!

64
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,250
[CHARO]
Wait for us!

65
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,708
It's an ice cream
paradise, tama!

66
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,666
But look, that's
such a long line.

67
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,916
We're gonna have
to wait a while.

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,208
[ACE] There isn't a line
at this one over here.

69
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,416
I don't really feel like
ordering anything from them.

70
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,041
The more run-down it is,
the better the food!

71
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,208
Like the saying goes, quick
and bold wins the race, tama!

00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,000
Why not?

00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,208
[CHARO]
Huh?

00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,541
Excuse me! We'd like
some ice cream.

I think I'll have
strawberry, tama!

sell us some ice cream?

I sure am!

Apparently, Star John
is supposed to be

Except no one's ever
actually seen the guy.

Wait, what? Seriously?

143
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:20,000
I thought if I came to this
city, I'd be sure to find him!

144
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,250
I dream about becoming

00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,375
a respected Guild
Dragon Caller one day.

146
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,958
I was planning
to ask Star John

147
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,041
if he would train me
whenever I found him.

148
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,333
I feel dumb.

Cheer up, Astell.

150
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,625
We'll find him together!

Yeah! Right, Charo?

Sure, why not?

154
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,791
I mean, it's not like we're
in the middle of a mission.

155
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,875
Plus, it's a chance for
us to get some training

156
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,750
from Star John too, tama!

157

Gee, I really appreciate it!

159
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,583
But we haven't got any
leads on his identity.

160
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,833
How are we ever
going to find him?

161
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,375
Door-to-door is
Investigation 101.

162
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,625
And the one clue we have is
that he's here in this town.

163
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,125
So that means someone somewhere
has got to know something.

164
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,708
I couldn't say.

165
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,625
I've never seen,
much less met the man.

166
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,166
Thanks, Mister.
We appreciate your time.

167
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,250
[OLD MAN A]
Hey, hold on there.

168
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,250
[TAMAZO]
Tama?

169
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,333
You seem pretty clever.

170
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,750
So take my advice, stop
your hunt for Star John.

171
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,708
Why do you say that, sir?

172
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,041
From what I've heard,

173
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,208
this Star John fellow is
an all-around bad person.

174
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,041
Well, like everything
related to the man,

175
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,208
I only know this from rumor.

176
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,083
But the story goes: He's such
a mighty Dragon Caller

177
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,666
that he has a godhead
serving under him.

178
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,208
A godhead?

179
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,125
Mophead? Letterhead?

180
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,416
It's an old word
that means deity.

181
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,791
You're liable to find
yourselves neck deep in trouble

182
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,708
if you decide to keep
looking for Star John.

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,500
We still don't have
any real leads.

184
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,333
And we still haven't gotten
any ice cream yet, tama!

185
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,666
We could use the break.
So ice cream it is!

186
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,333
Tama?

187
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,125
That stall wouldn't
sell us anything, tama.

188
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,500
Hi-ya, can I have
some ice cream?

189
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,250
Sorry, kid, but I'm just not
really feelin' it right now.

190
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,458
If you really want
some ice cream,

191
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,375
go wait in line
for the other shop.

192
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,291
Gimme some ice cream!

193
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,875
I already told you,
I don't feel like it, kid!

194
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,791
I told you I want some,

195
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,916
and you're gonna give
it to me right now.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,083
[yelps]

197
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,625
Yeah! Sure thing! Right away!

198
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,500
Here, and let me say sorry again
for making you boys wait.

199
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,083
[ASTELL]
Thank you, Mister!

200
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,333
Here, help yourselves!

201
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,750
Tama! It's delicious!

202
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,583
The tart sweetness of the
strawberry perfectly marries

203
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,791
with the silkiness
of the vanilla, tama!

204
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,833
And the combination of
the bitter chocolate

205
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,500
and the roasted nuts
is out of this world!

206
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,875
That shop's ice
cream is fantastic!

207
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,291
Astell, how'd you get that
cranky owner guy to serve you?

208
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,083
I just looked him square in
the eye and asked him firmly.

209
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,291
You guys have been nice
enough to help me out,

210
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,708
I thought you deserved to
get some ice cream for it!

211
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:38,208
I see. Well, thank
you very much!

212
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,750
[chuckles]

213
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,500
So what are we going to do now?

214
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,750
Should we continue
asking around the town?

215
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,083
Man, I just don't know.

216
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,666
I forgot!

217
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,500
[ASTELL]
I just remembered I had this!

218
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,291
[CHARO]
You have a map?

219
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,625
This must be Shining Town, here,

220
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,375
and it looks like there's
something in the forest

221
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,375
at the edge of town.

222
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,958
[ASTELL]
Yeah!

223
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,166
That's where we can find a clue
to wherever Star John is hiding.

224

--[ACE, CHARO] What?
--[TAMAZO] Tama?!

You had this in your
pocket the entire time?

226
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,500
I wish you would've
remembered it sooner.

227
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,000
For real, tama!

228
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,125
[chuckles]

229
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,041
[ASTELL laughs]

230
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,875
You look silly when I do that!

231
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,958
My tail's not a
yo-yo string, tama!

232
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,041
Ace, can I please keep him?

233
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,958
You gotta let me have him.
Tamazo's so much fun!

234
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,166
Nope, I'm afraid
I still need him.

235
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,375
According to the map,

236
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,000
the clue about Star John
should be up ahead.

237
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,333
If he's as horrible as
that old man said he was,

238
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,541
and even half as strong
as the rumors claim,

239
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,958
then we could find ourselves
in over our heads.

240
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,041
Maybe, and if he really
does have a god serving him,

241
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,250
then he's gotta be
pretty powerful.

242
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,333
When I Cross-On,
I'm basically like a god,

243
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,625
and I serve under you, tama!

Yeah, I guess you're right!

Star John's a Dragon
Caller just like we are!

247

I'm sure he'll train us once
we explain our situation.

248
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,708
Look at that.

Stand back. You're safe now.

All right, we're not
trying to hurt him.

You're gonna be
just fine, Astell.

wanna be here anymore!

Where did he go, tama?

He was just a little kid.

I think all of the excitement
may have been too much for him.

Let's split up and search.
We'll go this way.

00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,583
Guess you finally
found Star John.

289
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,333
No! You're lying!

290
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,041
A little kid like you just can't
be a powerful Dragon Caller

291
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,875
with a god for a servant, tama!

292

You really shouldn't
underestimate me.

293
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,666
That's a mistake!

You can say that again!

00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,833
Tamazo!

297
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,791
Does that mean you were
lying to us all along?

298
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,375
I guess I was! So are you mad?

299
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,541
[TAMAZO] Yeah, that's a
totally mean thing to do!

300
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,041
[STAR JOHN laughs]

301
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,583
You're right, y'know.

302
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:41,541
I'm actually guilty of a
few nasty little pranks.

303
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,958
Like those guys.

304
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,208
I might've done my part
to set that in motion

305
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,416
before you ran in to help.

306
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,000
And then I gave you
some random map,

307
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,166
and then I ran into the woods

308
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,208
and antagonized that
Light Armademon.

309
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,500
And I'm so very, very sorry!

310
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,750
Nah, just kidding.

311
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,333
I really had my hopes up.

312
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,625
I mean, you're King's son,

313
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,833
and even a hotshot like
Lance knows you by name.

314
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,041
But you've been quite
a disappointment.

315
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,666
You didn't finish off that angry
monster I sent after you.

316
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,250
Maybe you'd rather
head back to town

317
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,750
and eat some stupid ice cream.

318
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,125
You're just a big softy,

319
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,833
which makes me think
you're never going to be

320
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
much of a Dragon Caller.

321
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:28,125
All in all, I'd say you've been
a real waste of my time!

322
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,166
Tama!

323
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,666
Step back, Tamazo!

324
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,958
But, Ace!

325
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,958
Star John isn't a monster!
We can't fight him.

326
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,041
No! Ace!

327
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,500
We're the first people
to have found you.

328
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,833
And now, you've shown
your true colors.

329
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,416
We know who Star John really is!

330
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,208
Stay with me, Ace!

331
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,583
Tamazo!

332
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,541
How dare you hurt him!

333
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,875
You realize you don't have to
just sit there and take it.

334
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,583
In fact, feel free to use
your monsters to attack me.

335
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,541
Cross-On!

336
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,500
Now! Release!

337
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,250
[yells]

338
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,000
Huh. Hey, is that Ancient
Dragon Knight's Soul Armor

339
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,208
you got there?

340
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,041
You can't hope to take
me on with that.

341
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,125
Let's go! Ouka! White Dragon!

342
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,666
I'll pitch in too!

343
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,250
Cross-On, tama!

344
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,875
Awesome! I'm super angry!

345
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,833
All right, Ace, it's time to
teach this guy a lesson!

346
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,166
Okay!

347
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,583
Come, Dark Dragon Knight,
Leviathan, and Tamazo!

348
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,583
Attack!

349
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,416
Here comes the pain!

350
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,750
[gasps]

351
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,416
What happened?

352
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,291
Tremble before Zeus,
the god of thunder.

353
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,125
A god? It's true?

354
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,500
[ZEUS]
No harm will come to him.

355
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,000
I must protect Star John.

356
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,583
Don't hold back now, Zeus.

357
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,791
Blast them all to smithereens.

358
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,833
Wrath of God!

359
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,375
No way! His attack
is too powerful!

360
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,708
[screams]

361
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,875
[STAR JOHN] I guess playtime
is over for today.

362
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,333
Then again, with such
a wimpy Dragon Caller

363
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,583
wearing such
pathetic Soul Armor,

364
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:24,541
it wasn't much of a
playtime to start with.

365
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,791
Hey, Tamadra!

366
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,125
You should consider coming
with me next time.

367
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,750
See ya later!

368
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,083
[gasps]

369
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,333
[CHARO]
Ace? Tamazo?

370
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,125
What happened to you guys?
Please, wake up!

371
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:48,250
I'm here. Who did
this to you, Ace?

372
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,125
It was Star John.

373
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,125
[CHARO gasps]

374
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,083
[CHARO]
Star John? So you met him?

375
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:54,625
No, it...

376
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,833
Where is he?

377
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,416
It was Astell.

378
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,541
He was toying with us.
He was really Star John.

379
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,166
[CHARO gasps]

380
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,125
He lied to us, tama.

381
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,916
I can't believe it!

382
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,041
He beat me.

383
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:14,583
Star John won. I lost.

384
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,666
He crushed me!

385
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,708
[ACE] I was so frustrated,
so focused on becoming stronger,

386
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,666
that I didn't realize
until it was too late

387
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,750
that the real danger was
coming straight for us.

388
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,500
Next time!
"Nightmare in Light City."

389
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,916
I will find the strength to win!
