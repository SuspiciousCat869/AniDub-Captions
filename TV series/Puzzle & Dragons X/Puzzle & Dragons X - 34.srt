[NARRATOR]
The Battle Cup,

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,916
where ambitious young Dragon
Callers come to compete against

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,666
one another and determine
who's the best of the best.

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,250
It's a high-stakes tournament
where matches are fought

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,500
based on fighter classes.

6
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,416
They're all competing
for the glory,

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,458
as well as the Golden Egg.

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,958
The late Ancient of Light,
Master Lukes, banned Soul Brave,

9
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,333
an ancient Dragon
Caller technique.

10
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,916
However, that ban was lifted

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,708
by the current Ancient
of Light, Master Jest.

12
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,625
Utilizing their Soul Armor
and various monsters,

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:57,250
these Dragon Callers are aiming
to bring home the big win!

14
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,208
Ready yourselves, challengers,
for the moment of truth!

[CROWD cheers]

I'm bringing this match
to an end, right now!

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,083
Dark Hell Scythe!

18
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,250
Now Ace, attack
him from above!

00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,333

Which makes Ace the ultimate
victor in this match-up.

26
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:15,375
Which also makes him this year's
Battle Cup Class C Champion!

[CROWD cheers]

28
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:27,916
And now, we come to the finale
of the Battle Cup finals round!

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,666
The champion of
Class B is Starjohn,

30
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,791
and Ace defeated Kroell to
become the Class C champ.

31
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,000
But this next match is a doozy,

32
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,375
because we've at long last made
it to the finals of Class A!

33
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,000
The first contender
in this match

34
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,291
defeated her sister Morgan in a
hard-fought semi-finals bout

35
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,333
to make it here, it's Herriot.

36
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,458
Though she may have benefitted
from the unbanning

37
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,166
of the Soul Brave technique,
it was her courageous fighting

38
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,625
style that really helped
her go the distance!

39
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,375
Facing off against Herriot
in the finals for Class A,

40
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,375
it's last year's Battle Cup
champion, Lance!

41
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,750
And just like last year,

42
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,333
he has yet to break a sweat
on his path to the top!

43
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,083
Unlike many of
the top contenders,

44
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,625
he hasn't used Soul Brave in
any of his battles so far,

45
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,083
is this the quiet dignity
of a champion?

46
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,291
Will Lance secure his second
consecutive Battle Cup victory

47
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,958
at this year's tournament?

48
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,916
Or will Herriot finally realize
her long-held dream

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,625
of being crowned champion?

50
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,791
Every single one of us
is just dying to know.

51
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,791
This round can't
begin soon enough!

And whichever of them wins this
match, will face a rising star.

57
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,791
Either Class B's Starjohn,
or Ace from Class C.

58

That'll be an interesting
battle no matter who fights.

It's always encouraging to see

victorious this year as well.

[VAHATON]
Ah, yes.

It won't be much longer now.

Um, Master Lance?

00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,958
Do you have a secret plan

67
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,791
for how to use Devi
in this fight, devi?

68
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,458
Business as usual, of course.

Defeat our opponent.

70

follow Master Lance's

Hm?

Ms. Herriot has already used
Soul Brave in the tournament,

about everything, jeeze.

This is what she
was really after!

Attack Stance Light, all the
Heart Drops around Herriot

253
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,750
have been transformed
into Light Drops!

That was clever.

For sure.

I agree! But why, though?

257

Instead of just creating
Light Drops from the start,

258
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,333
she made a bunch of
Heart Drops appear

259
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,333
so that she could transform
them into Light Drops

260
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,916
later when she needed them.

261
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
That way, she could put together
enough Light Drop combos

262
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,500
to make a major attack
right at the end!

Changing 101, tama!

very much damage at all
from Herriot's attack!

the caliber of competition

You've gotten stronger.

That was your finest
attack by far.

And yet, there's one
thing you're forgetting.

00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,625
Herriot has been knocked
out of the tournament!

324
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,250
[CROWD cheers]

325
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,250
[METAL]
With a single counter-attack,

326
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,416
Lance emerges victorious!

327
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,750
And now, for the
second time in a row,

328
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:55,625
Lance will be crowned the
champion of Battle Cup Class A!

329
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,500
[sighs]

330
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,875
[DEVI]
Master Lance!

331
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,791
We really did it, devi!

332
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,625
We did.

333
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,750
All from one blow.

334
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,875
I never imagined there would
be that much of a power gap.

335
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,458
My bet on the dark horse
went bust, tama.

336
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,041
It can't be!

337
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,041
The strongest Dragon Callers.

338
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,500
[VAHATON]
Lance, my boy.

339
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,791
Just how strong
will you grow to be?

340
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,708
[HERRIOT groaning]

341
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,000
Sorry, Sis.

342
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,666
[MORGAN] Even after using her
Soul Brave, she couldn't win.

343
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,208
We've got to be missing
something, but what?

344
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,833
[KLEIN laughs]
That emotion you're feeling?

345
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,083
I understand it all too well.

346
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,375
The thing you're missing
is raw power.

347
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,625
When you boil it all down,
it's quite simple.

348
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,708
Think how different things
would be if you had more power.

349
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,833
More power...

350
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,791
[KLEIN chuckles]

351
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,333
Master!

352
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,333
Were you watching
that fight, Garnet?

353
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:32,125
I lost miserably,
downed in one hit.

354
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,583
[GARNET whimpers]

355
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,250
[HERRIOT]
It's a hard pill to swallow.

356
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,041
I'm sure.

357
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,291
[HERRIOT]
So be it!

358
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,583
I'll just train to
become even stronger!

359
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:48,000
I made a promise to Morgan
I intend to keep.

360
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,916
The champions from each class
have finally been determined.

361
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,791
Here's where it
gets interesting!

362
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,375
Comin' up next is the
Representative Battle!

363
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,791
[CHARO]
In the Representative Battle,

364
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,250
the winners from Class B
and Class C will fight,

365
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,250
so that means Starjohn
facing off against Ace!

366
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,375
Whoever wins that battle
gets the opportunity

367
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,375
to fight against Lance!

368
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,625
So before you can do
anything else, Ace,

369
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,041
you've got to defeat that
annoying little brat.

370
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,708
Go give him one of these!

371
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,875
Oh, hey. He's gone.

372
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,708
Well, that's strange.
I wonder where he went?

373
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,416
[TAMAZO]
Maybe to the bathroom again?

374
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,875
Did watching Lance's
victory in that battle

375
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,875
dampen your spirits a bit?

376
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,708
[ACE]
Uh?

377
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,375
No, that's not it.

378
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,750
[ANGENE]
Hm?

379
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,583
I'm actually pretty excited
about the fight instead.

380
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,541
Someone stronger than me
is standing in my way,

381
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:57,250
blocking my progress
like a wall.

382
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,041
But the higher they make
the wall in front of me,

383
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,791
the more I want to climb it!

384
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,000
[gasps, laughs]

385
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,875
I understand.

386
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,083
[ACE] Is that a weird thing
for me to say, Grandma?

387
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,208
[ANGENE]
No, dear.

388
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,166
That's actually a
rather common trait

389
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,250
of the very strongest
Dragon Callers.

390
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,083
[TAMAZO] The next roadblock
on our way to the top

391
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,500
is that pesky brat
Starjohn, tama!

392
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,708
Hey, Ace! Let's make
him pay twice as hard

393
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:56,041
for the last time he
defeated us, tama!

394
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,375
Next time:
"Ace Versus Starjohn"!

395
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,750
It would be a mistake to
take us lightly, tama!
