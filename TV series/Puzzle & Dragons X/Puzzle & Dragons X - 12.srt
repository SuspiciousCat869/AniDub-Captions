00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,791
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,791
there have been powerful
warriors who fought

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,833
against the various crises
that threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,375
They harnessed the
power of the monsters

5
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,666
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,833
They were: The Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,375
Dragon Callers are born
with the special power

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,041
to bridge the gap
between the realms of

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,125
nature, mankind, and monsters.

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:40,000
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us,

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,583
the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters,

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,625
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,708
[TINBELL] May the future of
Libria be full of happiness!

14
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,041
And may you all be blessed!

[TORLIE]
Me? An Ancient?

17
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,125
This is unreal.

00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,958
[CHARO]
Torlie!

19
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,208
Something's wrong with the
forest, but I'm not sure what.

20
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,041
We saw this weird flow
of Drops out there.

21
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,000
It's fine, you guys.

22
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,416
Just give it time;
it'll settle down.

23
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,083
I'm glad to hear that
it's nothing serious.

24
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,000
We were worried, tama.

25
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,416
Tama?

26
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Tama...?

27
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,583
The woods are merely grieving.

28
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:43,500
They knew Master Tinbell. Now
they're mourning his passing.

29
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,625
But we don't have to be sad.

30
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:51,333
Master Tinbell lived a long,
full life as a Dragonoid.

31
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,916
And he now lives on as a dragon.

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,666

Huh?!

[BASUDORA roars]

34
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,625
[TORLIE]
A long time ago,

35
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,000
Dragonoids had an ability
called Reversion

36
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,958
that let them return to
a more primitive state.

37
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,666
Dragonoid powers are amazing!

38
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,666
[TORLIE]
Now, only the Dragonoid Ancients

39
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,333
still posess that skill.

40
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,458
Does that mean we
might see him again?

41
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,750
That's right.

42
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,750
Excuse me, Ancient of Wood, sir?

43
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,416
The time has come to
begin your ceremony.

44
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,833
Yes, I understand.

45
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,791
Uh! What brings such "charming
young men" as you here?

46
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,541
None of your business, and
why're you acting so phony?

[GARNET growls]

48
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,291
What ceremony?

49
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,666
I thought you'd know.

50
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,166
It's a celebration to
welcome the new Ancient.

51
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,666
I want to go, too!

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,166
Well that's too bad!

53
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,500
Because the ceremony is for

54
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,750

exclusively.

Right this way, sir.

[ACE] Was it just me, or did
Torlie seem kinda down?

00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,208
Maybe it's stress.

61

The Ancient of Wood's the
head of the city, isn't he?

Who was that guy with the
horns and the armor?

151
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,833
[VAHATON] So, Master Tinbell
has passed on.

152
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,291

as advanced as his age.

Will we still be able to keep
our world safe without him?

154
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:28,833
Before he passed, Tinbell chose
a young successor named Torlie.

155
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,958
Let's put our faith in him.

I've heard he's a human.
Will he have what it takes?

157

Come now Dafnes, this was
Master Tinbell's last wish.

158
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,458
It is our solemn duty
to support Torlie.

159

Sentimentality is a
luxury we can't afford

in these dire times.

161
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,666
[ELDORA] But if Master Tinbell
specifically picked him,

162
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,750
he must be somewhat powerful.

163

I hope you're right.

Oh! Come in, Jest.

166

Is Torlie fit to be an Ancient?

00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,708
I fully understand
your concern, Dafnes.

168
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,875
But whether you're a
human or a Dragonoid,

00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,500
what matters most is your
ability as a Dragon Caller.

[VAHATON]
Welcome, my friends!

174
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,750
Today is a very special day!

175
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,291
It's the first time in all of
Dragozan history that a

176
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,916
human being has been
named as an Ancient.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,833

Didn't we see this
same statue earlier?

--[ACE] Hm?
--[TAMAZO] Tama?

185

Don't tell me you went
and got us lost again!

186
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,333
You even have a map!

187
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,750
[TIGER] Yeah, but
this map is so vague,

188
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,041
it isn't going to help anyone!

189
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,083
[CHARO] Now you say the
map isn't good enough!

You acted like you knew
the way this whole time!

There is no path before me,

192
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,458
only the trail I've
forged for myself!

193
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,458
That's been my motto!

194
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,416
But there was a path
you made us ignore!

195
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,375
We should've just brought
the ice-cream shop lady

196
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,833
along with us, tama.

197
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,416
We can't!

198
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,541
He's right. Besides, I'd rather
take a trip with some cuties.

199
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,083
Ugh, that isn't what I meant!

200
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,958
Then what do you suggest we do?

201
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,583
[TAMAZO] She might've brought
ice cream if she came.

202
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,166
[ACE, TiGER]
Uh?

203
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,250
Get with the program! Cuties are
always better than old ladies!

204
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,041

This is where you answer.

Uh, right! Yes, sir!

Excellent!

Then please release Tinbell's

you have the skills to
be worthy of the title

Yes!

Master Tinbell,

What's the matter, son?

00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,125
Perhaps his power level isn't
high enough to be an Ancient.

ceremonies such as this.

322
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,083
So, Can I leave now?

323
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,125
[TORLIE pants]

324
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,125
[TORLIE] I know that sound.
it's Charo's whistle!

325
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,500
[VAHATON] The monsters
seem unusually restless.

326
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,583
[ELDORA] It would be a simple
matter for any one of us

327
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,958
to settle this level
of disturbance.

328
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,791
But can someone of Torlie's
caliber handle it on his own?

329
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,291
No, this won't do at all!

330
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,541
What are those children
doing out there?

331
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,875
But, this is a
wonderful opportunity.

332
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,791
What are you saying?

333
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,208
It would appear that
Torlie knows those children,

334
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,291
and has gone to save them.

335
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,000
So, we can monitor
how he handles

336
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,708
the pressures of the job.

337
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,708
[TORLIE gasps]

338
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,750
I was too slow.

339
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,541
[gasps]
Charo.

340
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,583
[TORLIE]
Charo, are you...?

341
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,708
[MONSTER roars]

342
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,041
Oh, no!

343
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,250
Come on! This way!

344
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,583
Charo! Watch out!

345
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,083
Yeah, right here!

346
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,750
Okay, now!

347
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,791
[ENJU squeaks]

348
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,791
It worked!

349
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,375
[chuckles]
Thanks, Enju!

350
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,583
[squeaks]

351
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,000
Awesome!

352
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,750
Great job, Charo!

353
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,875
You've got guts, bro! Enju too!

354
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,375
[CHARO laughs] I was
still scared, but I did my best!

355
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,416
And they're fine.

356
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,041
Green Carbuncles
have hard heads,

357
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,375
so they'll just be a
little dazed for a while.

358
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,791
Don't be foolish, Charo!

359
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,500
Now is not the time to be
worried about them, tama!

360
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,458
[TORLIE]
Charo!

361
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,375
[ALL]
Huh?

362
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,583
[CHARO]
Torlie!

363
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,583
What are you doing out here?

364
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,291
Well, y'see it's sort
of complicated.

365
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,458
[TAMAZO] It's okay if you were
worried about us, tama!

366
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,333
[ALL gasp]

367
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,125
[ACE] There's still something
creating a disturbance

368
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,625
in the Drops!

369
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,208
[TIGER]
Seriously?

370
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,250
And it only seems to be
making things worse!

371
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,125
Tama!

372
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,708
[TIGER]
Whoa! What's that?

373
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,958
[TORLIE] They're Drop streams
running through the earth.

374
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,458
I've never seen
such distinct ley lines!

375
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,750
Dude, what the heck
is going on here?!

376
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,125
[ACE]
Is it a Drop Impact?

377
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,041
[TORLIE] It's still at
the stage before that!

378
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,750
I watched Master Tinbell
dissipate one

379
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,208
just like this before.

380
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,958
[CHARO] Which means that you
can do something about it,

381
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,791
right, Torlie?

382
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,416
[TORLIE] Wait here.
I'll go get the Ancients.

383
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,625
[CHARO gasps]
But Torlie!

384
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:32,666
Master Tinbell could've
done it, but I'm not him.

385
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,833
Sorry.

386
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,500
[ACE grunts] If we don't
do something soon,

387
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,000
the forest'll be destroyed!

388
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,750
[gasps]

389
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,666
[TORLIE] Master! Grant me
the strength to finish this!

390
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,166
Release!

391
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,541
[TAMAZO]
Tama!

392
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,291
It worked!

393
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:13,500
[roars]

394
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,375
[ALL gasping]

395
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,041
So cool.

396
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,291
The power of the
Ancients is incredible.

397
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,000
We're saved, tama.

398
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,666
[roars]

399
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,583
[gasps]

400
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:04,625
[TORLIE] Yes. I understand.
I won't run away again.

401
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,416
I swear to follow
in your footsteps

402
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,333
while forging my own
path as an Ancient.

403
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,083
Oh wow! That was incredible,
Master Torlie!

404
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,666
Oh! Yeah. Well, uh. Thank you.

405
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,125
[VAHATON]
Marvelous work!

406
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,458
[TAMAZO]
Tama?

407
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,625
Torlie was finally able
to release Master Tinbell.

408
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,666
He more than qualifies!

409
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,916
I rescind my complaints.

410
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,291
I'm amazed by how quickly
human beings can adapt

411
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,750
to solve problems,
unlike Dragonoids.

412
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,291
[JEST]
That's the power of humans.

413
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,000
Welcome, Ancient of Wood.

414
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,500
We are all expecting
great things.

415
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,500
Yes, Sir!

416
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,708
I'm just glad I stuck around!

417
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,666
This was well worth
staying to see.

418
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,916
[KLEIN sighs]
Yes. Yes it certainly was.

419
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,291
So did you hear the news?

420
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,750
About the next Dragon Caller
exam! They're holding one here

421
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,541
as Master Torlie's
first official duty.

422
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,041
Then that means.

423
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,541
We've got another shot at
becoming Guild Dragon Callers!

424
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,875
[exhales]

425
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,333
[BOTH] We're gonna pass
this time around!

426
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,583
[TAMAZO]
Tama.

427
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,458
Heh. I wish you
the best of luck!

428
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,416
[TORLIE]
You too.

429
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,208
[gasps]

430
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,750
Give it your very best.

431
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,458
Torlie.

432
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,333
[CHARO]
This is. It's a D-gear!

433
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,625
Just like the knowledge
I take from books connects

434
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,958
me to monsters,

435
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,333
you connect to them through
using your whistle!

436
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,583
So I thought it fitting to
take the whistle you love

437
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,500
and turn it into your
own personal D-gear.

438
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,083
[gasps]

439
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,583
That's great, Charo!

440
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,291
You're officially ready
for the real thing!

441
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,208
[TAMAZO]
I'm so happy, tama!

442
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,583
[CHARO whimpers]

443
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,583
Huh? What? Speak up,
I can't hear ya!

444
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,291
[ENJU squeaks]

445
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,458
[chuckles]

446
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,416
[squeaks]

447
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,125
Enju.

448
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,041
Hey, all right! He's your
very first Egg Drop!

449
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,583
[TIGER] Oh, man!
Someone's an overachiever!

450
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:15,541
[TAMAZO] He's happy!
Oh yeah! Super happy!

451
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,916
Yes!

452
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,208
[TAMAZO] I'm so glad Charo
has a D-gear now, tama!

453
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,958
Now all that's left is to become
real Guild Dragon Callers, tama!

454
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,541
[TAMAZO] But! It looks
like our opponent is tough!

455
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:59,250
Next time!
"Guild Dragon Caller's Exam!"

456
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,958
Are you going to let anyone
pass this time, tama?
