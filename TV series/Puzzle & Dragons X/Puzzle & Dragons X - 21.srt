00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,875
[NARRATOR]
For untold centuries,

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,041
there have been powerful
warriors who fought against

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,875
the various crises
that threatened our world.

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,333
They harnessed the power
of the monsters,

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,875
and forged a bond which
eased the planet's anger.

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:26,875
They were the Dragon Callers.

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,291
Dragon Callers are born
with the special power

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,875
to bridge the gap
between the realms

9
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:35,125
of nature, mankind,
and monsters.

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:39,916
When fear and hatred contaminate
the elements that surround us,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,375
the Dragon Callers will
rise up with their monsters,

12
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,500
and restore balance
to our world.

13
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,791
[CHARO'S MOM]
Bon appetit, boys!

14
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,416
This looks yummy!

15
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,541
I'm gonna do two forks
worth of damage!

16
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:35,250
And please, feel free to
eat as much as you'd like!

17
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,416
Tiger's not here.

18
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll eat for him!

19
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,333
For friendship!

20
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,041
[CHARO'S DAD]
Isn't it tasty, Charo?

21
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,083
[CHARO]
Yes!

22
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,166
Make sure to eat well,

23
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,208
so you can grow bigger
than me one day!

24
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,625
Our son's fine
just the way he is.

25
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,000
My little boy.

26
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,250
[CHARO]
Uh?

27
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:59,333
Stop it, Mom.
This is so embarrassing.

28
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,791
[ACE, CHARO'S DAD,
CHARO'S MOM laugh]

29
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,666
[CHARO]
Would you stop laughing?

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,541
[CHARO'S MOM]
Okay, okay.

31
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,083
[ACE]
Hi, Mom. How're you?

32
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,708
I'm in the Wood City
of Libria right now.

33
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,291
Charo's house is here,

34
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,041
and his mom and dad are
letting us stay with them.

35
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,833
I'm still training to be the
best Dragon Caller I can be,

36
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,250
but it takes time.

37
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,500
I gathered a bunch, tama!

38
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,250
[ACE] There's never a lack of
excitement, that's for sure.

39
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,333
[gasps]

40
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,708
Those fruit look tasty.

41
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,666
[ACE]
Tamazo's doing fine too.

42
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,458
He's still as noisy
and carefree as ever.

43
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:49,458
But at least he's loyal.
He's never left my side once.

44
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,875
Feels like ages since
I left Vienna City behind

45
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,041
and headed out to make
my own way in the world.

46
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,583
[ACE]
Drops.

47
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,250
[TAMAZO]
Uh! Ace!

48
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,000
[ACE]
Now that's an egg!

49
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:13,708
[gasps]

50
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,625
[TAMAZO]
Tama!

51
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,125
Stop that! Would ya cut it out?

52
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,750
Gimme a break!

53
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,291
[yells]

54
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,791
[ACE]
After I met Tamazo,

55
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,958
I learned something
about myself.

56
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:37,250
That I had the abilities of a
Dragon Caller, just like my dad,

57
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,291
and that's when my life changed.

58
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,083
What are these?

59
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,333
That kid.

60
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,458
He formed these Drops
from that distance?

61
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,833
[ACE] Me, a Dragon Caller?
Get serious!

62
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,708
[CHARO]
I am serious!

63
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,666
I think you've got
exactly what it takes.

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,375
Someone with your kind of
power can't just stay here.

65
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,208
Be one of the protectors
of our world.

66
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,708
Protector.

67
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,208
Exactly!

68
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,708
So that's why you should come
to Dragoza Island with me,

69
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,375
and then we can both study
to become Dragon Callers.

70
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,791
[ACE]
So I'm going to Dragoza Island.

71
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,250
[LENA]
It's okay to want to go.

72
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,500
[ACE] I'm sorry that I left
you alone so suddenly,

73
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,791
but I had to.

74
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,250
I miss you, Mom.

75
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,666
I wanted to learn all about
Dragon Callers, Drops,

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,166
and the world we live in,

77
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,458
and I had to leave
home to do it.

78
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,083
I see it. Dragoza!

79
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,291
[ACE] Every day on Dragoza
Island has been interesting,

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,416
to say the least.

81
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,625
[gasps]

82
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,458
Grandma, I'm here.

83
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,291
Is that really you, Ace?

84
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,541
You've grown so much since
the last time I saw you!

85
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,875
Take this.

86
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,083
A D-Gear?

87
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,458
This particular one
belonged to your father.

88
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,083
It was his D-Gear, Ace,

89
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,750
and it should help
guide you on your path

90
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,541
to become a great Dragon
Caller, just like he was.

91
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,833
[CHARO] That's the real thing!
Can I hold it?

92
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,208
[ACE laughs]

93
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,541
Yeah. Why not? I don't know
how to use it anyway.

94
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,166
[CHARO] For starters,
you're going to need to get

95
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,375
a monster Egg Drop
just to get it functional.

96
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,125
What's an Egg Drop?

97
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,458
That's what it's called
when a monster

98
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,833
takes the form of a Drop.

99
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,833
All you have to do is stick
the Drop in your D-Gear

100
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,125
and then you can
summon that monster

101
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,750
to fight for you as an ally.

102
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,166
[ACE]
Okay. How do I get an Egg Drop?

103
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,500
[CHARO]
Uhh...

104
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,958
The Dragon Caller's Guide says

105
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,750
that the monster
has to accept you.

106
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,208
Then it'll turn into an
Egg Drop all on its own.

107
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,750
Hey, listen to me.

108
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,250
It's not just dangerous to stay
out here all by yourself,

109
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,291
it's also lonely.

110
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,416
Would you lend me your power?

111
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,583
We'd make a great team.

112
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,833
[roars]

113
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,041
Let's do this, Ouka!

114
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,208
[ACE]
Now! Lend me your power!

115
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,708
Release!

116
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,250
[ACE]
Not long after I got my D-Gear,

117
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,166
I found the first
monster for my team.

118
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,333
[yells]

119
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,791
[ACE] Thanks to Charo
and Tamazo's help,

120
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,583
I was able to become
a real Dragon Caller.

121
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,291
Or so I thought.

122
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,958
I know, but why did you want
that Soul Armor so badly,

123
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,041
do you think?

124
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,583
[ACE] Well, if I could
equip the armor,

125
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,208
then it would make me a stronger
Dragon Caller, wouldn't it?

126
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,500
Tama?

127
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,083
[CHARO]
He's an Ancient Dragon Knight!

128
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,166
[ACE]
We've gotta do something!

129
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,083
[roars]

130
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,416
[CHARO gasps]

131
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,000
Hurry, you've gotta
turn into an Egg Drop!

132
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,083
[ANCIENT DRAGON KNIGHT]
It's too late.

133
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,583
But I can still put
my soul to good use.

134
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,291
[SALLY] That's a lovely Soul
Stone you have there, Ace.

135
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,750
[ACE]
Hey, Sally.

136
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,291
It's undeniable proof that
the Ancient Dragon Knight

137
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,833
has accepted you.

138
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,291
I am a priestess.

139
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,833
My duty is to bestow the
energy from the Soul Stone

140
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,041
to a worthy Dragon Caller.

141
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,666
In this way, new
Soul Armor is created

142
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,458
and we fulfill our purpose.

143
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,708
[ACE]
Hey, Tamazo,

144
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,333
how in the world did you
change the Soul Stone

145
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,791
to an Armor Drop back there?

146
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,791
[CHARO]
That's right.

147
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,125
It meant we didn't
have to go back

148
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,250
to Miss Sally to ask for help.

149
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,458
[TAMAZO]
It was Sally herself

150
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,666
who taught me how
to do it, tama!

151
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,416
The strands of fate
wove us together, tama.

152
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,250
For real?

153
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,041
Tamazo's full of surprises.

154
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,041
All things are possible
with me, tama!

155
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,875
Soul Armor.

156
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:50,666
[CHARO gasps]

157
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,583
I like it! So easy-going!

158
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,458
And to have Soul Armor
on top of that,

159
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,458
I bet you're unstoppable!

160
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,583
I'm amped up!

If we hand it over to the

then the Guild will
owe the SDF a favor.

Hearing about his success,

He more than qualifies!

I rescind my complaints.

335
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,208
I'm amazed by how
quickly human beings

can adapt to solve problems,
unlike Dragonoids.

That's the power of humans.

[ELDORA] That Ace boy, he seems
a lot like his father, King.

339

He was a brave Dragon Caller
who could understand

the feelings of his monsters.

I guess Ace takes
after his father.

There will be an increase in

that the mayor

Perhaps so. But I fear
it won't be easy.

It's very difficult
to restore balance

Oh, no.

We must continue
communicating with our planet.

Only then can we try to calm
the Drop Impact cycle.

And in so doing,
find the key to saving

He endeavored to find a solution
to the Drop Impact problem.

bring him down at all.

You mean he was
never one to give up.

Whatever happened to him,
wherever he was sent,

he might still be fighting
to stop the Drop Impact.

might be right.
