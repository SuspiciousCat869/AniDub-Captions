1
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,208
Cheers to Fam's tears!

2
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,208
Cheers!

3
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:37,541
Congratulations. You successfully
captured fifteen battleships.

4
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,833
Our Skyfish hunt isn't over yet.

5
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,083
I turned 16 today.

6
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,416
We still have to beat up the
Federation and take back Turan!

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,375
I'm staying right here!

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,500
<i>Dear Mom and Dad. How are you?</i>

9
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:36,166
<i>Have René, Félicité, and Adele</i>
<i>been behaving themselves?</i>

10
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,791
<i>We're currently on the Silvius.</i>

11
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:44,500
<i>It's crazy to think that we're hunting</i>
<i>Skyfish aboard the infamous Reaper.</i>

12
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,583
<i>Skyfish hunting used to be part of</i>
<i>my job as a Sky Pirate, after all.</i>

13
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,958
The first harpoon is mine!

14
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,500
Go!

15
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,625
"Hey, you creepy pervert of a captain..."

16
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,166
Creepy pervert?!

17
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,458
"I'm gonna make sure every port in the world

18
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:19,625
hears about how much of a chicken you are..."

19
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,375
"Hope you enjoy it!"

20
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,291
--Wow, that's harsh, Gisey!
--But it was <i>your</i> idea, Fam...

21
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,541
Shoot down that Vespa!

22
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,333
Breach!

23
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,958
We've caught ourselves a Skyfish!

24
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,666
<i>The world has always been</i>
<i>filled with territorial conflict,</i>

25
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,916
<i>but we Sky Pirates have remained</i>
<i>neutral and independent through it all,</i>

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,166
<i>soaring freely through the skies.</i>

27
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,125
<i>I assumed it would always be that way, too.</i>

28
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,583
Did you get the first harpoon again today, Fam?

29
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,125
You betcha!

30
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:32,041
<i>Turan and the Ades Federation</i>
<i>were set to sign a peace accord</i>

31
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:36,166
<i>when Premier Luscinia Hez appeared,</i>
<i>leading a Federation fleet.</i>

32
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,208
<i>I can't believe they betrayed Turan,</i>
<i>pretending to want peace...</i>

33
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,500
Gisey! Look!

34
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,625
"The Winged Maiden"...

35
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,833
Turan's flagship, the Lasas!

36
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,583
Take the two princesses alive!

37
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,333
Kill all the rest!

38
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,583
I've made up my mind!
I'm going to steal that ship!

39
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:11,750
Light signal from what appears
to be a Sky Pirate Vanship!

40
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,083
They're going to help us escape...

41
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,583
...in exchange for the Lasas?!

42
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,000
That's nonsense! Sky Pirate scum!

43
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,916
Okay, guys! Let's stir 'em up our usual way!

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,291
Roger that, First Harpoon!

45
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,208
She's attacking head-on!

46
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:39,250
And you people call yourselves
soldiers of the Augusta?!

47
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,958
Here we go!

48
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,083
Spin!

49
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,083
Clear #4 depth charge
and every last smoke bomb!

50
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,625
Fire everything!

51
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,625
Now let's blow off the top-wing!

52
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:11,166
Th-They scuttled their ship?!

53
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,750
<i>The Lasas survived thanks to Fam's strategy...</i>

54
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,916
<i>...but Millia was more than displeased.</i>

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,916
My sister might not have any qualms,

56
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,500
but I refuse to accept this nonsense!

57
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:34,083
<i>That's right. Millia said I can</i>
<i>address her on a first-name basis.</i>

58
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:39,083
<i>It makes me happy,</i>
<i>but it's kind of embarrassing.</i>

59
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,583
<i>I'm still not used to it; I really</i>
<i>admire her as a princess and all.</i>

60
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,166
--May I come in?
--Yes!

61
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,625
A letter to your family?

62
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,541
Y-Yes. We got permission
to make outside contact.

63
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,833
Oh?

64
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,958
Maybe I should write them something too, then!

65
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,291
I owe a lot to your family, after all!

66
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,875
Princess Millia...

67
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,416
"Princess"?

68
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:22,250
<i>Luscinia was bent on conquering</i>
<i>the royal city of Iglasia.</i>

69
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,708
<i>My sister went after him to try to stop him,</i>

70
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:31,208
<i>after sending Fam and me to Iglasia without her.</i>

71
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,958
Let's meet again in Iglasia.

72
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,625
Please be careful, Sister.

73
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,791
What happened to the Lasas?!

74
00:07:54,875 --> 00:08:00,666
<i>But, unable to keep her promise,</i>
<i>my sister fell into Luscinia's clutches.</i>

75
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,000
Where is my sister?! Release her at once!

76
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,458
Have you heard of the "Exiles"?

77
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,416
The Exiles are detestable ships...

78
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,666
In the cataclysmic days of yore,
they served as emigrant vessels

79
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,750
to help people flee this world and carry
them into the furthest reaches of the sky.

80
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:29,166
And once the calamitous times were over,
they nonchalantly returned.

81
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,541
But there was no longer any land to be given

82
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,166
to those who had abandoned
and fled the suffering world.

83
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,250
You people should never have returned.

84
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,083
Let my sister go!

85
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,250
"That which is born from
the blue surface of water..."

86
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:02,625
<i>I don't know what transpired or</i>
<i>what happened to my sister's body.</i>

87
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,666
<i>But I do know it resulted in</i>
<i>the worst possible outcome...</i>

88
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,166
An Exile...?!

89
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,208
Don't shoot!

90
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,833
<i>I was utterly powerless.</i>

91
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:42,208
<i>I lost my kingdom and family,</i>
<i>and did nothing but weep like a child.</i>

92
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,000
<i>And I completely lost it</i>
<i>when someone took off</i>

93
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,583
<i>with one of my sister's treasured mementos.</i>

94
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,125
Don't tell me what to do!

95
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,125
I'm a Turan princess, you know!

96
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,250
You've never touched a
Vespa in your life, Princess.

97
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,583
You can't fly it! It's too much for you!

98
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:05,125
But... It belongs to my sister...

99
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,041
It belongs to my sister...

100
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,083
Get out of there!

101
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,375
Get out!

102
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,541
Absolutely not!

103
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,958
Don't get the wrong idea!

104
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,958
I want you to get out and move to the back seat!

105
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,500
Hurry!

106
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,166
I'll be your wings!

107
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,083
<i>Fam was always there to help me.</i>

108
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,875
<i>Fam just couldn't ignore her.</i>

109
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,375
<i>Because she knew how</i>
<i>hard it is being all alone.</i>

110
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:43,250
<i>I heard you took her in</i>
<i>when she was just an infant.</i>

111
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,083
<i>"May the wind carry wings that are lost."</i>

112
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:51,375
<i>Help anyone in the sky who</i>
<i>needs help. It's a Sky Pirate rule.</i>

113
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,875
"Return fallen wings to the sky."

114
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,541
That's another Sky Pirate rule.

115
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:06,875
<i>I had always thought Sky Pirates</i>
<i>were a band of savages...</i>

116
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,000
<i>How wrong I was.</i>

117
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,208
Here.

118
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,458
Thanks.

119
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,250
You're welcome.

120
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,583
Gisey! Millia!

121
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,375
What's going on?

122
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,708
I'm gonna go steal Silvius
the Reaper for Millia now!

123
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,625
<i>Correction-- Fam is something else entirely.</i>

124
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,750
<i>I know we need military might to rebuild Turan,</i>

125
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,083
<i>but why must she always</i>
<i>go for such big scores?</i>

126
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,250
<i>My bad feeling turned out to be right...</i>

127
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,416
Playing war, are you?

128
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,625
<i>I think Tatiana was testing us at the time.</i>

129
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,583
Now that you've seen the Silvius,
we can't let you leave alive.

130
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,916
You were in that red Vanship.

131
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:35,666
We <i>could</i> return you to the sky,
if you'll agree to help us.

132
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,958
What do you want out of us?

133
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:42,083
Go steal some Ades Federation ships--
one for each year you've been alive.

134
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,375
Too much for you kids to handle?

135
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,916
All right, then! We'll swipe fifteen for you!

136
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,333
We'll put an entire fleet together
if we have to, for Millia!

137
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,458
<i>Fam always has us on our toes.</i>

138
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,083
<i>Yes...</i>

139
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:19,875
<i>We were tasked with hunting and</i>
<i>capturing fifteen Federation battleships.</i>

140
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,166
<i>It sounded like an outrageous undertaking,</i>

141
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,125
<i>but they managed to capture</i>
<i>a ship in the blink of an eye.</i>

142
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:32,541
<i>Meanwhile, Millia created a</i>
<i>Turan kingdom inside the Silvius.</i>

143
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,958
What's with that outfit?!

144
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:40,666
I-I had no choice! It's part
of the plan to rebuild Turan!

145
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,000
Congratulations on establishing
a refugee government!

146
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,416
Isn't this great?!

147
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,375
What's wrong, Millia?

148
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,291
I was just thinking how pathetic it is

149
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,583
that this is the best I can do now...

150
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,041
Millia...

151
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:06,166
I don't know if I can really
rebuild Turan like this...

152
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:13,416
But this is honest-to-goodness
territory you acquired all by yourself!

153
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,541
This table is just the start!

154
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,166
Soon you'll have <i>all</i> of the Silvius!

155
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,083
And then it'll be time to take Turan back!

156
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
<i>It wasn't much territory at all.</i>
<i>But it was my first step.</i>

157
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:39,125
<i>I must protect Turan, until the day</i>
<i>I'm reunited with my sister.</i>

158
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:45,666
<i>Our Skyfish hunt progressed smoothly,</i>
<i>until only one catch remained.</i>

159
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,250
We're here for Skyfish!
Some huge ones are headed this way!

160
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,291
The battleships Ades is transporting...!

161
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:58,916
So you're after 'em, too?
It's gonna be a fierce battle, though!

162
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,041
Good tailwinds!

163
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,416
The best position! Good going, Gisey!

164
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,916
The first harpoon is mine!

165
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,041
The Jagannath...!

166
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,291
Ades' 3rd Fleet?!

167
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,791
<i>The final Skyfish was an Ades Federation trap.</i>

168
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:34,708
<i>I was completely useless,</i>
<i>faced with their new, unknown weapon...</i>

169
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,791
--Time to leave.
--All that for nothing...

170
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,166
Fam. We should go, too...

171
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,166
Don't be so glum! We'll just
find new prey to go after!

172
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,208
<i>"I'm a failure as a Navi."</i>

173
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,333
<i>"I want to go home."</i>

174
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:06,250
<i>Distracted by these feelings, I never</i>
<i>realized we were being followed.</i>

175
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,041
<i>Their real target had been the Silvius...</i>

176
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,666
<i>...and me.</i>

177
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,708
Commence fire!

178
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,958
--All ships, commence firing!
--All ships, commence firing!

179
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,500
Fire!

180
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,666
Enemy has taken siege formation!

181
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,500
We're completely surrounded!

182
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,083
Tear through!

183
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,208
1st and 2nd Squads!
All ships, train guns on target!

184
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,833
Roger that! Training guns!

185
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,916
Target acquired...!

186
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,583
Wh-What?!

187
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,250
Distance to Glacies border, 40!

188
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,125
Enemy fleet deploying ahead!

189
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,125
Torpedoes incoming!

190
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,166
Down trim, 30! Take us into the clouds!

191
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,083
Target is descending... into the clouds!

192
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,041
Enemy has evaded torpedoes!

193
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,958
You can't, Fam! We're in the middle of a battle!

194
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,666
Retrieve the Vanships!

195
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,958
Th-That's what I tried to tell her, too...

196
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,833
The Skyfish hunt!

197
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,791
Skyfish hunt...?

198
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,250
Yeah! The Skyfish hunt!

199
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,125
I'm gonna fulfill my promise
to you once and for all!

200
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,208
This is <i>the</i> perfect chance!

201
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,583
Don't you agree, Captain?!

202
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,708
We can't retrieve you during battle.

203
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,666
You'll have to make it back on your own.

204
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:55,583
<i>Fam wanted to do whatever she could to help,</i>

205
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,208
<i>and I found myself completely</i>
<i>caught up in the desire to assist.</i>

206
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,208
The Anshar?!

207
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,875
She's chasing the Silvius! Not if  <i>we</i> can help it!

208
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,875
--Millia!
--Right!

209
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,041
<i>Please...</i>

210
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,083
Hit it!

211
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:35,250
<i>A direct strike to a ship's Claudia Unit</i>
<i>to stop her dead in the sky...</i>

212
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,208
<i>She had managed to pull off</i>
<i>what I was never able to...</i>

213
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,833
--Welcome back!
--Way to go!

214
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,125
She managed to take down <i>the</i> Anshar?

215
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,958
You guys are amazin'!

216
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,666
Princess Millia!

217
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,250
I was moved to tears!

218
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,666
Congratulations, Fam.

219
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,791
You were amazing too, Princess Millia...

220
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:07,125
You... finally managed to pull it off...

221
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:23,958
<i>I didn't feel fit to be Fam's Navi.</i>
<i>So I decided to leave the Silvius.</i>

222
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,125
You're really gonna leave?

223
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,958
I can't fly without you, Gisey.

224
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,083
Then just ask Princess Millia.

225
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,083
She has thorough knowledge
<i>and</i> good judgment.

226
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,875
Unlike me.

227
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:45,750
I'm not fit to be your Navi, Fam...

228
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,125
You're better off with Princess Millia.

229
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:52,000
--But you're amazing, Gisey!
--I'm not. I'm nothing...

230
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,250
Don't talk like that!

231
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,375
What would <i>you</i> know?!

232
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,333
<i>I lashed out unfairly. I was pathetic.</i>

233
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,291
<i>I'd only been thinking of myself...</i>

234
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,833
--I...!
--I...!

235
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,166
I want to cheer Fam up!

236
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,416
I don't like it when Fam is feeling down either!

237
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,208
<i>My jumbled-up feelings all came together.</i>

238
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,250
<i>To have Fam smile...</i>

239
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:28,500
<i>That was what I really wanted.</i>

240
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,291
Gisey!

241
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,458
Fam... I'm...

242
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,250
Welcome back!

243
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,666
I'm home!

244
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,416
<i>I felt the same way.</i>

245
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,750
I'm open!

246
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:12,375
<i>I want to make them-- and people</i>
<i>all over the world-- smile again...</i>

247
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,250
--Gisey!
--Right!

248
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,458
<i>...by holding another Grand Race someday!</i>

249
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:51,208
I feel like with Fam, dreams that
seem crazy are actually possible!

250
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,541
Yes! With Fam, they are!

251
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,666
Fam is all we can think about, huh?

252
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,583
Yeah!

253
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:03,083
Gisey! Millia! It's time to eat--

254
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,083
Oh! What are the two of you up to?!

255
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,666
--Oh, are you heading out?
--Yeah.

256
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,416
I'm gonna go pay those prodigal girls a visit.

257
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,416
<i>I'm going to stay aboard</i>
<i>the Silvius with Fam and Millia.</i>

258
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,625
<i>To defeat the Federation</i>
<i>and hold another Grand Race...</i>

259
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,666
<i>That is our dream!</i>

260
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,041
<i>And Fam Fan Fan is going to win it, of course!</i>
