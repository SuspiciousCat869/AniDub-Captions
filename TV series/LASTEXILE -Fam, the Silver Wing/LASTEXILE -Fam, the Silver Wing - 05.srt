1
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,666
I am Princess Millia il
Velch Cutrettola Turan.

2
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,208
As Royal Deputy of
the Kingdom of Turan,

3
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,458
I am leading an operation
to take back our homeland...

4
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,291
I apologize for any trouble
we may have caused you.

5
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,541
Interesting...
I had heard Turan fell.

6
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,666
Then you heard wrong.
It hasn't fallen...!

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,625
Not so long as I
still draw breath!

8
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,916
Turan's leadership and
army are no more...

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,250
That's a known fact...

10
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,166
How, then, can you claim
the kingdom still stands?

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,916
I know what's happened.
But I want to fight...!

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,375
I want the Federation to pay--

13
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,041
Your affairs are no concern
to me or my crew...

14
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,625
You and I are done here...

15
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,333
We've already reached an
agreement with the Sky Pirates.

16
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,958
What agreement?

17
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,000
Touch and move.

18
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,916
Princess Millia!

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,458
Reckless idiots! How could
they be so stupid?!

20
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,083
I want to talk to them now!

21
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,333
Please wait for me, Princess!

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,208
One Vespa to work
with... great...

23
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,875
Capturing fifteen ships
on our own won't be easy.

24
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,208
It's okay, I know you'll
figure somethin' out!

25
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,458
Come on...!
Quit messin' around, Fam.

26
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,166
Is it just me, or
does the Silvius seem

27
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,708
a lot like our own ships...?

28
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,291
Way more than I
thought it would.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,541
This one may be a
bit roomier, though.

30
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,250
I wonder where these
vanships are from;

31
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:38,083
they're not like our Vespas...
or the Federation's Shaharzes.

32
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,000
Seriously?! This is so awesome!

33
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,125
Wow...! It really
is Princess Millia!

34
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,375
It's her, in the flesh!

35
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,375
The white lily of Turan is here!

36
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,416
Welcome to our ship,
Princess Millia...

37
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,916
I do hope you've enjoyed your
ride aboard the Silvius so far.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,375
What's this? All of a sudden
you're Mister Suave?

39
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,166
At least I'm not just standing
there slack-jawed like you.

40
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,416
I ain't slack-jawed!

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
Excuse me... I'm looking
for Fam and Giselle...?

42
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,208
Not your ratty desk chair,
Elio! Something nice!

43
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,583
Will someone just
tell me where they are?!

44
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,416
Enough!

45
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,416
What's all this noise about?

46
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,250
About time.

47
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,625
I need to speak to the
person in charge here.

48
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,416
That would be me.

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,791
Fam! Explain yourself!

50
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,083
What's this about
fifteen battleships?

51
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,416
Funny you mention that.

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,416
Sir, could you please
let me contact Kartoffel?

53
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,875
We could really use their
help locating some Skyfish...

54
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:32,958
Pretty please?

55
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,791
Not gonna happen.

56
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,875
--Jerk face.
--Manners!

57
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,375
You can forget about
making any outside contact.

58
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,541
How do you expect us
to catch anything then?

59
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,125
You got one advantage.

60
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,166
Captain says you're free
to use anything onboard

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,625
that might be useful.

62
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,000
Just listen to this guy,
actin' all high and mighty.

63
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,875
Fam, please!

64
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:51,791
What was that?

65
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,291
Nothing, nothing at all.

66
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,208
Bad enough you made
a deal without me...

67
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,916
But did it have to be
something like this?

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,750
Now we're stealing fifteen
ships, not just the Silvius?

69
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,250
Yeah sorry, guess I just
couldn't help myself...

70
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,041
Like they say,
a bird in the hand...

71
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,333
well... fifteen is even better!

72
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,708
Suit up.

73
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,416
It's freezing out here!

74
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,166
Don't be such a baby,
it's not that bad. Achoo!

75
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,958
There, I got it.

76
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,208
Is that the Gyros?

77
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,583
Wow. You know your
constellations, Princess.

78
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,291
I'm not totally
ignorant, you know.

79
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,250
'Kay. Here we go,
Fam, get ready...

80
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,041
Now!

81
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,625
Done.

82
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:40,208
From the angle of elevation and
the azimuth, one, two, um...

83
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,708
We're 2.4 kilometers northwest
of Kurbis Lookout...

84
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:47,958
and moving south-southeast
by east at forty-three knots.

85
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,958
That puts us pretty far west...

86
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,583
So the closest
Federation base would be...

87
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,625
Shahiya's the only
one for miles...

88
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,708
So, our best targets are...
the Urs-rag-na or the Aeshma.

89
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,333
Our lucky day!
Two ships to choose from.

90
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,500
I love options
when I go hunting.

91
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:07,375
You can tell all of that just
from our present position?

92
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,833
Locked in Gigi's brain here,
are the specs from almost

93
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,166
every ship that's been
built in the past century!

94
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,583
Honestly?

95
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,333
Yep...! We're talkin' names,
affiliations, captains,

96
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,125
and key personnel profiles--
she knows everything!

97
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,958
I wouldn't say everything...

98
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,791
Like, I knew next to nothing
about the Silvius...

99
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,083
Okay fine, almost everything.

100
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,333
Hey, we need somewhere to work.

101
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,041
Can we use the space
below decks, Mister...

102
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,291
Uh, sorry. What was it again?

103
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,000
Olaf, Chief of Maintenance.

104
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,750
Just from our current position?

105
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,458
That's right...
They may be young,

106
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,041
but they've got real skill.

107
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,583
If they ask for help, give them
whatever assistance they need,

108
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,250
so long as it doesn't interfere
with your normal duties.

109
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,250
You got it.

110
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,791
Interesting couple
of kids, aren't they?

111
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,291
I still can't believe the reason
we lost contact with you

112
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:56,333
was because you joined
the Sky Pirates.

113
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,541
One of the Exiles came down...
I take it you knew?

114
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,958
Yes, we're aware.

115
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,041
And the key to the Exile
that struck Turan

116
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,958
is Princess Liliana...

117
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,375
who happens to be
Millia's older sister.

118
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:13,208
You're saying... The Federation
used the Exile as a weapon?

119
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,625
The princess was abducted

120
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,250
and taken aboard one of
their ships... the Impetus...

121
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,125
After which, there
was a Mysterion pulse.

122
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,291
So making peace
with the Federation

123
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,416
is not going to be easy.
Not with what's happened.

124
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,791
No, probably not.

125
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,833
Ah! Check it...!
This should be perfect!

126
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:42,000
Uh, yeah, um...
that's my collection...

127
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,583
Would you please allow
us to borrow them?

128
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,875
Mm-Hm.

129
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,041
So generous of you!

130
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,458
Don't forget about us...!

131
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,166
We'll do anything
you want, Princess!

132
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,500
All you have to do
is say the word!

133
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,500
I have to ask, Fam...
where did this decision

134
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,291
to start hunting Skyfish
for me come from?

135
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,416
Why...? Is it a problem?

136
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,666
Oh, no... Not at all.

137
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,125
I guess I'm just curious
because none of you have

138
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,208
any ties to Turan
that I know of.

139
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,958
That's just how Fam is...

140
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,958
She can't ignore anyone
who needs her help.

141
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,916
But what about my part...?

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't do anything
to repay you all...

143
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:30,083
I don't have anything
anymore... nothing of value.

144
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,916
Okay, I have an idea.
You can hold a Grand Race!

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,708
Yes, you and your Grand Race...

146
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,208
Once you've taken Turan back,

147
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,291
we can so hold another one,
even better than before...!

148
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,916
Tons of ships screaming
through peaceful skies...

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,375
and I'll prove once and for all

150
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,708
that I'm the best pilot
this world has ever seen!

151
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,125
Of course you will...

152
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,291
I have to say, that sounds
like a very interesting

153
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,916
and expensive reward.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,958
Ah, but how can you
put a price on peace?

155
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,041
All right, give 'er a try.

156
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,666
Okay!

157
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,958
Hey...! Short time no see, huh?

158
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,375
Dio?!

159
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:20,791
What do we have here?
The prodigal son has returned.

160
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,541
You're with these people?

161
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,833
What...?! Dio, you're
part of the Silvius crew?

162
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,125
All this time and you
never thought to tell us?

163
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,208
Have I... never
mentioned it before?

164
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,458
No, you didn't...!

165
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,750
Just think of all
the information

166
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,250
you could've given us!

167
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,916
We went in practically blind!
If you'd said something--

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,666
Easy, Fam. Calm down.

169
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,166
Anyway, have you heard...?

170
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,125
Big changes coming
in three days...

171
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,875
The Federation is
formally annexing Turan.

172
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,833
Annexing...?

173
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,500
Turan's leadership and
army are no more...

174
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,833
That's a known fact...

175
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,291
How, then, can you claim
the kingdom still stands?

176
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,625
Where's Millia?

177
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,333
Oh, the princess went
up to the lookout deck

178
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,000
to get some fresh air.

179
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,958
Okay, thanks!

180
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,875
Millia?

181
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,000
Shouldn't you be working?

182
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,666
We're all finished.

183
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,375
I see.

184
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,750
What perfect wind!

185
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,916
Millia...?

186
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,375
You know... if anything ever
happened to Kartoffel...

187
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,583
if it got destroyed
or something...

188
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,250
I know Giselle and I
would be really sad...

189
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,541
We love it so much.

190
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,666
If something like
that did happen...

191
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,625
I'm sure we'd cry a lot...
and get real angry...

192
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,458
and feel sorta lost...

193
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,166
But after that...
you know what we'd do?

194
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,166
We'd get back on our feet
and build a new Kartoffel.

195
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,916
Well, anyway... I guess
what I'm trying to say is...

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
As long as you're around, Turan
will never truly disappear.

197
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,416
All you need is some territory
and people to follow you, right?

198
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,833
Maybe... but I don't
have any land.

199
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,208
What's that matter? Territory
doesn't have to be ground...

200
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,750
It can be anywhere...
like a ship...?

201
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,083
Huh?

202
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,583
As long as you keep up hope,
people will follow you.

203
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,375
Okay, then.
Wish us luck... Bye!

204
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,958
Keep up hope...

205
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,041
Let's see... coolant and
Claudia are good to go...

206
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,791
Fuel tank checks out.

207
00:11:55,875 --> 00:12:00,666
The altimeter, gyro tuning,
and controls are all green.

208
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,375
Preflight checks
complete. All clear.

209
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,791
Y'gonna be okay out there?

210
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:09,416
Yeah, fortunately it's almost
exactly like--a Vespa.

211
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Start 'er up.

212
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,041
Uh... Right...! Starting up.

213
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,083
Hey, Fam...! Hold on!

214
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,000
This is a dangerous operation.
Will you be all right?

215
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,583
Of course we will!

216
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,833
Just wait, Millia...

217
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,666
We're gonna build you
and Turan a whole fleet!

218
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,916
Well, fine, then...

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,375
But if you get yourself
hurt out there,

220
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,958
you'll have to answer to me!

221
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,750
'Kay... let's do this.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,875
Last Exile.

223
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,083
In order to establish a country,
you need three things:

224
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,083
a government, citizens,
and territory...

225
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,083
At this time, we meet
two of the criteria...

226
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,958
I am the government, and
there's a citizen right here.

227
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,333
Huh?

228
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,166
Oh right, me.

229
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,166
One thing left... territory!

230
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,416
We need to exploit
the ship's weakness.

231
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:21,041
Pardon the intrusion... I have
a request for Captain Tatiana.

232
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,333
So the princess likes
to play dress-up, huh?

233
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,416
A little frilly,
but it suits you.

234
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,958
No, wait. Listen...

235
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,625
You see, I have a citizen
right here, and, uh...

236
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,625
Well, that was a waste
of time and effort...

237
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,791
I should've known this outfit

238
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,833
wouldn't have any
power over those two.

239
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,833
No power... Right.

240
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,416
Right on time.

241
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,125
What, those are our targets...?

242
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,375
All those stupid spikes
make 'em look lame.

243
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,333
Ships like those used to
show off their strength

244
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,333
with their colors and
how many towers they had.

245
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,875
Remind me again how many
towers the Ursragna has... two?

246
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,000
I need territory!

247
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,250
There has to be some place
here I can claim for Turan...

248
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,916
There has to be!

249
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,000
Sleep and good food are
life's greatest pleasures.

250
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,458
That's for sure...

251
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,333
Sometimes I think the food's
the only reason I stay on.

252
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,083
Hey, Pops! Seconds!

253
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,875
Yeah, me too!

254
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,708
Here goes nothin'.

255
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,958
We shouldn't run...
We look suspicious.

256
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,333
For cryin' out loud.

257
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:32,500
Whoa. That's impressive!
She's got three red towers.

258
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,416
These are orders from
Narvik Command...?

259
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,875
They want us to vacate the ship?

260
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,416
Affirmative...

261
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,125
The Premier believes Shiraz,
part of your captain's domain,

262
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,791
holds strategic importance...

263
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,333
He insists on quelling
any possible uprisings.

264
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,333
Where is this Shiraz...?
Never heard of it.

265
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,166
Hey...! That's the creepy perv--

266
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,375
Sorry, sir!

267
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,291
I have a message here
for the Lord Cirrus,

268
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,833
Captain of the distinguished
Prince of Victorious.

269
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,583
Allow me to read it for you.

270
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,000
It says, "Lord Ernest 'Cirrus'
Lindemann, your mother requests

271
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,000
that you return
home immediately."

272
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,875
What...? Orders from Mother?!

273
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,500
Yes sir. The letter
strictly commands

274
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,208
that you arrive by
tomorrow morning.

275
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,333
Tomorrow morning?!
I can't do that! No way!

276
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,750
We could never make it in time!

277
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,875
The Prince of
Victorius is too slow!

278
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,125
You got that right.

279
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,000
This spiky old Skyfish
would never get ther--

280
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,458
Oh...! Captain, sir.

281
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,875
It seems that a high-speed ship
has been readied for you.

282
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,791
Really...? Oh!
That's great news...

283
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,041
Fear not, Mother!
Your boy is on his way!

284
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,708
Captain!

285
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,666
So sorry...

286
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,125
Engine room under control.

287
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,708
Bow turrets under control.

288
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,541
Aft lookout deck under control.

289
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,000
Upper decks and all
turrets under control!

290
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,750
Who'd have thought you could
take over a ship this big

291
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,291
without a drop
of bloodshed.

292
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,625
Ninety percent of any
successful Skyfish hunt

293
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,208
is in the preparation, Olaf...

294
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,041
being ready for
any contingency...

295
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,916
Beyond that, it's
all 'bout guts...

296
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,333
Of course...
beauty doesn't hurt!

297
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,375
You really are something...
Nice, Giselle.

298
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,041
If it isn't too much trouble,

299
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,208
I would greatly appreciate
your help with something.

300
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,333
Please, I'm begging you...

301
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,416
The noble nation of Turan is
on the verge of destruction!

302
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,083
But you can help...
All I need is this one room.

303
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,041
I don't understand...

304
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,708
From what I've heard,
wearing an outfit like this

305
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:40,333
is guaranteed to turn
a man's knees to jelly.

306
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,000
Outfit strike two.

307
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,708
Engine acoustics
detected at nine o'clock.

308
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,583
Ship-of-the-line class.

309
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,250
All hands to battle stations...

310
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,500
Unknown ship-of-the-line
is now approaching.

311
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,500
Go to silent running now...
Fifteen to port side.

312
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,208
Fifteen to port... Silent.

313
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,666
Good. Confirm target
ship's position.

314
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,791
Present distance
is two point five...

315
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,875
Closing in at eighty knots Vc.

316
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,416
Lookouts, make
visual confirmation.

317
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,125
All hands to battle stations...

318
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,458
I repeat...

319
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,791
5th Squad...! Prepare for
close-quarters combat.

320
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,416
Aye-aye, sir!

321
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,666
Are you coming, sir?

322
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,875
Go on ahead, son...

323
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,916
Find a safe place to hide.
This could get ugly.

324
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,916
What do we do now, Princess?

325
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,458
Receiving acoustic signal
from the approaching ship...

326
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,833
"Olaf reporting...
Operation was successful."

327
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,166
Took him long enough.

328
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,958
Stand down from
battle stations...

329
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,333
The approaching ship has been
commandeered by the Sky Pirates.

330
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,166
Wah-hoo!

331
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,250
Fam's back! She actually did it!
Are you ready, citizen?

332
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,500
Isn't it too early for mess?

333
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,875
My name is Millia il Velch
Cutrettola Turan...

334
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,208
I am the Second Princess
and royal deputy

335
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,166
of the Kingdom of Turan.

336
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,125
The Ades Federation violated
the terms of the peace talks

337
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,208
held at the sacred Grand Lake...

338
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,250
They mercilessly
invaded Turan territory.

339
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,333
They reduced our
royal city to rubble.

340
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,000
In addition, they have
expanded their invasion...

341
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,583
and now threaten neighboring
nations with brutal usurpation.

342
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,250
The Federation knows
nothing of mercy.

343
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,250
As a representative
of the peaceful

344
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,416
and freedom-loving
people of Turan...

345
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,833
I resolutely vow to continue
fighting the Ades tyranny...

346
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,916
These animals must be stopped.

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,375
In furtherance of this goal,

348
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:56,000
I hereby establish the new
Turan Kingdom on this ship.

349
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,958
The conquerors have
been defeated...

350
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,125
After more than a hundred
years of unjust exile,

351
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,041
the people of Gonia
have been restored

352
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,708
to their rightful lands.

353
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,416
Fellow citizens, we have
all suffered long enough...

354
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,833
The need to unite is
stronger than ever.

355
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:18,291
I ask you... rise up, and
take back what is yours!

356
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,500
Gloria... Augusta!

357
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,041
In the name of history...
and our honored forefathers...

358
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:42,166
I hereby declare the annexation
of the Turan Kingdom.

359
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,250
A united planet... a united
nation... A united people...

360
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,916
May our former
glory be restored.

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,666
Gloria... Augusta!

362
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,166
Gloria... Augusta...!
Gloria... Augusta...!

363
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,791
Gloria... Augusta...!

364
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:05,208
Gloria... Augusta...!
Gloria... Augusta...!

365
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,958
Gloria... Augusta...!

366
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,791
What are your
demands, missy?

367
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,208
Rights to this galley...
three private rooms...

368
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,708
and a shower room...

369
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,416
This will serve as Turan's
Refugee Government Headquarters.

370
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,291
We also expect
three daily meals.

371
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,208
She's pretty serious
about those demands.

372
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,125
Told you they were some
interesting kids, didn't I?

373
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,291
How should we proceed, Captain?

374
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,708
I suppose she's fighting
for a good cause.

375
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,083
Sure 'bout this...?

376
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,041
If we allow her territorial
rights, we could end up

377
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,875
pitting ourselves
against the Federation.

378
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,583
You're the one who
told me making peace

379
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,750
was going to be difficult.

380
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,583
So once again, you hate the idea

381
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,708
of refusing help to
someone in need.

382
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,208
But for a couple of
lost little birds,

383
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,250
their talents could
come in handy.

384
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,625
'Scuse me. Make room please...

385
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,000
--Hey, don't push.
--Comin' through.

386
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,291
--Who's this?
--Princess Millia!

387
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,875
Whoa...! What's going on here?

388
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:16,041
Is that you, Fam?
You really did it, didn't you?

389
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,125
What's with the
get-up, Princess?

390
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,375
Hey, stop laughing!
I had no choice.

391
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,750
It was part of my plan
for rebuilding Turan.

392
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,125
Oh, I can't take any more.

393
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,916
--Okay, Fam... that's enough.
--My stomach hurts!

394
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,208
Fam is greatly amused.

395
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:35,500
A toast to the Turan
refugee government!

396
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,000
Little gift from me.

397
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,916
Awesome! Thanks a lot!

398
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,333
Now that's a royal feast...!

399
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:48,500
Wait a minute...
Something wrong?

400
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,875
I'm just thinking how
pathetic this all is.

401
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,416
My entire Kingdom now consists

402
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,750
of little more than
a ship's galley.

403
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,125
Millia...

404
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:02,208
How can I possibly do it...?
Rebuild Turan from this?

405
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,000
It may not seem like much,

406
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,166
but you have genuine
Turan territory now,

407
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,083
and you acquired
it all by yourself.

408
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:16,291
Don't think so negatively. The
mess hall is just the beginning.

409
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,291
Soon you'll have
the whole Silvius...

410
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,250
and after that... back to Turan!

411
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,708
We've got big things to do,
and no time to waste...

412
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:35,208
I can almost taste
that Grand Race victory.

413
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,083
Thank you, Fam.

414
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,000
Though it seems like
only one small step,

415
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,750
this is a giant leap
toward rebuilding Turan!

416
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,958
The galley of the
battleship Silvius...

417
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,000
This is where
our future begins!

418
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,125
Understand, Teddy?

419
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,625
Yes, Princess Millia!

420
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,375
After that, we'll need a
room for Fam, Gigi, and me.

421
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,708
Um.. Princess... Only one room?

422
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,250
Oh!

423
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,791
That's right!

424
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,583
I'll need a room to display my
sister's keepsakes, as well!

425
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:45,958
Uh... so where do I sleep?
