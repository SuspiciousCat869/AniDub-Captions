1
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,125
Where is the Silvius' crew?

2
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,250
I'm sorry... I don't know.

3
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,541
However, we do know the
Silvius made it out of there

4
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,041
after helping you escape.

5
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,458
Oh, good!

6
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,750
Oh, thank you.

7
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,500
Wheat! Amazing...!

8
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,125
It must've come along because
it was worried about you.

9
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,208
Right.

10
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,916
Luscinia fears the power we
can wield with the Exile.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,916
That's why he's searching
for Alvis, its key.

12
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,041
Dynamic Possibilities.

13
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:44,583
Let's see, I got one for Millia,
one for Alvis, and one for Dio.

14
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,833
Hey, have you noticed

15
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,375
that Millia hasn't been
eating much lately...?

16
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,833
I hope she's okay.

17
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:54,416
Yeah.

18
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,125
This is General Orang..

19
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,666
I thought you would
like to meet him.

20
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,708
He contributed greatly to our
victory in the last battle.

21
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,208
The Federation's Third Fleet.

22
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:08,208
This is Princess Millia, the
acting royal deputy of Turan.

23
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,333
I am very sorry.

24
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,583
What was done to your family
and the people of your land

25
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,625
was reprehensible.

26
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,458
Our position is still tenuous...

27
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:21,083
We will have to maintain
our hold of Boreas.

28
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,500
Yes.

29
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,416
General Orang will fight
toward that goal alongside us.

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,208
In the name of the Augusta.

31
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,500
For the sake of true and
lasting peace in this world.

32
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,583
A witch's sister
and a traitor...

33
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,791
Perfect match!

34
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,958
What?!

35
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,708
You'll stab us in the
back next, right?

36
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,208
Dyan!

37
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,041
Fam...

38
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,708
Oh, hey, Dyan...!
Are you hungry?

39
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,750
No, she's not...
Let's go, Dyan.

40
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,625
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't
have much of an appetite.

41
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,083
It's all right...

42
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:32,125
I'll just bring something
nice to drink then, shall I?

43
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:37,708
I'll just bring something
nice to drink then, shall I?

44
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,791
Huh?

45
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,250
[stomach growls]

46
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,791
Where's Dio?

47
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,625
Well, uh... I looked away
for a minute, and...

48
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,208
Cryin' out loud...

49
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,583
Sorry to impose like this.

50
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,833
Dio?

51
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,375
Oh, hi, Fam!

52
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,791
Sara!

53
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,541
I got hungry so I went
scavenging, and I found her...

54
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,250
--Right?
--Yes...

55
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,416
I was dining when this gentleman
introduced himself to me.

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,875
I'm sorry, but are
you telling us

57
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,166
that Dio actually
interrupted your meal?

58
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,916
Oh... well, yes,
I suppose he did.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,083
The Augusta's
having a tough time.

60
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,875
Yeah, Sara thinks
it's her fault somehow

61
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,291
that everyone is fighting
each other like this.

62
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,583
Not just her... Millia too...

63
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,875
Can't be easy having people
call her a witch's sister.

64
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,708
Whoa... They're saying that?

65
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,375
Hey Fam...! Gigi... Time to go.

66
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,666
This'll be so much better
without all that extra weight.

67
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,458
We're just supposed
to act as lookouts...?

68
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,708
Is that all?

69
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,041
Not really surprising

70
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,083
after we went and did our
own thing the other day.

71
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,750
Are ya ready, Birdbrain?
Let's do this!

72
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,125
General Kayvan's Second
Fleet hasn't recovered

73
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,958
from the damage it took
during the Glacies battle.

74
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,708
How much does that
help us, though...?

75
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,958
They still have Admiral
Sadri and his First Fleet,

76
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,750
which is nearly
at full strength.

77
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,375
Do not fear, Princess,
this fortress will not fall.

78
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,916
The thick mist and treacherous
crevasses will provide

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,375
adequate protection
from any invading force.

80
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,291
From the outside, perhaps...

81
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,916
But what if something... happens
to one of us from within?

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,750
Are you referring to
the lingering anger

83
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:48,541
between Glacies and
Orang's forces...? Or...

84
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,166
Is it that you don't fully
trust in your own abilities

85
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,958
as a commander?

86
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,416
Not only soldiers grow
stronger the more they fight,

87
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,250
their leaders do as well...

88
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,958
The Turan forces will continue
to improve, and so will you.

89
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,041
Are you sure?

90
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,958
We have justice and the Augusta
on our side; I have to be.

91
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,250
Looks like we're all clear
at one and two o'clock.

92
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,500
Roger. All clear at
ten o'clock, too.

93
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,041
Yep...! As far as
the eye can see!

94
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,000
Woo-hoo!

95
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:31,083
Nothin' but water
and sky and clouds!

96
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,500
Just look at it.

97
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,666
The Grand Lake is so
serene... so peaceful...

98
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,750
Why can't people
be like that, too?

99
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:44,541
Yeah... This stupid war hasn't
brought happiness to anybody.

100
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,083
Gigi?!

101
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,666
I'm fine!

102
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,250
They're moving so erratically!

103
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,500
I'm seeing something above
the horizon at eleven o'clock.

104
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,916
Muffle the engine.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,333
Target at eleven o'clock.
Altitude, two-fifty.

106
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,041
I'm counting at least
eighty Kishar Dreadnoughts

107
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,458
and seventy Grouse
Super-Dreadnoughts.

108
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,750
So...

109
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,291
We're looking at the
Federation's First Fleet.

110
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,291
Boreas patrol ships detected.

111
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,666
Scrambling interceptors.

112
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,583
No, let them go.

113
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,500
I want them to report
the size of our fleet.

114
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,833
Do you think the enemy
will take action?

115
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,208
Vasant spends more time
supporting those above her

116
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,041
than commanding
common soldiers...

117
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,208
Her rag-tag army
will be intoxicated

118
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,708
from its first victory ...

119
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,875
She will be unable to
keep the men in check.

120
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,041
There's no better time
to fight than now!

121
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,333
It's just one fleet
led by an old man!

122
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,916
That's right!

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:54,375
And we have General Orang and
the Third Fleet on our side now.

124
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,416
General Orang?

125
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,000
I agree holding our ground
is the best course of action.

126
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,333
Thank you...

127
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,125
I'm glad you're fighting
for the Joint Forces now.

128
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,791
In the name of the Augusta.

129
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,500
Gloria, Augusta, and good luck.

130
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,083
So... there's going
to be more fighting.

131
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,125
--Good tailwinds, Dyan!
--Fam?

132
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,166
Hey, no dying out there, 'kay?

133
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,000
And when you get back you can
totally make up with Millia...

134
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,958
Take care, Magnolia!

135
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,083
See you guys later!

136
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,291
There they go.

137
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,375
A battle... Just when the
Exile's about to return.

138
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,791
Last Exile.

139
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,416
There's a Glacies squad
approaching from the rear.

140
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,000
Fifty ships, sir!

141
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,916
Glad they're on our side.

142
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,666
Glacies squad now
passing overhead.

143
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,208
The Maguilitars
has been hit!...!

144
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,166
Unable to launch
Vanship squadrons!

145
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,416
The Imperius is down!

146
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,583
Admiral?!

147
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,000
Let them have the
numerical advantage...

148
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,708
The strength of the entire fleet
will secure our victory today.

149
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,458
The Glacies attack
run was a success.

150
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,666
No enemy ships in sight.

151
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,041
Which means air
superiority is now ours.

152
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,583
Yes.

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,208
Transmit the signal now.

154
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,958
A signal from the Borth?

155
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,916
Reconciliation?

156
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,708
"Attention, Third Fleet
and General Orang..."

157
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,000
"Move to attack rebel
forces from the rear;

158
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,333
follow arranged
pincer operation."

159
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,666
A pincer?

160
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,583
Admiral Sadri,
as crafty as ever.

161
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,041
Dyan...!

162
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,250
Dyan?

163
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,208
Incoming Glacies squadron!

164
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,375
They're hostile!

165
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,750
We'll be killed if
we don't shoot first...

166
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,333
Fire! Bring 'em down!

167
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,291
They're comin' in fast!

168
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,416
Fire...! Fire...! Take them out!

169
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,916
Glacies has taken
down the Impulsus!

170
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,458
Commence barrage fire!

171
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,250
Belay!

172
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,250
Dyan...! Wait!

173
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,666
Number five, number seven...

174
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,250
Don't fire!
Glacies is not our enemy!

175
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,083
Fire is breaking out!

176
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,916
Third Fleet is in bad shape.

177
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,291
Don't shoot!

178
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,208
Fifteen ally ships
damaged or downed!

179
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,166
And no thanks to
the enemy's strategy,

180
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,750
most of it's from friendly fire.

181
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,750
It's crazy out there! Ships
being shot down left and right!

182
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,875
Dyan!

183
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,708
You have to stop...!
You can't shoot your allies!

184
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,375
Dyan, listen!

185
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,166
The Jagannath
never fired a shot.

186
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,750
Even after you
started attacking,

187
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,541
she didn't strike back!

188
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:04,916
Retreat?!

189
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,416
Dio!

190
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,500
Support the Third Fleet ...

191
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,833
Our new alliance
must fight as one!

192
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,583
Attention, all ships
of the Third Fleet...!

193
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,041
Give the Turan fleet
time to withdraw...

194
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,708
Then bring up the rear.

195
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,458
Portside engine chamber damaged!
Speed down fifty percent!

196
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,000
We need to abandon ship!

197
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,458
No, not yet...! The princess
must get back safely!

198
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,875
No, the Jagannath...!

199
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,166
Portside propellers and
engine chamber hit...!

200
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,666
Damage to liquid
Claudia conduits!

201
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,208
Get those sealed off...

202
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,791
Reroute all remaining
ones and hold speed...

203
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,458
Don't give up!

204
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,625
You have to abandon
ship, Princess...!

205
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,458
There's no way we'll make it.

206
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,125
That is not the Anshar
we're firing at...

207
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,500
It is Princess Millia's
flagship, the Lasas,

208
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,333
we will show no mercy.

209
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,791
Cut off her retreat...

210
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:28,083
and destroy Orang's interfering
Third Fleet as well.

211
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,458
Boreas grows near!

212
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,750
Status report!

213
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,583
Lookouts?!

214
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,291
The Aniguis is down!

215
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,916
Sorry for the wait...
We've come to help.

216
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,375
The Silvius!

217
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,166
The Reaper!

218
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,625
Fire!

219
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,250
Princess Millia!

220
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:45,541
Teddy! You're all right!
It's so good to see you!

221
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,708
You, you too!

222
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,000
Thank goodness.

223
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,916
I'm glad you're
all in one piece.

224
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I know it took us a while,
but it wasn't easy

225
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,416
to get the Silvius repaired
while in hiding...

226
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,291
We're so sorry.

227
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,333
Well, I'm glad you're all right.

228
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,625
Where's Fam?

229
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:07,875
Time to fly!

230
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,041
Yeah, but Dio, your arm--

231
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,750
And here we go!

232
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,000
What just happened?

233
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,041
The rock wharf...!
It's been blown up!

234
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,291
The rubble from the explosion

235
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,875
is filling in the southern
crevasse, General!

236
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,291
But how?

237
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,916
Goodness, what now?

238
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,458
Come with me, Teddy.

239
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,583
Yes, Princess Millia!

240
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,125
Sara!

241
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,125
Let's put a stop
to this fighting!

242
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,333
What do you mean?

243
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,291
Everyone here wants
the same thing, right?

244
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,833
So we should all
be working together

245
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,666
and trusting each other!

246
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,208
Yes, I agree...! I hate
everyone fighting like this!

247
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,500
But I don't know how to stop it!

248
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,791
If anybody can make
this right, it's you...

249
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,125
the brave Augusta Sara.

250
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,916
The collapse of the cliff face

251
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,083
has eliminated the southern
corridor's altitude ceiling...

252
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,750
We can now advance!

253
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,208
Bring down Boreas...
Vanguard ships, charge.

254
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,291
Vanguard ships, charge!

255
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,791
Charge!

256
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,833
Enemy vanguard has breached
the last line of defense!

257
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,708
Prepare for
hand-to-hand combat...

258
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,875
Get the Augusta to a safe area.

259
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,583
For Vasant and Sadri.

260
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,791
Without fail.

261
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,416
Leave it to us.

262
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,208
Princess Millia!

263
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,750
Gigi!

264
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,250
Everything is all set.

265
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,041
Here we go.

266
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,166
Right... hope it works.

267
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Oh, what now?

268
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,041
Primary targets are the
upper command center

269
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,125
and the artillery batteries.
Take them down!

270
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,625
They've made it this far?

271
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,541
Then let's punch through.

272
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,708
Attention, Sky Pirates...
Turn back at once!

273
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,958
Turn around now...
or be shot down!

274
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,041
Stop, Dyan...!

275
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,875
We have to deliver this letter!
Please let us go!

276
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:03,958
Dyan!

277
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,708
They're shooting!

278
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,833
We have a message
from Augusta Sara.

279
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,208
Please, sir. You don't
understand how much it hurts her

280
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,375
to see you fighting
each other like this...

281
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,125
We have to put a stop to it.

282
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,625
From the Augusta...

283
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,500
Augusta Sara desires
an end to hostilities...

284
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,583
And she asks that an
immediate truce be called.

285
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,416
The Augusta?

286
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,750
But, it was for her sake...
that I started this...

287
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,750
I turned against
Luscinia for her!

288
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,541
Augusta...

289
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,083
Give the men new orders...

290
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,958
The assault on Boreas
Fortress will cease at once.

291
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,875
But, sir--?

292
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,041
Word from the Augusta herself.

293
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,541
She wishes for a truce.

294
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,666
Hey...

295
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,041
Fam!

296
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:38,208
It really worked...! Yes...!
Yes...! The war is over!

297
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,083
Yes!

298
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,000
Raha...

299
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,541
It must have been so hard!

300
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,250
Yes! But I knew
I'd see you again,

301
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,541
so I conducted
training every day!

302
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,625
Training?

303
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,291
Preparing your
favorite royal milk tea

304
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,833
to exactly the right strength!

305
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:30,875
Huh?

306
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:31,875
Baking your favorite
raisin scones

307
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,708
to exactly the right texture!

308
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,916
Teddy, you didn't need
any training for tha--

309
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,833
Every member of the
Silvius maintenance crew

310
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,958
has now mastered these tasks.

311
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,416
What?! You trained them?

312
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,666
Princess Millia!
