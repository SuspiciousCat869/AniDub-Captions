1
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,250
Enemy Notos fleet spreading
out on our port side.

2
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,291
They're opening fire.

3
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,750
Second and Third Armored
Fleets have been blocked in.

4
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,833
Enemy is outside our main
fleet's firing range.

5
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,291
Second Armored is taking damage.

6
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:04,125
They're flanking both sides and
then striking the weaker rear.

7
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,083
Exactly by the book.

8
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,958
A predictable maneuver...

9
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,666
Their commander likes
tried and true tactics.

10
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,500
They're surrounding us.

11
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,833
Aha...

12
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,416
Orang's inspired quite a
number of the enemy to retreat.

13
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,125
To think someone
with so little wit

14
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,791
could've put on such
a convincing act.

15
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,833
No thanks to you, Sorush...

16
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,541
You're tarnishing your
reputation for swiftness...

17
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,708
Attention, all ships,
bring about, immediately.

18
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,625
We'll counter-envelop the enemy.

19
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:08,708
Gloria!

20
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,333
It's time to show
these repatriates

21
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,625
the power of the
Augusta's soldiers.

22
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,750
Gloria! Augusta!

23
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,500
Today we teach these
Notos returnees a lesson.

24
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,375
They'll see why Fourth Fleet
is known for its swiftness.

25
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,666
Gloria! Augusta!

26
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,541
Enemy ships out of sight!

27
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,416
Enemy ships out of sight.

28
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,291
Any further pursuit would
be a waste of our time...

29
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,666
All ships, change course.
Return to the capital.

30
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,833
Gloria!

31
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,125
Silvius... the Reaper.

32
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,791
Light square.

33
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,083
Orang of the Third Fleet
and Sorush of the Fourth

34
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,333
have succeeded in destroying
the enemy Notos ships...

35
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,750
Cleanup operations
are now underway.

36
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,375
Good... What about Sadri?

37
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,458
He and the First Fleet have
subdued the Corbeau Peninsula...

38
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,458
They're currently in
pursuit of a battleship

39
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,250
of unknown affiliation.

40
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:28,791
We have returned from the
Turan capital city... Augusta.

41
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,833
Luscinia!

42
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,916
Welcome back!

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,750
Thank you both for
all your hard work.

44
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,125
Majesty.

45
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,333
My deepest apologies for the
damage done to the fleet

46
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,333
you so graciously granted us.

47
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,041
Please, do not be
so distraught...

48
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,833
I have no doubt you
did the best you could

49
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,375
with the resources available.

50
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,333
I am humbled, Augusta.

51
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,541
Kayvan... do you think...

52
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,583
um, could you do
that thing again?

53
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,500
Certainly...! Anything for you.

54
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,875
Please, Augusta...

55
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,500
You shouldn't frolic so.
You could sustain an injury.

56
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,041
Come, Vasant...!

57
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,250
Do you truly believe I would
commit such a careless blunder

58
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,291
as to drop the Augusta?
Unthinkable!

59
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,041
Upon receiving word
of Iglasia's downfall,

60
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:17,625
the cities of Turan
immediately began to surrender.

61
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,958
It seems a royal
edict had been issued,

62
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,291
encouraging peaceful surrender
should the royal city fall,

63
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,666
rather than prolonged fighting.

64
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,416
The king of Turan
was always known

65
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,375
for being a sensible moderate...

66
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:33,875
Besides, they stood no
chance against an Exile.

67
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:38,375
Indeed. To think that
they possess such power.

68
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,708
Exiles...

69
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,250
The accursed ships that
took them from our world

70
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,541
and brought them
back, uninvited.

71
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,666
With their role
long since fulfilled

72
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,875
and their existence fading
from the returnees' memories...

73
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,708
it was only fitting
that an Exile

74
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,541
dealt them the crushing blow.

75
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,625
For our world does not yet have
the bounty to support those

76
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,666
who have returned as well
as those who remained.

77
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,000
Thus far, even locating
the keys to the Exiles

78
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,333
has been a nearly
impossible task...

79
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,041
May I ask where
Your Majesty acquired

80
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,291
information about the Turan key?

81
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,083
Surely that is of no concern
to rank and file soldiers

82
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,625
such as ourselves, Vasant.

83
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,458
We call the area the
Kingdom of Turan now...

84
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,791
but what people
used to live there?

85
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,166
Well, Augusta...

86
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,625
That territory was inhabited
by the tribe of people

87
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,250
now residing in Gonia,

88
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,958
the northeastern region
of the Ades Federation.

89
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,666
Our records indicate that the
Turanians usurped their land

90
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,583
when they returned to this world
one hundred-eighteen years ago.

91
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,500
Life in Gonia must be difficult

92
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,791
after the harsh
winter last year.

93
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,416
but you will return their
wheat-filled lands to them soon,

94
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
won't you?

95
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,333
You have a great heart, Augusta.

96
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,666
We will do everything
in our power to see their

97
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,125
rightful territory restored
to them as soon as possible.

98
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,583
Onto other business then...

99
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,875
There's the memorial service
for the tenth anniversary

100
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,458
of the previous
Augusta's passing,

101
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,791
scheduled for next month.

102
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,000
Indeed... It is hard to believe

103
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:10,208
it's already been ten years
since the Grand Race.

104
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,333
Since my mother...

105
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,250
You lied!

106
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,083
You promised you would rescue
my sister, but you didn't...!

107
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,875
You could've just left me and
taken her away from there!

108
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,416
So why?! Why save
me and not her?!

109
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,875
Why?!

110
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,333
Please try to
calm down, Princess.

111
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,458
Let go!

112
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,958
I know what you're
going through...

113
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:46,541
Listen...! Please... It was
our only option at the time.

114
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,333
What do you know about
how I'm feeling...?!

115
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,291
My sister has to survive
no matter what! She has to!

116
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,041
Or else where will
Turan be without her?

117
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,625
Princess Millia!
Princess Millia!

118
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,083
Let 'er go...?

119
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,083
Should we help...? Or, um...

120
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,083
Nah, let's leave her be for now.

121
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,416
Damn that Federation!

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,125
Takes a special
kind of evil ta...

123
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,791
go dropping moons
on people like that.

124
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,375
Not moons Fritz,
they're Exiles...

125
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,875
Apparently, our ancestors
rode 'em back to this planet

126
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,333
hundreds of years ago.

127
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,833
Almost too crazy to believe.

128
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,125
Haven't had such heavy
trading in a long time...

129
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,166
Not since the fall of Metopon.

130
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,208
The Lasas?

131
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,583
Ninety thousand?

132
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,000
Look how banged up it is.
Fifty's being generous.

133
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,000
Eighty grand!

134
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,875
Fifty-five, max!

135
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,625
Our proud Kingdom of Turan...

136
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,416
Our loyal,
courageous soldiers...

137
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,875
Oh...! Now that's a nice unit...

138
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,875
Just what I'd expect
from the Turan flagship.

139
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,625
Up, up, up, up, up...!

140
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,833
--Hey! Make some room...
--And back...!

141
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,000
--Coming through!
--That's it, nice n' easy!

142
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,833
Oh, man, what a haul!

143
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,291
Wow! You got some
great pieces today!

144
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,375
Yep, just got 'em in.

145
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,583
This is nice!

146
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,625
All right... Just let me know
if you want anything else.

147
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,833
I'll be right here.

148
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,833
Will do... Good tailwinds!

149
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,083
May the wind carry your wings.

150
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,875
No, hold on...! Please!

151
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,583
Come back!

152
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,041
Last Exile.

153
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,041
Hey, I'm back...!

154
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,625
Why don't ya come in
and relax here for a bit?

155
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,125
Awright.

156
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,666
--Wha-whooo!
--Whoa!

157
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,791
Rene! How many times
have I told you

158
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,333
not to ride the
Melitta inside...?

159
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,083
Ghost ships come for children
who don't behave, you know!

160
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,750
--'Kay.
--Gigi! Glad you're home!

161
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,250
So am I!

162
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,166
Wait, who's he...? Did you
bring a new friend home, Sis?

163
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,833
Oh, hi!

164
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,958
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!

165
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,500
I heard everything...
It must have been so hard!

166
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,625
You're such a trooper!
You poor thing.

167
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,291
Careful, Mom...
You're scarin' poor Teddy.

168
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, my...! I'm sorry, dear.

169
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,708
I hope you'll
forgive the mess...

170
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,833
I'll go steam us
some potatoes...

171
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,083
Just make yourself at home.

172
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,416
Oh... thank you...

173
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,125
If it's no trouble,
could I 'ave some water?

174
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,250
Huh?

175
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,250
Don't cry, my dear...

176
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:11,166
You are our only hope,
Millia, please be strong...

177
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,833
The fate of our nation now
lies in your capable hands.

178
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:19,500
I beg you, please
rescue my sister!

179
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,541
She's all I have left.

180
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,666
Fam...! Come quick!

181
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,250
It's too dangerous! Please just
get out of there, okay?

182
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,875
You don't even know
how to operate it;

183
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,250
push the wrong button and
you could hurt yourself!

184
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,625
I am a princess of Turan...!

185
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,875
I don't take orders
from Sky Pirates!

186
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,875
Princess or not, you've never
touched a Vespa in your life...

187
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,583
There's no way you'll
be able to fly it.

188
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:00,625
Would you just listen to reason
and come down from there?

189
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:07,250
I can't... It belongs to my
sister... I have to get it back.

190
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,666
Get out of there!

191
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,000
Move, now.

192
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,250
Absolutely not!

193
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,625
Oh, calm down...!

194
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,750
I'm just asking you to
move to the back seat.

195
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,250
Hurry up!

196
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,708
Let me be your wings.

197
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,500
Unfortunately, she's got
a pretty big lead on us.

198
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,666
So I don't think we'll
be able to spot her.

199
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,541
Hey... you got a look
at her Vanship, right?

200
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,250
What's it like...?
Any special markings or colors?

201
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,750
It doesn't matter.

202
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,875
Huh?!

203
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,666
I said it doesn't matter.
Not anymore.

204
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,041
Why the sudden change of heart?

205
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,791
This is important
to you, isn't it?

206
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,500
It is, but... what can I do?

207
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,583
Nothing... I can't
do anything...

208
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:02,583
A memento of my sister... and I
can't even recover it by myself.

209
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,541
Don't you see?
I'm... completely useless.

210
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,791
Pull it, Millia.

211
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,666
The right lever.

212
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,208
This?

213
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,750
Ahh!

214
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,958
My, my...
Isn't that a nice setup?

215
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:36,875
So this what Turanians use
to make tea... Fascinating.

216
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,500
Here!

217
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,708
Oh, uh... thank you kindly.

218
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,166
Such a lovely home...

219
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,333
Is this where you and your
family have always lived?

220
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,875
No, we move around a lot.

221
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,750
This is one of many
bases we use...

222
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,500
We have to stay
pretty nomadic...

223
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,291
We make our livings
catching Skyfish,

224
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,875
mostly Federation ones...

225
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,791
so they're always
looking for us.

226
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,666
Doesn't that frighten you?

227
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,333
Sometimes.

228
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,416
It's not easy,
but it's necessary.

229
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,916
We're all here to
escape the Federation.

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,333
Escape?

231
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,666
When their homelands get
destroyed by the Federation,

232
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,416
people have nowhere else to go.
So they turn to this life...

233
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,208
There are Sky Pirates
all over the world now...

234
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,541
With no land, they make their
homes in the sky, instead.

235
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,000
Just like us...

236
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,500
I was still a baby when we
came to Kartoffel, though...

237
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,000
So this is the only
home I've really known.

238
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,416
Fam as well?

239
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,625
Wait up!

240
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,291
It's cool she gave
it back so nicely...

241
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,291
See, even a Sky Pirate
can sympathize

242
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,750
if you explain the situation...
but it's only fair for you

243
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,750
to give her something
in exchange later.

244
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:52,583
Of course, the best way to
repay one of us is during a job.

245
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,333
--I'm awfully sorry.
--Huh?

246
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,083
You shouldn't have to do this...

247
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,791
I'm so helpless; I'm nothing
but a constant inconvenience.

248
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,083
"May the wind guide and carry
wings that become lost."

249
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,166
If someone in the sky
needs help, you help them,

250
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,583
regardless of who they are...

251
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,541
That's a big part of
the Sky Pirate code...

252
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,583
In fact, they helped me
when I needed it most.

253
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,333
I don't know where
I'd be without them.

254
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,916
They helped you...?
How do you mean?

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,625
When I was a baby...
they saved me.

256
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,541
--Hey!
--Hey!

257
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,000
You all right?

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,708
I'm sure it crashed
somewhere in this area.

259
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,375
That's it, down there!

260
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,208
Too late...

261
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,500
Hey...! Hey!

262
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,333
Atamora, I got somethin' here!

263
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,458
Yeah what did you find?

264
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,541
Don'tcha hear that baby crying?!

265
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,500
I feel awful.

266
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,875
All this time...
I've been so selfish...

267
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,958
I've been acting like I'm the
only one who is suffering...

268
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,750
I only ever thought
about myself...

269
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,958
But you and your people have
been through a lot too...

270
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,458
you have your own sorrows.

271
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,750
I guess it is a
pretty sad story,

272
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,333
and there are times when it's
difficult to think about...

273
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,125
But I was way too
little to remember,

274
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,791
so I try not to let it
bother me that much.

275
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,125
Besides, Gigi and her folks
have been there for me

276
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,625
ever since then...

277
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,458
Being a Sky Pirate's like
being part of one big family.

278
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,000
It's great 'cause I can trust
that as long as I'm in the sky.

279
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll never be too far
away from someone I know.

280
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,416
And on top of all that,
I have a dream!

281
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,125
A dream?

282
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,708
The Grand Race?

283
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,375
Yeah, I'm betting
this prob'ly happened

284
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,833
just before you were born...

285
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,791
Dad took Fam and me to see it...

286
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,916
I'll never forget that
day as long as I live!

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,916
Vanship pilots from
all over the world

288
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,041
gathered to compete
in one big race.

289
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,416
It was held to commemorate
"the day the Federation,

290
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,166
and all the world's
countries agreed to peace."

291
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,583
So you want to hold
a new Grand Race?

292
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,125
Yeah! Jus' like before...

293
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,875
Vanship pilots from
all over the world

294
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,125
set aside their differences
and come together to compete.

295
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,375
Sky Pirates, surface
dwellers, everyone!

296
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,166
Soaring through the sky together
instead of fighting each other.

297
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,541
Sounds great, huh...?
Of course...

298
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,708
At the end, when the dust
settles, I'll be the winner!

299
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,541
Of course... Nice dream.

300
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,250
I think so.

301
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,625
But... things didn't stay
like that after... Did they?

302
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,750
No... in the end,
the peace fell apart...

303
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,333
And there's never been
another Grand Race since.

304
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,625
All those Vanship pilots
from all over the world

305
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,333
split up again and left
for their own skies.

306
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,041
Hold on! That's the victory cup

307
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,875
from the Grand Race
on your shelf, innit?

308
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,958
Does that mean
the winner was--

309
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,791
--Daddy!
--All right, kids, it's time.

310
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,916
Oh, hi Dad!

311
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,333
You guys ready?

312
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,875
Yeah!

313
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,166
Good... let's go!

314
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,666
How amazing that sounds!

315
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,750
People from all different
nations coming together

316
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,208
for a race in a sky
free of fighting...

317
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,958
I can only imagine how
wonderful that would be!

318
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,583
We'll make it happen...
Someday, for sure!

319
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,125
Indeed.

320
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,541
What is that, Fam?

321
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,500
It's a funeral.

322
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,583
That looks like a Turan ship.

323
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,583
"Return fallen
wings to the sky."

324
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,458
That's another part of
the Sky Pirate Code.

325
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,833
May the souls lost to this
world find their way safely

326
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,458
to the peace that awaits them
in the far reaches of the sky.

327
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:51,666
"Ola... kae... Tode... tai."

328
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,750
Let the wings of your ship
carry you as they fly...

329
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,041
The sky is your eternal home...

330
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,875
May you find peace.

331
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,916
Good tailwinds forever more.

332
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,750
I pray that the wind
will carry your wings

333
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,916
as you make your final journey.

334
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,958
Ola... kae... Tode... tai.

335
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:28,291
Ola... kae... Tode... tai.

336
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,458
Well?

337
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,958
Thank you so much.

338
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,041
Of course. No problem.

339
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,666
Delicious... Great job, Teddy.

340
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,500
Oh thank you, Princess!

341
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,333
Father's right.
I need to be strong.

342
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,291
Hey, Fam! Wait up a sec...

343
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,666
I've got some
interesting info for you.

344
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,666
Dio, your version
of "interesting"...

345
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,916
is never all that impressive.

346
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,708
How's this for impressive:

347
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:32,791
the legendary Silvius was
spotted at the Miran lookout!

348
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:40,000
Gigi...! Millia!

349
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,208
Fam, what's going on?

350
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,958
Silvius the Reaper's
been spotted,

351
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,583
and I'm gonna steal
her for Millia!

352
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,416
That's a really
impressive bag, Teddy!

353
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,000
I wondered why it was so big,

354
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,208
but I never guessed you had
a whole tea set in there.

355
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,583
Aye! Being ready to serve
tea at a moment's notice

356
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,458
is a critical part of my job.

357
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:34,083
Wow! Being a princess
sure has its perks!

358
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,375
So, what else is there?

359
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,625
What do you mean?

360
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,833
You know, what else do
you do besides the tea?

361
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:41,458
Like, do you gallantly
throw yourself in harm's way

362
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,416
if she's in danger?

363
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,458
Uh no, just the tea.

364
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:46,458
Oh. Really?
