1
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,958
Come on! Hurry up, you two!

2
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,833
All right.

3
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,583
Ugh! I'm going.

4
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,958
Fam...! Wait for me!

5
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,208
Good afternoon,
fellow citizens...

6
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,958
This shall be a glorious day,
one to be remembered.

7
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,041
May this celebration of peace
and friendship be spoken of

8
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,541
with joy for
generations to come.

9
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,750
We have sworn before
the Grand Lake...

10
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:12,208
From this day forward, let
ours be a world of harmony.

11
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:16,541
And now... Let the
First Grand Race begin.

12
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,541
Yay!

13
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,041
Grand Race... Hurray!

14
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,875
Backward pawn.

15
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,250
Atamora...! Kaiser!

16
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,208
Are you our cheerleaders today?

17
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,000
Mm-hm!

18
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,208
We're countin' on you,

19
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,916
so you better leave 'em
in your dust, okay?

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,125
Who do you think you're
talkin' to, huh?

21
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,875
If you lose you have to
scrub all the toilets

22
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,791
in Kartoffel for an entire year!

23
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,250
I accept those terms,
young lady, but if we win,

24
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,833
you have to start
eating your carrots.

25
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,416
No fair! Carrots are yucky!

26
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,500
Here, Daddy, this is
for you... For good luck.

27
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,666
Thanks!

28
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,166
Do I get one, too?

29
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,125
Yep...! Here's yours, Kaiser.

30
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,458
Ooh! We'll be unbeatable now!

31
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,333
To hell with you people!

32
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,791
Quit acting like
you own this world

33
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,541
just 'cause you and your
kind weren't good enough

34
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,083
to get a ride on an Exile.

35
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,291
Don't give me that...!

36
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,625
It's your people bargin' in,

37
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,416
takin' other folks'
land from them!

38
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,708
Hey, if it's a fight
you're after--

39
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,916
The hell are you...? Let me go!

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,083
Cool it, loudmouth...

41
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,166
Do you wanna sully
this historic day?

42
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,416
What do those guys wanna
go and start a fight for...?

43
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,791
That's the opposite of what
the Grand Race is about.

44
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,208
Everyone will calm
down eventually...

45
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,583
In fact, that's
part of the reason

46
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,750
for holding the event today.

47
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:29,541
Time for the second race of
the final qualifying round.

48
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,333
Marvelous!

49
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,916
Millia.

50
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,375
King Turan, I bid you welcome.

51
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,666
I am so pleased
you could attend.

52
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,208
Augusta FarahnAz.

53
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,625
Today's celebration has been

54
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,208
a truly memorable
experience for all.

55
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,375
We are honored to make
your acquaintance.

56
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,833
It is a pleasure to meet you.

57
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,166
How do you do...?

58
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,666
I'm happy to meet Turan's
adorable princesses.

59
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,916
I'm Liliana, your Highness.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,875
I'm Millia.

61
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm sorry, dear.
Did they startle you?

62
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,708
So, uh... are these
your bodyguards?

63
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,625
Yes. But you needn't fear them.

64
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,041
They are angels
who have come from

65
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,291
the land of the white
sky to protect me.

66
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,916
Angels?

67
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,750
--Kaiser's in the lead!
--Go, Dad!

68
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,833
Come on! Show 'em
what you're made of!

69
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,041
Careful, Fam!

70
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,500
Go! Go-go!

71
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,291
Wow, your dad is awesome.

72
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,250
He's flying the
latest Notos model...

73
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,250
It has twenty percent more
engine power than other ships.

74
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,625
Wow, Gigi...! You're so smart!

75
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,750
Oh! That's an Ades
Federation Heavy Vanship.

76
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,833
People still fly those
clunky old things?

77
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,333
Don't talk like that
about the Shaharz!

78
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,000
Please...! That relic's no
match for our Vanships.

79
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,083
Better watch it,
dirty Sky Pirate.

80
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,666
Now, now, children. Not so fast.

81
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,458
Why don't you try some
treats from Her Majesty?

82
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,541
--Can we have some, too?
--Sure!

83
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,833
All right! Thanks, Ades dude!

84
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,416
See? We're not so bad!

85
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,458
--Awesome!
--Don't hog 'em all!

86
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,708
Hey, now!
There's no need to push.

87
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,291
Indeed, I agree...

88
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,000
By working tirelessly on
negotiations with other lands,

89
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,083
Augusta Farahanaz
has finally been able

90
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,791
to make world peace a reality.

91
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,541
Thanks to her unwavering
conviction and warm soul,

92
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,041
the world has come
together at last...

93
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,125
Not just anyone could have
accomplished what she has.

94
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,083
She is truly a remarkable woman!

95
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,000
What are you two
doing over there?

96
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,625
Is there something the matter?

97
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,041
Millia...

98
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,791
Luscinia... Careful,
you're frightening her.

99
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,208
What should I do, then?

100
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,958
You could try
smiling, for a start.

101
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,708
I see.

102
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,625
Luscinia.

103
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,875
That was a nice attempt...
but it needs some work.

104
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,166
In your next training session,

105
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,000
we'll have to go over
how to smile again.

106
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,958
The history of Vanships
has quite a bit in common

107
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,625
with the history of the world...

108
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,375
Vanships...? How so?

109
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,416
Just look at them, dear...

110
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,083
For years, they were
all so different...

111
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,583
Only now are they beginning
to be standardized...

112
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,416
But today, they
have come here...

113
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,125
all these different Vanships
at this sacred lake...

114
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,458
soaring together
through the same sky.

115
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,333
Fellow citizens of the world,
striving for the same goal...

116
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:21,208
unified by the desire to see
their dreams become reality...

117
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,541
Yes, they'll occasionally
still fight each other...

118
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,916
but there's respect now...

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,666
because they can
see what they share.

120
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,250
My hope is that the people
will see their lives

121
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,458
as an extension of
today's celebration.

122
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,958
Turan's future is
our responsibility...

123
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,833
We'll have to make
certain we work hard, too.

124
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,125
Then I'll study a whole
bunch and get super smart

125
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,708
so I can help you!

126
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,583
Sounds lovely... Thank you.

127
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,791
So that's what
Glaciens look like...

128
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,541
I've never seen one before.

129
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,958
No one said they were
so good looking...

130
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,833
Ooh...! And look at
those girls from Notos!

131
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,500
Come on, Sorush!
We are on duty, you know.

132
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,666
Come on. Nothing's
gonna happen today...

133
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,125
Relax... You should try
observing the beautiful scenery,

134
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,291
like I am...

135
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,583
All these girls!
The Augusta's truly great.

136
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,166
Be quiet...

137
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,791
Do not dare sully the Augusta's
noble ideals with your lechery.

138
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,041
Whoa, whoa, I'm just kidding...

139
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,708
You can be a real prude, Orang.

140
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,291
And you can be a real
loudmouthed fool!

141
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,500
There we have it, folks!

142
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,750
Kaiser and Atamora of Kartoffel
advance to the finals!

143
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,416
Oh, forgive me...
It's an old habit.

144
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Bracelets like that are
used to count prayers,

145
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,416
aren't they, Your Highness?

146
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,458
Yes... although...

147
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,041
For the moment, it serves
a different purpose...

148
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,291
I use it to count all the
sins that I have committed.

149
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,875
Your sins?

150
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,750
Millia?

151
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,916
Last Exile.

152
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,541
I wonder if maybe...

153
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,958
my family might be
here somewhere.

154
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,250
You playing hide-and-seek?

155
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,291
Shh!

156
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,000
--Princess Millia?!
--Princess...?

157
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,750
--That way!
--Right...!

158
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,166
--Princess?
--Hello? Princess!

159
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,333
Don't tell anyone!

160
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,291
Huh? Oh... Why?

161
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,666
Please, just don't!

162
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,875
'Kay!

163
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,291
Hello, little one.

164
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,375
Have you seen a girl about
your age pass this way?

165
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,875
Nope! Sorry.

166
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,833
I see...

167
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,708
--Princess Millia!
--Princess?!

168
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,458
--Please answer us, Princess!
--Oh, do stop hiding!

169
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,708
I think they're gone.

170
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,833
Thank you so much!

171
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,291
These are for you!

172
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,708
So long!

173
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,041
See ya!

174
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:24,083
Yashbal finishes first!
And advances to the finals!

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,750
Your behavior is inexcusable!

176
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,875
Have you any idea how
much you worried everyone,

177
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,458
running off on
your own like that?

178
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,458
But, Lily...

179
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,333
I don't want to hear excuses...

180
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,875
You're a Turan princess,
and you need to act like one.

181
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,541
Do you understand me?

182
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,583
Yes, I'm sorry...

183
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,708
Go easy on her, Liliana...

184
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,375
This is a day of joyous
festivity for all...

185
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,291
Surely you can understand
Millia's desire to make merry.

186
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,750
You pamper her too much, Father.

187
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,625
Princess Liliana...
I think that will be enough.

188
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,291
Your sister seems suitably
regretful of her actions,

189
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,125
don't you think?

190
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,791
Oh... Sorry.

191
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,750
Hurry along. The final
race is about to begin.

192
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,333
Oh yeah...! Right!

193
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,083
Come along, Millia.
Let's go watch.

194
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,208
I, ah...

195
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,500
I thank you, sir.

196
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,916
Right...

197
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,083
Fam! Fam!

198
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,625
Gigi!

199
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,208
Where'd you run off to? The
final race is about to start!

200
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,000
I guess it was pretty silly...
thinking I might find 'em here.

201
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, Fam...

202
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,916
Well... let's grab our seats.

203
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,333
Hey, I almost forgot...! Look!

204
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,750
What is this?

205
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,041
Candy?

206
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,875
It's so pretty!

207
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,375
I was pleased to
see, Luscinia...

208
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,708
that you helped Princess
Liliana without any prompting.

209
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,291
Sadly, he still has
moments of ineptitude.

210
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,500
Alauda.

211
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,875
It is the truth...

212
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,708
Regrettably, Princess
Millia views him

213
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,750
with quite an extreme
degree of fear.

214
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,833
Oh...? Is that what led to
Millia's sudden disappearance?

215
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,875
I apologize.

216
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,041
You think you can act
all high and mighty

217
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,541
just 'cause you
got decent marks?

218
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,208
What is going on, soldier?

219
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,708
Augusta!

220
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,208
She doesn't deserve the honor
of presenting the bouquet.

221
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,583
Chaos good-for-nothing,

222
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,083
she's only alive because of
Your Majesty's kindness.

223
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,416
Be on your way.

224
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,750
Y-Yes, Your Majesty!

225
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,875
Are you all right, miss?

226
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,791
Augusta Farahnaz...

227
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,208
Please, Your Majesty...
I truly respect you...

228
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,416
From the very bottom
of my heart... I do...!

229
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,791
And your cause...!

230
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,791
To unite the world and
end the fighting at last...!

231
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,750
To make peace...!

232
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,166
Please rise.

233
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,791
Thank you, soldier...

234
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,791
I hope you will continue
to lend me your support.

235
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,875
The world will be better for it.

236
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,000
I... yes!

237
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,041
That young soldier
was from Chaos...?

238
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,416
We annexed them so long ago,
yet this still happens?

239
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,375
I am afraid many difficulties
lie on the road ahead.

240
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,791
Even with peace
treaties in place,

241
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,000
the world will still
be far from united.

242
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,458
Until the nations can forget
the pain of bloody wars,

243
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,333
hatred and discrimination
will never fully disappear.

244
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,041
I hope that girl
and those like her

245
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,083
someday live in a
world of acceptance.

246
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:01,416
But we have many
challenges yet to overcome.

247
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,666
You are the very
cornerstone of this world.

248
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,208
While I do appreciate
your ambitions for it...

249
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,125
Majesty... we cannot lose you

250
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,166
in your efforts to achieve
worldwide harmony.

251
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,166
Luscinia is correct in this...

252
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,375
Without you, the world
would be utterly lost...

253
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,875
cast adrift... as would we...

254
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,125
Alas, there is still so much
good work to be done...

255
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,125
and precious little
I can do myself...

256
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,208
Luscinia... Alauda.

257
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:36,750
Please, protect not only me...
but also the world I love.

258
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,541
It is a great honor...
and a great burden.

259
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,041
Augusta Farahnaz!

260
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,791
We came to get you...
Your Highness.

261
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,000
Dad and Kaiser took the lead!

262
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,916
And the winners of the
very first Grand Race

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,791
are Kaiser and
Atamora of Kartoffel!

264
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:37,208
They did it...! See Fam,
I told you Dad would win!

265
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,791
What is it?

266
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,458
Look how happy everyone is.

267
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,083
I'm gonna do this someday.

268
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,291
I'm 'onna fly... and
everyone's gonna smile...

269
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,375
just like they are today.

270
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,833
Everyone...
All the people I know...

271
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,625
And all the people I've
never even met before!

272
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,333
Awesome.

273
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,000
All right!

274
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,333
We won, kids!

275
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,041
--All right! Yay, Dad!
--That was awesome!

276
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,833
Look at this, little one.

277
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,541
My Sara.

278
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,500
There, there.

279
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,625
As winners of the first ever
Grand Race, I congratulate you.

280
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,958
Please accept this trophy.

281
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,500
Atamora...! Kaiser!

282
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,875
These children shoulder the
burden of our world's future.

283
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,666
They shall present
the victory bouquets.

284
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,458
Die, Farahnaz!

285
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,833
Th-Thank you...
for the bouquet...

286
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,000
It was... an... honor.

287
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,125
Kaiser!

288
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,083
Kaiser...! Kaiser!

289
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,208
Ades must pay!

290
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,166
The time for
retribution is at hand!

291
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,416
Stay back, Majesty.

292
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,166
--Father, no!
--Get out of here, Guzel!

293
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,333
Augusta! My lady!

294
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:19,958
My baby!

295
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,625
I've got her!

296
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,875
Atamora...! Kaiser!

297
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:46,541
Fam!

298
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,041
Atamora!

299
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,041
--Take him down!
--Vengeance!

300
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,500
Liliana!

301
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,958
Father...! Father!

302
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,541
I don't understand...!

303
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,291
How could they...? Why?
Why, Your Highness?

304
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,416
Oh...! Your Highness,
are you all right?

305
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,250
You're safe now...
you're safe...

306
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,333
Oh no, Your Highness!

307
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,916
Your Highness!

308
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,583
The dictator is dead...

309
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:52,458
It is done. My people...
you are avenged!

310
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,041
Farahnaz... Your Majesty...

311
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,250
White monster!

312
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,083
Kill you all... Who else?!

313
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,750
Luscinia...

314
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,333
I will protect you,
my lady Sara...

315
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:56,083
I will always keep you safe...
I promise... Always! I swear!

316
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:04,041
I'll kill them all...
Who else...? Who else?!

317
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:08,375
That's enough...
Hush... Luscinia.

318
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,291
Please...! Just let me die!

319
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,500
Let me die with her!

320
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,583
Why?

321
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:20,125
Why now...? Of all days,
how could this happen?

322
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,375
What have we gotten
ourselves into?!

323
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,208
And more importantly,
where are we?

324
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,291
Whoa! Who are you?

325
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,916
What's that language
you're speaking?

326
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,125
Hey! It's totally white outside!
