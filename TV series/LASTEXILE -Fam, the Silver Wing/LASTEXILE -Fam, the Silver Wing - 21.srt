1
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:30,500
Whoa!
Get outta the way!

2
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,625
Whoa--look out!

3
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,125
Quit it, René!

4
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,958
Just wait...! When Gigi gets
back, I'm gonna tell on you!

5
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,916
Gonna tell on you!

6
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,125
It's not the same...

7
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:52,250
I miss 'em... I sure hope
they make it home soon.

8
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:56,541
Uhh... They are comin'
home, aren't they?

9
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,333
Of course they will, Adele...

10
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,500
I know it... Gigi and
Fam will be fine...

11
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,416
The wind's on their side.

12
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:20,416
The Fuchs and the
Frohlich are plummeting.

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,083
How many ships are remaining?

14
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,750
We're down to twenty-five!

15
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,208
All ships, forward...!

16
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,000
The Grand Exile must
not be taken down!

17
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,750
The Silvius is aground!

18
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,041
The Vanship squadron?

19
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,333
They've all departed.

20
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:37,125
Then we have no one left
to help the Silvius...

21
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,750
That changes our focus.

22
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,125
We'll neutralize its main
guns from the inside...!

23
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,833
Forward full!

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,125
News from the infiltration team?

25
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,875
They're still locked in battle!
No recent contact...!

26
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,541
Fam... Giselle, please...

27
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:12,166
So it's you... I'm impressed.

28
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,583
What have you done to her?!

29
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,583
She's simply resting...
She is exhausted, nothing more.

30
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,208
I can assure you,
she is in no danger.

31
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,083
You're lying! How dare you?!

32
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,500
Fam!

33
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,583
The Augusta will
awaken once more...

34
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,291
and this world will
be a changed place.

35
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:37,666
This is wrong...!
It's not what Sara wanted!

36
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,125
She would never use this ship

37
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,416
to cause more
destruction and suffering!

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,916
She would never hurt people!

39
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,333
Damn it, can't shake these guys!

40
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:51,583
Heine?!

41
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,125
It's okay! I'm fine...!

42
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:58,625
Engine and fuel lines
are still green... Go!

43
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,250
We Sky Pirates are
stronger than you think!

44
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,208
There's so many!

45
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,625
Do not break formation.

46
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,791
Let's secure Fam
an escape route!

47
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,708
[in Russian]

48
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,625
I can't take any more of this!

49
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,416
Please, no more...!
No more death!

50
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:53,041
This ship was not actually
built to cause destruction...

51
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,958
In fact...

52
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,958
It was created to
soar through the sky.

53
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,625
Really?

54
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,708
During the Great Cataclysm...

55
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,333
this was centuries
upon centuries ago...

56
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:12,000
the Exiles were built...
so some could flee this world.

57
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,500
Your repatriate ancestors
built these ships...

58
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:21,083
and the people they abandoned,
dreamed of only one thing.

59
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,875
Wings to break free
of this broken world...

60
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,166
and soar freely
through the sky...

61
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,666
An Exile that would
surpass all others.

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,708
Despite everything...
we held fast to that dream.

63
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:42,708
Generation after generation.

64
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:50,166
And you think this Exile is
going to fulfill that dream?

65
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,833
Just look at her...
She's still incomplete...

66
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:58,333
She was abandoned
a long time ago...

67
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,250
They left her, unfinished...
and forgotten.

68
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,083
Indeed.

69
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,791
That's why I'm here...
to see it completed...

70
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:13,166
I have but one goal...
To unify the world...

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,958
to bring lasting peace...
In Sara's name.

72
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,250
Understand...?!
I'll do what I must!

73
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,875
More artillery-loading acoustics
coming from the Grand Exile,

74
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,500
over ten tons again!

75
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:41,500
Target orientation holding at
one-hundred-ninety-one degrees.

76
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:45,500
He's intent on taking out
Turan... Most unfortunate...

77
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,500
...given the Silvius'
current immobility.

78
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,666
All hands, brace
for impact, now...!

79
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,541
Ready bow-mounted cannons
and back us out, full reverse!

80
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,708
Fire!

81
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,916
Forward guns operational!

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,083
Secondary lateral guns ready!

83
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,333
You heard 'em.

84
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,833
Go flanking speed...!
Catch up with the fleet!

85
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,916
Let's take out the
Grand Exile's artillery!

86
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,958
With the power of
the Grand Exile,

87
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,416
Premier Luscinia will bring
peace unto this world...

88
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,083
And our task is to
pave the way for him!

89
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,500
Gloria, Augusta!

90
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,708
It's true. The Premier's
method will undoubtedly produce

91
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,000
the quickest results...

92
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,541
Oh, well...

93
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,750
Guess I'm still too wet behind
the ears to know any better.

94
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,708
Output dropping!

95
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,625
We've lost artillery battery B!

96
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,791
Third and Fourth Squads
have fallen away...

97
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,708
Unable to maintain formation!

98
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,666
There comes a point
when you must realize

99
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,666
that life is about more than
blindly following orders.

100
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,583
What we do now, we do
for Augusta Sara...

101
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,208
Don't give up...!
All ships, charge!

102
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,541
Gloria, Augusta!
Gloria, Augusta!

103
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,833
Your dream of another
Grand Race is noble...

104
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,875
However... as I am
certain you are aware...

105
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,958
Not even Augusta Farahnaz
could realize that dream...

106
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,291
Ideals alone cannot
change this world.

107
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, I know... I know that.

108
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,916
This is the real world...

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,875
and things aren't as simple
as we want them to be.

110
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,625
You can't just chase
after your dreams...

111
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,500
Blind faith will
do nothing for you.

112
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,583
I... I know that now!

113
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,666
But still...

114
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,416
It's my dream...
and I will chase it!

115
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,875
How can I not...?

116
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,250
The Grand Race has always
been what's guided me.

117
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,791
It's my singular wish...

118
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:58,625
And it's kept me aloft
when nothing else could.

119
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,375
It was a gift...

120
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,041
given to me by the brave people

121
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,083
who made that first
Grand Race a reality.

122
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,208
Don't you see...?!
I will never stop flying!

123
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,000
Fire time-delay torpedoes!

124
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,041
We'll use the ship as a shield!

125
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,750
Let's clear a path for
the Empress Sophia.

126
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,000
Concentrate all our fire
on the enemy cannon!

127
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,333
I'm right... they're not
offensive weapons...

128
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,291
So what are they?

129
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:56,708
What now? Should we try to
make a temporary retreat?

130
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,458
Fam will bring Sara out...
I know she will.

131
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,750
All right then... Train all
guns on their interior walls!

132
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,875
Draw the tentacles'
attention to us! Fire!

133
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,250
Maybe you're right.

134
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:30,291
Maybe all my hopes and dreams
will fall apart like last time.

135
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,500
Maybe nothing will change...

136
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,083
Maybe all the hatred
and sorrow will continue.

137
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:46,708
Even if that happens,
I will keep flying.

138
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,708
Because I know... eventually...

139
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,666
someone will make
the dream come true.

140
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,958
I admit, I'm glad you came.

141
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:34,375
Where I'm going...
she cannot accompany me.

142
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,875
It is time.

143
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,625
Last Exile.

144
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,625
Something's blowing
apart on the enemy hull!

145
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,791
Coming from near the gun
that's about to fire!

146
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,041
What's happening?!

147
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,625
It's now spreading
throughout the entire ship

148
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,458
at tremendous speed.

149
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,250
I had it all wrong...
Those aren't guns...

150
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,875
They're enormous
propulsion engines.

151
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,625
Ah... that's what it's about.

152
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,333
You wanted to take
everyone into the sky...

153
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:28,375
So... You readied your
multitude of wings...

154
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,000
But sadly... it was
never meant to be.

155
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,000
Anyone know what the heck is
going on with this monstrosity?!

156
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,250
We've done all we can.

157
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,666
Damn... Everyone, follow me out.

158
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,541
Grand Exile structural
collapse at twenty...

159
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,708
twenty eight percent...!

160
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,791
Destruct-sequence accelerating.

161
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:12,458
Admiral! Our ships are
requesting your orders!

162
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,916
All hands... abandon ship.

163
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,291
We've reached the
end of our era...

164
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,583
All ships...
disarm immediately...

165
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,583
Obey the Joint Forces orders.

166
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,833
But, Admiral...!

167
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,166
It's what the Premier
himself wishes...

168
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,625
He issued these instructions
before he departed.

169
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,333
Guzel... please... I have
one favor yet to ask of you.

170
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,000
Sir?

171
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,791
Take this... Get it
to my granddaughter.

172
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,291
You knew this was
going to happen...

173
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,875
You knew from
the very beginning.

174
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,666
Luscinia!

175
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,541
No, wait...! Come with us!

176
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:21,583
For Sara! She doesn't want this!
She doesn't want anyone to die!

177
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,791
It will be all right...

178
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,458
Liliana said she didn't regret
the hand fate had dealt her...

179
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,458
having been born
as an Exile key.

180
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,750
Alauda and I feel
the same way...

181
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,333
Take care of Maestro Sara.

182
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,416
Luscinia!

183
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,791
Let's go!

184
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:48,166
After all this... all the
sadness and death!

185
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:54,125
Can't you at least take some
responsibility?! Luscinia!

186
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,833
Fam, we gotta go now!

187
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,666
Falling debris has increased
the load on our keel

188
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,666
by seventy percent...
We can't take much more!

189
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,083
Where's the rescue team?

190
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,250
Reports say they're
on their way out now.

191
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,833
And Sara?!

192
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:18,500
Still no word that the Augusta
has been successfully retrieved.

193
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,708
Fam...

194
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,375
Grand Exile descending!

195
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,916
Roughly two-point-five minutes
of operational altitude.

196
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,583
--It's the Senapati!
--What?!

197
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,958
Orang... follow!

198
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,791
Right, Sorush...

199
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,583
All ships, follow the Senapati.
Let's make a run for it!

200
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,750
We can't wait for the Augusta's
rescue team any longer...

201
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,375
Engines to max!

202
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,916
Take us away from the Exile!

203
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,708
I'm sorry.
Engines to max... now!

204
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,083
Straight for ten
seconds, then right!

205
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,291
Roger!

206
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,541
Liliana...

207
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,375
Were we right...?
Will the world change...?

208
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,041
Truly change...?
As we hoped it would?

209
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,708
Fam...

210
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,583
This engine's acoustic...
It's Fam!

211
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,041
Light signal from the Vespa...

212
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,250
"The Augusta has been
safely rescued!"

213
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,666
They're... back!

214
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,416
They did pretty well, huh?

215
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,083
The Augusta is safe!

216
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,625
Augusta... Thank goodness.

217
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,166
Hey, ya pulled
it off, Birdbrain!

218
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,125
Way to go!

219
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,875
Yeah, Fam...! Gigi!

220
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,416
Her sixteenth Skyfish sure
turned out to be a big one, huh?

221
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,708
Yeah.

222
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,666
Fam...! Giselle!

223
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,625
Sara! Sara!

224
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,750
You're awake.

225
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:55,166
What's going on...?
Where are we?

226
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,708
Sara!

227
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:03,375
Where's Vasant...? And
Luscinia...? Where are they?!

228
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,958
Please, Fam!
Where are they? Tell me!

229
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,708
So you're sure this
is all of them?

230
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,166
You aren't hiding any other
ships, I hope?

231
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,708
What, you don't trust us...?

232
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,500
Ades is completely on
board with disarmament.

233
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,875
Aw yeah...

234
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,750
...these guys use some
really great Claudia units.

235
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,291
Bet we can get a lot for 'em.

236
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,250
C'mon! Quit slacking,
you old geezers...!

237
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,250
Look out, comin' through!

238
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,833
There's still so much to do!

239
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,875
I wonder what we can
build with these Units.

240
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,166
I hear Turan's started using
'em for power generators.

241
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,583
With this sacred water,
drawn from the

242
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,250
blue depths of the Hole,
source of the Grand Lake,

243
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,708
I hereby celebrate and bear
witness to this covenant.

244
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,166
Please, allow me.

245
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,500
We have a pact...
among member nations...

246
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
We will coexist harmoniously...

247
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,500
We'll strive to uphold peace...
so that everyone may prosper.

248
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,666
After all these years,

249
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,750
the world is finally moving
in the right direction.

250
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,458
It is--because we're
all working together...

251
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,875
Although...
a number of Ades citizens

252
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,958
still seem to be
a bit anxious...

253
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,375
Orang... can I count
on you to help them?

254
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,833
Yes, Gloria, Augusta.

255
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,500
It's reassuring to have
you as our mediator...

256
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,625
I know you'll do well,
Premier Orang.

257
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,958
I will serve...

258
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,666
but it is Sorush who
should be filling this role.

259
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,041
But he...

260
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,833
Maybe I should learn
how to fly a Vespa.

261
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,833
That could be quite diverting.

262
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,791
You'd appreciate that,
Vasant... wouldn't you?

263
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,083
Young lady, I have
something for you.

264
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,458
What is it?

265
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,208
She looks just like you!

266
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,500
But, who...?

267
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,000
It's from Admiral Sadri...

268
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,291
He wanted his
granddaughter to have it.

269
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,416
Sadri...?

270
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,500
But... but I... I thought...
I broke his foot!

271
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,208
Fam...

272
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,208
Fam, what's the matter?

273
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,875
Hey, don't cry!

274
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,666
There's so much
we could've talked about...

275
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,750
questions I could've asked,
like about my mom...

276
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,500
So many potato pancakes
we could've shared...!

277
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,375
Luscinia...

278
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,375
I think that...
maybe you loved Lily.

279
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,166
Ah-ha...! There she is!

280
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,041
What are you doin'
out here, Dyan?

281
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,375
Fam?

282
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,958
How am I supposed to
brag about winning the race

283
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,416
if you don't even
compete in it...?

284
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,875
Now, come on.
You need to get ready.

285
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,875
Quit shoving her around!

286
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,666
If you don't have a ship,
you can borrow one of ours.

287
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,125
You remember...
I know you do...

288
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,791
The feeling of
the wind in your face!

289
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,375
The... wind?

290
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,875
Don't think
you'll beat us, though.

291
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah...!

292
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,208
Now... I won't take
no for an answer!

293
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,708
Wait up!

294
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,750
Claus...! Lavie!

295
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,916
Hi, Al!

296
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,666
See...? I told you
they were interesting.

297
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,791
I told ya, we're
all gonna be in it!

298
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,958
Will you never give up?

299
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,541
Fam!

300
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,541
D'you think...
that I'll ever fly again?

301
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,291
Immelman...

302
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,750
Of course you will, silly!

303
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,208
We'll all fly together...
right, Dio?

304
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,708
Yeah... Sure will!

305
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,750
Fam...! Giselle!

306
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,125
Good luck out there!

307
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,916
Careful, Princess!

308
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:42,625
Hey! Thanks!
We got this, just watch!

309
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,083
Oh...? You do?

310
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:47,791
Dyan!

311
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,500
Just leave us alone!

312
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,916
Well...? Ready, Luciola?

313
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,958
Everyone...!
At last, it's time...!

314
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:11,041
Welcome to the
Second Grand Race!

315
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,708
People of the world...
Thank you...

316
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,583
It's because of you
all of this is possible...

317
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,625
It's a day of joy!
