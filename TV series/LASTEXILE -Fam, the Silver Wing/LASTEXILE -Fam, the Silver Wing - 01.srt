1
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:40,125
Gigi... Gigi...

2
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,125
You're not gonna answer me...?

3
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,916
All right... I guess
I'll just have to come in.

4
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,666
Fam!

5
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:09,000
Fam...! Hey, Fam!
You okay down there?

6
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,916
Yep... Wide awake now!

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,500
Check it out, Gigi! I can
almost touch the clouds!

8
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,041
How many times is this now?

9
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,666
Six or... seven this month?

10
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,458
Since you're havin'
so much fun down there,

11
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,958
we can just leave ya!

12
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:27,875
Wha--huh...? Aw, maaan!

13
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,625
Open file.

14
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,291
Distance to capture site,
one-twenty. Maintain course!

15
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,458
Careful, it's only
calm on the surface...

16
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,541
The target is being drifted.

17
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,083
Adjust heading three
degrees starboard.

18
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,583
A spout!

19
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,916
And now a tail flap.

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,458
She just confirmed her
position... She's going down!

21
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,291
No way, we're gonna intercept
'er... Now gimme twenty!

22
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,291
Pushing twenty ticks... Done!

23
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,125
Hey...! Shouldn't you
be heading out?

24
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,458
♪ ...get happy...!
Happy when you're born...! ♪

25
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,875
♪ Happy when you're 
old and gray! ♪

26
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:03,791
You're not gettin' away.
First harpoon is so mine.

27
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,583
And fire!

28
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,916
Claudia rotor is down!
Thrust decreased fifty percent!

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,458
This can't be happening...!

30
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,791
I'm going to be late for
mother's celebration...!

31
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,750
--This is awful!
--Signal light spotted, Captain.

32
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,458
Message:

33
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,125
"Hey... creepy... pervert..."

34
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,833
"Creepy pervert?!"

35
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:39,708
"Only a complete coward would...
turn tail... and run now."

36
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,208
"I will tell... this story
in... every port...

37
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,083
The whole world--will know...

38
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,291
exactly... how much of
a total chicken you are."

39
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,416
"Hope you like it!"
Jeez, you're harsh!

40
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,375
No, I'm not...!
It was your idea, Fam!

41
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:59,125
Damn Sky Pirates...!
Blow that Vespa outta the sky!

42
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,833
Incoming!

43
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,166
Five.

44
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,000
Four.

45
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,791
Three. Two. One!

46
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,375
Breach!

47
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,208
That's one Skyfish, in the bag!

48
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,500
It's Dad!

49
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,208
Please.

50
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,833
We're getting a signal.

51
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,708
--Read it.
--Right.

52
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,500
"You... brainless... oaf,
don't you dare go scuffing...

53
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,000
up... my prey."

54
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,583
Sure is blunt, huh?

55
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,875
Yeah... you get used to it.

56
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,125
Ah... you've made
the return journey, too.

57
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,458
"The place where all are born...

58
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,750
The place where
all will return."

59
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,708
"A blue world."

60
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,208
O, Grand Lake...! Sacred sea!

61
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,583
Everlasting water
of righteousness!

62
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,833
We, the people of Turan,

63
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,875
are thankful for your
graciousness... and...

64
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,125
we come before you
in humble prayer.

65
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,041
We ask that you
bless the water...

66
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,666
the wind... and the earth
upon which we live.

67
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,833
That we may continue to
receive their great bounty.

68
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,250
Lily!

69
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,375
What are you doing, Millia...?

70
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,166
Your dress is going
to be soaked through.

71
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,291
These are the sacred
waters of the Grand Lake.

72
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,416
To be soaked in them is
to receive its blessing.

73
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,666
Princess Lily...!
Princess Millia...!

74
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,500
You'll both catch cold!

75
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,833
Oww...

76
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,958
Teddy...! You are unbelievable!

77
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,541
Pl-Please do
forgive me, Princess!

78
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,041
Honestly...! You are a servant
of a Turan princess...!

79
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,750
Pull yourself together.

80
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,541
R-Right!

81
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,291
Come now. Didn't you just finish
telling me it's a blessing

82
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,208
to be soaked in the sacred
waters of the Grand Lake?

83
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,208
It's different when someone
else is doing the soaking.

84
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,625
This place... is
always so beautiful.

85
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,500
So peaceful ...

86
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,166
It is sacred even to them...

87
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,208
and that's saying something...
given the Federation has...

88
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,416
a penchant for
utter destruction...

89
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,541
These peace talks are
out of character...

90
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,750
Something's not right.

91
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,750
Millia.

92
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,250
Just think...!

93
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,583
How many people have already
died? All because of them?!

94
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,083
It's time... We have to go.

95
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,208
Fam! You're back!

96
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,250
Yep!

97
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,416
Hey, Sis... welcome home.

98
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,708
Thanks. I should
probably get cooking.

99
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,750
Yay...! Fam's home!

100
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,375
Sure am, Adele, hi.

101
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,625
Didja get First Harpoon
again today, Fam?

102
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,666
You bet!

103
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,666
[stomach growls]

104
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,333
Your tummy's loud!

105
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,625
How's potato pancakes?

106
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,875
Sounds perfect, yeah!

107
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,500
Dio! You ditched
work again. Come on!

108
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,291
Fam...! You were
amazing out there!

109
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,458
Zee-room...! Vroww...! Bam!

110
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,583
I'm serious!

111
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,041
Do something around
here for once

112
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,708
instead'a bein'
a useless mooch!

113
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,625
Yeah, mooch, get to work!

114
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,000
Sure thing.

115
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,541
Why don't I believe you?!

116
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,625
Oh, and you might not
wanna relax just yet...

117
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,875
Heh... You're going to
have a busy day today.

118
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,166
You have more work too?

119
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,833
Remind me, what's
today's schedule?

120
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,416
Well, we caught that Skyfish,

121
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,708
so we have the rest
of the day off...

122
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,125
Tomorrow's busier though.

123
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,625
We have laundry and
potato-planting duty.

124
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,083
Yeah, thought so.

125
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,166
--C'mon... Hold still!
--Nice!

126
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,250
Don't wanna!

127
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,416
What's this...?

128
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
"Turan Kingdom and
Ades Federation

129
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,458
to finalize peace treaty.

130
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,875
The signing will take place at
noon today by the Grand Lake."

131
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,041
Hopefully this'll end
the Federations' invasions

132
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,083
for a while...

133
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,041
Things'd be so much
more peaceful.

134
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,500
Is what I heard really true...?

135
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,458
That the king of Turan
is gravely ill...

136
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,958
so the two princesses
are ruling in his place?

137
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,333
Yeah...

138
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,250
And you know, the younger
one, Princess Millia...

139
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,250
she's the same age as us!

140
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,041
Can you imagine it Fam...?

141
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,833
To be so pretty... and smart?

142
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,916
I dunno, doesn't sound
all that great to me...

143
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,541
Talk about restrictive!

144
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,125
Oh, I wouldn't worry...

145
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,250
You're probably the last person
anybody would make a princess.

146
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,208
Hey! What exactly do
you mean by that...?

147
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,916
--Sorry!
--Gigi!

148
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,541
So many Skyfish!
What's goin' on?

149
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,958
One hundred thirty-five
miles to the west.

150
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,458
But that's the Grand Lake!

151
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,875
Oh my gosh, the peace treaty!

152
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,208
Gigi...! We're takin'
first harpoon.

153
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,500
Right.

154
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,541
May the wind carry
your wings, Fam!

155
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,208
We're on it! Good
tailwinds, guys!

156
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,041
What's taking so long?

157
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,750
Maybe he overslept...?

158
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,041
Oh wait, of course he didn't!
No, that's ridiculous!

159
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,375
That's right, Teddy...

160
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,458
This is Premier Luscinia
of the Ahdiss Federation,

161
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,666
not some irresponsible
young servant.

162
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,250
Right... Sorry, Princess!

163
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,000
Here... Take my hand.

164
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,750
Lily...! Lily, look!
Do you hear me?

165
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,416
They're blotting
out the whole sky!

166
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,166
I... I'm so scared!

167
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,250
I'm certain there's
nothing to worry about.

168
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,625
The Federation considers
the Grand Lake sacred,

169
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,958
just as we do...

170
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,166
To go to war in this place
would be to defile it.

171
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,458
But, Sister...!

172
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,000
We are here for a mutually
beneficial dialogue.

173
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,708
There will be no negotiation.
It is time for action...

174
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:21,375
The Ades Federation declares
war... Turan must perish.

175
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,916
All forces, proceed
without hesitation.

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,250
Gloria!

177
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,375
On, to the royal city...!
On, to Iglasia!

178
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:35,375
Gloria! Gloria! Gloria!
Gloria! Gloria! Gloria!

179
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:40,333
Gloria! Gloria!
Gloria! Gloria!

180
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,750
Last Exile.

181
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,875
Looks like they're
starting a war.

182
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,666
The Ades Federation
has betrayed Turan!

183
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,916
The peace talks were
nothing but a ruse!

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,083
Gigi! Look at that!

185
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,125
They call it "The
Winged Maiden"...

186
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,000
Turan's flagship. The Lasas!

187
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,000
Take the princesses alive!
As for the rest, kill them all!

188
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,458
Okay, get a signal
tube and flares ready.

189
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,708
Message?

190
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,958
Target this operation
is the Turan flagship.

191
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,208
Seven blues, five blacks.

192
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,541
Really?!

193
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,833
Really... I've decided
I'm gonna steal that ship.

194
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,291
Multiple Vanships detected!

195
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:41,166
Sky Pirates... Swarming
like the vultures you are.

196
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,541
First harpoon!

197
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,666
Light signal spotted,

198
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,750
from what appears to be
a Sky Pirate vanship.

199
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,875
"Attention... We are
commandeering your flagship...

200
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,416
We'll take her to safety...
but then she is ours."

201
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,541
They're going to help
us escape the battle...

202
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,250
in exchange for the Lasas.

203
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,875
Utter nonsense...!
Filthy Sky Pirates!

204
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,833
"That's our deal...
The choice is yours to make...

205
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,583
Die here... or survive
with the Sky Pirates."

206
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,875
Response signal...! Three
short... one long... two short.

207
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,625
What...? You're not serious!

208
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,500
If we remain here,
we'll likely die...

209
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,041
Then who'll be left
to look after Turan?

210
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:31,791
Fam.

211
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:32,833
Controls are yours.

212
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,291
'Kay, got it.

213
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,083
They're agreeing to our terms!

214
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,625
I love it when people
see things my way.

215
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,291
A girl?!

216
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,916
'Kay, done deal.

217
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,458
She's quite the pilot.

218
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,458
You really think she'll
do what you told her?

219
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,458
She'll pull through for us.

220
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,750
'Kay!

221
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,041
Is that seven blue, five black?!

222
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,250
Man...!
That's Birdbrain for you...

223
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,833
I swear she gets
crazier by the day.

224
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,208
Well, you know her... She
loves to go for the big hauls!

225
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,291
Let's move!

226
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,750
May the wind carry your wings!

227
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,333
Good tailwinds, guys!

228
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,291
Let's do this!

229
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,125
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

230
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,541
The law of the sky says First
Harpoon calls the shots...

231
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,541
Start makin' preparations, men.
We got huntin' to do!

232
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,750
Right...! And Good Tailwinds!

233
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,375
Atamora...!
Open the hatch, quick!

234
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,875
All right... Let's see
what fun awaits.

235
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,333
Zooooom!

236
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,375
No... Preposterous... We can't
go through with this...!

237
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,166
Commence countdown once blue
signal light is sighted...

238
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,000
All hands, prepare to strap in!

239
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,958
Wait! Are you sure?

240
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,166
'Kay guys...! You all know
what to do, let's move in!

241
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,000
Roger that, First Harpoon!

242
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,708
Your wish is our command.

243
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,958
Yoo-hoo!

244
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,333
Dio?!

245
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,833
--Good tailwinds!
--Hey...!

246
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,708
You better not forget
I got first harpoon!

247
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,791
It seems unlikely,

248
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,958
but have the Sky Pirates
teamed up with Turan?

249
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,458
Forget them...

250
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,250
Whatever they're up to, they
won't escape our siege net.

251
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,125
Confirm all ships' positions...

252
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,125
They're to cease
all other activity...

253
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,208
New orders: follow
the flagship's signals.

254
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,291
Aye, sir!

255
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,375
Immelmann... Turn!

256
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,375
Awesome!

257
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,291
Whatever... I could do that.

258
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,458
All this smoke is
effectively blinding us.

259
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,208
Signal from the flagship.
"SB-One-Five.

260
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,041
All ships commence fire
on yellow signal light."

261
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,541
Right...! Fifteen to
starboard... Prepare to fire!

262
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,625
Fifteen to starboard!

263
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,833
Fire!

264
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,791
Heavy damage to ships three
and four of second squadron...

265
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,958
the entire third
squadron as well!

266
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,833
Pirate scum...!
Using our signals against us!

267
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,208
"Forty-five degrees left.

268
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,875
Elevation, ten. Range,
thirty-eight thousand."

269
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,583
All guns, fire!

270
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,125
"Consort ship at SB twenty-five.

271
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,208
Request fire at P-Fifteen
on white signal."

272
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,625
We might actually win!

273
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,375
This is pure insanity!

274
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,750
Captain, dead slow ahead
through the smoke...

275
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,833
Stand by for the next
signal upon arrival...

276
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,791
Coordinates W-Zero-Five.

277
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,916
Send emergency flares
to all ships...

278
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,125
"Be aware of false
enemy signals."

279
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,458
Ship Six rapidly approaching,
sir! She's attacking head-on!

280
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,708
Pathetic...! You call yourselves
soldiers of the Augusta?

281
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,875
Claudia engines three
through six are down.

282
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,250
Main rudder damaged!

283
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,416
Damage to armor
plating in sections

284
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,583
twenty-five through forty-one.

285
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,500
Distance three miles
at eleven o'clock.

286
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,583
Lasas is above lake.
Elevation, five hundred.

287
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,875
All aircraft, open fire!

288
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,000
Blue signal spotted, Princess!

289
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,541
Good, commence countdown!

290
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,875
All hands...! Ready
for evasive maneuvers!

291
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,083
But, Sister!

292
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,833
Ahoy, everyone!

293
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,833
Okay... You might want to hold
onto something right about now.

294
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,500
Wha-... who are--?

295
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,000
And...

296
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,791
Turrrn!

297
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,083
Clear number four depth charge
and all the smoke bombs.

298
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,583
Fire everything!

299
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,083
You don't give the
orders around here!

300
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,541
Sophia and your king said
I could do whatever I want,

301
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,166
so I beg to differ!

302
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,750
That's ridiculous!

303
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,416
What?!

304
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,708
Full power to main thrusters!

305
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,416
All right, now let's
blow off the top-wing!

306
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:05,208
They... They scuttled...
their ship?!

307
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,666
Report from Viceroy Kayvan
of the Second Fleet.

308
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,083
The Turan flagship has
crashed into the Grand Lake

309
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:18,166
of her own accord and
is completely submerged.

310
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,666
He believes Princesses
Liliana and Millia

311
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,125
have met the same fate as
their ship: a watery grave.

312
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,833
And what do you
believe... Alauda?

313
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,750
Premier... I am,
as always, your servant.

314
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,458
In other words, only what you
have seen with your own eyes.

315
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,916
Yes.

316
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,583
That was a brilliant strategy.

317
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,833
On behalf of all Turan,
I offer our heartfelt gratitude.

318
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,625
Don't thank me...
Thank your generous crew...

319
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,041
They let me cast off all her
beautiful wings for this plan.

320
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,750
While my sister may not have any
qualms with you and your people,

321
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,791
I refuse to accept any of this.

322
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,125
Yeah whatever...

323
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,125
I wasn't the one who
thought this whole thing up.

324
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,375
Fam was.

325
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,750
Fam?

326
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,083
Oh, wow! Check it...!
We got real-life princesses!

327
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,125
Hey Gigi, I'll get
you their autographs!

328
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,291
No, Fam...! Please don't!
I'm begging...!

329
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,875
--Please... don' do it...
--Why the heck not?

330
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:20,500
Wha--... Who do you think
you are? Have you no manners?

331
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,833
Filthy Sky Pirate...

332
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,375
Enough, Millia.

333
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,000
Even as we speak, Luscinia's
fleet of ships draws ever nearer

334
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,416
to our beloved Turan
and its capital city.

335
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
We've no time to waste.

336
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,083
Begin inspections and
repairs at once...!

337
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,458
As soon as we can, we're
taking what's left of our fleet

338
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,791
to the royal city of Iglasia!

339
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,375
We will fight.

340
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,166
We will stop Luscinia Hafez.

341
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,708
Hmm.. maybe "Fam the Great?"

342
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,250
--What?
--Oh, hey, Gigi.

343
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,166
I'm trying to come up with a
new name for the Turan flagship.

344
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,625
How about "Glorious"?

345
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,916
Excuse me! Our illustrious
flagship already has a name.

346
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,166
It's the Lasas.

347
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,875
That's what you called it,
but it's ours now.

348
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,208
"The Flagship Fam!"

349
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,041
Don't be ridiculous!
The Lasas is the Lasas!

350
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,416
"The Fam Voyager!"

351
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,125
Are you even listening?!

352
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,916
Please calm down,
Princess Millia!

353
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,666
Yeah, I guess just
"The Fam Fan Fan."
