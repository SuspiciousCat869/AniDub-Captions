1
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,041
The White Legacy...

2
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,958
Weak square.

3
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,958
Keep moving, vermin.
You are enemies of the people.

4
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,541
These traitors forsook their
homelands for personal gain...

5
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,708
Their selfish actions have
hindered our sacred crusade.

6
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,958
Who knows how many fields
could've been planted

7
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,583
with the money these
so-called leaders

8
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,458
greedily leached from
their own people?

9
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,541
However, they have
been stopped...

10
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,583
and punished in a manner
befitting their crimes.

11
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,166
And now, no one can
deny our resolve.

12
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,958
We have shown it for all to see.

13
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,250
A clear path lies before us.

14
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,958
All of this world's fertile
lands shall be ours once again.

15
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,916
Our forces continue
to push forward,

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,750
beyond the northern reaches
of the sacred Grand Lake.

17
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,250
Soon they shall reach your
former homeland of Glacies...

18
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,750
and the returnees who
have stolen it from you.

19
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,333
My people! Let us retake
our land together!

20
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,750
Gloria... Augusta!

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,208
That was a magnificent
address...

22
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,750
You must be exhausted...

23
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,375
Perhaps you should
get some rest.

24
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,458
They're all dead...
all of those people...

25
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,916
and it's because... of me!

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,666
You mustn't say that.

27
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,666
I am so young... and weak...

28
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,250
That's what killed them.
So many.

29
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,666
That's not true, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,291
Please believe me
when I tell you that

31
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,750
none of this
is your fault...

32
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,750
They were undone
by their own greed!

33
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,541
I'm supposed to protect
the people, it's my duty...!

34
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,333
A good ruler doesn't harm her
subjects, she earns their trust.

35
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,500
Like my mother!

36
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry.

37
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,583
Your Majesty,
I'm here for you...

38
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,916
Do not ever forget that...

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,166
I will always see
your will be done.

40
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,416
We've stamped out most of
the resistance movements...

41
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,875
We've also begun collecting
capital in territories

42
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,250
owned by the surrendered nobles.

43
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,708
Good work... We owe this
success to your swift action...

44
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,333
The Almighty Spear of
Ades triumphs again.

45
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,375
You are too kind, Premier.

46
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,833
We shall not be attacked
from behind, now...

47
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,458
Our obstacles are melting
away... soon the last will fall.

48
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,375
And finally we'll be
able to move forward.

49
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,083
The Grand Lake's
southern coast will be

50
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,791
under our complete
control before long...

51
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,291
The next step will be taking
the battle northward...

52
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,750
and beginning full-scale efforts

53
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,125
to reclaim the Lake's
northern coast.

54
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,708
Kumari, Arshia,
and Sepehr, yes...

55
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,750
all three should yield
quickly enough...

56
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,708
They are small nations.

57
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,250
Vasant's negotiations
were effective...

58
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,541
I doubt anyone will offer
much resistance... except...

59
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,416
Except Glacies.

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,416
We can safely assume
the Federation will now

61
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,458
turn its attention
north of the Grand Lake.

62
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,166
When that happens, they'll
come to blows with Glacies...

63
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,833
They'll have to.

64
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,250
Will it be a head-on
confrontation?

65
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,416
Most likely.

66
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,333
Glacies has remained
totally independent

67
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,041
since the moment
it was founded...

68
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,458
I'm sure they don't even notice

69
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,041
when the Federation usurps
other territories...

70
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,375
But I expect it will be a
completely different story

71
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,291
when it's their land
being threatened.

72
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,291
In many ways, they're even more
trouble than the Federation.

73
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,833
They refuse any and all
negotiations and attack

74
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,375
the moment somebody
crosses over their border...

75
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,000
They don't put much
stock in the idea

76
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,375
that your enemy's enemy
can be your friend.

77
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,333
Which means our future
is going to be determined

78
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,291
by whatever action
Glacies chooses to take.

79
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,958
I suppose all we can do for now

80
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,958
is trust in Vincent's
ability to bargain.

81
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,250
Perhaps we should do
some preliminary recon.

82
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,750
Lay in a new course...

83
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,750
Head for the Glacies border.

84
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,958
How's the tea? Teddy taught me.

85
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:21,958
Listen up, lad.

86
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,583
Germs and vermin
are always lookin'

87
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,458
to infiltrate
your territory...

88
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,333
You gotta keep a sharp eye.

89
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,041
Aye-aye, sir!

90
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,750
But I'm telling you, this is
the perfect chance for us!

91
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,958
Don't talk with your
mouth full... It's rude.

92
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,375
These purges they've
started carrying out

93
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,500
are gonna make the
Federation even stronger...

94
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,166
Come on... This is
a huge opportunity...!

95
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,083
We need to take advantage
of it while we can.

96
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,958
You see, as the nobles
are being purged,

97
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,958
the battleships belonging
to their territories

98
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,208
are being captured and taken
back to the Ades Federation...

99
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,708
That's the most
notable extraction.

100
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,083
That fleet is being transported

101
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,041
from the northern
land of Fields...

102
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,625
It consists of eight
brand-new ships,

103
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,541
constructed
only six months ago.

104
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,291
Eight ships...?

105
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,041
But the agreement only
calls for one more.

106
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,416
True... But Fam thinks...

107
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,000
I think we should go
all-out for this last run...

108
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,791
Imagine the look on the
Captain's face if we succeed...

109
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,708
She'll never be expecting
eight ships at once!

110
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,958
That would be quite
a sight to behold.

111
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,291
Oh, no. Not you too?

112
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,041
All right, that settles it...

113
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,250
We're gonna show Captain
Tatiana what we're made of!

114
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,916
Thank you for the book.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,375
Oh... finished with it already?

116
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,416
Yes.

117
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,875
All of it...?

118
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,000
Even including "A Summary
of Signal Lights and Flares

119
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,041
per the Trans-Grand
Lake Treaty?"

120
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,375
Yes... I found it
most informative.

121
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,625
It sounds like you won't be
needing my guidance anymore...

122
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,000
It's all yours...

123
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,416
Delve into whatever
subjects pique your interest.

124
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,916
So, um... Now that
I've done the research,

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,666
I hoped you would tell
me the best strategy

126
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,708
for destroying an entire
Ahdes fleet single-handedly.

127
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,375
I meant it when I told you
there was no such thing...

128
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,291
Fighting boils
down to resources:

129
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,333
yours and your enemy's.

130
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,666
Giselle.

131
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,166
Gathering information
for your mission?

132
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,791
Yeah... there are still some
things I'm uneasy about.

133
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,125
That's very sensible...

134
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,375
Fam could learn a thing
or two from you.

135
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,416
Not really...
Fam's fine the way she is...

136
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,750
Background research is
just part of the job...

137
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,250
It's my duty as her navi.

138
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,958
We can't afford to
fail this operation...

139
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,083
Ades is gonna keep getting
stronger and stronger...

140
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,541
Hunting Skyfish won't
be so easy anymore...

141
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,583
Not like it was.

142
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,375
Please, Giselle...

143
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,833
I just need your help
for a bit longer...

144
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,708
I'll put Fam's fleet
to good use, I swear...

145
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,500
With it, I will reclaim Turan.

146
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,708
I will make your dream real.
There will be a new Race.

147
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,166
A flock of Grand Birds...!

148
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
What's that? You wanna race?

149
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,250
All right, you're on...!

150
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,625
Let the second Grand Race
qualifiers begin!

151
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,625
So, Fam...

152
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,208
Yeah?

153
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,208
At the end of today, we'll have
the fifteen ships we agreed to.

154
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,375
Have you thought about
what we'll do next?

155
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,208
Next, huh...?

156
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,250
If we've met our quota, we won't
need to stay on the Silvius...

157
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,291
We can go back to Kartoffel.

158
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,750
I'm worried about
Adele and René.

159
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,541
Félicité isn't old
enough to help Mom

160
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,625
with the younger ones so much...
and you know my dad...

161
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,541
He's practically helpless
when he's not in the sky...

162
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,041
I mean... don't you miss
Fritz and the others, too?

163
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,291
Yeah...! Don't you miss us?

164
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,500
Hey, ladies!

165
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,708
Fritz! Heine! Johann?!

166
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,208
Whadaya know, you are alive!

167
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,250
So Birdbrain escaped the
infamous Silvius, huh...?

168
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,666
I didn't see that one coming.

169
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,166
Atamora's pretty
ticked, by the way.

170
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,958
It's Dad.

171
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,750
You can rest easy, sir...

172
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,958
Looks like they're
safe and sound.

173
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,500
Yeah, so... are you guys
here to bring us back?

174
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,166
Is that what you think...?

175
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,083
Sorry... We came for the
Skyfish headin' this way.

176
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,291
The ships Ades is transporting?!

177
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,041
So, you're after
them, too, huh...?

178
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,416
I hope you're ready
for a tough battle!

179
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:57,000
That's Zwiebel... Pilze...
Karotten... and Kürbis...

180
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,500
...even Spargel!
They're all here!

181
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,375
Oh, no! Here they come!

182
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,166
No...! Those ships are
our prey, not yours!

183
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,583
You're wrong about
that, Birdbrain!

184
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,208
Good tailwinds, you guys!

185
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,625
Hey, Fam! Keep an eye out

186
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,625
for currents blowing
into the canyon.

187
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,333
Roger that!

188
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:28,833
Skyfish! And they're
all gonna be mine!

189
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,375
We're in the best position.
Great job, Gigi!

190
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,958
First harpoon's
got my name on it!

191
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,666
It's the Jagannath!

192
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,125
What's the Third
Fleet doing here?!

193
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,875
Sky Pirate docks and multiple
small vessels ahead...

194
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,916
Distance, two thousand.

195
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,458
It's about time.

196
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,583
Last Exile.

197
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,000
This is the Ades
Federation fleet...

198
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,333
The time has come for
you to pay the price

199
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,083
for your unrelenting defiance

200
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,125
and multiple acts
of depredation.

201
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,208
Prepare for
counter-air combat...

202
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,125
We shall obliterate
all who stand in the way

203
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
of the Augusta's
noble cause.

204
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,083
Sir!

205
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,791
Gloria... Augusta!

206
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,916
Activating rapid-fire system...

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,916
Actuating coupled anti-aircraft
guns numbers one and two.

208
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,208
I should've seen
this coming... Sorry.

209
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,833
Look out!

210
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,791
Ades caught us in their trap!

211
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:27,750
We can't go up!

212
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,875
There's nowhere to run!

213
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,416
Damn it!

214
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,750
This was all just a set up...

215
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,166
We took the Federation's
bait, all right.

216
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,750
Well, what now?!

217
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,750
How're we supposed to
get outta here, Gigi?

218
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,500
Give me a second to think.

219
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,875
What are we up against...?

220
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,625
I only see Third
Fleet's Jagannath

221
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,458
and Field Squadrons
one through four.

222
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,875
This isn't their
entire main force...

223
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,875
These're all long distance
ships-of-the-line.

224
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,833
They use 'em for decisive
fleet-against-fleet battles...

225
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,416
which means...

226
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,166
The lower turrets on these ships
can't match the Vespa's speed...

227
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,541
We need to slip beneath the
fleet and skim along the water

228
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,000
to get through the canyon.

229
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,208
Gotcha!

230
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:17,000
Lower anti-aircraft guns...
prepare to open fire.

231
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,666
Lower guns,
prepare to open fire!

232
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,833
Guns below, too?

233
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,833
They're only Sky Pirates.

234
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,541
They don't have the
speed or maneuverability

235
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,375
of Glacies rocket fighters...

236
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,708
They aren't likely to present
enough of a challenge for us

237
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,000
to gain useful intel
for the new weapon.

238
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,250
Quiet, Crèche...

239
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,708
There's no such thing as
a meaningless mission.

240
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,000
Sorry, sir... I'm out of line.

241
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,625
Gigi!

242
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,875
Purge the repair deck,
on the double!

243
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,708
Atamora!

244
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,916
No...! They're hit!

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,125
Daddy...! You can't sink!

246
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,166
--No!
--Calm down Gigi, it's fine!

247
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,208
Only the repair
deck's been hit...

248
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,125
That's not enough
to take 'em down.

249
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,250
But...!

250
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,500
Atamora would never
fall so easily...

251
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,333
You should know that
better than anyone.

252
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,208
Think...! There's gotta
be something we can do.

253
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,458
Look at the Grand Birds...

254
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,041
That's it!

255
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,541
Fam! The wind is
too strong up there!

256
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,041
Don't worry...!

257
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,541
The Grand Birds have just
shown us the way out of this!

258
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,125
The current changes...
Don't you see...?

259
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,958
It shifts for just a moment
when the glaciers hit the water!

260
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,500
No, it's impossible!

261
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,416
The Grand Birds made it,
didn't they...?

262
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,833
It's all timing...

263
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,958
There has to be one moment
when we can slip through.

264
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,750
We just gotta find it.

265
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,500
By the time they fly off,
it'll be too late...

266
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,833
We would need a shockwave to
change the current ourselves.

267
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,083
I know!

268
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,083
Those are Fam's signal flares.

269
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,000
She wants us to
draw their fire?!

270
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,333
Yep, that sounds like
Birdbrain, all right.

271
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,541
She does realize they've been
blasting at us the whole time?

272
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,458
Signal from Fam's ship!

273
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,250
"We're heading into the
canyon... Follow my lead!

274
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,458
Be sure to attract the
Third Fleet's fire."

275
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,166
Men! Follow Fam's lead!

276
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,041
Good tailwinds!

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,666
Those girls'll be
the death o' me...

278
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,166
Sir...!

279
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,791
The Sky Pirates appear to be
withdrawing into the canyon!

280
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,250
Intel collection for
the new weapon is

281
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,791
approaching completion, sir.

282
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,375
Very good. I'd say it's high
time we finish them off.

283
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,750
Fire main guns!

284
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,291
Move, now!

285
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,333
A gustnado is forming!

286
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,583
Engines to maximum!
Use auxiliary circuits!

287
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,291
What are you fools doing...?

288
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,500
Get after the Sky Pirates, now!

289
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,208
But... we can't, sir.

290
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,791
It's impossible to
get a fix on them

291
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,208
in the middle of all
those Grand Birds.

292
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,958
Milady!

293
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,166
I trust you're all
holding up well?

294
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,166
We are, my lady...

295
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,791
We surviving citizens of Chaos

296
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,958
are too strong to
be brought low.

297
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,250
Your pardon... but, we...
well, we were wondering about

298
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,000
this recent purging
of the returnees.

299
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,958
Quiet, fool...
Don't put her on the spot!

300
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,416
We're not here to ambush
her with such questions.

301
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,291
Right, I'm sorry, my lady.

302
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,291
I understand why you
would be uneasy...

303
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,750
There is no need to worry,
all will be well...

304
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,750
And I can assure you,
the Augusta knows

305
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,791
the people of Chaos are
loyal to her and her reign.

306
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,083
Of course she does...!
What was I thinking?

307
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,791
See, I told ya you
were being foolish.

308
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,291
You feel better now?

309
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,666
Yeah, world's
biggest scaredy-cat!

310
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,083
Sure did a number on us.

311
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,291
Yeah.

312
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,541
So what happens now...?
What do we do?

313
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,958
What are you talking about...?

314
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,708
Same as we've always done...

315
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,708
Hunt Skyfish and survive.

316
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,625
Yeah... maybe...
but it's gettin' ugly.

317
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,333
Time to go.

318
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,166
All that for nothin'.
What a waste.

319
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,750
Come on... we should leave, too.

320
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,333
Not yet, Gigi...

321
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,416
Type something up for me.

322
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,125
You sure about this...?
Letting 'em go?

323
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,750
A Sky Pirate has honor...
We keep the promises we make.

324
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,291
"I'm sorry, Atamora.
We can't come home quite yet.

325
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,541
I know I'm being selfish...
but please...

326
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:02,041
just give me a little longer...
Millia still needs us."

327
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,750
Come on, why so glum...?

328
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:13,000
We just have to find new
prey to go after, that's all.

329
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,333
We made it out of the
canyon, didn't we...?

330
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:19,291
And that was totally
thanks to you.

331
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:23,708
Nothing's gonna stop us...
long as we're together.

332
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,291
Sure.

333
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,000
Approaching Vespa...
It's Fam, Captain.

334
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,750
Fam's ship has returned...
Open hangar hatch.

335
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,416
I'm going to go and meet them.

336
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,250
Right... See you soon, Princess.

337
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,541
Multiple engines heard...

338
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,541
They're behind Fam...
Distance, Oh-Five.

339
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,958
They followed us back!

340
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,416
The Anshar?!

341
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,916
Why didn't we detect
those ships sooner?

342
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,875
Receiving a communication
from Admiral Sadri,

343
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,541
Commandant of the First Fleet.

344
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,208
What's the bastard say?

345
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,583
"Hand over Princess Millia..."

346
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,666
"...immediately..."

347
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,583
"Refuse and...
we sink your ship."

348
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,333
Teddy?

349
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,416
Yes, Princess?

350
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,458
Isn't this the
maintenance storeroom?

351
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,166
No, I've annexed it!

352
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,250
As of today, it's the office
of the Turan Refugee Government

353
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,625
and your own private study!

354
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,750
Considering how much
Ignace likes to gamble,

355
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,541
you'd think he'd
be better at it.

356
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,958
Teddy, you didn't...

357
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,583
At this rate, it won't be
long before I've expanded

358
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,625
our territory to include
the whole of the Silvius!

359
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,875
Just you wait and see, Princess!

360
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,041
I'm not sure I want to.
