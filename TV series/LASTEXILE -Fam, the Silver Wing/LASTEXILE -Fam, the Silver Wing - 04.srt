1
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,041
Hey, Gigi.

2
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:28,083
What makes you... really happy?

3
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,416
What brought that on?

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,416
And... go!

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,833
Gigi!

6
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:37,875
All right...! I have to go...
I'm helping with dinner.

7
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,833
'Kay!

8
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,166
Dubious move.

9
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,708
Northeasterly wind... Force two.

10
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,583
All clear ahead.

11
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,000
Helm amidships!

12
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,916
Helm amidships.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,916
We've got a nice view
of the stars tonight.

14
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:42,333
Operation: Catch the
Silvius Alive... is a go!

15
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,416
Thank you, Rene...
Is the table all clean?

16
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,000
Mm-Hm.

17
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,416
Could you maybe
give us a hand, Fam?

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,083
Come on...!
Why aren't you happier?

19
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,166
We're talking the Silvius...

20
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,541
Can't you even pretend
to be excited?

21
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,250
Gimme a "wow" at least!

22
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,208
Ah! The potato
pancakes are burning!

23
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,916
I love 'em burned.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,166
Me too!

25
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,375
Yay, burned!

26
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh my. Would you like
some help with that, dear?

27
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,541
Please.

28
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,208
No, on second thought,
I've got it.

29
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,875
Am I really the only one
who's into this...? Man!

30
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,250
Think, Fam... It is called
The Reaper for a reason.

31
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,625
Like the Grim Reaper?!

32
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,875
Pretty cool, huh...? I think
it's the best name ever!

33
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,791
Uh, thanks... for the clothes.

34
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,375
It looks great on you!

35
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,833
You think so?

36
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,125
Yes, absolutely!

37
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,250
A little tight in
this area, though.

38
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,708
Hey! Did you have
to point that out?

39
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,000
Come on, Millia.
They'll listen to you...

40
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,125
Please tell them we're
gonna catch the Silvius.

41
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,958
What's the Silvius...? A ship?

42
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,500
Hey! We caught up!

43
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,750
So that's it.
The infamous Silvius.

44
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,416
Thanks for the food!

45
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,708
Ow...! Hot-hot!

46
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,208
Please, allow me to serve you.

47
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,250
I love quiche!

48
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,458
Yeah, me too!

49
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,791
Too bad. None for you!

50
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,833
Aww...!

51
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,333
Be polite.
You can't have it all.

52
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,958
The Silvius...
A mysterious warship...

53
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,583
She suddenly showed up in
western Lierre two years ago,

54
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,041
and then just vanished
into thin air.

55
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,333
I've never actually seen 'er,
but she sounds cool!

56
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,833
But if it's a ghost ship, how
are you supposed to catch it?

57
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,291
A ghost ship?

58
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,541
They come for children
who don't behave.

59
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,583
Whoa, really?!

60
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,958
Don't worry, Millia ...

61
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,333
It's not a ghost;
it's actually a real ship.

62
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,791
They say it single-handedly
wiped out an entire Ades fleet.

63
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,291
So, of course the Federation...

64
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,291
would love to get
their hands on it.

65
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,708
It sounds perilous... Do we
really need a ship like that?

66
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,875
Just think how much it
would add to your arsenal...

67
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,625
You can't rebuild Turan
without a ship, right?

68
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,208
Good point.

69
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,583
You're doing it wrong!

70
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,916
With potato pancakes,
it's best to chomp right in.

71
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,208
Oh I can't even bear to look!

72
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,500
Oh, don't be silly.

73
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
When something tastes good...

74
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:38,125
Then you should show it.
With a smile!

75
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,000
Of course!

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,375
Tasty, isn't it?

77
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,541
Yes... very much so!

78
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,750
And now for a special treat!
Cured meat for everyone!

79
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,250
--Cool!
--Wow!

80
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,958
It's like a birthday and a
harvest festival all at once!

81
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,291
I love birthdays...!
So much fun!

82
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,666
Hey, Fam... isn't
yours coming up?

83
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,583
It sure is...!
I'm about to be sixteen!

84
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,583
Awesome...! That means
we get meat again, huh?

85
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,666
Hooray meat!

86
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,125
♪ Hey there,
it's your birthday! ♪

87
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,083
♪ Get happy! Happy
when you're born...! ♪

88
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,416
♪ Happy when you're 
old and gray! ♪

89
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,208
Princess Millia?!

90
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,666
Lovely, Teddy. Thank you.

91
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,208
Your quiche fell apart!

92
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,375
--It's still delicious.
--Yum!

93
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm starvin' here.

94
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,958
Ta-da!

95
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,500
The Silvius!

96
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,916
It looks like a fish.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,041
That's awesome!
Where did you get it, Dio?

98
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,750
It's a secret.

99
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,708
What good is this? It's too
blurry to make anything out.

100
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,791
Maybe at first glance,
but look closer... Right?

101
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,458
Well I guess
wherever they're from,

102
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,791
there's a certain logic
to how ships are built...

103
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,375
We can deduce a fair amount,

104
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,166
even with just tiny
bits of information.

105
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,208
Sounds awfully difficult though.

106
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,083
Yeah... It's
completely different

107
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,708
from any ship we've
dealt with before, so...

108
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know how
much we can plan.

109
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,250
Gigi... what does this
look like to you here?

110
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,125
Uhh... A listening device?

111
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,333
And over here? What's this...?

112
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,750
Going off of what I know,
I'd guess it's a mast.

113
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,000
Turan ships have them also.

114
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,916
Oh... the bridge!

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,750
See, now you're gettin' it!

116
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,833
Given its relative
size and structure,

117
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,416
it's not a terribly
large ship...

118
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,750
A ship-of-the-line...?

119
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,916
No! An amphibious
assault carrier.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,625
And what is that, exactly?

121
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,958
Oh... like the one we
caught that one time?

122
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,416
I don't get any of this!

123
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,041
Use your imagination.

124
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,250
'magination?

125
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,125
All right, so why's it
flat across the top?

126
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,833
Could it be a flight deck?

127
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,791
Yeah...! Yeah!

128
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,375
So it's what, a floating dock?

129
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,958
If that's the case, fighting
it's not going to be easy.

130
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,958
Then it is a ship-of-the-line.

131
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,458
No... I still don't
think that's right.

132
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,458
Ooh! The Reaper...!

133
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,250
Reaper!

134
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,375
This protrusion
here on the bottom...

135
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:05,125
There must be
something inside of it.

136
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,875
But I can't tell--

137
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,125
I got it!

138
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,416
I bet it opens up and a
super-secret weapon goes

139
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,458
ba-boom, pow! Pow!

140
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,916
A secret weapon? Yeah, that
would've been pretty cool.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,750
Oh...! Could be ballast.

142
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,791
That's a logical guess.

143
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,708
--Aww...
--Okay, then...

144
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,541
Where's its main armament?

145
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,166
No secret weapons...? Lame!

146
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,541
Look at the spot Fam
pointed out before.

147
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,333
What, you think
they're retractable?

148
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,750
Maybe where you'd
least expect them.

149
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,125
There aren't any nations I know
of with dummy battle ships...

150
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,708
I just wish...

151
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,583
I knew why they're going to such
lengths to hide their weapons.

152
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,416
Eyewitnesses say the
ship is always alone.

153
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,625
Of course...! She operates
solo to gather intelligence.

154
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,875
She wants to stay inconspicuous
and avoid fighting.

155
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,083
She's faster than
any ship we've seen,

156
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,458
and she can scout like
you wouldn't believe...!

157
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,166
She'll see the enemy right away!

158
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,125
This is not gonna be easy...

159
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,041
We won't know what
she's really capable of

160
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,666
until we get close and
land our first harpoon.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,666
There we go!

162
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,791
Such a ship truly exists?
You're amazing, Giselle!

163
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,500
Huh...? Yeah...

164
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,791
This might be my
best work... Thank you.

165
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,416
All finished...!
Now that's what I'd call...

166
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,791
the Reaper!

167
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,041
Secret weapons out
the wazoo... see!

168
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,291
There's only one
thing missing...

169
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,500
a little bit of water!

170
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,875
No sleeping. Come on,
Fritz! Wake up.

171
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,333
I was just tellin'
it like it is.

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,375
Hey! Shooting star!

173
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,416
He's an unusual character.

174
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,791
Yeah...

175
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,000
He showed up out of the blue
about six months ago...

176
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,291
And then he just--never left...

177
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,208
There's no denying he's
got some serious skills...

178
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,583
but he can be pretty flaky.

179
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,125
You hungry...?
I've got some bread here.

180
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,083
I'm fine.

181
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,291
Sure?

182
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,666
Mmm...! Smells so good...

183
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,541
When Aunt Tereza hangs
the sheets out to dry,

184
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,000
it's like they
capture the sunlight.

185
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,041
I can getcha some
water if you want.

186
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,833
Oh you needn't fuss over me.

187
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,416
It's no fuss, really...

188
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
I just wanna make sure
you're comfortable...

189
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,416
Though... It's probably
smaller than you're used to.

190
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,250
And I don't have
company too often.

191
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,166
What about Giselle?

192
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,083
Yeah, once, a long time ago.

193
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,833
She's got Rene and
the other little ones

194
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,458
to take care of, after all.

195
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,500
Well, here you go,
Princess. All yours.

196
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,250
What about you?

197
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,208
Floor's fine.

198
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,833
You should take the bed, not me.

199
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,166
I can't do that.
You are the guest here.

200
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,500
Gimme that blanket!

201
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,125
--Fam, please! Come on! 
--Hands off!

202
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,791
--Why not?!
--'Cause the bed is for you!

203
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,416
Too bad. I'm sleeping
on the floor.

204
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,625
I didn't think a princess
could handle the floor.

205
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,750
What do you mean by that?

206
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't get it...

207
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,625
Why did you make such a crazy
announcement like that...?

208
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,583
Do you really want to drag
all of Kartoffel into it...?

209
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:56,291
It's not as if we need
a ship like the Silvius.

210
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,708
Yeah, well the way I figure it,

211
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,958
the bigger the prey,
the better... Right...?

212
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,833
Besides, wouldn't
having it cheer you up?

213
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,083
I'm just trying to
make you happy is all.

214
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,916
But you don't look happy.

215
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,833
Now you're being silly.

216
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,708
Wha--?! Millia, c'mon...

217
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:31,666
G'night, Fam... Sweet dreams.

218
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,333
Thanks, Millia... You too!

219
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,583
Last Exile.

220
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,208
First Harpoon! Boom!

221
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,250
Johann's Vanship?!

222
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,375
Fam!

223
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,666
Yeah... I heard it
too... Let's go...!

224
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,583
Time to catch
us a Reaper!

225
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,833
No matter what,
I will rebuild Turan...

226
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,458
Father... Sister...
Please watch over me...

227
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,916
I will need your guidance.

228
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,708
Come home safe!

229
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,208
Wait! We're going along!

230
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,583
Princess, no!

231
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,500
Teddy!

232
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,125
Oh Princess, you shouldn't.

233
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,500
This is my fight, too.

234
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,083
Very well... Be careful!

235
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,583
I will be!

236
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,416
It's fun time.

237
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,125
Oh... hey. Nice outfit there.

238
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,750
Thank you. Can we go?

239
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,333
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

240
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,625
What's wrong now...?

241
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,250
You were confident enough
about it last night.

242
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,875
Yeah, it's just...

243
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,166
Look, don't worry...

244
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,125
I believe in you
even if you don't...

245
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,291
If anyone can do it, it's us.

246
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,666
Well...

247
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,125
This ship seems
different from Fam's.

248
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,833
Hands off!

249
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,666
Sorry.

250
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,125
That seat was... Lucciola's.

251
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,083
Okay... you might wanna
keep your mouth closed!

252
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,000
Ahh!

253
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,750
Corkscrew!

254
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,125
No, no, no! Stop, please! Don't!

255
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,708
That hits the spot.

256
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,458
So, Fam... didja sleep well?

257
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,166
Well enough to sleep-dive.

258
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,000
Eight times.

259
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:55,833
The Skyfish?

260
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,083
She's just wakin' up...

261
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,250
Taking it nice
and easy so far...

262
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,916
Around here.

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,333
Good... We'll proceed
with our usual plan, then.

264
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,541
You know we're
facing the Reaper...

265
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,000
That's why we're
playin' by the book.

266
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,833
We don't know enough about her.

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Did we miss anything?

268
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,458
Millia...! Teddy, hi!

269
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,625
Whadda ya know?

270
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,250
Don't even try telling
me to leave! I won't go!

271
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,916
You can't leave now anyway...

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,708
Oh, well... No prob...
You can watch us work.

273
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,958
Just wait: we will catch
the Silvius for you!

274
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,666
Distance is at
thirty thousand...

275
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,125
seven ships, dead-ahead.

276
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,625
Signal flares detected.

277
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,250
Identifies as
Federation ship Qingu!

278
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,916
Swing ten to port.

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,250
Roger, ten to port.

280
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,625
Skyfish has altered course.

281
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,250
Hah...! Fly away, losers!

282
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,041
Okay! First harpoon!

283
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,250
Cecily?

284
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,791
All I've heard so far is...
"First Harpoon."

285
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,666
Captain! Speed is dropping.

286
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,833
Well, Captain?

287
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,125
So this is what a
Skyfish hunt looks like.

288
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,250
You seem to be having fun.

289
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:27,083
Nicely done! Looks like
we've stopped her!

290
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,458
Yeah, or not.

291
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,708
Watch this...! I'm gonna
take out the Reaper's eyes.

292
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,916
Did they do what
I think they did?

293
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,666
Yes ma'am, blinders.

294
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,916
Multiple rock
structures detected ahead.

295
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,708
Distance, five hundred...
Twenty to starboard.

296
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,041
Climb to seventy-five.

297
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,250
This could be tricky.
She's got really good ears.

298
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,000
Then let's plug 'em!

299
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,791
Sorry. My ears are shot.

300
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:06,833
It's all right.

301
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,375
Alis... you have the bridge.

302
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,583
"You are now both
blind and deaf...

303
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,458
Your ship no longer stands
a chance in the open skies.

304
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,041
But if you surrender,
Fam Fan Fan of Kartoffel

305
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:35,166
promises to lead you
to a safe location."

306
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,583
Now this oughtta
cheer up Millia!

307
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,375
Are you having fun playing war?

308
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,708
Man!

309
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,750
The Silvius is getting away.

310
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,708
No it's not...! We'll knock
out its listening device again.

311
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,166
Fam!

312
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,875
We can't shake her!

313
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,583
A passing mark... barely.

314
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,791
And who are you?!

315
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,375
Your Scissor maneuver
could use some work.

316
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,041
You should go help them!

317
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,250
What for?

318
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,458
See...?! She's
having so much fun.

319
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,583
Hang on tight, Gigi.

320
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,083
Gonna ram me, are you?

321
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,166
Go, now!

322
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't get it.
She didn't shoot at us...

323
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,250
What do you think we
should do now, Gigi?

324
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,625
Unarmed...? This'll be fun.

325
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,333
Let me join the good time!

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,125
Huh...? Wha--?

327
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,666
Am I crazy, or are
we still alive?

328
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,250
Not sure how, but yeah...

329
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,416
All right...
Where's the Skyfish?

330
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,375
Four o'clock!
Distance... Four thousand!

331
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,208
That's the Grand Lake.

332
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,916
That's sacred water...

333
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,708
We have to stop...
Let's forget about it!

334
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,208
You do know we're only
doing this for you.

335
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,958
Please, don't.

336
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,666
Fam, no!

337
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,791
Don't worry...! We won't
desecrate the Grand Lake.

338
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,666
Fam?!

339
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,375
Shoot it, Gigi!

340
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,708
Try again... go on.

341
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,958
It's no use...

342
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,000
I've never been able to
stop a Claudia engine...

343
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,708
Not even during
training... I'm sorry.

344
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,708
How about shooting
it from the inside?

345
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,583
Come on... I know you can do it.

346
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,041
Yeah... Okay... I'll try it!

347
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,125
Straight for six
seconds, then up...

348
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:12,208
In four... three...
two... one... now!

349
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,625
How much are you
really sure of...?

350
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,458
Maybe she's surprisingly
spacious below deck.

351
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,541
Hard right in...

352
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:23,208
three... two... one... now!

353
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,000
You're amazing, Gigi! Well done!

354
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,250
There's only one thing missing.
A little bit of water!

355
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,833
Water...? That means
watertight doors!

356
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,166
Fam, you need to
take us out now!

357
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,333
Huh?!

358
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,500
Outer hull watertight
doors sealed...

359
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:43,208
Tween deck evacuation
is complete.

360
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,208
All hands: brace
yourselves for impact, now!

361
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,166
Keep going!

362
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,875
Yeah!

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,250
Fam!

364
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,541
It's diving...!
Why's it doing that?

365
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,375
Gigi...

366
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,708
I dreamt the Skyfish
dove underwater.

367
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,375
It wasn't a dream...

368
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,750
We go wherever we please,
whether it be sky or sea...

369
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,666
Lovely, isn't it?

370
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,125
Now that you've
seen the Silvius,

371
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,625
I'm afraid we cannot
allow you to leave alive.

372
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,875
I know you... You were
the one on that red Vanship.

373
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,708
That's right.
Captain Tatiana Wisla.

374
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,666
I'm Fam Fan Fan of Kartoffel.

375
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,833
And your age?

376
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,458
I'm Giselle Collette, ma'am...

377
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,166
W-We're both fifteen years old.

378
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,416
Ya know there is a way for
you to get out of this mess,

379
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,583
but you'll have to help
us with something first.

380
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,375
Yeah, what could
you want from us?

381
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,875
Lemme see... Go steal some
Federation ships for us.

382
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,375
One for every year
you've been alive.

383
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,500
Every year?!

384
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,625
How do we steal fifteen ships?

385
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:15,625
Heh... Too much for
kids like you to handle?

386
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:19,625
Oh, we can handle it
all right... Fifteen!

387
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,041
It's them...! They're both here!

388
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,625
Millia...

389
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,583
We've got a deal.

390
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,916
We'll put a whole fleet together

391
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,541
if that's what it
takes to help Millia!

392
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,250
Huh?!

393
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,291
Ugh! I can't stand that captain!

394
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,625
Thinks she's all hot stuff

395
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,666
just 'cause she's
decent with a Vanship!

396
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,833
Well, I'm gonna show her!

397
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,416
Seems like more
than a coincidence,

398
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,291
the way we fell
right into their lap.

399
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,583
Wait! Do you think Dio
planned for the Silvius

400
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,666
to catch us right
from the start?

401
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,208
What? Are you suggesting
Dio's a spy for the Silvius?

402
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,666
♪ Get happy!
Happy when you're born, ♪

403
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,291
♪ happy when you're
old and gray! ♪

404
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,083
No, there's no way.

405
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,125
--Agreed.
--Immelmann Turn!
