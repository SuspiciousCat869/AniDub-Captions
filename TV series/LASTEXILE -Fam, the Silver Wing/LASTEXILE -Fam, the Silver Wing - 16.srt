1
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,208
You care for a drink...?

2
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,375
I took the liberty of swiping
it from the premier's cabinet.

3
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,416
He's banished people for less.

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,833
At least you'll be
right there with me.

5
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,875
I never thought
I would see the day

6
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,083
when Ades soldiers
would fight each other.

7
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,000
If she were still alive,

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,291
Augusta Farahnaz would be
grief-stricken by this.

9
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,916
Even she could not put an end

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,833
to hatred and strife
between peoples.

11
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:00,125
What hope do we commoners have?

12
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,750
The premier will
continue moving forward,

13
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,416
taking down friend and
foe alike in his wake.

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,000
We have already
lost so many lives...

15
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:13,166
What is left to gain...?
Why should we continue this?

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,125
We will defeat the opposition...

17
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,166
and the fighting will stop...
You'll see, Orang...

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,041
The premier is taking
the shortest path to peace.

19
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:26,458
The shortest path, huh...?
Sometimes I do envy you...

20
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,458
with your simple,
matter-of-fact outlook.

21
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,916
Sometimes... I envy you,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,208
with your zeal to fight for
that in which you believe.

23
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,416
Automaton.

24
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,333
Twenty miles to Boreas Fortress.

25
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,375
All hands, take Type
Two battle stations.

26
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,458
All hands, take Type Two
battle stations, now!

27
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,125
Bring the starboard
guns around slowly!

28
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,166
So...! The aces of Kartoffel

29
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,958
are finally heading
into battle, eh?

30
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,708
You'll be able to do
some serious damage

31
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,000
with these on board.

32
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,375
But why would we want those?

33
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,000
We can fly just
fine without 'em.

34
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,916
Wh...? You can't go
out there unarmed!

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,041
Aren't you the same Pirates

36
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,708
who stole fifteen
of our battle ships?

37
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,500
This should make it
even easier for you.

38
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,583
I told you, I don't want--

39
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,750
Fam... settle down, okay?

40
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,791
We're here to defend the freedom
and justice of the skies, Fam...

41
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,541
Having some backup
won't hurt us.

42
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,458
Yeah, but... I don't like it.

43
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,291
I know.

44
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,625
Enemy spotted!

45
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,916
I repeat... enemy spotted!

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,541
One hundred ships, about
sixteen miles ahead.

47
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,875
Looks like the Third
and Fourth Fleets.

48
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,666
Led by Orang and Sorush...

49
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,541
They don't appear to have any
Turan ships among their fleets.

50
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,791
Thank you for your
consideration...

51
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,333
I know you're busy
enough right now

52
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,666
without having to
worry about me.

53
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,125
Of course, Princess.

54
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,000
Enemy signal flares!

55
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,000
They wish to know
our intentions.

56
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,791
There is no room
for negotiation.

57
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,625
Augusta Farahnaz truly believed

58
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,541
that the purpose of
the Ades Federation...

59
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,916
was to create a world in which
all peoples can live in peace...

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,875
a belief she passed on
to her young daughter.

61
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,791
Luscinia's actions
make a mockery

62
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:57,000
of the Augusta's noble desire.

63
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,458
And that's why you've brought
the young Augusta Sara here?

64
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,208
The battlefield is
no place for a child.

65
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,416
We do what we must...

66
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
We are safeguarding
the Augusta's wish

67
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,125
for a world of
peace and justice.

68
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,791
"We," you say...?
I just see you.

69
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,166
So, how will you proceed?

70
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,833
Do you dare aim your
guns at the Augusta?

71
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:19,916
You're the one who is forcing us
to make that choice... General.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,125
And you...? You'll fight?

73
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,375
Yes, I... must.

74
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,916
That's unfortunate...

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,666
I thought you two would have
understood why I'm doing this.

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,583
Our joint forces will commence
hostilities against you

77
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,041
at twelve hundred hours.

78
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,125
Come, on. This is our job.

79
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,416
What about the Augusta...?

80
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,708
It is our duty to protect her.

81
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,916
Creating a peaceful
world for everyone...

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,958
That's our ultimate duty.

83
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,541
I know...

84
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,125
Essentially, the Augusta is just
a representative of the people.

85
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,750
If it comes down to it...
she can be replaced.

86
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,625
Sorush!

87
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,666
Hypothetically, of course...

88
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,416
For now, you and I
just need to focus on

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,583
accomplishing the task at hand.

90
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,208
Think about what Kayvan
is always saying...

91
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,750
"A soldier is a sword;

92
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,333
and is to be used at its
wielder's discretion."

93
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,791
Am I right?

94
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,875
Marilla...

95
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,750
There seems to be quite a
bit of commotion outside.

96
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,291
Don't worry, Augusta...

97
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,041
I'm certain that everything
will turn out for the best...

98
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,125
General Vasant
believes in you...

99
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,875
She says your presence here is
for the sake of world peace.

100
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,666
Boreas Fortress is
a natural stronghold,

101
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,750
veiled in constant fog, and
surrounded by deep crevasses.

102
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,041
These fissures exceed

103
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,333
the standard battleship
altitude ceiling.

104
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,833
Therefore, only these slabs of
bedrock here are navigable...

105
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,833
If you stray too far
from the rock...

106
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,833
You're gone.

107
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,208
It's also important to note that

108
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,291
Boreas Fortress's cannons
pack quite a punch.

109
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,500
And the only dead ground
is this corridor here.

110
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,916
With that in mind, this is
where we will make our push.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,750
Of course... we can
expect the enemy

112
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,375
to anticipate our move
and act accordingly.

113
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,208
Leave the Third Fleet
for Glacies to handle.

114
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,333
We will destroy
them personally...

115
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,250
They killed our people.

116
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,791
We'll try to repel
Luscinia's attack...

117
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,375
If we can keep them
from the fortress,

118
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,375
then victory will be ours...

119
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,125
And, once again, everyone please
be mindful of the crevasses.

120
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,791
Right... understood.

121
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,000
Roger.

122
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,166
I think Fam's still a
bit unsure about this.

123
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,958
And you?

124
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,833
We want to protect Kartoffel...

125
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,083
We want to protect
these skies... We do...

126
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:21,166
but we're Skyfish hunters,
we're not professional soldiers.

127
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,208
We've never shot
at people before.

128
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,291
Please... when this war
finally comes to an end...

129
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,916
when the fighting's done,
will the world be at peace?

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,166
Yes... I have faith it will be.

131
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,000
We're going, Princess.

132
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,375
Right. Thank you.

133
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,833
You don't have to
do this, you know.

134
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,291
Huh?

135
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,125
Kartoffel only joined the
fight against the Federation

136
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,333
because of the agreement we
made with Princess Liliana

137
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,791
after Turan fell.

138
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,416
And now we're choosing to
fight with Princess Millia...

139
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,791
to defend the
freedom of the skies

140
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,000
from Luscinia's brutal tyranny.

141
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,333
But with that said...

142
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,500
this is only
Kartoffel's decision.

143
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,166
You're free to choose
for yourself...

144
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,916
You've made your own agreements.

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,875
And Sky Pirates pride themselves
on keeping their word...

146
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,041
It's our integrity that
gives us unfettered wings.

147
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,708
Without it, we're no
better than the enemy.

148
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,250
Yeah, you're right...

149
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,666
And thank you...
But I'm going, Atamora.

150
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,375
I want to protect these skies
the best I know how.

151
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,708
I see.

152
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,458
Third combat squad in position
along western Boreas corridor.

153
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,666
Fourth squad in position
along eastern corridor.

154
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,166
It's time.

155
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,541
Very well, then.
Launch all Vanships...

156
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,416
Battleships,
first combat speed...

157
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,416
Let's eliminate the
traitors in Boreas.

158
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,250
All ships, first combat speed!

159
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,916
Can't we go any
faster than this?

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,333
No, actually, we can't.

161
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,416
I'm sure there are
many of you here

162
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,250
who hold General Vasant in
the very highest regard.

163
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,708
In fact, I, myself, confessed
my love to her in my youth.

164
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,000
Not that it did me any good.
But we must remember our duty.

165
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,958
We are fighting to
rescue the Augusta

166
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,000
from General Vasant's
traitorous machinations.

167
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,458
Put your feelings aside...

168
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,541
Do what you must to
destroy the enemy!

169
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,916
All ships, second
combat speed...

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,541
Target the enemy flagship.

171
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,666
Roger... Second combat speed!

172
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,583
Main enemy fleet is on the move!

173
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,750
All ships, prepare to fire.

174
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,208
All ships... prepare to fire!

175
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:53,416
Madness. I am about to fire
on the Augusta herself.

176
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,458
Can I do this?

177
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,333
Enemy Vanships approaching!

178
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,125
Ready counter-air combat!

179
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,291
--Fire!
--Fire!

180
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,500
Five ships-of-the-line downed.
Four others severely damaged.

181
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,166
Glacies' new weapon
in action, eh...?

182
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,708
All ships, move to charge.
Push the enemy to the south!

183
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,041
Man, they're fast!

184
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,541
Can't say I'm that big a fan
of this anti-aircraft fire!

185
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,833
Enemies above!

186
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:37,750
Aw, crap!

187
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,416
Give us a break, will ya?

188
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,208
Fam! Incoming, five o'clock.

189
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,333
Roger!

190
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,583
Steering's so heavy.

191
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,916
We're in range!

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,458
Arming...!

193
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,708
Fam!

194
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,333
No!

195
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,208
We're out of ammo.

196
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,333
That's fine, 'cause
I can't-- I can't do this.

197
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,666
This just keeps getting worse.

198
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,041
We have to stop.

199
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,416
At this rate...
everyone's going to die!

200
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,583
Fam, what are you doing?

201
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,541
Exactly what I should
have done all along!

202
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,583
We've received orders from
the Fourth Fleet to attack.

203
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,250
We're still just out
of firing range.

204
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,541
Last Exile.

205
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,458
Sorush!

206
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,250
I heard you requested to be
stationed on the southern front.

207
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,291
Is that true?

208
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,916
Yeah... sure is.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,041
That whole area is
a battleground...

210
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,166
You want to die?

211
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,750
One battlefield is
a lot like another...

212
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,166
I figure it'll be fun to go
where the most action is.

213
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,291
That's where the best chance
for glory is gonna be, anyway.

214
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,791
Well, yes... That's true...

215
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,291
I guess I was just expecting
you to take the easy way out.

216
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,708
You never took training
very seriously...

217
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,625
and you don't seem particularly
loyal to the Augusta.

218
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,125
That's not true...

219
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,250
I admire the Augusta quite
a bit, I will have you know...

220
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,583
I admire lookin' at her, I mean.

221
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,166
Don't you dare disrespect her!

222
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,083
You're one of the
true believers, huh?

223
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,666
I'll bet you have genuine
faith in her ideals

224
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,000
and in Ades' future...

225
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,250
and that's the reason
you became a soldier.

226
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,041
Well, yes.
Isn't that why you did?

227
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:53,583
No. Envy... Just envy's
what brought me here.

228
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,416
What do you mean by that?

229
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,791
Nothing... You take your
path and I'll take mine...

230
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,833
Who knows what's gonna
happen to us next...?

231
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,166
Maybe sometimes I'll
even check up on you.

232
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,291
Gee thanks.
That's very supportive.

233
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,625
Well, good luck...

234
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,666
They're sending you to
the east, aren't they...?

235
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,458
The action there's almost
as intense as the south.

236
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,041
Yeah.

237
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,541
Let's meet again...
Here, in the capital.

238
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,958
Gloria... Augusta.

239
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,916
Back then... I knew
nothing of uncertainty...

240
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,125
My only concern was
for the Augusta...

241
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,333
and for the future of Ades.

242
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,208
But... now...

243
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,583
Orang is behaving strangely...

244
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,333
Is he that worried about
the altitude ceiling...?

245
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,875
Wait...

246
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,750
Second and Third
Combat Squads...

247
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,833
Move to flank the
enemy on both sides

248
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,916
while maintaining
your distance.

249
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Two... three. It's
your turn, Augusta.

250
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,625
All that noise...

251
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,208
There's no need to worry...

252
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,750
General Vasant will destroy the
enemy if they come near us.

253
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,875
Enemy...? Who...?
Is Luscinia here himself?

254
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,875
Is it him or one of
the other generals?

255
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,833
I'm sorry... I'm afraid
I don't know...

256
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,291
Why must everyone
fight like this?

257
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,416
I mean... we fought
together for so long...

258
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,458
It doesn't... it doesn't
make sense to me!

259
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,750
What's the prey?

260
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,708
The fastest one they have.

261
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,791
Lead ship of Fourth Fleet's
high-speed, heavy flotilla,

262
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,250
commanded by General Sorush.

263
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,208
The Senapati, huh?

264
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,416
Listen up, now!

265
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,166
Our prey is big and fast...
So look alive!

266
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,083
Yeah!

267
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,416
Focus only on
reaching the Augusta.

268
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,958
They have nowhere to run
at this point, anyway...

269
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,708
Push forward, now!

270
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,291
Enemy ahead.
They're preparing to ram us!

271
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,166
Emergency ascent...!
Let them pass us--

272
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,916
Turn hard aport!

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,583
Hard aport... move!

274
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,666
We're not gonna make it...!

275
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,583
We've lost buoyancy...
We're falling!

276
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,041
Watch the altitude ceiling!

277
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,208
Don't get overpowered
by the enemy!

278
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,541
Target sighted!

279
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,041
Then let's go, get 'er!

280
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,375
Sky Pirate ships approaching.

281
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,750
The same Sky Pirates who
gave Orang a good scare, huh?

282
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,250
First harpoon!

283
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,291
Did it hit?

284
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,041
Keep on! Full speed ahead!

285
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,500
No good!

286
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,083
They'll have to do
much better than that

287
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,750
if they want to stop me...

288
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,916
Forward...!

289
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,208
The Augusta is almost
within our grasp.

290
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,791
They took out
the Augusta's flag!

291
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,833
How dare they fire...
on the Augusta?!

292
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,750
You're nothing but a
despicable traitor, Vasant.

293
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,791
You don't deserve
to fly her flag...

294
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,625
Send up the signal flares.

295
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,625
Fourth Fleet has given
the signal to attack, sir.

296
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,208
You'll see, Orang...

297
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,416
The Premier is simply taking
the shortest path to peace.

298
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,750
Sorush...

299
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,791
I truly do envy you your
matter-of-fact outlook.

300
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,083
But...

301
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,208
Sorry, my friend...

302
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,875
All ships... open fire!

303
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,208
Evade...! Do not
let them approach!

304
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,833
We need only recover
the Augusta...

305
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,458
That will end the battle...

306
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,666
All hands...!
Prepare for close comba--

307
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,666
What was that?!

308
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,583
It's the Third
Fleet's Admirari!

309
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,250
They're firing on us!

310
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,208
Now hear this...!

311
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,458
We are loyal vassals
to the Augusta...

312
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,125
I'll brook no
further atrocities.

313
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,000
Orang...

314
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,708
Direct hit, General!
To the upper sub-bridge!

315
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,166
Aft thruster is hit!

316
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,250
I see... so this is the path
you've chosen to follow.

317
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,583
I can't say why, really.

318
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,375
But somehow...

319
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,541
I had a feeling
this would happen...

320
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,458
I knew this day would come.

321
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,750
You take your own path...

322
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,958
But... as for me...

323
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,208
Attention, all ships...!

324
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,000
Those loyal to the Augusta,
heed my orders...!

325
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,208
We are fighting for true
peace in the world...

326
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,791
Break through the enemy forces
and then seek out the Premier!

327
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,375
They're attacking
the Augusta's ship!

328
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,291
All ships, open fire!

329
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,958
By the way...
sorry about all this.

330
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,833
Not at all, sir...
Nothing new to me.

331
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,000
Max out the engines!
All ahead full!

332
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,250
Now, men...!

333
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,416
Let me hear your cry of victory!

334
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,625
In honor of the Augusta!

335
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,666
Augusta Sara, please wait!

336
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,208
Augusta!

337
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,416
That's Sorush...

338
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,750
Stand back!

339
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,625
Sorush...! Sorush!

340
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,083
No!

341
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,333
I'm sorry, General.

342
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,125
Please forgive me,
but Augusta Sara

343
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,458
doesn't wish to
see you right now.

344
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,041
It's... Dio!

345
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,166
That which slumbers deeply
in the land of snow...

346
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,916
A faint and distant promise
which guides those who are lost.

347
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,583
A vast ocean brimming
with stars...

348
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,791
The far-reaching path of
those who have departed.

349
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,041
The dream delivered only
by the angels of war...

350
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:25,083
a beacon... a shining
symbol of hope and life.

351
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,875
From Princess Liliana.

352
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,916
What next?

353
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,625
Our path remains the same...

354
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:47,541
It was set in stone,
that day, ten years ago.

355
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,791
I hear you and Sorush attended
the academy at the same time.

356
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,958
He made decent grades,
but they held him back

357
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,416
because he was always
ditching class,

358
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,916
so we graduated the same year.

359
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,458
That sounds like Sorush.

360
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,750
He always broke curfew.

361
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:31,958
And I can't count
the number of times

362
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,125
I had to help him
with papers and tests.

363
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,500
That sounds like Sorush.

364
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,333
He'd run up bar tabs in my name

365
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:40,583
and girls he cheated on would
go on a rampage in my room...

366
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh, I see...

367
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,541
Curse that scoundrel Sorush!
