1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,375
The Grand Exile was constructed
by the Ades Federation,

2
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,291
rightful rulers of this
world and all its lands...

3
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:32,041
It was designed to surpass
all else in its power.

4
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,750
I now have in my custody
the legitimate heir

5
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,750
and plenipotentiary over all
the inhabitants of this world.

6
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:43,291
In the name of MaestroSara,
I hereby declare...

7
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,750
As of this moment...

8
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,416
All acts of hostility
throughout the world...

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,125
are to come to an end.

10
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,500
All military forces
of all nations

11
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,583
will disarm at once
and surrender.

12
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,125
Those who refuse to comply

13
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:01,166
will be duly punished
by the Grand Exile.

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,083
All offensive weaponry will be
dismantled and destroyed...

15
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,625
Thus will begin an era of
true peace in this world.

16
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,166
He's gotta be kidding with this.

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,416
What's that bastard
know about peace?

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,833
If he wants an end
to the fighting,

19
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:17,083
maybe he should
stop making threats.

20
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,333
This isn't the peace
Sara dreamed about...

21
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:23,291
It's not what she wanted!

22
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,791
I can feel her... She's crying.

23
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,500
Triple rook.

24
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,625
Grand Exile's
position confirmed.

25
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,708
It's in Glacies, Grid G-7.

26
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:17,291
Moving south-southeast
by east at twenty knots!

27
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,583
Additionally, Admiral
Sadri's First Fleet

28
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,708
has taken formation ahead of it!

29
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:32,166
That murderer Luscinia does not
represent the Augusta's wishes.

30
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,916
All ships will focus on
eliminating the enemy fleet

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,375
arranged at the fore
of the Grand Exile.

32
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,625
Vanships will penetrate
its defenses...

33
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,583
We'll attempt to find the
Augusta... and rescue her.

34
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,125
Just can't wait to
scratch that itch

35
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,625
and get back in the action, huh?

36
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,208
It's the path we have to take.

37
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,541
We're the only ones who have
proper Vanship training

38
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,958
and can storm the ship.

39
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm jealous. I wish
I could go play, too.

40
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,541
The Silvius is in
your hands now...

41
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,375
Support Commander-in-Chief
Millia the best you can, okay?

42
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,750
Right! Consider it do--

43
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,333
And you, Cecily...

44
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,958
Those ears of yours are going to
be vital inside the blizzard...

45
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,208
We're counting on you.

46
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,791
I'll do my best!

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,750
She's not the
only one, though...

48
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,625
As the new Turan witch,
can't you sense her, as well?

49
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,875
I'm needed here to
oversee our forces.

50
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:28,750
Dyan...

51
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,458
No, I can't...
My sister is dead.

52
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,875
I saw you kill her
with my own eyes.

53
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,416
I can't forgive that.

54
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,333
But, that doesn't
change the fact

55
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,500
that I have a duty to fulfill.

56
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,666
Duty...?

57
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,541
I must do whatever it takes.

58
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,541
I am Turan's ruler...

59
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,291
While my people survive,
I must lead them.

60
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,791
Don't you see...?

61
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,250
That is the task
I've inherited...

62
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,708
I must set my feelings aside.

63
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,583
Well, I hope you're ready.
They're all waiting.

64
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,833
To all those about to
confront the Grand Exile...

65
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:07,208
I fully believe...
The war ends with this battle.

66
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,291
Laying down our weapons
and surrendering now

67
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,833
might indeed end the
current hostilities...

68
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,625
as Luscinia claims...

69
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:18,541
But I ask you... could
we truly call that peace?

70
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,458
Gathered here today are people
from different nations...

71
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,166
different worlds, in fact.

72
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,208
Wherever we come from,
we share a common dream...

73
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,750
The dream of a peaceful,
prosperous future.

74
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,333
After all we've done, we know
we can change the world...

75
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,250
Not through force...

76
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,458
But through cooperation.

77
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:42,125
With compassion and
care for each other.

78
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,291
Let's build a better future...

79
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,333
Now... Let's do it together...!

80
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,500
What say all of you...?
Will you stand with me?!

81
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,708
Gigi... you know what...?

82
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,333
I really do still wanna
hold a new Grand Race.

83
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:03,291
It's not such a bad dream. So
many people were happy that day.

84
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,250
They were.

85
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,875
What's that for?

86
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,250
We will make it happen, okay?

87
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,666
You know the controls?

88
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,625
Crossing Glacies border.

89
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:36,291
ETA to the current location of
the Grand Exile is ten minutes.

90
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,375
Have we received any
word from the Silvius?

91
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,750
Unable to confirm.

92
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,625
Maintain formation for now...

93
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:46,208
And keep the comm relay safety
margin at fifteen percent!

94
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,708
Ships detected at three o'clock.

95
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,083
High-speed, heavy flotilla.

96
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,166
Receiving a signal from the

97
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,125
Fourth Fleet flagship,
the Senapati...

98
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,166
"Our fleet hereby unites with
the Joint Forces in the effort

99
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,750
to establish peace in
the world as desired by

100
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,500
the Augusta and her
loyal subjects."

101
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:08,250
Were you trying to ditch me,
old friend...? How rude.

102
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,333
Your reply, sir?

103
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,375
It's about time.

104
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,791
Ships up ahead...!

105
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,375
I count fifty... no... seventy
super-dreadnaughts...

106
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,375
The Third and Fourth Fleets!

107
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,041
There's no true
freedom in this country.

108
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,833
Tied down by old edicts
and outdated traditions.

109
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,208
So where does that lead us...?
To fighting and stealing!

110
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,041
You are still a child.
You cannot understand.

111
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,083
I understand this isn't right...

112
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,708
I want to soar...
through free skies...

113
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,250
No one's going
to stand in my way!

114
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,583
Come back here! Raha!

115
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Perhaps you should
have gone with Sorush

116
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,916
and the Fourth Fleet instead.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,541
No... I believe in
the Premier's cause.

118
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,916
Only he can do what needs
to be done for this world.

119
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,083
All hands, battle stations!

120
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,708
Giant Claudia Unit
acoustics ten miles ahead!

121
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,041
Artillery loading...
Main gun preparing to fire.

122
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:17,625
The Grand Exile...
All forces, prepare for combat!

123
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,083
Roger!

124
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,250
We are now approaching
the altitude ceiling.

125
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,958
Prepare for battle!

126
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,916
Prepare to fight!

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,833
Assemble the floating docks...
Let's give 'em a foothold.

128
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,333
Altitude limit reached.

129
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,791
Commence Boreas Strategy!

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,708
And fire!

131
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,958
The enemy's been rendered
virtually blind and deaf!

132
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,958
Let's give that old soldier
a farewell he'll never forget!

133
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,708
Why...? Why won't they stop...?

134
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,916
More death is the
last thing she wants!

135
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:15,208
Incoming fire! Impact
in three... two... one...

136
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,958
Object approaching...
speed at three hundred knots.

137
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,666
Threat imminent!

138
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,791
What is it?!

139
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,916
The Fourth Fleet's Kumara
and Guha are down!

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,291
What's happening out there?!

141
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,208
The Grand Exile is attacking...

142
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,625
...launching
direct strikes using

143
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,333
some kind of
ultra-high-speed objects.

144
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,166
The Grand Exile has them, too.

145
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,791
The Exile defense mechanisms.

146
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,750
Give the Fourth Fleet support!

147
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,208
Enemy fleet approaching
at ten o'clock.

148
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,666
The Grand Exile
is loading artillery.

149
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,625
Ten tons, maybe more!

150
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,958
Alert all ships and
order evasive action, now!

151
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,500
All comm relays are down.

152
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,250
We have no way to communicate!

153
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,083
What? No!

154
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,750
Hey!

155
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,500
Come on... Can't we do anything?

156
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,291
If we go out there now,
we'll just get

157
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,291
ourselves blown to pieces.

158
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,625
The Augusta's flame will
transform this dark world...

159
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,875
We must defend her at all costs.

160
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,250
Not a single ship can be allowed
to approach the Grand Exile.

161
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,750
Artillery loading complete.
Main gun is about to fire!

162
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,791
We must hurry!

163
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,750
What's that sound?

164
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,375
Gimme a casualty report!

165
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,375
Down a third of our forces.

166
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,791
Unusual wind noise from
the Grand Exile's outer hull.

167
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,750
From what I can tell,
the gun and the shielding

168
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,958
surrounding it have
broken off somehow.

169
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,375
What?

170
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,416
It would seem the big ones
are single-use only, then.

171
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,916
Engines to full.
All ships to flank speed.

172
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,916
Engines full.
All ships flank speed!

173
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,500
We're going to
send our intrusion

174
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,625
team through that opening.

175
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,166
We'll launch all
Vanships after we've

176
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,833
successfully breached
the enemy vessel.

177
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,291
First we need to get
inside the Grand Exile...

178
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,416
Then we retrieve
the Augusta as planned.

179
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,750
Grand Exile gun located at one
o'clock is preparing to fire...

180
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,083
Target orientation,
one-hundred-ninety-one degrees!

181
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,041
What is their projected target?!

182
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,958
The Turan royal city, Iglasia.

183
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,041
He's going to
destroy Turan again?!

184
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,125
But that's not
a military base...

185
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,583
Ades immigrants
live there now, too.

186
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,541
It's a message.

187
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,500
"That which is born
of your blue surface."

188
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,458
Replace the combat modules
on all damaged ships!

189
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,333
Incorporate all
the remaining ships

190
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,291
from both the Third
and Fourth Squadrons...

191
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,083
We need to break through!

192
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,750
Change of formation...

193
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,333
Move all heavily damaged
ships to the rear of the fleet.

194
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,375
"May our serenity be
complete and everlasting."

195
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,208
Liliana...

196
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,958
Last Exile.

197
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,416
They used an Exile as a shield.

198
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,916
What's that...?
What's happening out there?

199
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,416
Something's definitely odd.

200
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,666
I need you, Father...

201
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,083
Lily too. I need you to
do something for me...

202
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,375
Please, keep my friends safe.

203
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,416
All ships, charge now!

204
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,166
To Inverted Wedge formation...

205
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,750
Fend off the enemy's charge.

206
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,916
Hello, friends...

207
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,833
I took the liberty of
bringing reinforcements.

208
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,583
Vincent and Wina!
Anatoray backup!

209
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,791
It's about time, Sophia.

210
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:52,166
Order to all ships from Empress
Sophia of Anatoray Disith...

211
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,958
Support the Joint Forces...!
Run up the banner!

212
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,291
All Joint Forces
ships flank speed now!

213
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,583
Follow the Silvana's lead!

214
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,166
That should give us
some breathing room...

215
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,416
New focus: do whatever we must
to get inside the Grand Exile!

216
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,875
Evade...! Five to starboard.

217
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,416
Move...! Trim-up 15 degrees!

218
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,791
The Silvius must break
through the enemy lines!

219
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,166
All ships: launch as
soon as the hatch opens.

220
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,833
Do not fall behind! Understood?

221
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,583
Output has reached
eighty percent now.

222
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,000
All systems are nominal...
We're all set for takeoff.

223
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,333
Guess this is it, huh?

224
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,083
Well, Birdbrain...
hope you're ready.

225
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,458
Good tailwinds.

226
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,333
Yeah, same to you guys!

227
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,625
Just hold on...
We're on our way, Sara.

228
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,958
Show 'em what we can do...
Go, Fourth Fleet!

229
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,166
Please, Lady Millia...!
Save the Augusta!

230
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,083
Bow-mounted,
long-barrels... Ready guns!

231
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,041
Fire!

232
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,000
All ships, go!

233
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,875
Okay, Sara... we're coming!

234
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:24,041
Fam... Giselle...
Dyan... Good luck!

235
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,000
So this is the inside
of the Grand Exile.

236
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,666
This all seems...
familiar somehow.

237
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,208
Fam, keep going!

238
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,291
What about you, Captain?

239
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,541
I've missed doing this...
It's such a rush!

240
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,291
Don't get distracted.

241
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,458
Prepare to ram them...

242
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,208
All hands, brace
yourselves for impact.

243
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,500
Just how big is this ship?

244
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,083
We gotta hurry!

245
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,083
Captain Tatiana, Millia, and all
the others are still in danger!

246
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,500
Yeah, just as I thought.

247
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:32,208
Yes... I agree...
This isn't right at all.

248
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,333
You just wanted to
create a world where

249
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,583
everyone could smile again.

250
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,916
That way!

251
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,458
Hold on!

252
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,666
Enter the pipe at nine o'clock!

253
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,500
What?

254
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,750
That one is our best bet.

255
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,750
It will give us
the shortest route!

256
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,833
Really...? How do you know?

257
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,333
Because it looks like the
Grand Exile has the same

258
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,541
basic structure as the

259
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,083
Federation's Flagship,
the Impetus.

260
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,250
Jet-propelled shells...
Fire... now!

261
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,666
In eight seconds,
take a hard right...

262
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,000
five... four... three...
two... one... mark!

263
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,833
Left turn in six seconds...

264
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,625
four... three...
two... one... mark!

265
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,375
Right in five...

266
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,125
four... three...
two... one... mark!

267
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,000
Whoa!

268
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,750
Heh... It's about time we
got a piece of this action!

269
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,708
All right guys...
Let's show 'em what we got...

270
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,250
Firing!

271
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,750
Go Fam, we'll cover you!

272
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,750
Thanks you guys...
May the wind carry your wings!

273
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,500
Almost there...! Just ahead!

274
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,375
Dyan!

275
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,958
Whoa, this looks... unfinished.

276
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,041
Seems like it was abandoned
during construction...

277
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,208
Unbelievable.

278
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,166
All right then..

279
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,041
Train all guns on
their interior walls!

280
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,125
Draw the tentacles'
attention to us!

281
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,166
That's why I'm here...

282
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,500
Fire!

283
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,291
To unify the world...
to bring lasting peace...

284
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,291
There comes a point
when you must realize

285
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,041
that life is about more
than blindly following orders.

286
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,583
The Premier's
method will undoubtedly

287
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,000
produce the quickest results...

288
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,208
And you think this Exile
is going to fulfill that dream?

289
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,416
It's what the
premier himself wishes...

290
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,791
He issued these instructions...

291
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,083
Please, no more!
No more death!

292
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,583
It's my dream!
And I will chase it!
