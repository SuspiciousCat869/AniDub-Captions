1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,625
This will be the greatest battle
the world has ever seen.

2
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,333
Expect it to be
one of attrition.

3
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,916
We are ready to
take the next step.

4
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:00,125
The strength of the enemy's
military is as yet uncertain.

5
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:06,333
We shall prevail...
We have the ultimate weapon.

6
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,666
--Exile!
--Exile!

7
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,375
Bad move.

8
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,083
Those aren't their main fleets.

9
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,833
They're not Federation ships?

10
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,250
They are flying Federation
flags, but it's not Luscinia...

11
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,625
Looks like...

12
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:05,500
Those are the
Federation's main fleets!

13
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,500
We have to tell
Dyan immediately!

14
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,916
The Chaos fleet
sent into battle...

15
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,625
This is a great day
for our forces, Vimal.

16
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,750
Our first fight since
joining the Federation.

17
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,291
Yes...

18
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,375
we'll prove our worth by wiping
out Glacies single-handedly.

19
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,500
Status report!

20
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,458
Three miles to Glacies border...

21
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,916
Speed is eighty knots...
Estimated arrival, two minutes.

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,833
All hands to battle stations...!

23
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,250
Prepare for anti-Vanship combat!

24
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,541
Anti-Vanship combat!

25
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,750
Shell type: time-delay
incendiary spread.

26
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,208
There's a thundercloud
developing ahead!

27
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,875
Wonderful.

28
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,333
Crossing border.

29
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,000
A thundercloud?! No...!
It's Glacien fliers!

30
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,833
Dinesh! Secure target!

31
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,750
I can't! They're too fast!

32
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,916
What are these--?

33
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,541
Can't we go faster?

34
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,250
We're already at full speed.

35
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,708
We can only maintain
the full-boost

36
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,333
for another twenty seconds.

37
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,916
More than that and
the engine's toast!

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,208
C'mon, hang in a little longer.

39
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,250
Look! There they are!

40
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,416
We've lost eighty percent
of the vanguard fleets.

41
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,208
Defeat is not enough
for the Glaciens,

42
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,833
they want our total destruction.

43
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,208
I doubt the provincial fleets
can ever be reconstructed

44
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,458
after such a blow.

45
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,458
True... the best we can
do now is avenge them...

46
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,958
Fleet, prepare for
anti-aircraft combat...

47
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,916
Combat box formation.

48
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Prepare for
anti-aircraft combat!

49
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,833
Activate rapid-fire
control systems!

50
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,375
Fam... they're past
the border now...

51
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,791
Watch out for stray shells.

52
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,416
Roger, will do.

53
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,333
Over there!

54
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,208
Hold on, girl.
We're almost there!

55
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,083
Three more seconds... That's
all the boost we have left.

56
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,708
Then let's use it wisely!

57
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,958
The vanguard is just a decoy...!

58
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,666
The Third Fleet is behind it!

59
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,291
Armed with a new
anti-Vanship weapon!

60
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,750
I don't get it!
Why isn't she listening?

61
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,250
'Cause she doesn't understand!

62
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,291
Right...

63
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,416
Enemy squadrons
commencing attack runs!

64
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,041
Good. We have them now...

65
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,750
All ships, you may open fire!

66
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,333
All ships, open fire!

67
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,625
Attack successful.

68
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,583
It's too early to celebrate.
Continue the assault...

69
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,375
Destroy every one of them.

70
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,833
We've gotten the signal
from the Third Fleet.

71
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,916
So it's finally
my turn, is it...?

72
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,958
You better have left me at least
some enemy ships, Orang...

73
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,958
You're tarnishing my reputation.

74
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,333
All ships, third combat speed!

75
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,041
Destroy the enemy,
to the last ship...!

76
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,208
We shall avenge
the provincial fleets!

77
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,291
That's the Federation's
Fourth Fleet...

78
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,583
They're led by Sorush the Swift.

79
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,375
You need to get out of there!

80
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,875
Excellent results.

81
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,791
Indeed... Send word
of this back home.

82
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,500
Land offensives aren't
generally my area,

83
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,541
but today I'll make
an exception...

84
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,875
Target the Glacies stronghold!

85
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,791
Combat positions!
Shell type, incendiary spread!

86
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,625
You're outgunned...!
Let's get out of here!

87
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,000
I want to thank you.

88
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,875
Yeah...

89
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,750
Last Exile.

90
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,250
Now that all their Vanships
are out of the way,

91
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,625
our next target--

92
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,833
All aircraft...!
Take evasive action!

93
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,916
Commence bombardment!

94
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,291
Commence bombardment!

95
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,500
First Squadron,
target Block A-one!

96
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,250
Second Squad...!
Block B-three...! Take it!

97
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,625
We never suspected they were
hiding such heavy weaponry...

98
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,333
How careless.

99
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,666
Let's go!

100
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,125
Seems we're just in time...

101
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,666
Let's show Glacies what the
Swift Fleet is capable of!

102
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,500
The Fourth Fleet has
joined the battle, sir.

103
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,125
Sorush the Swift:
ever true to his title.

104
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,250
I'm so worried... I hope
they'll be all right.

105
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,291
I'm sure they'll
be fine... Really.

106
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,750
This is awful...
It's an actual war now...

107
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,125
The whole world, nothing
but war, wherever you go...

108
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,250
It's hard to believe
this is the same world

109
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,083
that held the Grand Race
just ten years ago...

110
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,458
This isn't how things
are supposed to be!

111
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,041
We're on our own... It's just
the three of us again.

112
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,916
The Glacies counterattack

113
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
has taken out six percent
of the Second Fleet,

114
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,208
but our offensive continues
to progress smoothly.

115
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,416
First thing we need to
do is find the Silvius.

116
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,416
Hope nothing bad's
happened to them.

117
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,666
C'mon, it's the Reaper!
They're fine!

118
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,291
Yeah, good point...

119
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,000
but where do you
think they are?

120
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,333
Should we find this
"Anatoray" place of theirs?

121
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,208
Maybe, but all I really know is
that it's super far to the east.

122
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,083
We need more information...

123
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,583
Maybe we should
return to Kartoffel

124
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,166
before doing anything else.

125
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,750
Are we good on fuel?

126
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,458
No... We'll need
to stop somewhere.

127
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,250
Cool... We'll drop in on
some nearby Sky Pirates...

128
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,875
Sound good, Millia?

129
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,541
Oh... Yes.

130
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,375
Please, Mother...
Keep our people safe...

131
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,166
As we forge a better world...
lend us your strength.

132
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,458
Is all of this bloodshed
truly necessary...?

133
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,416
Have we not already gained
more than enough territory

134
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,291
for our people to settle?

135
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,208
If this continues...

136
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,125
...the Augusta will be
branded a mass murderer!

137
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,416
The invasion of Glacies
is going according to plan...

138
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,208
Casualties on our side
are within expected limits.

139
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,666
And the status of
the vanguard force?

140
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,500
Glacien air defenses were more
devastating than we thought...

141
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,041
Batos... Rhaetus...
Ta Opisthen...

142
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,541
...and the Chaos squadrons
were all destroyed...

143
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,625
There were no surviving ships.

144
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,666
Milady!

145
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,250
I trust you're
all holding up well?

146
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,250
We are, my lady...

147
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,833
We surviving citizens of Chaos

148
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,000
are too strong to
be brought low.

149
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,041
Vimal... Dinesh...
Anand... Shiva...

150
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,708
Vasant, is something the matter?

151
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,541
[in Russian]

152
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,791
We've detected no
movement within three miles.

153
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,041
Excellent...
Most of our work is done...

154
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,500
Contact the main fleets...

155
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,375
Inform them that we're now
heading for the Glacien in--

156
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,666
What is that?!

157
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,291
Altitude at five-zero...

158
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,333
They've gone beyond our
battleships' service ceilings!

159
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,208
We weren't prepared for this!

160
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,791
A White... Legacy...

161
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,000
All ships...!
Armor-piercing shells!

162
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,125
Prepare for fleet-wide salvo!

163
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,166
Armor-piercing shells...!
Prepare for fleet-wide salvo!

164
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,833
All ships, target
the wall's central eye!

165
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,958
Fleet-wide order... open fire!

166
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,875
Open fire!

167
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,666
Did we get it?

168
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,875
All ships... evasive action!

169
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,416
All ships,
full astern, full astern!

170
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,125
The Second Fleet's Kumbha and
Nikumbha have been destroyed,

171
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,125
along with Fourth Fleet's
Subhadra and Singh!

172
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,375
Six ships from the
Second Fleet are down.

173
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,041
Severe damage to four others.

174
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,791
Eight Fourth Fleet ships down.

175
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,666
Severe damage to two others.

176
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,125
Third Fleet
returning to battle lines!

177
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,041
Have all ships temporarily
withdraw to the border.

178
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,541
Aye, sir!

179
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,375
Lady Liliana.

180
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,500
Premier Luscinia
has called for you.

181
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,250
Wind speed, wind direction,
and our position is...

182
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,166
We should probably
ease up a bit, Fam.

183
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,125
We're running on fumes, here.

184
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,041
How's that?

185
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,166
Even more... Slow as possible.

186
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,833
So... how long until
we reach the

187
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,666
Pirates in whatever it's called?

188
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,125
In Spargel... not long now.

189
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,166
And they'll help us,
just like that?

190
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,541
Yeah. Remember...

191
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,125
"May the wind carry
wings that become lost."

192
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,083
At the very least,
they'll refuel us.

193
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,416
Sky dwellers
look out for each other.

194
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,875
Hey... there it is!

195
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,958
Adjust speed to
one-hundred-thirty knots.

196
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,416
Roger that.

197
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,291
Approach course...
three degrees port.

198
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,250
Three degrees port... Got it.

199
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,041
Lookout tower spotted...

200
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,250
Gigi, request
permission to land.

201
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,541
Roger.

202
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,541
Huh...

203
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,708
Something wrong?

204
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,083
I'm not getting a response.

205
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,500
There's the lookout,
try it again!

206
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,875
I've got a bad
feeling about this...

207
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,833
Fam, pitch five degrees up.

208
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,416
Five degrees up!

209
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,625
Make ready for approach.

210
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,791
What happened here...?
Were they bombed?

211
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,416
But... by who?

212
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,291
These marks were left by the
main guns of a battleship.

213
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,416
That can't be right...
It's impossible.

214
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,416
Ades ships
can't climb this high.

215
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,916
It seems they can now...
a new weapon, maybe?

216
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,333
Kartoffel's in danger!

217
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,708
Fleet losses now
surpassing ten percent!

218
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,666
You have no qualms?

219
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,625
Not at this point... My hands
are already bloodstained.

220
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,041
[in Russian]

221
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,958
Hexad of stars,
shining in the heavens...

222
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:05,791
[in Russian]

223
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,208
Guide us to a
place of new birth...

224
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:13,958
a sacred surface of blue...
a land of plenty.

225
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,750
Fam, we need to stay calm.

226
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,458
Yeah... sorry.

227
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,708
What was that
about staying calm?

228
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,333
Y... Yeah.

229
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,916
Please, Lily...!
This is madness!

230
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,583
Have you forgotten what
these people did to Turan?!

231
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,041
I do this for the good
of the whole world.

232
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,250
I hoped it would
not be this way...

233
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,000
I therefore strip
you of your title...

234
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,250
From this day on,

235
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,250
you are neither Turan
royalty, nor my sister.

236
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,500
How could you?!

237
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,916
The next time we meet will
be on the field of battle.

238
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,291
If the Federation was
behind this attack...

239
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,166
does that mean
Luscinia's intention

240
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,833
really is to destroy
everything...?

241
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,833
And with Lily by his side?

242
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,750
Hey, Millia, let's go!

243
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,291
C'mon, we've been here
too long already!

244
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,375
East-southeast
winds... Force two...

245
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,166
Heading,
one-six-five.

246
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,250
Altitude, three thousand...
Increase to cruising speed.

247
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,916
Roger! Kartoffel, here we come!

248
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,833
Uh... do you hear that noise?

249
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:33,833
What is that?!

250
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,833
It looks like it's
headed for Glacies.

251
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,125
What?

252
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,750
Lily, no...

253
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,750
Please stop this...!

254
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,958
Lily!

255
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,291
How pretty!

256
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,291
These were some of the flowers
strewn throughout the capitol

257
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,625
on the day of the Augusta's
peace conference.

258
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,833
I've pressed them
to keep them preserved.

259
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,250
Wow!... You must
really treasure them.

260
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,750
Yes!... Oh, and, look!...

261
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,375
This is a handkerchief
she used at a dinner party...

262
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,125
...and this is a
sample from the ground

263
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,791
she stood on when she
declared peace!

264
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,041
You actually saved
a clump of dirt?

265
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,125
Of course!

266
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:46,208
Augusta Farahnaz
meant everything to me!
