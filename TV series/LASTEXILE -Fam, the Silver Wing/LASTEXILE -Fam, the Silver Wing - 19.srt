1
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:40,583
I'm sorry, Father...

2
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,791
Luscinia!

3
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,916
I swear... you will pay for
this!

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,375
If it's your wish to kill me,
Princess, by all means, do so.

5
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,916
But before you pull the trigger,

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,583
you should know that killing me
now will not end the war...

7
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,083
Indeed, it would only
lead to greater chaos

8
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,708
and more bloodshed...

9
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,458
A fierce power
struggle would begin

10
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:09,583
for the title of
Federation Premier.

11
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,166
One death always
leads to another...

12
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,125
Humanity does not yet
know how to break

13
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:20,708
its perpetual chain of revenge.

14
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,666
But, Princess...

15
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,375
If you are confident
that your rule

16
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,833
would establish peace for all...

17
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,375
Then do it.

18
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,958
Save this forsaken
world in my place...

19
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,958
so the dream may live.

20
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,666
Queening Square.

21
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,666
Oh, Lily...

22
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,833
How could I have been
so blind to everything...?

23
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,000
I didn't know what
you were doing...

24
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,291
or the burden you
were forced to bear.

25
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,875
How long have you had to endure

26
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,625
the dreadful weight
of this knowledge...?

27
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,791
The memories you
inherit as a "Key."

28
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,583
People everywhere will always
repeat their mistakes...

29
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,500
will always fall to despair.

30
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:48,583
Always... No matter what...
It's inevitable...

31
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:52,666
Even knowing that,
you sacrificed yourself...

32
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,916
You suffered so that
others could be saved.

33
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,458
I'm so stupid.

34
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,958
I didn't understand anything...

35
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,625
I thought if we could
all just get along

36
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,333
then all the hatred and
anger would disappear...

37
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:23,083
and the whole world
would finally be at peace.

38
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,333
[in Russian]

39
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,208
I am sorry for what
happened to Liliana.

40
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,125
With her, hope for
a truce died as well...

41
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,041
I deeply regret that this is so.

42
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,458
You fully expected something
like this would happen

43
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,625
from the very beginning,
didn't you?

44
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,583
You only went along
with the truce so easily

45
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,375
because you knew it was
gonna fall apart again!

46
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,083
This was honestly not how I
had hoped things would end...

47
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,500
I had the same wish as you...

48
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:51,708
...after all this time... that
the world had found true peace.

49
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,541
However...

50
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,041
I didn't confuse
hope with reality...

51
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,416
...so, I knew...
peace was not to be.

52
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,375
Please, look after
Princess Millia...

53
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,375
I know it's what
Liliana would wish.

54
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,375
If you really
wanted peace so badly,

55
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,750
then why did you
go and start a war?!

56
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,708
Because I felt
it was necessary...

57
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,500
What other reason
can I possibly give?

58
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,333
Think on that...

59
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:29,166
You should do what you
feel is necessary, as well.

60
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,541
We cannot stop now,

61
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,750
otherwise Liliana's sacrifice
will have been in vain.

62
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,000
Indeed... This is our
final opportunity to atone

63
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,708
for the sin of surviving
that day ten years ago.

64
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,666
Very well... proceed as planned.

65
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,875
Should one
of us falter or fall...

66
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,541
...the other will
continue to the end.

67
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,708
The first and second fleets
are departing already?

68
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,083
That seems awful quick.

69
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,375
They didn't
inform us about this.

70
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,625
Have the Second Fleet
take the lead.

71
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,916
Meanwhile, we will see
to guarding the rear

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,166
and keeping the
volunteer forces in check...

73
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,875
Should they strike,
counterattack at once.

74
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,500
Aye, Sir!

75
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,666
It appears the Urbanus
won't arrive for

76
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,333
a few more days yet, Captain.

77
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,916
Getting a late start...

78
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,708
This truce is
messier than expected...

79
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,375
Dio, what would you do?

80
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,208
Not sure, whatever happens,
happens, right?

81
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,416
This is the Bridge, go ahead.

82
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,000
All of Luscinia's fleets
are on the move...

83
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,666
No advance notice or
request for clearan--!

84
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,500
Sh-Shouldn't we stop them?

85
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,166
We haven't been given
an attack order yet!

86
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,166
If we let them go now,
Luscinia will win!

87
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,041
So the truce has
fallen apart already.

88
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,250
Hold fire...

89
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,166
Do not attack until we've
learned their true intentions...

90
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,333
Where's Orang?

91
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,958
He's on his way to
the Admirari, General.

92
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,458
Get the fleet ready
to sail now...

93
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,291
To sail... but not
to fire, understood?

94
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,666
Aye-aye!

95
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,750
Luscinia... You won't
even mourn her properly?

96
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,541
Vasant!

97
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,291
What's happened?

98
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,541
Everything's fine...

99
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,125
I can assure you,
there is nothing

100
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,208
to be concerned about,
Your Majesty.

101
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,958
Although... things may be
getting a bit hectic soon...

102
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,458
...so it might be best if you
would move to a different sh--

103
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,583
No!

104
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,916
Please, Vasant...!

105
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,875
Just tell me what's really
happening out there...!

106
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,708
I know I'm still young...

107
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,875
...and I know I might
not understand it all...

108
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,250
...but I need to know!

109
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:12,791
I'm the Augusta...! I'll order
you to tell me if I have to!

110
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,500
Please, Your Majesty I--

111
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,125
I can't stand it...!

112
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,416
My people are out there
getting hurt and dying,

113
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,125
and I'm waiting here,
left in the dark...! Tell me!

114
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,666
Please accept my deepest
apologies, Majesty.

115
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,375
Yes, of course...

116
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,583
Gloria, Augusta...
I'm at your mercy...

117
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,500
From now on, I will--

118
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,708
I'm certain you know why
I'm here... Come, Augusta.

119
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,791
Don't move...! Guards,
in here...! Stop him!

120
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,250
Why fight?

121
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,500
Or have you
forgotten what I am...?

122
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,416
Surely you haven't.

123
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,166
Come with me, dear Augusta.

124
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,791
Luscinia!

125
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,833
Augusta... I'm sorry.

126
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,000
Last Exile.

127
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,916
Luscinia's done what?!

128
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,916
All of his fleets
are on the move...

129
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,583
They're ignoring every signal
our fleet sends to them.

130
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:03,041
What about Vasant...?
Has she issued any orders yet?

131
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,541
No, none at all.
We've lost contact with her.

132
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,791
Everything's so chaotic...
We have no idea what's going on!

133
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,458
This way!

134
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,750
Hurry!

135
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,791
(in Russian)

136
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,208
It's looking like we have to go
on the run again for a while...

137
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,916
Sorry... How are you...? Okay?

138
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,791
Never mind about me...
Are you hurt?

139
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,000
Dio!

140
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,666
Stay down, Al!

141
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,333
Luscinia...

142
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,416
Thank you, Al...
You're a life-saver.

143
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,125
But Dio, I didn't--
What do you mean?

144
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,541
I have succeeded in rescuing our

145
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,666
beloved leader from
the traitor scum...

146
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,625
Now, fly her flag!

147
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,166
We can expect
their immediate pursuit...

148
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,708
I'll let you deal with that...

149
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,458
I will travel north with the
Augusta as previously planned.

150
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,375
Have a Vanship ready.

151
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,875
Aye, sir!

152
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,583
I believe that this truly will
be the decisive battle...

153
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,583
After this, the world will
finally know peace...

154
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,958
Just as Farahnaz had wished.

155
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,916
Indeed... As soon
as this battle is over,

156
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,250
I intend to retire
from active service...

157
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,666
I'll let Augusta
Sara and the

158
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,000
youngsters take
care of the rest.

159
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,791
Admiral, you have
my sincerest gratitude.

160
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,875
No 'thank you's' yet, Premier...

161
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,750
It's too soon...
Wait until this is over.

162
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,500
Indeed.

163
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,791
Alauda...

164
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,958
When the premier returns,
he will bring with him

165
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,250
the power to make world
peace a reality at last.

166
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,125
These traitors sought
to corrupt the Augusta...

167
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:24,208
Give them the justice they
deserve...! Gloria, Augusta!

168
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,875
Gloria, Augusta!

169
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,250
The--the Impetus is
flying the Augusta's flag!

170
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,666
Again, Luscinia...?

171
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,000
How many times must you

172
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,708
act in defiance of
our leader's wishes...?

173
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:42,666
We must rescue the
Augusta...! Full speed ahead!

174
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,083
This is horrible.

175
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,208
I'm gonna go, too...!
I'll get Sara to safety!

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,291
Good, I will remain here and try
to get things back in order...

177
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,500
At the least, we need to
establish the chain of command.

178
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,250
Millia!

179
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,041
I'm really sorry...

180
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,583
I should've thought
more about how

181
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,041
other people felt
during all this.

182
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,125
Dyan's need for revenge...

183
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:34,333
Your intense suffering...
I couldn't understand it...

184
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,208
Worse... I never even tried.

185
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,666
I forced all of my
dreams onto you...

186
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,500
...even though you were
carrying so much already.

187
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,458
Just like with Dyan.

188
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,500
I wasn't thinking...

189
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,416
All I could see was what
I wanted to happen...

190
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,541
Another Grand Race was
all that mattered to me.

191
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,583
I never even really thought
about how we could do it...

192
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,000
I guess I just
figured it would all

193
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,458
magically come together somehow.

194
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,916
Like there was nothing
more to it than that.

195
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,125
So, it's not much...
but I'm sorry...

196
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,625
I had to at least tell you that.

197
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,166
Wait!

198
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,083
I should have given
it back sooner.

199
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,791
Fam...

200
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,958
It's only because of you, that
I was able to make it this far.

201
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:36,208
Your dream gave me the hope
I needed to continue trying...

202
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,000
Without it, I would've
given up long ago...

203
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:43,166
I would've abandoned my own
dream of rebuilding my kingdom.

204
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:50,000
We'll do it... We'll have
a Grand Race... I promise!

205
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,708
Millia...

206
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,166
Hey, don't forget about me,
we're all in this together...

207
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,000
No matter what
the future might hold,

208
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,000
we'll never let go of our dream!

209
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,666
That's right!

210
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,333
All ships, change formation!

211
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,208
Obliterate the
treacherous enemy!

212
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,458
Are you still so
determined to fight

213
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,875
against the dream
of true peace?!

214
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,291
Where is she?
What happened to Vasant?

215
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:24,916
I humbly welcome your return to
the Grand Exile... Maestro Sara.

216
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,583
What do you mean?

217
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,666
I do this in order
to save the world...

218
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,416
...to make Augusta Farahnaz's

219
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,625
peaceful dream
a reality at last.

220
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,416
That which slumbers
deeply in the land of snow...

221
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,750
...a faint and distant promise
which guides those who are lost.

222
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,833
A vast ocean
brimming with stars...

223
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,375
The far-reaching path of
those who have departed.

224
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,083
The dream delivered
only by the angels of war...

225
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,583
...a beacon... a shining
symbol of hope and life...

226
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,875
The Grand Exile.

227
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,125
At the far end of the world...
lie snow-white wings...

228
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,708
...which surpass everything
in their greatness.

229
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,958
These wretches must pay for

230
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,583
desecrating the
Augusta's dream...!

231
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,833
Ours is a just cause!

232
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,166
We must fight in
the name of the Augusta...!

233
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,541
As always, we are
her obedient swords!

234
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,458
Do not let a
single ship through.

235
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,041
All ships, keep the pressure on!

236
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,875
Sara...!

237
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,791
Let us go forth...

238
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,500
...abandoning the
ancient land of strife...

239
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,291
Seeking bountiful skies
and everlasting seas.

240
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,416
Pray for good tailwinds to carry

241
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,833
the wings of the beloved child
bound for a new world.

242
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,708
Fly strong... Fly high.

243
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,416
Claudia Unit down!

244
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,958
Helm inoperable!
Losing altitude quickly!

245
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,666
Target the Third Fleet's
flagship, the Admirari...!

246
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,666
Let's put an end to them,
once and for all!

247
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,250
Fire!

248
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,083
What the... heck is--

249
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,125
Stop fussing, I'll be fine...

250
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,625
Are the others all right?

251
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,000
Yes, sir.

252
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,833
Your Majesty.

253
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,750
We will arrive at the
skirmish point shortly.

254
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:23,916
Whatever we may face,

255
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
failure in this battle
is not an option.

256
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,458
Understood! I shall do
everything in my power

257
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,208
to ensure a favorable outcome.

258
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,166
All forces,
Type 1 battle stations!

259
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,666
All ships, full speed ahead!

260
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,666
Roger.

261
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,458
Vince...

262
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,625
Yes?

263
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,916
These people we're
about to fight for...

264
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,375
...do they even know who we are?

265
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,333
Uh.. All hands to
Type 1 battle stations!

266
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,791
All ships, full speed ahead!
