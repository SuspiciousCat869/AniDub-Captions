1
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,166
Now passing Saman Lookout...

2
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,375
Speed, one-eighty...

3
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,416
Bearing correction,
five degrees starboard.

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,291
Distance to royal city
Iglasia is four hundred.

5
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,666
Roger that.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,541
These are strategic
instructions pertaining

7
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,333
to the defense of the capitol.

8
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,750
It is crucial that you deliver
it to Father personally.

9
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,250
You're telling me to
get off the Lahsas

10
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,791
and continue to
Iglahsia without you?

11
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:58,625
I won't do it...! I want to
stay beside you and fight.

12
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,041
Millia.

13
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,000
Please. Our father
needs you by his side.

14
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,125
That is your place right now.

15
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,500
But, Lily...

16
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:15,125
I will meet up with
you in Iglasia.

17
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,458
Promise me you'll be careful.

18
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,833
Take care of her.

19
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,041
You're sure this is
what you wanna do...?

20
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,666
You don't think a Turan pilot

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,500
would be a better
choice for this?

22
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,083
I don't believe so.

23
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:38,000
You two can out-fly anyone in
these skies... Isn't that right?

24
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,541
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

25
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,583
Gotta admire how observant
the princess is.

26
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:48,291
Didn't take her any time to
notice how talented I am.

27
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,375
Are you okay? Feeling scared?

28
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,375
No... I am most
certainly not scared...

29
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,000
I just don't know
how comfortable I am

30
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,500
putting our fate in the
hands of Sky Pirates.

31
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,291
We'll be entering
a jet stream soon...

32
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,125
Please hold onto Fam for safety.

33
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,583
Jet st--? Ahh!

34
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,541
What's going on?!

35
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,333
Fool's mate.

36
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,166
As far as compensating
you for your services...

37
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,083
We are prepared to offer
twenty tons of wheat,

38
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,000
and forty tons of Claudia ore.

39
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,541
Additionally, we will grant your
people the right to trade freely

40
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,916
in Turan territory
for two years.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,541
Sounds fair enough...

42
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,625
In exchange, you have my word
Kartoffel will spare no effort

43
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,333
to assist Turan
in this struggle.

44
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,041
--Princess! Princess!
--Over here! Look!

45
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,333
--Let me have your autograph!
---Woo-hoo! Love you!

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,750
I thank you...

47
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,333
Under different circumstances,

48
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,583
this ship would
already belong to you.

49
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,208
Even with her wings clipped,

50
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,541
the Lasas is still
a beautiful vessel.

51
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,083
Indeed.

52
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,333
And don't worry; Kartoffel
will take good care of

53
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,333
any of your soldiers who
were wounded in the battle.

54
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,125
Huh?

55
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,041
Good tailwinds, Princess.

56
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,583
Right... I leave both
my sister and soldiers

57
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,583
in your capable hands.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,166
The Fam Fan Fan is
the obvious choice...

59
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,750
Uh... huh?

60
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,708
You know, the ship you
and your sister gave us.

61
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,916
I'm planning on renaming it just
as soon as this battle's over.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,583
Exiting the jet stream
in fifty seconds.

63
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,666
That's ridiculous. You can't...!

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,708
Our flagship already has
a perfectly good name.

65
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,625
Don't go calling
it something stupid!

66
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,083
Pretty rude callin'
someone's name "stupid."

67
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,583
Someone's name...?

68
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,750
Well, yeah... That's
her name. Or, sort of...

69
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,083
Down to ten seconds, Fam.

70
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,833
What do you mean, sort of?!

71
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,250
My name is Fam Fan Fan.
And yours is Giselle Collette.

72
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,250
Three... Two... One. Mark!

73
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,458
Let's go!

74
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,958
So, it's settled...

75
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,708
As of tomorrow, the Lasas
becomes the Fam Fan Fan.

76
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,625
No! I refuse to accept that.

77
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,791
Uh, too bad, 'cause the ship
kinda belongs to me now...

78
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,000
That was my agreement
with Princess Lily.

79
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,833
My sister is a kind,
caring, wonderful woman.

80
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,416
Yeah, I could totally tell
when I met her... And?

81
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,875
And, I can't let you take
advantage of the situation,

82
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,083
and rename the Lasas
without her knowing!

83
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,875
We've received updated
reports from Fort Zwiebel...

84
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,833
According to them,
the Federation fleets have

85
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,125
regrouped over
the Bolur Islands.

86
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,625
They're continuing their
advance on Iglasia.

87
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,541
So, we're looking at six
ship-of-the-line fleets

88
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,541
along with four
siege ship fleets.

89
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,875
Now we got siege
ships involved, too?

90
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,500
And that marker
represents the Impetus.

91
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,708
I also got word of
their progress...

92
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,708
Sounds like they've just
passed Saman Lookout.

93
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,541
Slower than I'd expect.

94
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,500
Their fourth fleet
is amazingly swift,

95
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,916
but otherwise, Federation
ships are rather sluggish.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,666
Their firepower and armor are
nothing to sneeze at, though.

97
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,916
We shall strike the Impetus
with the Lasas herself!

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,125
We will pierce the heart of the
enemy with a decisive blow...

99
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,791
It will cripple them...

100
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,500
All we need to focus on is
taking out Premier Hafez.

101
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,875
The other fleets will
crumble quickly enough.

102
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,750
Can you walk?

103
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,375
Of course I can...
I don't need help from you.

104
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,916
Due to heavy fog in
the Belhall region,

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,916
the 1502 flight to Madiran
will now be stopping at Huelva.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,250
The Madiran flight is over here!
We need to hurry!

107
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,791
--We were so worried!
--Make way!

108
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,916
This is a private ship.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,666
Has His Majesty still not left?

110
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,208
Princess Millia!

111
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,458
Marianne!

112
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,916
Thank goodness you're all right!

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,375
Everything will be fine...

114
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,375
I'm back now, and I'm not
going to let the Federation

115
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,416
lay a hand on Turan.

116
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,791
Right.

117
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,375
Please, don't worry.

118
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,875
My sister has entrusted me with
a way to protect the kingdom.

119
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,833
We will not fall to them.

120
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,708
Millia...

121
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,375
Oh, Father!

122
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,916
You're alive,
I've been so worried.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,916
Yes... and Lily's safe, too.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,416
She is...? Oh, thank goodness.

125
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,291
She says we must use this
to protect the royal city.

126
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,500
Liliana...

127
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,958
Evacuations have begun to try
and save our fair people...

128
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,125
But Millia, you must now
get to safety, as well.

129
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,958
What about you?

130
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,458
My duty is to see this
through to the end.

131
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,958
Then you must let me stay, too!

132
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,000
Even if all our land is taken,

133
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,833
Turan will not fall so long
as it has its ruler...

134
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:22,166
Dear... Millia. If only one of
us can survive, it must be you.

135
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,625
So this was what Lily had
planned from the beginning.

136
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,375
You girls are Sky Pirates, yes?

137
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,416
We are.

138
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Come.

139
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:36,000
You have my thanks for bringing
my daughter safely home.

140
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,458
Oh... it was nothin'.

141
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,958
Liliana would not
lightly entrust her sister

142
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,458
to someone else's hands.

143
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:46,000
You must be very
skilled pilots indeed.

144
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:51,500
Now I ask... Will you
keep protecting her?

145
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,208
Yes.

146
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,750
Of course.

147
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,708
I hope you will accept that
ring as a small payment...

148
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:04,291
Take her to the imperial villa
in the east, out of harm's way.

149
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,000
Father, no!

150
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,333
Don't cry, my dear...

151
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:13,250
You are our only hope,
Millia, please be strong...

152
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:18,208
The fate of our nation now
lies in your capable hands.

153
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,250
A father... huh.

154
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,583
Why can't they all
just run away together?

155
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,833
Do what...?

156
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,291
The Princesses,
and their father--

157
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,416
they should all try to escape!

158
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,791
If the kingdom survives
but its king dies,

159
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,541
all this is for nothing!

160
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,416
You know I'm right, Gigi.

161
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,125
I'm ready... We can go now.

162
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,208
ETA at Turan,
eighteen hundred hours...

163
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,750
Main Turan forces
have been deployed

164
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,791
to the fore of the royal city.

165
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,875
They'll fight to the death.

166
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,416
King Turan is no fool.

167
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,958
He knows the objective
of this battle.

168
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,750
He knows our goal
is annihilation.

169
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,708
All craft, to
battle stations!

170
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,208
Use all necessary force to
destroy their army and capital.

171
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,083
Today we show our
resolve to the world!

172
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,375
Our enemy will be
watching the skies...

173
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,666
The Federation favors
visual patrols...

174
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,125
And their spotting
technology is bar none.

175
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,666
But if our ruse has worked,

176
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,500
and they believe the Lasas
has sunk into the Grand Lake,

177
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,541
we should be able to
catch them off guard.

178
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,541
If we locate the Impetus
before they spot our approach...

179
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,208
our victory will be assured.

180
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,458
Impetus sighted.

181
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,166
Currently five miles
off Cape Aster,

182
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,833
heading South towards Iglasia.

183
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,458
Instruct all ships:
go to silent running...

184
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,333
Our only target is
Luscinia's command ship...

185
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,625
We must bring down the Impetus!

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,833
Last Exile.

187
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,833
Luscinia Hafez is
our sole target!

188
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,916
Destroy him at all cost!

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,125
A Turan fleet... Fifteen ships,
including the Lasas.

190
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,875
So then she did survive.

191
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,625
Luscinia...

192
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,500
Full ramming speed!
Destroy the Impetus!

193
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,875
Enemy flagship
approaching from above!

194
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,541
Evade, now!

195
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,375
All right! They've got 'em!

196
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,291
What happened to the Lasas?!

197
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,708
Roughly two hundred miles
to the Eastern villa...

198
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,916
Should take us about four hours.

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,083
You think we should stop
by Kartoffel first...?

200
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,833
They're still tending
to the Turan soldiers

201
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,416
who were wounded in battle.

202
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,041
You gotta stay strong,
Princess, like your father said.

203
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,166
You can't reassure your people

204
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,833
with that hopeless
look on your face.

205
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,625
I am well aware of
that, thank you.

206
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,833
'Course you are.

207
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,750
Okay! Let's get going!

208
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,791
Dio?!

209
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,375
They've taken Princess Lily!

210
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,791
They have my sister?!

211
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,875
The Lasas bridge crew
was slaughtered...

212
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,250
My best guess...

213
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,708
whoever took her must've
brought her to the Impetus.

214
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,750
Will you save her?

215
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,541
Please...! We have
to do something!

216
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,958
We have to save my sister...!

217
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,416
You have to take me to
that ship... right now!

218
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,750
Princess Millia?

219
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,916
They're going kill her,
I know it...

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,583
I beg you... please
rescue my sister.

221
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,958
She's all I have left.

222
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,625
Gigi! You familiar with the
inner-workings of the Impetus?

223
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,958
We're goin' in.

224
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,333
Roger!

225
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,875
Well...? Can we enter
from the flight deck?

226
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,375
Doubtful. That's where her
defenses are most concentrated.

227
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,083
Our best bet is between
the rotary propellers.

228
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,125
I'll act as a decoy.

229
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,625
Sir! Sky Pirate ships below!

230
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,750
Forget 'em! The only weapons
they have are harpoons.

231
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,250
Time to dive into the Skyfish!

232
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,666
We're going in there?
Seriously?!

233
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,708
Ahh!

234
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,541
Turning right.

235
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,500
No, Fam! Go back!

236
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,000
Claudia ships have five
ventilation shafts ahead...

237
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,833
Enter the pipe at nine o'clock.

238
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,250
Roger that!

239
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,791
Maintain current speed,
then take a hard right in six...

240
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:29,375
five... four... three...
two... one... now!

241
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,625
Huh...? A main passageway?

242
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,541
Maybe they're doing repair work?

243
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,916
We need to find a map
of the ship somewhere.

244
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,583
Through the lower
deck Claudia tanks

245
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,666
and parametron computation room,

246
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,333
up the main artillery hoist
elevator, and then let's see...

247
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,375
Through the cooling
tower and air ducts.

248
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,666
Can we do it?

249
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,041
Yeah but I think we ought to
keep using the vents...

250
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,958
They should get us there.

251
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,083
Are you okay?

252
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:14,208
I'm fine... Don't worry about
me. Worry about my sister.

253
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:18,625
I promise... we will find a
way to rescue Princess Lily.

254
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,583
We've lost sight of
the Sky Pirate ship...

255
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,958
Last seen near the vents.

256
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,333
Send gunners to every exit!
Eliminate them on sight!

257
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,208
Two...! One! Turn now!

258
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,375
So, you must be--!

259
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,708
Luscinia Hafez!

260
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,958
I'm here for my sister...
You will release her at once!

261
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,250
They're coming this way!

262
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,500
Send gunners!

263
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,708
Permission to fire, sir?

264
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,791
Hold...! Silence, men.
Do not fire.

265
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,083
Are you familiar
with the Exiles?

266
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,000
They are detestable ships...

267
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,791
Emigrant vessels from
the cataclysmic days...

268
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,916
They took those who
wished to flee this world

269
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,625
and carried them to the
furthest reaches of the sky.

270
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,000
When the time of
peril had passed,

271
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,208
they returned as if
it was their right...

272
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,250
as if they hadn't turned
their backs and fled.

273
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,708
But there was no place for
them here any longer...

274
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,791
no land for those cowards who
abandoned their home world

275
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,958
at the time of its
greatest suffering.

276
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,083
I did not come here to
listen to a history lecture.

277
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,875
Now, bring out my sister!

278
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,750
You people should
never have returned.

279
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,375
This is not your home.

280
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,416
Liliana!

281
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,375
Millia... you need
to put the gun down.

282
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,416
What are you doing?

283
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,625
Enough, Luscinia... you win...

284
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,208
Turan surrenders to
the Ades Federation.

285
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,875
Don't, Lily...

286
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,541
I ask but one thing...

287
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,958
Let no harm come to my sister.

288
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:11,083
Unfortunately, surrender
is not an option.

289
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,500
There is only one way
our world can know peace.

290
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,250
The nations of returned
emigrants must fall.

291
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,375
Some must die so
others may live.

292
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,416
That is your true
objective in this...?

293
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,458
You seek only annihilation?!

294
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,166
Have you forgotten
everything...?

295
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,541
Forgotten the sorrow of the
Grand Race? Farahnaz's dream?

296
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,375
I told you to let her go!

297
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
"That which is born of your
waters... Your blue surface."

298
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,875
Wha... What's happening to her?

299
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,791
What have you done to my sister?

300
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:02,500
"United by a single word...
Joined by a single wish."

301
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,541
Lily!

302
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:16,625
You see... This is my true
objective, Liliana!

303
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,125
"May our serenity
be everlasting."

304
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,375
Fam!

305
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,083
What's going on?

306
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,333
Why are they retreating?

307
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,208
Is the attack over?

308
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,083
What is that?!

309
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,833
A new Federation weapon?

310
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,250
Fire...! Shoot it down!

311
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,791
An Exile...?!

312
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,583
Hold your fire!

313
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:41,708
You are a loyal man, and have
served me well... I thank you.

314
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,083
No, my liege...

315
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,166
Thank you for making my life
such a fulfilling one.

316
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,458
Very well.

317
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,833
O, Grand Lake, I pray...

318
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,958
Give the people of Turan
and my daughters

319
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,166
your protection through
all that is still to come.

320
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,416
Gigi...! Gigi!

321
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,458
I'm fine.

322
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,125
Where's the princess?

323
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,083
Millia!

324
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,583
Millia...

325
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,000
You know what, Millia?

326
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,166
Gigi's actually a
really good cook.

327
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,708
She's got a big family,
so she's always helping out.

328
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,708
Fam.

329
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,666
Potato pancakes
are her specialty!

330
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,291
They're pancakes
made out of potatoes!

331
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,541
There's not much land here,

332
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,250
so potatoes are about
all we can grow.

333
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,458
Fam, please.

334
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,333
Just wait until you
take a bite of one!

335
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,833
They're nice and warm and
fluffy and they make you feel

336
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,708
like you're being
hugged on the inside!

337
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,291
They'll cheer you
right up, Millia! I promise!
