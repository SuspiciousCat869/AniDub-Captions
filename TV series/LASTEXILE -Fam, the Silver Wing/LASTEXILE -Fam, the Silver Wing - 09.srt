1
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,166
A soldier is a sword...

2
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,625
and is used at its
wielder's discretion...

3
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,583
Our duty is a simple one...

4
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,958
We need only be mighty swords.

5
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,125
The one who wields
us is determined...

6
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,125
She will do anything
to achieve her goal...

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,000
She will stop at nothing...

8
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,291
even should her swords become

9
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,875
bloodstained and
broken in the process.

10
00:00:55,791 --> 00:01:00,125
And that... is what worries
me more than anything else.

11
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,416
Connected Passed Pawn.

12
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:55,833
♪ Hey there...! It's your
birthday...! Get happy! ♪

13
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,208
Happy birthday, Fam!

14
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,375
Fam, hello!

15
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,166
That's strange.

16
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,416
I can't believe it.
You're really leaving?

17
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,666
Well, we've captured
fifteen Federation ships...

18
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,375
just like we promised.

19
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, I know... still...

20
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,500
Don't worry...

21
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,416
I'll tell everyone in Kartoffel
why you're staying behind.

22
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,958
They'll understand.

23
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:11,291
This isn't right... Gigi...
I can't fly without you!

24
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,291
Why not ask Princess Millia?

25
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,750
She's very knowledgeable...

26
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,625
and at least she
has good judgment...

27
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,833
Something I'm missing.

28
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:25,125
I'm sorry... I'm just not...
fit to be your navi anymore.

29
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,375
I'm sure you and the
Princess'll be great together.

30
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,000
You're the best navi there is!

31
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,958
No, I'm not... I'm nothing.

32
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,375
Don't say that, Gigi!

33
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,833
You don't know anything, Fam!

34
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,375
I heard what happened...

35
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,291
Talk about a bad
first impression.

36
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,541
Encountering Glacies wasn't
exactly part of the plan.

37
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,333
We violated their airspace...

38
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,000
then fought inside
their territory...

39
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,833
We must seem like
total savages to them.

40
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,666
Conflict will be unavoidable.

41
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,166
Seems that way...

42
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,375
I doubt even offering the
Silvius as a gift would help.

43
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,208
Where's Vincent?

44
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,750
On his way now...
Can't wait to see his reaction.

45
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,166
He's in for a shock,

46
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,750
seeing the invincible
Silvius all beat up like this.

47
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,833
Do you know what would've helped
us avoid taking so much damage?

48
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,250
Having our Vanship squadron's
captain around for the fight.

49
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,875
It really would've helped
if you'd shown up sooner.

50
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,541
I know.

51
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,583
Is Millia here?

52
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,500
I burnt it! I'm sorry!

53
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,250
Hush!

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,750
Why are you trying to avoid Fam?

55
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,708
I'm too ashamed to face her.

56
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,416
But it weren't your
fault, Princess.

57
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:06,250
Tell me... what am I supposed
to do at a time like this?

58
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,083
I wish my sister was here...

59
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,166
She would have known
exactly how to handle it.

60
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,000
Soup's gettin' cold.

61
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,458
Delicious...

62
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,041
Verify system check!

63
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,875
Everything looks groovy!

64
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,625
"Groovy?" Really?

65
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,541
Yahoo!

66
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,125
Come on, Dio, cut it out!
We're not here to play games!

67
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,333
We're supposed to be
heading to the border!

68
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,833
I know that!

69
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,291
Oh, you do? Coulda fooled me...!

70
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,041
Fam, say something!
Hello...? Fam!

71
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,375
Impressive.

72
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,791
But they shouldn't bother us

73
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,541
as long as we stay
outside the border.

74
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,208
I'm not so sure...

75
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,958
They could come back
with reinforcements.

76
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,416
Let's get this done
quick, just in case.

77
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,916
A tweak here and there and
she'll be flying again...

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,666
A tough ship to bring
down... Good job.

79
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,208
Fam seems kind of upset, huh?

80
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,333
Well, fighting's a part
of life on the Silvius...

81
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,250
It's not like we're
making them stay...

82
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,583
If they don't like it, they
can leave anytime they want.

83
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,958
They're not officially part
of the crew or anything.

84
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,791
You gonna call it in?

85
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,458
Oh... yeah.

86
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,208
Recirculation valve repaired.

87
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,666
Roger that... Start the engine.

88
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,708
Starting engine!

89
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,833
Output increasing...!

90
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,958
Ten... Twenty...
forty percent, and...

91
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,625
Liftoff!

92
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,208
She's returning to Kartoffel?

93
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,291
Mm-hm...

94
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,000
What about you?

95
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,833
I never stopped being part
of the Silvius' crew...

96
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,541
I had a lot of fun
flying with you guys.

97
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,416
But my playtime is over now.

98
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,750
I see... Gigi is
set on going back.

99
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,833
We head out at fifteen
hundred hours...

100
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,500
We'll be going that
way for supplies,

101
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,375
so we can drop you off.

102
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,375
Thank you for
everything, ma'am...

103
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,416
I really appreciate it.

104
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,000
Giselle... Do you remember
the advice I gave you before?

105
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,833
That sometimes, in
order to do your job,

106
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,583
you have to say
what's on your mind.

107
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,583
I've been taking
Gigi for granted.

108
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,375
She's always been
there for me...

109
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,750
so I assumed she
always would be...

110
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,208
I never stopped to think about
what she might be feeling.

111
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,916
I've been there, too.

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,375
I had someone in my life who
was very important to me...

113
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,583
I took for granted he
would always be there.

114
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,541
I just assumed he felt
the same way I did.

115
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,083
I never actually asked
him about his feelings...

116
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,833
nor did I ever tell
him about mine.

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,250
Now he's gone,
and I'll never know.

118
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,416
Oh no! Careful, Princess!
Fire! It's on fire!

119
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,083
Let me!

120
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,291
Thanks, Gigi.

121
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,958
Sure.

122
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,291
Potato... pancakes?

123
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,833
Well... yes...
They're for Fam...

124
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,875
They're her favorite,
aren't they?

125
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,041
Sometimes having a tasty
meal cheers people up...

126
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,375
I thought you two could
eat them together.

127
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,583
I'm so sorry...
This was my issue...

128
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,458
Turan versus Ades...

129
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,708
I should never've
dragged you into it...

130
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,625
It's caused you and
Fam so much trouble.

131
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,041
I feel terrible!
Please forgive me!

132
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,750
No... Millia!

133
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,791
You have nothing
to be sorry for...

134
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,333
Really... That's just
the way Fam is.

135
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,000
She couldn't ignore--

136
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,833
You could've just taken
her away from there!

137
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,333
Let me be your wings.

138
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,083
If we've met our quota, we won't
need to stay on the Silvius.

139
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,458
We can go back
to Kartoffel, Fam.

140
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,708
I'm sorry...

141
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,708
I'm just not... fit to
be your navi anymore.

142
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,333
I'm sure you'll and the
Princess'll be great together.

143
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,375
She couldn't ignore you
when you needed help.

144
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,166
She's just not built for it.

145
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,000
What's the matter?

146
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,625
I've been so awful...

147
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,791
I was only thinking
about myself...

148
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,250
and I said such terrible things.

149
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,583
The look on her face...

150
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,458
I never meant to hurt her...

151
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,875
--I want to--
--I want to--

152
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,208
I want to make it
up to her somehow.

153
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,541
I know, me too!

154
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:15,125
I can't stand to see her
feeling that way, either.

155
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,500
It's settled then.
We'll do it together.

156
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,375
Right.

157
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,208
So let's think about this...

158
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,833
What can we do to cheer her up?

159
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,416
Duh...! Today's Fam's birthday!

160
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,958
It is? Really?

161
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,291
I can't believe I
forgot! I'm a jerk.

162
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,958
Although... The day
isn't over yet, you know.

163
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,041
Right!

164
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,750
Last Exile.

165
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,041
You guys!

166
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,791
Man, where is everyone?

167
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,625
Dio?

168
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,458
That's a tall order.

169
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,208
All righty... first thing...

170
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,791
Yeah, they jumped ship.

171
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,541
Could you not have
phrased that differently?

172
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,083
It's the truth.

173
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,791
The best ones are
nice and round--

174
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,541
still fresh
around the stem.

175
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,125
Smells wonderful!

176
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,708
A gallon of milk and all of your
oranges and potatoes, please.

177
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,708
--A goat!
--So cute!

178
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,250
Gigi...! Let's go!

179
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,458
'Kay, I'm coming!

180
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,958
'Bout ready to go?

181
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,250
Yes.

182
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,583
Enough slackin' off for ya.

183
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,333
Hey, cool... Check out
the mast-topper... Huh?

184
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,291
Hey, Fam...! Pass!

185
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,541
Come on, I'm open!

186
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,000
Elio!

187
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,250
Get it!

188
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,708
Go long!

189
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,083
Let's see if we
can even the score.

190
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,125
Hey! Hockey game up on deck!

191
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,958
What's going on...? Well, men?

192
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,541
One... helluva game...

193
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,625
Fam's got a real knack
for--Oh...! Captain!

194
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,625
Close but not quite!

195
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,666
Jus' warmin' up!

196
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,875
Come on! Let's do it!

197
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,166
Yeah!

198
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,375
Fam Fan Fan?

199
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,541
I wish I had a cooler name...

200
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,416
Fritz and those guys say it
sounds like a pet's name.

201
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,583
Nobody else has a name
like that, it's neat.

202
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,916
You think so?

203
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,666
Fam, please put it down!

204
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,625
You're gonna get in trouble!

205
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,541
It's a long way down,
birdbrain, better be careful!

206
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,166
Nuh-uh!

207
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,083
It's Daddy!

208
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,041
Hi, Atamora!

209
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,416
It's always been the two of us.

210
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,541
Just like sisters.

211
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,791
Soaring through the sky...

212
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,750
Melting into the wind...

213
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,250
That's my dream.

214
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,291
That's our dream.

215
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,125
Fam!

216
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,000
Sorry!

217
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,291
Gigi!

218
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:06,083
Fam... I wanted to say...

219
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,916
You came back.

220
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,208
'Course I did.

221
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,875
Would you like to
play, Princess?

222
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,958
Oh... you want me?

223
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,333
Hey, Fam... we got
another teammate!

224
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,708
Huh?

225
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,041
Millia!

226
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,458
They got six players now.

227
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,500
Guys, we could use some
extra hands over here.

228
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,750
No problem.
We've got you covered.

229
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,958
I thought I'd lost
everything that mattered.

230
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,375
I had to help her...
Nobody should be alone.

231
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,750
For as long as I can remember,

232
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,833
I've always wanted
to support her.

233
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,083
We'll always be there
for each other...

234
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,916
No matter what happens.

235
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,750
Think you can get past me?!

236
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,791
Millia! Heads up!

237
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,541
You might want to stand back.

238
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,041
The Princess...?!

239
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,875
What am I supposed to do?
Do I stop her? She's royalty!

240
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,541
--Gigi!
--Got it!

241
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,458
Yeah!

242
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,666
Together with Gigi...

243
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,250
To help Millia!

244
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,583
Together with Fam...

245
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,791
We'll see another
Grand Race someday!

246
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,916
Ready!

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,125

Everybody eat up
before it gets cold!

253
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,541
A toast to Miss Fam Fan Fan...!

254
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,291
--Cheers!
--Thank you!

255
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,333
Sorry. It was supposed
to be a secret.

256
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,750
We were hopin' to surprise
you... and it worked!

257
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,291
Here you are.

258
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,916
Congratulations...
You got all fifteen ships.

259
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,375
Well done, Fam.

260
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,666
Are you really gonna leave now?

261
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,666
Our Skyfish hunt isn't over yet.

262
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,000
I turned sixteen today.

263
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,666
We still need to take down
Ades and reclaim Turan.

264
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,083
So I'm not going anywhere.

265
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,208
Here... my birthday
present to you.

266
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,625
All right! Now you're officially
part of the Silvius crew.

267
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,416
Hmm... sounds lively.

268
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,250
A welcome party?
You shouldn't have.

269
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,791
Vincent!

270
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,041
Hello, Tatiana... Great work.

271
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,000
You are...?

272
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,208
Yes, forgive me...

273
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,125
Commander-in-Chief
of the United Kingdom

274
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,208
of Anatoray-Disith's
Vanguard Unit.

275
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,958
My name is Vincent Alzey.

276
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,291
And you're Princess Millia...

277
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,875
royal deputy of the Turan
refugee government...

278
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,916
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

279
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:24,083
You guys! Thank you
so much for today!

280
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,375
So, Fam... now that
you're sixteen...

281
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,250
is there anybody that
you're interested in?

282
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,291
Interested in?

283
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,458
Is there?

284
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,750
I haven't really thought
about it... Hmm...

285
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:34,958
Oh! There is someone!

286
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,416
Oh! Really? Who is it?

287
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,083
That old Ades admiral.
He's interesting!

288
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,750
Oh... I see...

289
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:45,375
That's not exactly what
I meant, but okay...
