1
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,041
We got company...! Open fire!

2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,625
Protect the Urbanus!

3
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,208
Hi...! Sorry for the wait.

4
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,625
Dio!

5
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,875
The Federation sent assassins.

6
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,458
We need to leave Anatoray.

7
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,875
No more games.

8
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,208
Block.

9
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,666
Who're you?

10
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,708
Where are Gigi and Millia?

11
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,666
I--There were two girls with me.
Have you seen them?

12
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,666
We're about a hundred
eighteen miles...

13
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,375
north-northeast of
Kurbis lookout.

14
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,750
We're really far north.

15
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,041
Yeah... and you know
what that means...

16
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,666
Gigi...! Millia!

17
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,458
You guys are okay...!

18
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,208
I was so worried about you!

19
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,833
We're fine, see for yourself.

20
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,000
And you...? Are you okay, too?

21
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,458
Yep...!

22
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,333
Who's that girl? She doesn't
understand anything I say.

23
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,416
And where the heck are we?

24
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,250
Gigi figured it out.

25
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,333
We're in Glacies.

26
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,125
We crash-landed
inside their border.

27
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,791
Well, we survived...
Good job, girl.

28
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,833
I still can't believe we managed
to escape that firefight.

29
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,416
I thought for sure we
were gonna die out there.

30
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,833
Did that Glacien girl rescue us?

31
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,916
Most likely.

32
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,500
Wonder about the Silvius...

33
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,500
I sure hope they
got out all right.

34
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you think she can be fixed?

35
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,541
She's taken pretty
heavy damage, though...

36
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,958
We don't have all the
parts to make repairs.

37
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,291
So what do we do now?

38
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,833
Why's someone from
Glacies helping us?

39
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,125
I wonder who she is, anyway.

40
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,791
Someone important?

41
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,333
Yeah...? But how do we
know we can trust her...?

42
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,166
She could be
holding us prisoner!

43
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,583
If that was actually the case,
don't you think she would've

44
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,000
stripped us of everything
we have by now?

45
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,083
That's a good point...

46
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,208
She hasn't even
taken our tools away.

47
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,458
But this is Glacies
we're talking about...

48
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,875
Maybe she's just
waiting to eat us!

49
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,750
That's ridiculous.

50
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,750
She's saying "Please, kindred
spirit... grant me life."

51
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,250
Wait, you speak--?

52
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,416
Of course.

53
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,625
Now she's saying... "Forget
nothing... soul of mine."

54
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:42,208
"Give praise to the world...
and be thankful of it all."

55
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,125
Oh, wow...! It smells so good!

56
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,833
Mm, it does!

57
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,250
Millia.

58
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,750
Millia il Velch
Cutrettola Turan?

59
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,833
Impressive!

60
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,791
She knows your full name!

61
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,291
I still can't remember it all!

62
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,875
Manners.

63
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,416
Oh...! Sorry!

64
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,875
"We are the Winged Priestesses.
We protect our motherland...

65
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,708
You and your friend
came to our aid once."

66
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,958
Oh...! Right, that!

67
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,000
"Why did you save my pilots?"

68
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,166
"May the wind guide and carry
wings that become lost."

69
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,500
She says, "You're too nice."

70
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, so are you!

71
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,916
She said...

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,375
It's okay. I think we
got the point of that.

73
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,541
Viola!

74
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,250
As we speak, the fleets
are assembling

75
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,125
one hundred-fifty
miles northeast

76
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,708
of the Boreas Fortress.

77
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,666
Kayvan, Orang, and Sorush...

78
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,833
you will command your fleets
in a joint operation.

79
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,291
And together, crush Glacies.

80
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,291
Gloria, Augusta!

81
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,750
Who do you intend
to form the vanguard?

82
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,958
Batos... Rhaetus...
Ta Opisthen... And Chaos.

83
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,375
We're sending the
provincial fleets, Premier?

84
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,875
The Augusta adores
the provinces...

85
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,625
I hope we can count
on their assistance

86
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,416
to safeguard her future
and that of her subjects.

87
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,833
Yes! Even should it
cost me my life.

88
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,166
I will do my utmost
to serve Her Majesty.

89
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,375
As will I. Gloria, Augusta!

90
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,250
Gloria, Augusta!

91
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,416
Thank you, men...

92
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,583
Together we shall
achieve our goal...

93
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:19,041
With your help we will
reclaim our rightful lands.

94
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,708
We could've received
no greater honor.

95
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,750
Yes... This shows how much
the Augusta trusts us.

96
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,791
We will be proud to
lead the vanguard...

97
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,250
The Survivors of Chaos
will fight valiantly.

98
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you... All of you.

99
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,750
The Glacies offensive
will begin in three days.

100
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:44,291
I will fulfill my duty...
and nothing more.

101
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,250
I have not forgiven
you, Luscinia.

102
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,958
I know, Princess.

103
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,958
That book. Is it
from the Silvius?

104
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,291
It is... The captain
gave it to me...

105
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,875
It's a ship operations manual.

106
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,375
They're okay, right...?

107
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,291
Teddy and the others...

108
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,958
We will see them
again, won't we?

109
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,125
Of course we will...
They'll be fine...

110
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,916
No one can take
down the Silvius.

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,291
The captain promised they'd
come get us, remember...?

112
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,250
No need to worry.

113
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,041
What's she saying?

114
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,000
She says we can use
these for repairs,

115
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,833
and she won't tell
her superiors...

116
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,166
but as soon as we're--Fam!

117
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,541
Hold on! Wait up!

118
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,458
Hey...! Thank you!

119
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,500
Umm... Let's see...
er... thank you...

120
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,416
You understand?

121
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,083
How else can I say it?

122
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,958
I want to thank you!

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,750
Ah, come on! Thanks a lot!

124
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,750
Whatever we need...
she says she'll get for us.

125
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,583
For real?! That's incredible!

126
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,333
You met Millia... but the
quiet one there is Gigi.

127
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,458
Oh... and my name's Fam.

128
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,041
Uh... F-Fam...?

129
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,333
Yep!

130
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,000
Hard to believe
we've come this far.

131
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,375
At last.

132
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,250
Our time is at hand.

133
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,125
Last Exile.

134
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,375
Thanks!

135
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,458
Oh, great! Do you think you
could get these things next?

136
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,083
If it's no trouble.

137
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,791
Fam! You didn't
eat your carrots!

138
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,208
Fresh vegetables are
hard to find out here...

139
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,041
It's rude to let
'em go to waste...

140
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,250
Open. "Ah!"

141
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,958
I'll only eat 'em if
they're cooked first.

142
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,208
Eat!

143
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,500
Later, okay?

144
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,750
Now!

145
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,750
Dyan.

146
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,500
Giselle, Dyan is
asking where the--

147
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,500
I'm not sure I'm
understanding this right...

148
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,833
Do you know what
a "windshield" is?

149
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,833
Just what it sounds like, a
piece of glass for protection.

150
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,166
If we had one of those,

151
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,833
I wouldn't be able to feel
the wind on my face.

152
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,875
Hey! What was that big sigh for?

153
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,833
What the heck do you
have against the wind?

154
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,875
She's asking where
the ship's weapons are.

155
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,833
Aren't any!

156
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,708
There...! I'm all
done up here, Fam.

157
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,208
I'm finished here, too...

158
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,958
Why should we have weapons?
You don't need 'em to fly.

159
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,000
That's freezing!

160
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,166
Stop...! Leave it alone, Fam!

161
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,958
Well, if you won't take
it off someone's gotta!

162
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,416
I would if you'd
stop staring at me!

163
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,375
Let me help you with that.

164
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,416
That's it, Gigi, pull!

165
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:16,541
That was amazing, Dyan!
It's like they worship you!

166
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,666
"The sky is a battlefield."

167
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,333
"Flying on ships
without weapons...?

168
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,041
Saving others for nothing?"

169
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,291
"I don't get it...

170
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,208
I don't understand
why you fly this way."

171
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,458
"What reason is there?"

172
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,875
Why do we fly...?

173
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, because we
want to, of course!

174
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,916
Flying's so much fun...!

175
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,833
Zooming around,
doing big loops,

176
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,958
taking steep dives,
racing people!

177
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,083
"That's what you
consider fun?" she asks.

178
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,458
That's it!

179
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,250
You're going to be in
the new Grand Race, too...!

180
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,125
Maybe then you'll get it.

181
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,291
Ah...!

182
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,958
It's when Vanships from all over
the world come together to fly!

183
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,333
And everyone's happy!

184
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:23,166
On the day of the Grand Race
there's no fighting or violence.

185
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,000
Just people coming
together in peace.

186
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,125
Not like now, where it's
war wherever you go...

187
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,041
I don't like it...
The sky's so full of hate...

188
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,875
It has to stop...
And that's why...

189
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,791
I'm not gonna rest until we
have another Grand Race...!

190
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,708
Then everyone can smile again!

191
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,541
She says, "That's rubbish."

192
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,208
"An ominous sign."

193
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,875
"There was an aurora
that night, as well."

194
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,250
Aurora?

195
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,791
"The night before
the... Grand Race."

196
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,416
"That's when we decided
we would never again

197
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,666
trust anyone from
outside our own land."

198
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,625
"Or else even more
blood would be shed."

199
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,541
No way! We won't let it
end like that again!

200
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,583
I agree.

201
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,875
Heh...! And you'll be
right there with us, Dyan.

202
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,166
Fam!

203
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,416
The Grand Race...! In or out?!

204
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,458
Fam, stop!

205
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,750
Well? Come on! In or out...?

206
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,583
Hey! Just calm down, would ya?

207
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,333
Now you're in for it!

208
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,541
Take it easy! I'm just
tryin' to help, Fam!

209
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,250
No, wait!

210
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,583
Dyan...! Challenge!

211
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,708
And here's the deal,
if I beat you...

212
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,750
You're in the Grand Race!

213
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,125
What?! She isn't coming up?!

214
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,083
Fam?

215
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,041
--Fam?!
--Fam?!

216
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,291
Fuel, coolant, Claudia...
All good to go...

217
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,583
Altimeter, gyro tuning,
and controls are green.

218
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,041
We're all clear on
preflight checks.

219
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,958
Roger that... Starting!

220
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,333
Wanna try it?

221
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,333
Throttle control is
in the headset...

222
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:24,333
Just remember, you wanna go full
throttle when you start her up.

223
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,916
Think of it like this...

224
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,083
If you look downward
to move forward,

225
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,083
the rest'll come naturally!

226
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,250
You've flown tons
of times before...

227
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,833
It's the same as that.

228
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,500
Give it some gas.

229
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,916
The throttle...!
Give it full throttle!

230
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,166
Dyan!

231
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,291
That was a waste of fuel.

232
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,541
Take a look at that!

233
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,333
Dyan!

234
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,750
Thank you again
for all your help!

235
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,208
What was that?
Some kind of goodbye?

236
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:22,291
She says she doesn't think
we'll ever see each other again.

237
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:26,666
Aww... what'd she
go and say that for?

238
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,750
Well... there was
one other thing.

239
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,750
She hopes we can soar
through the same sky someday.

240
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,041
Luscinia's going to
be here before long.

241
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,625
As soon as we get
out of Glacies,

242
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,541
we'll track down the Silvius
again... and once we do...

243
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,291
We're gonna go
save Princess Lily!

244
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,291
Multiple fleets at ten o'clock!

245
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,833
That many?!

246
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,375
Those aren't their main fleets.

247
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,250
They're not Federation ships?

248
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,625
They are flying Federation
flags, but it's not Luscinia...

249
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,333
Looks like...

250
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:14,083
Rhaetus... Ta Opisthen...
Chaos?!

251
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,000
Those are the
Federation's main fleets!

252
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:32,375
Why would they have brought the
Provincial Fleets with them?

253
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,875
Now what?

254
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,333
What's going on?

255
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,041
Those are decoys.

256
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,250
We have to tell
Dyan immediately!

257
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,125
Wow, you speak the Glacies
language perfectly, Millia!

258
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,083
Of course.. I am royalty..

259
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,166
Okay then, tell me
how you say, "I win."

260
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,250
Uh... "Ya pobedila."

261
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,375
Now how about...

262
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,583
"Try and beat me, if you dare!

263
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,875
You'll never win in
a million years!"

264
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,708
I'm sensing a theme, here...

265
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,625
Why do you want to learn how
to say stuff like that, Fam?

266
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,458
Why do you think?
