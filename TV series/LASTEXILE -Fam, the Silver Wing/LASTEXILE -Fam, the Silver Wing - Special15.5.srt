1
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:39,208
The Glacies Exile...
I can't hear it any longer.

2
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,708
No.

3
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:45,666
Dio, the Exiles were never
meant to be used for fighting.

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,291
That's true.

5
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:53,125
And yet... Exiles have always
been at the center of our wars.

6
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,916
In a place far
beyond these skies...

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,625
we fought over an Exile
ourselves... didn't we?

8
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,250
Second Adjournment.

9
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,750
Prester... the artificial
land we called home...

10
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,583
was divided by two nations
that were constantly at war.

11
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,125
On one side was Anatoray.

12
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,916
On the other was Disith...

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The Guild acted as arbitrator
between the lands.

14
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,750
The Grand Stream separated
the two nations,

15
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,208
and within its turbulent
winds was an Exile,

16
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,083
awaiting the appointed time.

17
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,333
The Exile was a colony ship
brought by the first settlers,

18
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,666
meant to return us to our
homeland.

19
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,166
But that knowledge had
long ago been lost,

20
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,791
and we instead believed it
possessed god-like power.

21
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:35,833
And it was me, Alvis Hamilton,
who was the key to that Exile.

22
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,625
The Guild wanted to use
it for world domination,

23
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:42,375
and I was no longer
safe... so I escaped.

24
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:47,416
I'd like you...
to take my mission.

25
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,333
It's seven stars?!

26
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:53,958
The cargo...
I entrust her to you.

27
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,416
This girl...?

28
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,041
I, Claus Valca...

29
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,416
Vanship pilot,
hereby take over...

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,833
Ralph Wednesday's
divine mission.

31
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,250
I got a little present for ya...

32
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,875
...you monster!

33
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,500
Well then...

34
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:20,166
My name is Claus...
and this is Lavie.

35
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,875
So um... while you
were still sleeping,

36
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,250
we were asked to
take over the job.

37
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:32,625
They were Vanship pilots...
Two young sky couriers.

38
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,625
And I loved them both...

39
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,708
Well, I was a little bit
scared of Lavie at first...

40
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,541
but the tasty sandwiches
that she made

41
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,833
won me over before long.

42
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,500
Guita...

43
00:04:55,208 --> 00:05:06,958
Guita... She's not
coming back... is she?

44
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,875
Let go! Let go of her...!

46
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,875
Claus!

47
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,333
I was finally delivered to
a ship called the Silvana,

48
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,125
and its Captain, Alex Row...

49
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,375
I was afraid I might never
see Claus and Lavie again.

50
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,875
Lord Dio, the preparations
are complete.

51
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,291
Shortly thereafter...
we arrived at the scene.

52
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,583
Lord Dio.

53
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,041
Luciola...

54
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:14,291
don't you think that dead
bodies are very intriguing?

55
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,833
Who... is this?

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,708
Of all the pilots in
this dull battlefield...

57
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,791
Immelman was the only
one who seemed to shine.

58
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,708
I'm going to give you
some flying lessons,

59
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,708
so try to pay attention.

60
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,583
Don't you think you're
getting a little close?

61
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,291
I'm afraid you may not realize
whom you're talking to...

62
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,625
You may refer to me
as Professor Dio.

63
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,083
Time is up.

64
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, very well then.

65
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,125
I hope we get to do
this again soon.

66
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,583
Our next encounter came
sooner than I thought...

67
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,375
We met in Horizon Cave...

68
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,666
for an eight-hour long
Vanship endurance race.

69
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,250
Now, Claus...! Max the output!

70
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,333
Gotcha!

71
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:32,875
Lord Dio--

72
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,666
Luciola, we're going to lose!

73
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,291
We can't go any
faster, Lord Dio...

74
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,666
At the last pit stop
we filled up our--

75
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,875
Then get out,
Luciola! Right now!

76
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,416
Come on, floor it!

77
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:55,166
We did it!

78
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,583
Did you win?

79
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,333
Yeah.

80
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,875
They're making a party!

81
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,666
A party sounds wonderful!

82
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,208
I trailed Immelman and wound
up a prisoner on the Silvana.

83
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,791
But... that was
my plan all along.

84
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,208
Right... I'm a prisoner of war.

85
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,625
It's nearly dawn.

86
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,291
I hate you.

87
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,250
Why's that?

88
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,500
'Cause you're weird.

89
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,875
You think so?

90
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,750
Yeah, for one thing you call
Claus by a weird name.

91
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,500
Yes, but Immelman is Immelman.

92
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:36,833
Claus is just Claus!

93
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,583
And you are Alvis.

94
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,375
How do you know about me?

95
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,458
I know a lot about you.

96
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,500
I'll recite you a little poem.

97
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,583
A poem?

98
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:54,458
What poem?

99
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,833
What lies deep within the
furthest reaches of the skies?

100
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,375
This is... amazing!

101
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,208
Al!

102
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:13,958
That which will guide the lost
child back to her mother's arms.

103
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,041
Exile...

104
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,250
Last Exile.

105
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,500
I realized that Alvis
and the four Mysterion

106
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,666
were required to
activate the Exile.

107
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,375
How many of them do
you know, Captain...? Two?

108
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,000
No, I've got it... Three.

109
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,208
And what was Alex's objective?

110
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,750
It was simple...

111
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,416
He wished to obtain an Exile...
change the world...

112
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,333
and do whatever it would take to
bring down the Maestro Delphine.

113
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,791
--Lord Dio! Please calm down!
--She's coming for me...!

114
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,666
Delphine's found me!

115
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,416
Shoot it down at once!

116
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,541
I know that she's on board...!
The Maestro is there!

117
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,166
Delphine... My older sister.

118
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,416
Happy birthday to you, Dio!

119
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,875
This has gotta be the best
water I've ever had...

120
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,791
It's better if you savor it.

121
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,458
Thanks a lot.

122
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,958
These are from me. I hope
they're not too beat up for ya.

123
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,375
Immelman!

124
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,125
There's cake, too!

125
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,875
Try some, Dio!

126
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,791
It was because of their
kindness and generosity

127
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,458
that I realized how wonderful
a birthday could be...

128
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,125
--This is wonderful!
--However...

129
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,833
Please...!

130
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,166
I would soon face
the Trial of Agoon,

131
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,375
the Guild's coming
of age ceremony.

132
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:54,541
Luciola! He'll save
me--Luciola...! Luciola!

133
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,416
They dragged me back home...

134
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,416
and shattered my
grasp on reality.

135
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,125
Now... let the trial... begin!

136
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,250
Dio is absolutely magnificent.

137
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,000
Alvis, you're going to
be the star of the show.

138
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,833
I'm here now... I'm right here.

139
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,916
Excellent, let's begin with
House Dagobert's Mysterion.

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,041
Dagobert, the waves that
flow and dye the land gold.

141
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:56,625
The blessed breath,
the nurturing breath of life.

142
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,375
A land... of wheat.

143
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,916
Having acquired me
and the Mysterion...

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,625
Delphine now had the tools to
take possession of the Exile.

145
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,625
Dio's mind never
returned to normal,

146
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,000
even after it was all over.

147
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,583
Nonetheless...

148
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,916
Luciola helped Claus, Dio and me
escape from Delphine's ship...

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,875
Luciola...! What can you
accomplish by yourself?

150
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,125
I will remove those who try
to bring harm to Lord Dio.

151
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,708
I smiled like a simpleton...

152
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,958
laughed like a mad man, who'd
been robbed of his memories.

153
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,916
Very well done, Luciola.

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,083
I'll give you a reward.

155
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,958
Set Lord Dio free.

156
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,041
Go ahead... Take it.

157
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:26,000
I want you to tell me why you
let my precious Dio escape.

158
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,958
I merely--

159
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,833
It's odd... because you two
aren't even friends.

160
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,041
What do you mean
to Dio, Luciola?

161
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,458
So is it good?

162
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,000
Mm-Hm.

163
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:45,291
If you like how something tastes
it should show on your face!

164
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,916
My face?

165
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:54,208
Listen... Luciola, you and me
are going to be friends!

166
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,541
Because...

167
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:06,166
He is my--he is my friend
and I won't betray him.

168
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,958
Is that so?

169
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,625
Wonderful!

170
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,791
How beautiful... Luciola!

171
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,000
Throttle off... check.
Verify... check.

172
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,500
All clear.

173
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,791
Starting engine.

174
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,583
Everybody ready?

175
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,333
Good luck, Claus.

176
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,583
May fair winds be with you.

177
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,916
After reuniting with Lavie,

178
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,750
the three of us headed
back to the Grand Stream.

179
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,500
This time... we would take back
the Exile from Delphine.

180
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,833
It was already a hard task,

181
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,666
but a still-confused
Dio trailing us

182
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,125
only made things worse.

183
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,625
Bearing, 1 o'clock...!
Rainbirds!

184
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,916
I can see the finish line!

185
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,708
We're gonna lose, Luciola!
Can't we go any faster?!

186
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,541
Maybe you should just
jump out, Luciola!

187
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,583
We won!

188
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,458
We did it!
We really did! We won!

189
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,750
We beat Immelman! Luciola!

190
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,166
Luciola?

191
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,791
Because I said to jump out...?

192
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,583
Just because I told you
to jump out...?! Luciola!

193
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,875
I'm sorry, Claus! I don't
know what our heading is!

194
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,250
Clear a path for our Empress!

195
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,791
All ships commence fire at will!

196
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,875
Exile keeps sending
out more tentacles...!

197
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,250
I can't count them all!

198
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,333
Timed fuse torpedoes
engage, full spread!

199
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,041
Fire!

200
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,875
Open main turrets 1 through 3!
The target is the Urbanus!

201
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,125
All hands, make for the
ship's bow! Here she comes!

202
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,500
Open fire!

203
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,250
Take course elevation
to 20 degrees!.

204
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,583
Continue forward...
at flank speed!

205
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,958
Majesty...!
Give the Maestro hell!

206
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,125
Diminishing-caliber,
heavy antiaircraft cannon!

207
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,583
Commence fire!

208
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,875
I heard the Captain's voice
inside Delphine's ship!

209
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,958
To the sky...

210
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,708
Claus...! Bearing... 2 o'clock!

211
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,125
I'm gonna hit the booster!

212
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,666
Punch it!

213
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,666
The Grand Stream...

214
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,750
We crossed it.

215
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,208
Lavie...

216
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,708
What's this?

217
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,208
This must be... Disith...

218
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,208
Ok, Claus, you're gonna have
to take me to Exile now.

219
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,833
You got it, let's go.

220
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,625
Lavie!

221
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,416
Claus...

222
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,041
You did it...

223
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,583
You crossed the Grand Stream.

224
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,708
It's up to you.

225
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,000
What lies in the furthest
reaches of the sky?

226
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,625
That which guides a lost
child back to her mother...

227
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,916
Exile.

228
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,500
Waves that flow...
and dye the land gold.

229
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,625
A land full of grain...

230
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,125
blessed by the breath
that nurtures life.

231
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,541
The path the angels
descend upon.

232
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,791
The path of great winds.

233
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,791
The Grand Stream.

234
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,125
What lies in the furthest
reaches of one's memory?

235
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:21,083
The place where all are born...
and all will return.

236
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,708
A blue star.

237
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,875
Hey! Look, they're back!

238
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,125
We swore to make a new world...

239
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:40,458
A world without Anatoray...
or Disith... or The Guild.

240
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:44,708
A world of peace, where we
could live without conflict.

241
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,041
And yet we are at
war once again...

242
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:56,000
No matter where I go, I'll
always be targeted and used...

243
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,375
Those I care about get hurt...

244
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't think I can
take it anymore.

245
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,541
Alvis.

246
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,416
I know it's been rough on you,

247
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,166
but you know why we're here...

248
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,375
Because everyone
has come together.

249
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,583
My life... is the same as yours.

250
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:23,625
We live on... we keep going...
even when it's hard.

251
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,875
Dio!

252
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,166
Let's go... Run!

253
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,416
Wake up, sleepyhead!

254
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,708
Come on... It's lunch time!

255
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,708
It's going to be all right, Al.

256
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:12,958
I promised Immelman...
that I would keep you safe.
