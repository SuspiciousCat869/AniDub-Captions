1
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,708
Attention unidentified craft...

2
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,666
This is the Ades Federation...

3
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,666
You have five minutes to
hand over Princess Millia...

4
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,875
disarm and surrender.

5
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,250
I repeat...

6
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,000
You have five minutes to
hand over Princess Millia...

7
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,125
disarm... and surrender...

8
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:39,166
Fail to do so, and
you will be destroyed.

9
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,708
Distraction.

10
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,041
They're on absolute
silent running...

11
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,416
I'm not even picking
up any wind noise.

12
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,250
Next move, Captain?

13
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,208
The Federation and Glacies...

14
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,208
With both foes,
prepare for the worst...

15
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,333
All ships! Ready for battle!

16
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,625
No, don't...! They're only doing
this because they want me.

17
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,375
I can't drag you into
this any deeper.

18
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,750
Hand me over to them!

19
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,958
Why are you laughing?!

20
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,375
Here I thought you
were determined

21
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,083
to rebuild your
beloved kingdom...

22
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,208
Guess I was wrong.

23
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,000
I am determined.

24
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,541
If that's the case...

25
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
You shouldn't worry about using
us to accomplish your goals.

26
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,875
Self-sacrifice is
all well and good...

27
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,708
but in this situation,
that sacrifice

28
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,875
would be a betrayal
of your people.

29
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,375
And it would likely
be pointless, anyway.

30
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:12,041
Even if we were to give you up,
I doubt they would let us go.

31
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
All ships... Weapons!

32
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,708
And, up!

33
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,333
Number four torpedo all set!

34
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,041
Good! Get it into position.

35
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,333
Armor-piercing shell!
Distance, two hundred!

36
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,333
Move! You're in the way.

37
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,916
Refuel me too!
I'm going out there!

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,750
We don't need an amateur
along...! Stay out of it.

39
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,125
Come on...!

40
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,125
We were the ones who led
'em here in the first place!

41
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,000
Hurry...! We're heading
up right now.

42
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,291
Roger!

43
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,916
It's my... responsibility.

44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,375
Don't worry about this...
Let the old pros handle it.

45
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,958
No, wait!

46
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,291
It's our fault all this
is happening! Please...!

47
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,000
Let us do something to help!

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,416
Time's run out.

49
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,583
So much for
bargaining with them.

50
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,125
They've made their
choice... open fire!

51
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,250
--All ships, open fire!
--All ships, open fire!

52
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,541
Fire!

53
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,166
Enemy fleet has opened fire!

54
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,458
We'll charge through...

55
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,875
All ships...
commence fire at once!

56
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,416
Attention, ships!
Commence firing!

57
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,791
Ahead, second combat speed.

58
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,083
Enemy vessel approaching.
She's firing on us.

59
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,208
Move!

60
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,958
All ships, Hind-Wing
Echelon formation.

61
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,208
Enemy's in siege formation!

62
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,000
We're completely surrounded!

63
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,500
Stay this course!

64
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:07,916
Engines to third combat speed.
Open aft lift deck. Now!

65
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,583
Vanship squadron...
clear for takeoff!

66
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,583
First and Second Squads...!
All ships, train guns on target!

67
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,375
Roger that! Training guns.

68
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,041
Target acquired.

69
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,750
What the...?!

70
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,875
All forward obstructions
have been destroyed.

71
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,708
Course is clear.

72
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,500
Good, maneuver us out
of their siege net.

73
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,833
Still locked in combat.

74
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,708
First Squad and Second
Squad appear to have

75
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,458
sustained substantial
damage, sir.

76
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,375
All ahead full...!
Heading One-Zero.

77
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,375
Now exiting smoke screen.

78
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,291
Climbing turn, full speed!

79
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,916
All hands... brace yourselves.

80
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,125
Ow!

81
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,958
Wait a minute...

82
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,875
Captain... the main enemy
unit is directly beneath us.

83
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:42,000
I hate this. I feel so useless!

84
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,291
Fam...?

85
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,208
Enemy has altered
heading to Ten...

86
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,416
They are now moving
toward the Glacies border.

87
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,666
Stop them.

88
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,958
Sir...! Instruct Fourth
Squad to cut them off.

89
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,916
Do not let them escape!

90
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,333
Moderate damage to outer
armored compartments...

91
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,583
Heavy damage to turret!

92
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,208
Multiple enemy destroyers
up ahead, near the border.

93
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,791
Stay the current course...
Helm, all ahead full.

94
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,375
Get out! Go... We're in
the middle of a battle, Fam!

95
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,208
Retrieve the deployed Vanships.

96
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,500
I... I tried to tell
her not to disturb you.

97
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,541
We promised you Skyfish!

98
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,333
And what is your point?

99
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,750
Fifteen... we're still short.

100
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,833
This is the perfect
opportunity to change that.

101
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,291
I'm gonna fulfill my promise.

102
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,708
Well, Captain...
what do you say?

103
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,125
We're not able to retrieve
you during battle...

104
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,500
You'll have to make
your own way back.

105
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,541
Last Exile.

106
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,458
Distance to Glacies
border, four-zero.

107
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,500
Enemy fleet deploying ahead.

108
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,833
Incoming torpedoes!

109
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,166
Ascend immediately!

110
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,666
Belay that, descend...!

111
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,708
We're an easier target
with our nose up...

112
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,541
Down trim, three-zero.
Take us into the clouds.

113
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,125
Target descending...
They're going into the clouds!

114
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,833
Enemy has evaded torpedoes.

115
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,625
Shall we smoke them out, sir?

116
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,125
All ships, prepare
for bombardment.

117
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,208
Wait, shouldn't
Giselle be doing this?

118
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,916
No time...! Move out!

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,375
Roger that...! Millia,
put on your goggles.

120
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,708
Why are we moving?
What's happening?

121
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,166
Sit down and hang on.

122
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,541
No wait... Fam!
What are we doing?

123
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,458
An' here we go!

124
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,708
You can't be serious!

125
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,291
Fam's ship has taken off.

126
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,208
Excellent. Close off
the flight deck.

127
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,833
Closing flight deck... Roger.

128
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,708
Depth charges from above.

129
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,166
Keep your eyes open.

130
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,166
We will seize the ship...
Preferably intact...

131
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,583
Fire if you must, but do as
little damage as possible.

132
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,833
Engine output has dropped!

133
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,083
Turret Number One's
been taken down!

134
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,666
Pressure bulkhead destroyed...!

135
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,958
Fires breaking out onboard!

136
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,375
--Over here!
--Put it out!

137
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,000
Multiple enemy
propulsion acoustics

138
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,750
at three, six, and nine o'clock.

139
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,750
Our retreat's cut off!

140
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,791
Cliffside straight ahead.
Captain?!

141
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,208
Distance to cliff...
four thousand.

142
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,916
This is what it boils down to...
Who fights hardest.

143
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,708
Attention... I have bad news.

144
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,125
The captain is laughing, and
we know what that means...

145
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,375
don't we, men...?

146
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,541
Let's all prepare for an
unexpected announcement.

147
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,958
This is Tatiana Wisla.

148
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,166
Ades has spoken...

149
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,208
They have made the
following demands...

150
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,166
We must cease our fire and
turn over Princess Millia,

151
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,333
ruler of the Turahn
Refugee Government,

152
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,833
who is currently
under our protection.

153
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,458
In return for our compliance,

154
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,291
they have offered to
grant us safe passage

155
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,708
from this airspace...

156
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,541
However, this assurance
is nothing more

157
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,333
than Federation trickery...

158
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,875
Their actions make it clear that

159
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,708
they aim to capture the Silvius
as well as the princess.

160
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:45,291
Should this ship be seized...
Anatoray would be in danger.

161
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,458
Do not fear the
enemy's numbers...

162
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,291
Stand strong and fight them.

163
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,541
We will all return
to Anatoray...

164
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,666
Down to the last soldier.
That is all.

165
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,083
Captain! Thirty-five
hundred to impact!

166
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,166
Find us an area where the
bedrock is relatively thin.

167
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,333
Aye-aye!

168
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,291
Fifteen degrees off port bow...

169
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,750
Distance, three thousand.

170
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,666
Captain! I found a weak spot!

171
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,125
Very good... Ready
armor-piercing shells.

172
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,958
Jet-propelled...
heavy-core wing-type!

173
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,875
Leaving cloud cover!

174
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,625
Target has surfaced!

175
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,875
No surrender signal...
I'll order ships to open fire.

176
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,625
What a pity.

177
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,333
Millia...! Throttle, now!

178
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,583
Uh... Like this?

179
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,250
That's it...! You got it!

180
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,750
I do hope the Silvius will
be all right through this.

181
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,958
Do what you must to stop her.
Do not let her self-destruct!

182
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,250
Aye, sir!

183
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,666
Enemy ships dead-ahead!

184
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,750
Fifteen seconds until contact.

185
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,666
All engines to full power!

186
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,041
Engines to full!

187
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,125
Use the enemy as
a stepping stone.

188
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,375
They're going to scuttle her

189
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,500
rather than leave anything
for us to claim?!

190
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,666
Fire!

191
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,708
What is... all of that?

192
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,083
Wha--?! Fam, wait...!
Where are you going?!

193
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,666
What's going on...?
Somebody report!

194
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,916
A mountain range near
the border is crumbling.

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,708
Fourth and Fifth Squads
have taken heavy casualties.

196
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,833
Are you all right, sir?

197
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,208
The Silvius... also
known as The Reaper...

198
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,041
Now I see why.

199
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,666
Glacies fighters!

200
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,583
Hold fire...! We can
slip through the border

201
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,291
while Glacies and the
Federation are engaged.

202
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,250
Vanguard fleet is locked in
combat across the border!

203
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,708
Guzel!

204
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,333
Attention, all ships!

205
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:23,125
You are to leave Glacies
territory immediately!

206
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,958
Unidentified aircraft:
this is a warning.

207
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,916
You have reached the border
and are in violation

208
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,625
of Glacies airspace...

209
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,666
Disarm and surrender at once...

210
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,083
Message repeat...

211
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,791
You are currently in violation
of Glacies airspace...

212
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,375
Surrender at once.

213
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,208
Engine has taken damage...

214
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,416
Output has dropped
to fifteen percent!

215
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,208
Output has dropped by a quarter.

216
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,583
I can't halt our descent!

217
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,083
What about the long-barrels?
Are they still working?

218
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,083
We might get one more salvo.

219
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,208
Good enough.

220
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,041
Primula...

221
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,666
What do they think
they're doing...?

222
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,541
Why are those fools
still fighting?

223
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,375
Visibility is too poor
to maintain contact, sir.

224
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,916
Do you remember nothing your
father taught you, Guzel?

225
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,583
Launch signal flares ordering
ships to cease fire...

226
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,916
Follow with another round

227
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,791
ordering them to suspend
hostilities with Glacies.

228
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,875
The battleship Borth will take
charge of the fleet for now...

229
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,750
Meanwhile, we'll make
sure the Silvius

230
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,333
is out of commission for good.

231
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,541
Sir!

232
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,625
Aniguis, Lacerta,
Cochlea. Follow us...

233
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,666
We're going after the Silvius.

234
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,458
The Silvius!

235
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,375
Whoa... she's all beat up.

236
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,916
Fam look!

237
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,375
There...! A Glacies vanship!

238
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,958
Why are they stuck together?

239
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:31,333
I have no idea... but there
could still be pilots inside...

240
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,250
We have to try and save them!

241
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,208
The engine's running...
That means it's still manned!

242
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,583
Now what?!

243
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,625
Fam...! You're mad!

244
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,333
No way this'll ever work!

245
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:52,875
Yes, way...! It'll get ripped
apart if we don't do something!

246
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,166
It could wreak havoc
on the Silvius, too!

247
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,708
Think of something else!

248
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,541
This is absolute insanity!
Even for you!

249
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,125
Just do it!

250
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,833
There she goes!

251
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,791
Wha--?!

252
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,500
We did it...! We're amazing!

253
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,416
Target the surface of the
Grand Lake... Get ready...

254
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,083
Fire!

255
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,625
--Rate of descent decreasing.
--Impact!

256
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,083
Look!

257
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,500
The Anshar?!

258
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,958
She's going after the Silvius...
Not if we can help it!

259
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,583
All right, now!

260
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,958
Got it!

261
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,041
Please...!

262
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,375
Just hit it!

263
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,833
Sudden Claudia
depressurization...!

264
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,458
We've lost our buoyancy!

265
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,125
Why? What's happening?

266
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,208
The ship can't stay afloat.
She's going down!

267
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,916
Impossible!

268
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,458
What now, sir?

269
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,041
All hands, abandon ship at once.

270
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,583
You want us to
abandon the Anshar?

271
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,500
The ship can be replaced.
Her crew, however, cannot.

272
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,791
Sir... All hands, abandon ship!

273
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,333
All hands, abandon ship!

274
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,125
All flagship crew members
have been retrieved.

275
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,416
Ready, men...
She's going under.

276
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,250
The Silvius!

277
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,625
Still in one piece!

278
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,375
It's good to see her.

279
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,958
"We have brought down...

280
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,375
the First Fleet
flagship, the Anshar."

281
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,416
They really did it.

282
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,791
You were great!

283
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,375
You sure showed 'em!

284
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,583
Wow...!

285
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,791
She managed to take
down the Anshar, huh?

286
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,875
You're amazing! Awesome work!

287
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,625
Princess Millia!

288
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,958
Never doubted you for a second!

289
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,666
Congratulations, Fam.

290
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,416
You too, Princess Millia...

291
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,791
Great job... You guys did it.
You really did...

292
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,625
After all this time,
you got it to work.

293
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,958
Gigi! Hey, can
you believe it...?

294
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,708
We actually managed
to pull the trick off!

295
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,375
Hey, Teddy...! Did you see us?

296
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,291
So yeah. Congratulations.

297
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,958
I don't know how to handle
this situation, Ignace.

298
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,541
Sorry, kid.

299
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,500
Once two girls start fightin'
there's nothin' a guy can do.

300
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,375
This is making me realize
just how powerless I am.

301
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,958
--Oh, yeah?
--Yeah... 

302
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,583
I mean, I could collect all your
wages for the next two months

303
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,875
and seize Niccolo's gold pocket
watch to cover what you owe me,

304
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:40,166
and it wouldn't help this
problem one little bit.

305
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,166
You're certainly not
cheering me up any!

306
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,083
Jeez, are you trying
to make me cry, here?
