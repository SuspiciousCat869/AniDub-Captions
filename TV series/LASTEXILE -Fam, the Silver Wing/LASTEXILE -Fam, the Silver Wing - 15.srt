1
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,875
An emergency message
from the admiral.

2
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,083
That was sooner
than anticipated...

3
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,958
Though we are dealing with
the Amethyst of Chaos.

4
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,291
So, what now...?

5
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,500
Shall I return to
the capital on my own

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,125
and extract Augusta Sara?

7
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,083
Let's leave this in
Sadri's hands for now...

8
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,458
We have important
work to do here.

9
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,250
Our success... will put
an end to the fighting.

10
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,875
Triangulation.

11
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,041
It appears Kumari,
Batos, Reetus,

12
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,875
and a few other
repatriate provinces

13
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,041
have already united in revolt...

14
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,041
alongside the remaining
Glacies forces

15
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,750
and several Sky Pirate camps.

16
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,291
There are also rumors that
the survivors of Turan

17
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,500
have rallied around
Princess Millia.

18
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,000
Vasant's move is
bold and decisive...

19
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,875
I must give her that.

20
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,375
The status of the Exiles?

21
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,250
We've succeeded in rendering
the Glacies Exile...

22
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,291
completely inoperable.

23
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,208
Good, meaning there's no chance

24
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,625
the rebel forces
can make use of it.

25
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,750
In a way, this rebellion has
actually benefited us...

26
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,916
All potential opposition
has been uncovered

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,541
in one fell swoop.

28
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,833
The rest is simple...
We take them out.

29
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:28,625
So that is the
premier's true goal.

30
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,750
It seems they've
beaten us to the draw...

31
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,375
Creating a grand
Anti-Federation alliance

32
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,958
to oppose the atrocities
Luscinia has committed

33
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,375
in the name of
world peace...

34
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,791
That's what we had
hoped to accomplish

35
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,708
by allying ourselves with Turan.

36
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,375
Likely, our announcement of that
alliance spurred them on...

37
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,875
We got the ball
rolling for them.

38
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,666
We gave them the
momentum they needed...

39
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,166
And now we must fulfill
our end of the bargain...

40
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,916
However... We can't make a move
with Ades right on our doorstep.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,583
That would endanger
our mission here.

42
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,416
Our duty is to protect
this wheat-filled land...

43
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,375
no matter what happens.

44
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:11,250
Then we'll just have to hold out
until Lady Sophia returns.

45
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,708
Yes...

46
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,375
--Look, Princess Millia is here!
--We love you, Princess Millia!

47
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,375
Long live Princess Millia!

48
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,750
Hooray for the princess!

49
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:27,958
Long live Turan!

50
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,541
The Turanians are
excited to see her.

51
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,041
Of course they are.

52
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,125
They're pinning all their
hopes on this joint rebellion.

53
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,000
It still bothers me, though.

54
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,333
They virtually ignored her

55
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,541
when she was opposing
the Federation on her own.

56
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,625
Aw, what do they know?

57
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,500
They're a buncha
birdbrains, that's all.

58
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,958
Federation General Vasant
is behind this...

59
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,291
but I'm not sure we can
trust her... Should we?

60
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,583
As things stand,
we're powerless.

61
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,708
If there's dissent brewing
within the Federation,

62
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,666
we should do what we can
to use it to our advantage.

63
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,333
Like they say, "yer enemy's
enemy is your friend."

64
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,375
And if things do
start to get hairy...

65
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,583
we'll grab the princess and get
outta here as fast as we can.

66
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,916
Right!

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,083
Princess, Lady Vasant
has arrived.

68
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,083
We have been expecting you.

69
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,333
And so, in the name of
the newly established

70
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,791
Anti-Luscinia Joint Forces...

71
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,250
I welcome you all.

72
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,500
Vasant... That can't be right!

73
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,791
Luscinia has spent
all these years

74
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,708
fighting for the
sake of the people!

75
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,166
My people.

76
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,625
Yes, but it is the way he
fights that is the problem.

77
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,458
He has expanded the war...

78
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,458
killing far more people than
necessary for our objective

79
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,250
and plunging the entire
world into a vast whirlwind

80
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,291
of turmoil and suffering...

81
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,750
His sins are beyond imagining
and utterly unforgivable.

82
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,875
Luscinia is a tyrant...

83
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,125
His methods will never make

84
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:56,750
your late mother's
dream of peace a reality.

85
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:06,541
Now, please...
I need your decision.

86
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,250
Augusta Sara.

87
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,458
Pardon the intrusion,

88
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:18,916
but Princess Millia
of Turan has arrived.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,833
So this is what the Ades
palace looks like, huh?

90
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,666
Dull compared to Turan's.

91
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,541
Manners.

92
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,125
Fam!

93
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,666
She's not alone in that...

94
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,708
All the foreign visitors
say the same.

95
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,458
Please accept my apologies...

96
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,958
It was horribly rude for
her to say such a thing.

97
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,375
Not at all... there is
no need to apologize...

98
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,458
Morvarid stands
in memory of those

99
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,666
who survived the great
cataclysm so many years ago.

100
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,875
After the lakes froze over
and the earth grew sterile,

101
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,875
this remained the
only habitable area...

102
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,666
It was the last
bastion for those

103
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,666
who were abandoned
by the Exiles.

104
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,000
To this day, our capital
rests on this land

105
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:05,125
so that we may never forget
that time in our history.

106
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,875
Now, come this way, if you will.
The Augusta awaits.

107
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,208
--She really is just a kid!
--Come on, Fam!

108
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,666
I can't help it if
I'm surprised...

109
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,958
I mean, I knew she was young,

110
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,000
but I had no idea--

111
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,666
Child or not, I am the Augusta.

112
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,166
Yes, I'm still young...
very young...

113
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,750
In many ways I'm powerless...
I understand that.

114
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:39,041
But... even so...
I am still the Augusta!

115
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,666
I represent the Ades people.
I fight for them.

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,250
I'm sorry!

117
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,375
My humblest apologies...

118
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,875
Augusta Sara... I beg your
forgiveness for her words.

119
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,500
You have my promise she will
be very thoroughly scolded

120
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,125
for her behavior here today.

121
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,000
Pardon me, Augusta.

122
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,375
Let us not forget that
these girls are victims

123
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:04,875
of Luscinia's war as well.

124
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,666
You must be exhausted
from your journey here...

125
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,666
I hope you find the
food to your liking...

126
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,541
Please take as much as you want.

127
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,583
Thank you, that's very kind.

128
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:20,000
--Yeah, thank you for the food!
--Thank you very much.

129
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,208
Turanian soldiers have begun
to hear of the alliance.

130
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,958
They are coming out
of hiding in droves

131
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,458
to stand with you
in this, Princess...

132
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,375
I happily return them to your
command, where they belong.

133
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,791
I am sure they will fight to
the best of their abilities

134
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,916
with you once again in a
position of leadership.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,625
You'd be willing to do that?

136
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,291
Absolutely, I must admit we have
high hopes for you, Princess...

137
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,125
There aren't many who
could oppose Luscinia

138
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,333
as valiantly as you have
and live to tell of it.

139
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:55,791
Oh, well... I didn't
do it alone, of course.

140
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,875
You also received aid
from the Silvius...

141
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,083
I've heard all about
your work with them...

142
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,375
Do you know where they are now?

143
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,166
I'm afraid I don't...

144
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,958
We've completely lost
contact with them.

145
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,375
I was unaware of that.

146
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,916
I do wish Anatoray
could be here, though.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,833
Oh, no... Please don't
concern yourself, Princess.

148
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:20,333
Your presence alone is more than
enough reassurance for us.

149
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,291
Luscinia still has many people
and resources at his disposal...

150
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,833
but we can no longer
overlook the atrocities

151
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,000
for which he is responsible.

152
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,541
The late Augusta Farahnaz
dreamed of a lasting peace...

153
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,041
That dream died ten years ago.

154
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,000
The time has come for us
to bring it back to life...

155
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,416
But to do so...

156
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,458
We must first
eliminate Luscinia.

157
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,416
Now, please, don't be shy...
Eat your fill...

158
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,208
These are the first
oranges of the season,

159
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,958
picked from a Notos oasis.

160
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,041
And, uh... what is this
stuff...? It's slimy!

161
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,458
Please, Fam!

162
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,541
No, it's fine... Not your
favorite dish, I take it?

163
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,416
That's millet porridge,
one of our staple recipes...

164
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
We eat it daily...

165
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,125
Everyone from the most humble
citizen to the Augusta herself.

166
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,541
Seriously?!

167
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,291
Soil capable of sustaining
a good crop of wheat

168
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,375
is difficult to
come by in our lands.

169
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,916
I am sorry...

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,250
...for calling you
a kid earlier.

171
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,041
You act a lot older,
and I can tell

172
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,625
you really do love your country.

173
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,083
As far as generals go,

174
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,500
Vasant seems pretty nice,
dontcha think?

175
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,750
Yeah.

176
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,250
We've all got a lot of
work ahead of us yet...

177
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,083
The Augusta is safe in
General Vasant's care...

178
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,791
but so far, these joint forces

179
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,375
are looking like a
pretty ragtag band.

180
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,416
I never realized there were
decent people on the Ades side.

181
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,666
but from what I can tell,

182
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,875
Sara seems like she'd
make a great ruler...

183
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,125
...if we can get
rid of Luscinia.

184
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,875
Dyan!

185
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,291
You made it through the battle!
Thank goodness...!

186
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:01,958
Does this mean you guys
are joining up, too?

187
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,041
Dyan?

188
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,083
[in Russian]

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,291
She says she cannot
be friends with me...

190
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,541
The sister of her enemy.

191
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,833
Dyan...

192
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,041
Last Exile.

193
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,875
Incredible... Vasant
inciting a revolt.

194
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,625
Well, the Chaos fleet
was essentially used

195
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,541
as a sacrificial pawn
during this latest battle.

196
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,375
What do you think?

197
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,791
About what, the premier?

198
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,250
Saying that sort
of thing out loud

199
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:09,041
is enough to earn a man a
speedy execution, you know.

200
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,708
--Sorush--
--Drop it, Orang...

201
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,708
...now.

202
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,333
Enter.

203
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,583
Orders to move out, sir...
as follows...

204
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,333
At dawn... you're to
make for Boreas...

205
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,458
...and then conquer it.

206
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,041
The fortress city of Boreas...

207
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,583
It is a key strategic point

208
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,000
positioned between
Ades and Glacies,

209
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,458
where the forces still loyal to

210
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,000
Luscinia are
currently stationed.

211
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,041
Located within Boreas are a
large-scale battleship dock...

212
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,333
...an abundant stockpile
of ammunition...

213
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,250
...and an ample number
of Claudia deposits.

214
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,708
On top of this, it is also
a major traffic artery...

215
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,583
All of the northeastern
Grand Lake routes

216
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,458
pass through its territory.

217
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,416
It is no exaggeration to say
that whoever controls this city

218
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,458
also controls the northern
shores of the Grand Lake.

219
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,541
What about the forces
remaining at the fortress?

220
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,416
Are they under
Luscinia's control?

221
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,666
They are not...

222
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,541
We have already called
for them to be placed

223
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,041
under the Augusta's
direct command.

224
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,416
The first thing we must do

225
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,583
is assemble our
respective teams of troops

226
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,583
in Boreas and fend
off Luscinia's forces.

227
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,041
Their long excursion
into Glacies

228
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,666
has stretched their
supply line thin.

229
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,250
As they start to weaken,

230
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,250
we will seek as many supporters
from around the world as we can.

231
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,333
When we're strong enough, we'll
take the fight to Luscinia.

232
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,875
Damaging Luscinia's forces at
Boreas could be key...

233
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,458
More people would
be likely to stand with us.

234
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,125
Forget this talk
of damaging them,

235
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,000
our goal should be
annihilation...

236
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,833
That tyrant likes bloodbaths
so let's treat him to one!

237
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,583
We'll make them bleed
for what they've done...!

238
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,916
We'll avenge our brethren
who were killed in Glacies!

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,791
Justice will be ours!

240
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,041
Victory will go to
the Joint Forces...

241
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,375
The only answer
to tyrants is death!

242
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,375
And a merciless execution
for the Turan witch

243
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,541
who helped them
with their massacre!

244
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,583
Death to the tyrants!

245
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,625
Death to the Turan witch!

246
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,625
Stop it!

247
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,791
Uh...

248
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,458
I mean, why don't we all just
take a deep breath...?

249
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,375
Surely there's no need for
us to be so bloodthirsty...

250
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,541
Sit down and be quiet weakling!

251
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,375
Me? A weakling...?

252
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,333
Sure, it's true I'm not
a soldier like you guys,

253
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,750
but that doesn't mean I--

254
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,166
Exactly! You are not soldier...
So keep your mouth shut!

255
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,541
But isn't peace what
brought everyone here...?

256
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,416
Honoring Farahnaz's wish...?

257
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,541
Making a world where another
Grand Race is possible?!

258
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,708
I'm not stupid.

259
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,416
I know we can't do that without
at least some fighting...

260
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,583
But you're talking about killing
just for the sake of revenge...

261
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,208
How will that help
us achieve our goal?

262
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,916
How does that make us
any better than them?!

263
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,375
You didn't have all your friends
and family slaughtered.

264
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,333
How could you
possibly understand?!

265
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,458
That's right!

266
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,666
What do you know about it?

267
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,083
--Sit down and be quiet!

268
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,500
--She knows nothing!
--Let it go, Fam. That's enough.

269
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,375
Wha--? Millia...

270
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,416
I'll be in contact
with you all tomorrow...

271
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,750
By that time,

272
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,041
I'll have the Boreas
defensive plans drawn up...

273
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,791
I thank you for
your cooperation.

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,250
I can't believe them!

275
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,708
Calm down, Fam.

276
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,541
Yeah, so maybe
I'm not a soldier...

277
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,916
...and maybe I can't
understand how they feel...

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,041
But I do know the vibe
in that room was all wrong!

279
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,666
I appreciate it, Fam.
Don't worry about me, though.

280
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,208
This is what matters now...

281
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:53,041
Defending Boreas Fortress from
Luscinia, whatever the cost.

282
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,458
Are you going to send
the Turan fleet out, too?

283
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,208
Good question... We have so
little time to get organized...

284
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,708
It's not going to be easy.

285
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,416
Even so, we must fight.

286
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,750
For Turan's future.

287
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,000
It'll work out, Millia.

288
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,000
You think?

289
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,458
If things don't go as planned,

290
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,916
there's always a chance you
could act as a mediator...

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,458
between the Joint Forces and
Princess Lily's people, I mean.

292
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,000
If that happens... you say the
word, and I'll be your wings.

293
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,750
Umm...

294
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,708
Really...?!
That was your father...?

295
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,666
The winner of the Grand Race?!

296
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,125
Uh... yes.

297
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,000
Wow...! That's incredible!

298
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,125
Yeah, you wouldn't believe it!

299
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,083
Atamora's team
was totally amazing,

300
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,500
like something out of a story!

301
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,083
And me and Gigi
have practiced really

302
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,208
hard to be as good as them.

303
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,291
You should see us, Sara!

304
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,541
I mean, Augusta...?

305
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,208
Please don't worry about it...

306
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,083
I want to hear
everything about that day.

307
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,166
Will you describe it for me?

308
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,375
They say the Grand Race was my
mother's dream brought to life.

309
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,791
A festive celebration meant to
bring happiness to the people.

310
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,541
Exactly!

311
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,791
That's what it did...

312
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,500
And that's why I'm gonna
make another one happen!

313
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,666
Oh, I know...!

314
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,958
Why don't you help us
hold a Grand Race?

315
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,833
You...
you want my help?

316
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,291
Of course...! Aw, man.

317
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,291
How did I not think of
this before now...?

318
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,333
With all of us working together,
it'll be perfect. Right?

319
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,875
Wow... You're
somethin' else, Fam.

320
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,958
Do you think that
could actually happen...?

321
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,958
A new Grand Race...?

322
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,416
Everywhere you
looked that day,

323
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,833
people had big smiles
on their faces!

324
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:43,000
Staring up at Atamora's Vespa,
the crowd was so happy!

325
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,333
Oh, do you know
what Vespas are...?

326
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,916
They're the small Vanships
we Sky Pirates use...

327
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,416
They may look tiny, but they
pack some serious power.

328
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,458
They're kinda like our secret
weapon, you know?

329
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,875
So, the total is
thirty-one battleships,

330
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,041
and six supply vessels...

331
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,208
That's a lot more
than I had expected!

332
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,375
There are many others out
there as well, still in hiding.

333
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,958
When they hear that you have
joined our cause, Princess,

334
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,208
I'm certain they will
all rush to our support.

335
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,916
That is... most encouraging.

336
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,333
After all this time...

337
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,625
We're finally returning
to our homeland!

338
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,958
I can't believe how
long it's been...

339
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,333
If only Grandfather
were here for this.

340
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,625
I heard when we're in Turan,

341
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,541
we'll get to eat
meat. Is it true?

342
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,958
I want meat too!

343
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,250
And you'll have it!

344
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,791
That's not all, either...

345
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,875
From now on,
there will be fish, too...

346
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,416
And you can eat as many
pastry treats as you want!

347
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,916
Yay!

348
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,958
Those are Gonians, aren't they?

349
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,416
Please, Princess...
Come away from there.

350
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,208
They need not trouble you.

351
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,750
They're the people who lived in

352
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,500
Turan before our
ancestors returned.

353
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,541
Yes, that's correct,
I'm afraid...

354
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,541
However, they are now a
part of the Joint Forces...

355
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,000
Unfortunately, that means we
can do nothing to stop them.

356
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,208
I've waited so long to plant
this seed where it belongs.

357
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,208
Oh, Lily... all these people...
Did you see them, too?

358
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,291
Oh, and I think my favorite
part of all was when

359
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,458
they pulled off a perfect
Split-S maneuver...

360
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,291
Like this, see?

361
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,333
Oh, wow...! Wow!

362
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,500
What is it? What do
you want to show us?

363
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,416
Just a bit further.

364
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,916
There, you see...?
That's my mother.

365
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,500
I don't remember her...

366
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,166
I was still little when
she passed away...

367
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,250
Just a baby,
too young for memories...

368
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,250
So this painting is all I have.

369
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,916
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,375
I want so badly to be like her.

371
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,791
You will, Sara. I know you will.

372
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,541
I'm scared.

373
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,583
I don't know why
Vasant and Luscinia

374
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,541
have to fight like this...

375
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,166
They've both worked so hard
and sacrificed so much

376
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,000
for the people of Ades.

377
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,541
And now this.

378
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,708
It's because I'm just a child...

379
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:27,291
Only a helpless little kid.
That's why...

380
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,208
That's why this is happening.

381
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,750
Luscinia was my mother's
bodyguard all those years ago.

382
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,833
When she died,
he blamed himself...

383
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,000
He was there, but he couldn't
do anything to stop it.

384
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,333
After it happened, he vowed to
protect me, no matter what...

385
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,125
and in order to do that, he
became Premier of all Ades.

386
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,416
All he wanted was to
create a peaceful world.

387
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,291
A world where I could
always be safe and happy.

388
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,625
Luscinia said he has
a dream of his own...

389
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,958
one that is very dear
and important to him.

390
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,458
He said there's a big,
ancient goddess

391
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,375
sleeping far away
to the north...

392
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,208
at the very edge of
where humans can go...

393
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,083
Luscinia wants to use
that goddess's power...

394
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,583
He says that, with her,
he can save the world.

395
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,916
The Augusta is
actually really nice!

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,083
Yeah! And she said we could
hang out again tomorrow!

397
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,666
Nice or not, she is still the
Augusta... Behave yourself.

398
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,083
Yeah, yeah, I know.

399
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,208
If you start teaching her
bad words or dirty jokes,

400
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,166
General Vasant might
have you executed.

401
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,166
Come on, Millia...
I would never do that.

402
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,125
Augusta?!.. What in
the world are you doing?!

403
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,041
Oops.

404
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,833
--Fam!
--Fam!
