1
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,500
Your Majesty...
you're still here.

2
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,791
Hello, Vasant.

3
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,166
I was just thinking
about my mother...

4
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,791
You knew her, didn't you?

5
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,958
Yes... I am proud to say so...

6
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:00,416
Augusta Farahnaz was a
truly magnificent woman.

7
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,916
Her ambitions were noble
and she held to them fast...

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,458
But despite the
pressures of rule,

9
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,625
she was rarely without a smile.

10
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,541
We were child soldiers then...

11
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:13,208
Your mother seemed like nothing
short of a goddess to us.

12
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,250
Over step.

13
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,083
Where'd those troublemakers
wander off to now?

14
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,541
Atamora!

15
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,041
Look at this... I got
something you need to see!

16
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,750
Here.

17
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,416
"Announcing the formation of
the Turan refugee government."

18
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,791
Yahoo!

19
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,791
Spreading this news
is a good start...

20
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,500
It should bring at least some
hope to the people of Turan.

21
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,458
It's important that they know
you're still alive and fighting.

22
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,000
That should at least put
a smile on their faces.

23
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,500
I hope so.

24
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:53,041
Right... One step closer to
the Grand Race... Let's go!

25
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,125
We're about halfway there.

26
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,583
Transport of the Sky Pirate
fleet will commence shortly.

27
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,500
All transport personnel,
please gather on deck.

28
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,291
Take a northbound detour.

29
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,125
The Federation still has their
First Fleet prowling about.

30
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,083
Roger that...! Though...

31
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,666
given that I'm
along for the ride,

32
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,500
there shouldn't
be any problems.

33
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,916
My regards to the
people of Anatoray.

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,666
Sure.

35
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,625
Impressive how many ships
they've managed to gather

36
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,791
in so little time.

37
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,041
It is... Oh, I meant to ask.

38
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,375
Have you heard about something
called a "Grand Race?"

39
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,708
Yeah...

40
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,458
Apparently it was a
competition that took place

41
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,458
long before we returned...

42
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,041
Why do you ask?

43
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,958
Curious... it's just a term I
seem to be hearing a lot lately.

44
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,583
Where's that...? Anatoray?

45
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,708
Ah... you're alone?

46
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,791
Yes. I'm scouting out
a new target for us.

47
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,916
We've still got a ways to
go before we reach fifteen.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,500
It must be rough... Getting
dragged into this, I mean.

49
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,708
No... A navi's job is to
stick beside her pilot...

50
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,833
No matter what.

51
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,250
That's true, but if you
have a reckless pilot...

52
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,750
things get tricky.

53
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,625
I know.

54
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,083
Sometimes another part of the
job is speaking your mind...

55
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,125
If you always keep your
opinions to yourself,

56
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,666
you might both end up
losing your way.

57
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,041
I am pleased with how
productive this conference

58
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,583
of allied nations has
been, Lady Vasant.

59
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,583
And I am certain the Augusta
will appreciate your countries'

60
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,458
timely demonstration
of wisdom and prudence.

61
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,833
Turan were fools...

62
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,083
I'm sure you'll find we
exhibit far better judgment

63
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,625
than they ever did.

64
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,625
Our sincere hope is that as
members of the Ades Federation,

65
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,083
we can work together to
ensure prosperity for all...

66
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,625
Such is the true
definition of world peace.

67
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,333
Yes, indeed...

68
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,375
The Augusta is dedicated to
fulfilling her loyal subjects'

69
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,166
expectations for the future.

70
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,958
Clearly the mark
of a worthy ruler.

71
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,708
I think I speak for us all...

72
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,791
when I say it is a comfort
to have you acting

73
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,791
as the Federation's
representative.

74
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,500
Your history does make you
uniquely suited to the task.

75
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,208
The "Amethyst of Chaos."

76
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,291
To think that you,
the scion of a nation

77
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,833
that was once a thorn
in the Federation's side,

78
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,500
are now a general under the
Augusta's direct command...

79
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,041
Let us not speak of the past...

80
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,750
The Chaos region hasn't been
known as such for a long time.

81
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,208
The returnees' kings
have scrambled like mad

82
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,125
to send emissaries to this
conference of allies...

83
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,041
It appears they hope to
ensure their own survival...

84
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,916
at the expense of their
lands and their people.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,083
I imagine they were horrified
by what happened to Turan...

86
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,791
I realize he was dealing
with returnees, but really,

87
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:56,166
that bodyguard of his doesn't
possess a shred of mercy.

88
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,083
I have to wonder how far
that bloodthirsty upstart

89
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,875
will need to expand the battle
lines before he's satisfied.

90
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,208
When you get right down to it,

91
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,875
he's nothing but
a glorified guard

92
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,833
who's got the young Augusta
wrapped around his finger.

93
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,958
Sadri will head from the
Corbeau Peninsula to Batos.

94
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,916
Kayvan will go to Reetus.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,875
And Orang goes to Ta Opisthen...

96
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,458
Finally, Sorush will
head for Boreas...

97
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,875
They are all bountiful lands

98
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,291
which provide ample
resources of wheat...

99
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,666
Boreas in particular--
if I'm not mistaken,

100
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,458
they're rich in
Claudia deposits too.

101
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,958
That is correct, Augusta...!

102
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,250
You are becoming a very
knowledgeable ruler, indeed.

103
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,833
I have Vasant to thank for that.

104
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,291
There is so much to be done

105
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,500
if I am to become a great
Augusta like my mother.

106
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,541
That's the dream
closest to my heart...

107
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,916
I want our people to live
richer, happier lives.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,083
You have a heart of gold...
I make this vow...

109
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,875
I, Sorush, will
do all in my power

110
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,666
to recapture our
lost territories.

111
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,041
Well...? Wouldn't you like
to say something, too?

112
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,916
I let my achievements
speak for me,

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,166
rather than resort to
long-winded bravado.

114
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,958
Be careful, so that
you may return safely...

115
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,875
And, Sorush, try not
to get too friendly

116
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,583
with any girls you
encounter along the way.

117
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,791
Why did she say that, Orang?

118
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,125
What have you been
telling the Augusta?

119
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,000
Luscinia!

120
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,500
The pieces have come together.

121
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,000
Preparations are in place
to conquer each nation.

122
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,750
Then we shall begin
tonight, as planned.

123
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,916
Also, I came across this
in former Turan territory.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,416
A Turan refugee government?

125
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,541
So, she has made
her first move...

126
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,708
Well... It seems
Princess Millia...

127
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,375
is doomed to lose
everything yet again.

128
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,750
What?!

129
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,541
All my precious
ships?! Gone?!

130
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,750
"We've moved all the ships
you've acquired so far...

131
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,708
They've been relocated
to a safe location,

132
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,875
pending completion
of your mission."

133
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,500
"You have seven battleships
to go... Best of luck."

134
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,000
Where is this "safe location"?

135
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,583
Who knows?

136
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,291
My goodness...
this is quite a place.

137
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:35,500
Yep... Eldorado
entertainment area...

138
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,208
They hold lots of underground
Vanship races here...

139
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,041
That's what it's most known for.

140
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,583
As you can see, we have a
referral from Duke Bollner.

141
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,000
All right, boys...!

142
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,458
Time to make some money...!
Today's gonna rule!

143
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,416
We're gonna make a man
outta you yet, little guy.

144
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,375
Just you wait. Ha!

145
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,583
Excuse me, I take it
you're Lady Roshanak Babar,

146
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,916
the Federation baroness.

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,250
And you would be...?

148
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,208
Fam Fan Fan...
I'm a Vanship pilot.

149
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,833
Is that so...?

150
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,958
And what does a Vanship pilot
such as yourself want with me?

151
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,500
We were told you're a regular
patron of Eldorado,

152
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,041
and that you're particularly
interested in the Vanship races

153
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,291
that are held here.

154
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,625
Indeed...

155
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,125
In fact, I have my own
participant racing today.

156
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,416
I have an offer...

157
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,375
I'll compete against
this contestant of yours.

158
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,166
If I win, I want ownership
of your state battleship,

159
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,500
the Nahid.

160
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,375
Very well... and in exchange,
if my man wins...

161
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,375
My compensation will
be... that cutie.

162
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,333
Huh?!

163
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,666
What can I say?

164
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,958
My weakness for young boys

165
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,000
is almost as strong as
my love of gambling...

166
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,583
And this one here
is very much my type.

167
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,833
You're gonna make another
one of these bets, milady?

168
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,625
Oh, Lady Roshanak...

169
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,458
you certainly do have
a fondness for them.

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,166
Awesome... We got this.

171
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,500
Fam, shush!

172
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,041
That's why I'm dressed
this way? To act as bait?!

173
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,708
Don't worry about it...

174
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,500
The races they hold here're
always real low-level stuff...

175
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,125
Right?

176
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,125
Yeah... I guess...

177
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,041
Yashbal!

178
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,208
Yes, Mistress...
How may I serve you?

179
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:48,291
The Yashbal Anand?! No way!
What the heck is he doing here?

180
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,375
Um, who?

181
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,125
He... he's a pilot.

182
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,166
One of the ones who
flew in the Grand Race!

183
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,166
My, aren't you well-informed...?

184
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,083
Especially for one so young...

185
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,666
Yashbal was indeed a
finalist in the Grand Race.

186
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,500
He has quite the reputation.

187
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,958
Even here, where he's known
only as the Unbeatable Falcon.

188
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,375
Hey...! No fair,
usin' a fake name!

189
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,000
By the way, after a
hundred-twenty races,

190
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,208
he's undefeated.

191
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,208
If you lose,
I'll kill you myself.

192
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,583
Last Exile.

193
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,916
It's set up as a
twenty-lap speed race...

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,041
The course is ten miles long...

195
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:39,083
Which means it'll last
around two hours, I guess.

196
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,791
We need a strategy...

197
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,625
That final deceleration
point will be the key...

198
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,208
And it's safe to
assume our opponent

199
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,791
knows the course inside and out.

200
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,583
Goin' up against a Grand
Race finalist though...

201
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,500
Beating this guy's not
gonna be a piece o'cake.

202
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,875
Yeah, unfortunately,

203
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,625
I think that's a bit
of an understatement.

204
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,875
Especially if he's stayed
active in competitions

205
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,500
since the Grand Race...

206
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,833
unlike Dad and the
other Sky Pirates.

207
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,500
On the bright side...

208
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,625
we've still got another
Grand Race to hold.

209
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,291
Aw yeah...! They're about
to start, you guys!

210
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,791
Remember, make our move
on the final lap...

211
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,083
Until then, we can take things a
bit slower and even fall behind

212
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,958
a little where
everything bottlenecks...

213
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,541
Just don't lose him!

214
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,291
Roger that... I'll leave it to
you as far as the timing goes.

215
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,083
Go, Fam.

216
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,583
Amazing... this guy's
a serious racer.

217
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,500
Man, look at him go...!
He's got a huge lead!

218
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,666
He... looks like
he's gonna crash.

219
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,375
Dude's got guts, and he
ain't afraid to show it.

220
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,041
No wonder he's the
favorite to win...

221
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,208
No one else's even comin' close!

222
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,041
Worried?

223
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:16,250
No... Fam won't lose
to him. I'm sure of it.

224
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's chat a bit...

225
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:23,375
Have you... heard about
this new Turan government?

226
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,583
Wherever you go, it's all
anyone's talking about...

227
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,541
I can't believe they're still
determined to resist...

228
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,500
Not after how thoroughly the
Federation defeated them.

229
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,250
I don't know about that kinda
stuff... I'm just a kid.

230
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,916
Everyone's saying
how ridiculous it is.

231
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,500
You should be ashamed...

232
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,291
As a group, you have been
motivated only by greed and

233
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,333
the selfish desire to
protect your own interests...

234
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,791
Even more despicably,

235
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,625
you are guilty of countless
crimes against the state.

236
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,666
We have received
reliable reports...

237
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,625
that you have willingly turned
over your personal battleships

238
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:15,041
to Princess Millia of Turan...
and assisted in her uprising...

239
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,791
Today it was announced
that Turan has established

240
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,500
a refugee government...

241
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,083
This was only possible because
of your traitorous assistance.

242
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,791
No...! That's absurd...!

243
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,250
We would never even consider
giving aid to Turan.

244
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,500
You must understand, our
battleships were stolen,

245
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,250
that was all the
Sky Pirates' doing...

246
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,916
We didn't willingly offer
them up for their use!

247
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,500
These accusations are ludicrous!

248
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,083
This is a royal decree...

249
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,416
You are hereby
sentenced to death.

250
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,041
It's... the Extermination Squad!

251
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,291
He barely slowed down at all!

252
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,000
Fam!

253
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,916
This brings back memories...

254
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,208
It's almost like the
Grand Race itself.

255
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,750
Of course... it's no more
than a false veneer.

256
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:33,416
These ladies...? Once royalty
in powerful kingdoms...

257
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,333
In exchange for
the small sacrifice

258
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,166
of their homelands and pride...

259
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,083
they were made
members of the nobility.

260
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,500
The same bargain I made.

261
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:48,000
Just forsake your kingdom...
and you'll save yourself, right?

262
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,208
Patriotism, responsibility...
Do they honestly matter...?

263
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,583
Fighting might save your
precious pride... But why...?

264
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,166
Such tenacity is noble,

265
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,791
but it will simply lead to
more conflict and bloodshed.

266
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,208
It's pointless.

267
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,708
I couldn't disagree
with you more.

268
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,125
To live a life
devoid of honor...

269
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:22,083
utterly empty of any meaning...
I would prefer death.

270
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,250
Nothing is going
to save you now...

271
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,375
Please don't make this any
harder than it needs to be.

272
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,125
We will kill each
and every person

273
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,041
who dares sully the
name of the Augusta!

274
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,000
I can't keep up.

275
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,166
It's down to the final lap...
He's got this in the bag!

276
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,833
Come on, Fam.
You gotta get it in gear!

277
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,500
Don't let it end like this!

278
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,666
Gigi, how much
farther to the goal?

279
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,166
We've only got a
quarter-mile to go.

280
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,166
Right...! Cut the fuel!

281
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,875
Gigi!

282
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,541
All right. I'm on it!

283
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,708
Please, Fam.

284
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,666
Here goes. Jettisoning
left wired spear.

285
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,958
Dumping all fuel, coolant,
and Claudia reserves...

286
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,666
That should do it!

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,750
What? She dumped their fuel?

288
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,375
Huh...? Huh?!

289
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,125
She jettisoned it to
drop the extra weight.

290
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,458
That's one gutsy
last-ditch gamble...!

291
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:35,041
Even so... How's she
gonna make the turn?

292
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,625
I won't lose!

293
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,541
Oh, no...! They're gonna crash!

294
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,958
Now!

295
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,000
Wow...! She actually
pulled it off!

296
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,750
Yeah, they won!

297
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,708
Aw, man...! I lost it all!

298
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,166
That was amazing! You won!

299
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,375
Thanks, Millia!

300
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,833
Great job... but please...

301
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,166
don't ever scare me
like that again!

302
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,958
I don't think I could take it!

303
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,750
Yeah sure... but...

304
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,500
at least we put on
a good show, right?

305
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,041
Yes, just incredible...!
My heart was beating so fast...

306
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,791
It was nearly as intense
as an actual Grand Race.

307
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,708
You were nothing more
than a common bodyguard.

308
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,666
How can you do this...?

309
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,416
Have you forgotten
Lady Farahnaz's wish?

310
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,708
I have not forgotten the
former Augusta's wish.

311
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,583
But granting it...

312
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,333
Requires your blood.

313
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,708
The purge has begun...

314
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,291
Purify the world in
the name of the Augusta.

315
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,083
We'll make the
announcement at dawn.

316
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,625
Understood.

317
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,250
I never imagined they
would use that strategy

318
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,583
to negotiate the turn.

319
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,083
I have failed you
shamefully, Mistress...

320
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,875
I accept any punishment
you choose to give me.

321
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,541
Somehow, I think this
may be--for the best.

322
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:30,791
She won the Nahid...
It's hers to take.

323
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,208
Unbelievable...!

324
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,041
You mean to say none of
you put money on me?!

325
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,250
Well, I hope you've all
learned your lesson...

326
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,916
From now on, there
better be no question

327
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,666
who you're dealin' with!

328
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,375
I am the future champion
of the Grand Race, got it?!

329
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,750
What's the matter, Teddy?

330
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,583
Um.. during that last race,

331
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,291
Ignace and the others kinda
talked me into, well...

332
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,833
They talked you
into placing a bet?

333
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,541
Right.. So, of course,
I bet on you and Fam.

334
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,750
Huh?

335
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,708
Then the crowd went
wild about some upset,

336
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,583
but I don't really know
what that means...

337
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,875
Am I supposed to do
something with this ticket?

338
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:38,958
You haven't cashed it in?

339
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,541
"Cashed it in"?
What's that mean?

340
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,416
Somebody, quick!
Stop the ship!

341
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,083
We need to go back to
Eldorado right now!
