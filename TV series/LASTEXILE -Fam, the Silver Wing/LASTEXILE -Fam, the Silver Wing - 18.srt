1
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,833
Admiral Sadri says that he
agrees to the cease-fire.

2
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,458
Thank you!

3
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,375
Aw, it was nothing!

4
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,333
[in Russian]

5
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,166
Transposition.

6
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,666
Thank you for overseeing
things in my absence.

7
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,625
I accepted the truce without
first consulting you...

8
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,916
I hope that I was
not out of line.

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,333
No, you made the proper
decision, Admiral...

10
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,833
I commend your handling of
the battle for Boreas...

11
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,000
Overall, a job very well done.

12
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,833
Thank you, sir...
but you are too kind.

13
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:43,041
Luscinia... I am so glad
that you've returned.

14
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:47,125
Gloria, Augusta...
I am at your mercy.

15
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,708
A great deal of blood has been
shed in the recent fighting...

16
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,208
For this I bear full
responsibility...

17
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,166
I offer my deepest apologies
to the people of Ades

18
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,791
and all foreign lands.

19
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,083
Vasant... Luscinia.

20
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,041
I am happy to see you
standing before me

21
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,791
peacefully once more...

22
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,916
Happier than you know.

23
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,583
Please, accept my
apologies, Augusta...

24
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,041
I have caused pain
to Your Majesty...

25
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,708
For that... I am
filled with shame.

26
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,875
Although, I had no choice...

27
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,333
I am sorry, but I could
not stand idly by

28
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,125
and allow Luscinia's heinous
crimes to continue...

29
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,875
Before this truce is final, I
demand the Premier be replaced.

30
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,458
How dare you...?!

31
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,875
You are the treasonous
one here, Vasant...

32
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,500
For what you've done, I demand
you face a court-martial.

33
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,583
You were the one who fired on
the Augusta's flag, Kayvan...

34
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,333
That is the action of a traitor.

35
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,125
We were rescuing the Augusta
from a disloyal general.

36
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,541
Disloyal?!

37
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,291
You heard me, you turned
your back on the Ades cause...

38
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,458
when you willingly
supported the repatriates!

39
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,750
The Ades cause...?

40
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,000
The Federation's only
cause now appears to be

41
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,541
the total destruction of other
lands...!

42
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
The victims are many...

43
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,291
Turan, Glacies, and
Anatoray, as well.

44
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,291
Tell them about your "cause."

45
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,250
I am happy to.

46
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,166
Our objective is quite simple...

47
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,291
We wish to see this
world's limited resources

48
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,250
passed on to the
next generation.

49
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:25,666
The ruler of Turan herself
understands what must be done.

50
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,250
Yes, he speaks the truth...

51
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
Luscinia's cause is a just one.

52
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,166
And the kingdom of
Turan supports it.

53
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,791
I am Millia il Velch
Cutrettola Turan...

54
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,708
and I ask to speak.

55
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,208
Oh! I'm so sorry...

56
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,666
I'll bring a replacement
straight away.

57
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,750
What is security like?

58
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,666
Tighter than expected.

59
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,208
I see...

60
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,625
Lily, you are unfit
to lead our kingdom.

61
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,541
Listen to the princess speak...

62
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,666
I have no doubt that she will
sympathize with our cause...

63
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,166
Do whatever it
takes to bring her.

64
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,041
It shall be done.

65
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,166
Do not speak of what you
do not understand, Millia...

66
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,666
We must consider ourselves first

67
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,750
as inhabitants of this world
and then as Turanians.

68
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,708
Is that how you justify
using the Exile

69
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,833
to murder thousands
of innocents?

70
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,916
This world we live on
is far too small...

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,208
It lacks adequate
space and resources

72
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,583
to provide for everyone.

73
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,833
That may be true...

74
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,333
but it doesn't give you
the right to choose

75
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,625
who lives and dies.

76
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,083
That decision is
not yours to make.

77
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,291
In other words...

78
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,500
Princess Liliana was
a willing accomplice

79
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,458
to the crimes committed
by Premier Luscinia...

80
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,833
And, as such,
she has demonstrated

81
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,708
her unworthiness to claim
leadership of Turan...

82
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,333
Is that what you're trying
to say, Princess Millia?

83
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,708
Uh, yes... Yes, that's right!

84
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,708
Lily, you have acted in
defiance of our people's will!

85
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:12,041
Can you not see that?!

86
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,458
She cannot...

87
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,250
Your plea has fallen on
deaf ears, Princess Millia...

88
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,375
Our requirements
are as follows...

89
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,333
Premier Luscinia
must be replaced

90
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,791
and stripped of all titles...

91
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:26,083
and Liliana must be
placed in our custody.

92
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,500
Thanks... to the tragedies
in Turan and Glacies...

93
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,958
It is clear the Exile
must be sealed away.

94
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,416
What does she mean by that?

95
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,416
Princess Lily needs
to be locked up...

96
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,458
If she is, it will prevent the
Exile from being used again.

97
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,875
Huh?

98
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:45,083
Without the Exiles, this world
will never know peace.

99
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,416
By nature, people are greedy...

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,666
Left unchecked...

101
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,541
that greed will completely
devour the world.

102
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,500
As has happened once already.

103
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,666
So there is no room
for compromise?

104
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,791
Surely you realized
that from the start.

105
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,875
Stop, both of you!

106
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,416
I'm begging you...

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,208
I don't want there to
be any more fighting.

108
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,958
Please... I ask you to
remember my mother's dream.

109
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,333
Vasant, I want you to stop
condemning Luscinia.

110
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,791
And, Luscinia...

111
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,541
I want you to promise you'll
never use the Exile again.

112
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,791
Sara's right! Listen to her...!

113
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,666
We all need to start
getting along...!

114
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,708
"Gloria, Augusta," and all that!

115
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,333
[applause]

116
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,291
Our soldiers are all
exhausted from battle...

117
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,416
It is time for us to set
aside our differences

118
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
for the sake of peace.

119
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,125
As Augusta, I hereby declare...

120
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,041
we have a truce!
The war is over!

121
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,458
Looks like the worst of
it is behind us now...

122
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,666
Three cheers for peace, eh?!

123
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,083
Hard to believe Fam's little
outburst led to this, huh?

124
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,791
Uh-huh--a grand ball...!
Wish I was going to it.

125
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,416
Why? You can't dance
to save your life!

126
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,083
So, are we still enemies...
or friends, again?

127
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,166
Things are happening
quite quickly, yes?

128
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,458
War has a way of severing
ties between people...

129
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,125
not just among friends,
but even among family.

130
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,208
She looks... like Raha...!

131
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,666
I don't see why I had
to get all dressed up.

132
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,666
This ball is being held
by the Augusta herself...

133
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,875
But I have to say,
you look pretty good.

134
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,125
Y'don't have to
sound so surprised!

135
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,833
Millia!

136
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,541
You should try to cheer up!
The fighting's finally over...

137
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:27,708
So that means you and
Princess Lily can make up now!

138
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,916
Just talk it through,
I'm sure she'll come around.

139
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,583
Gigi?

140
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,208
Enough.

141
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,583
Lady Fam Fan Fan.

142
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,625
You are largely responsible
for our newfound peace...

143
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,166
Would you be so kind as to honor
this old man with a dance?

144
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,458
Wha--Huh?!

145
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,750
What do you think?

146
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,833
The dress is lovely on you.

147
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,916
I was talking about the truce.

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,500
Oh, I see...

149
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,875
Things are still pretty
volatile, I'd say...

150
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,458
Serious faces
everywhere you look.

151
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,000
Huh...? Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

152
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,250
Are your parents well,
Lady Fan Fan?

153
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,083
Uh-whoops...!
Sorry about that...

154
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,875
What did you ask me?

155
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,708
I was asking how your
mother and father are.

156
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,333
I dunno... I've never
seen them before.

157
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,375
Please forgive my rudeness.

158
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,833
Don't worry about it...

159
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,875
Most of the time I feel like
I'm part of Gigi's family.

160
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,291
And have you always
been a Sky Pirate?

161
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,333
Yeah... I've been flying for
as long as I can remember.

162
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,750
Your parents, too?

163
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,333
I'm... not sure.

164
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:45,083
I heard they were from another
country and died in an accident.

165
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,250
Well--

166
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,541
Ahh!

167
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,666
I am so sorry!

168
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,041
Well water from
the Ruins of White...

169
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,583
the rarest quality...

170
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,166
Will you join me in
drinking to our new peace?

171
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,041
Thank you.

172
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,250
I heard that you
and General Sorush

173
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,458
had been friends
for a long time.

174
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:19,666
It's a horrible thing, fighting
against a family member.

175
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,500
Or against a good friend...

176
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,291
I know how you feel.

177
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,291
I just wish I knew
how it all came to this.

178
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,750
Who can really say...?

179
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:36,250
Perhaps we're being tested
by a power greater than us.

180
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,083
Maybe we are being
put through all this

181
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,041
to somehow prove
that we are worthy.

182
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,666
I'm glad we could talk.

183
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,041
Princess Millia.

184
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,208
My name is Emma.

185
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,333
I've been asked to deliver this
on behalf of Major Geeth.

186
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,541
Major Geeth?

187
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,208
He wishes to speak
with you personally

188
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,958
about Princess Liliana.

189
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,583
About my sister?

190
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,208
I've had enough
dancing for a lifetime!

191
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,333
Well, you didn't do
too badly out there.

192
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,666
--Where's Millia?
--What?

193
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,916
Last Exile.

194
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,958
Well...? You find her?

195
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,125
Huh-uh... but Dad and the
others are looking for her, too.

196
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,541
Dang it, Millia...
Where are you?

197
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,375
Thank you for coming
all this way, Princess.

198
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,333
You wanted to speak
about my sister?

199
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,125
We would like to see you
on the Turan throne

200
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,875
instead of Princess Lily.

201
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,583
Are you serious?

202
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,666
I assure you, all the
Turan people feel this way.

203
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,291
What does Liliana think?

204
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,125
There'd be no point in
discussing it with her.

205
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,541
She's before me in the
line of succession...

206
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,375
I cannot simply disregard our
laws and crown myself queen!

207
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,708
That problem would be solved
if you were first in line.

208
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,250
As I'm sure you're well aware,
she has been branded a witch...

209
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,541
She's a traitor to
the Turan people...

210
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,041
and she controls the
Exile for Luscinia...

211
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,333
the man who would conquer
the world in Ades' name.

212
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,583
Countless people have
lost their lives.

213
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:36,208
We ask that you
fulfill your royal duty.

214
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,041
We will devote our lives

215
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,541
to protecting and
serving you, Princess.

216
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,416
We need you to
retake our territory

217
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,208
from Ades' clutches
and rebuild Turan.

218
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,166
You are the only
hope we have left...

219
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,333
Without you, Turan dies.

220
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,291
You want me to...
kill my own sister...?

221
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,666
We have disclosed this to you

222
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,458
with full understanding
of the consequences...

223
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,791
Please give us your
decision, Princess.

224
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,000
It is time...! Your sister
must pay for her disgrace!

225
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:07,250
It'll work... You can get near
her without raising suspicion.

226
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,500
It's a terrible thing to
ask of you. I know that...

227
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,458
but it's the only
option, Princess!

228
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,541
What is your answer?

229
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,375
You again!

230
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,125
I beg you, don't harm them!

231
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,333
How could you have
turned us over to them?

232
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,541
Huh?!

233
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,875
You're going to turn
your back on Turan, too?

234
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,375
What? No!

235
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,458
So you would betray us,
just like your sister did!

236
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,250
No! I didn't do this!

237
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,833
Lord Luscinia would like a word.

238
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,041
Hey!

239
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,208
Anything?

240
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,541
We're all still looking...

241
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,833
Someone saw her and a maid get
into a Turan military vehicle.

242
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,541
Military?

243
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,291
Princess Millia, as requested.

244
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,875
Welcome to the Ruins
of White, Princess...

245
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,166
It was from this historic place;
that the all-powerful Guild

246
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,958
supervised this world
so many years ago.

247
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,666
Where are the others?

248
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,916
I'm sure they'll be
suitably punished.

249
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,666
Why? They haven't
done anything wrong!

250
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,291
In the name of Turan... I demand
they be released at once!

251
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,458
Tell me... do you
join your countrymen

252
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,416
in believing Liliana
and I are cruel and evil?

253
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,791
That the world
and everyone in it

254
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,125
would be better off
if we were gone?

255
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,500
Come this way.

256
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,916
Long ago, when this world's
resources had been depleted,

257
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,625
the Guild proposed
an emigration.

258
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,416
We'd escape to the heavens...

259
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,916
The world would wither,
but humanity would survive.

260
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
To see this plan
become a reality,

261
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,208
the Guild was given
authority and resources

262
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,708
beyond anything
you could imagine...

263
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,791
Take the "Twins," for instance.

264
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,000
They took pairs of young boys...

265
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,625
To protect the Guild,
they were forced to

266
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,083
endure the most
brutal training...

267
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,833
...until they were molded
into perfect killers.

268
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,166
When a weapon is sharp enough,

269
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,041
it becomes almost impossible
not to cut yourself on it.

270
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,333
Liliana wishes to
see you, Princess.

271
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,625
Does she really?

272
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,458
I'm worried...

273
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,833
Don't be... I'm sure
she'll come back soon...

274
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,250
Come on, Fam...

275
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,000
...you know she's a whole lot
stronger than she looks.

276
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm told that long ago,
crops from around the world

277
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,958
were brought here
for preservation.

278
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,083
But now...
well, just look at it...

279
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,375
Millia... I'm glad you
agreed to come.

280
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,958
Did I have much choice?

281
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,750
I want to know
why you betrayed Turan.

282
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,541
I want you to admit
what you did was wrong...

283
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,500
I don't understand...!

284
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,333
You loved our people so much.

285
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,500
How could you do this to them?!

286
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,166
You destroyed our land...

287
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,625
...betrayed all of us...

288
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,125
You've been branded the
Witch of Turan, and for what?

289
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,250
What are you trying
to accomplish?!

290
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,375
I can see I hurt you...

291
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,666
I never wanted
to cause you pain.

292
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,666
Don't avoid the question...!
Answer me!

293
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,125
Why are you helping Luscinia?!

294
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,500
All right.

295
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,666
If this is what you truly

296
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,708
believe you
must do... then do it.

297
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,416
Now!

298
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,083
Set aside your
personal feelings,

299
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,708
and do what must be done...

300
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,916
That is a princess's duty.

301
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,166
Please, Liliana...

302
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,375
By becoming a witch,
I am doing just that.

303
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,625
As I said... this world
is much too small for us...

304
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,416
If the returnee population
continues to grow...

305
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,875
...and deplete already
limited resources,

306
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,500
it will be less than a century
before we are plunged

307
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,666
into another age of calamity.

308
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,500
You still don't
have the right...

309
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,625
This is the only
path I can follow.

310
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,291
It can't be!

311
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,041
Luscinia's just one man...

312
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,875
He needs someone
else to stand by his side.

313
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,583
But why you?

314
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,416
"To rule a country, one
must make personal sacrifice

315
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,833
to solve unsolvable problems."

316
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,333
Those were our father's words.

317
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,250
Millia!

318
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,541
Hey!

319
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,375
Finally!

320
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,541
Thank goodness!

321
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,166
What's the matter?

322
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,791
Your sister's been safely
returned to the fortress.

323
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,666
Thank you. I appreciate
your thoughtfulness.

324
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,125
I want you to know
I'm truly sorry.

325
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,666
You're the last
person in the world

326
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,208
I expected to
say something like that.

327
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:59,041
Even so... we have no choice
but to continue forward.

328
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,583
You got to talk to her?
That's great...!

329
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,250
What did she say?

330
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,458
It's awful... I had no idea...

331
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,791
She's carrying such
a heavy burden...

332
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,708
...and she has to do
it all by herself.

333
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,833
Hey... look!

334
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,375
Usually you can only see them
if you're way further north.

335
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,750
Oh, wow... Just like
back in Glacies!

336
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,791
It's almost... frightening.

337
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,708
You know, I'm
actually kinda nervous.

338
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,458
I was getting worried
there for a while...

339
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,958
...but now the war is over...

340
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,666
...and Millia and Liliana
are speaking again...!

341
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,541
Holding another Grand Race isn't
just a crazy dream anymore!

342
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,000
Who knows, maybe
sometime next y--

343
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,750
What is it...? What's going on?

344
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,583
Why did you protect me?!

345
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,000
You need to live...

346
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:37,750
There is still something
you mus--must do.

347
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,000
Liliana!

348
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:46,000
Please Luscinia...
Look after my... sister.

349
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,833
Not again!

350
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,125
Liliana!

351
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,041
Wait...

352
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:57,291
Oh, no!

353
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,625
Millia!

354
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,416
Millia! What's wrong? 
Can you hear me?

355
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,708
--Please, stay with us!
--Millia...! Millia!

356
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,000
Millia!

357
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:21,416
Oh, Lily! So this is why...

358
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,000
Lily...!

359
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,916
Turan Refugee Government
Special Tea Squad!

360
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,250
Prepare to move out!

361
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,291
Yes, sir!

363
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,875

00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,791
Captain! Five minutes
'til raisin scone completion!

365
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:34,000
Good... ETA to
afternoon tea.. Ten minutes...

366
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,583
At last... the time has
come for us to use

367
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,000
the power we have so
carefully cultivated!

368
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,041
Yes, sir!

369
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,541
Glory to the Turan Tea Squad!

370
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,375
Yes, sir!
