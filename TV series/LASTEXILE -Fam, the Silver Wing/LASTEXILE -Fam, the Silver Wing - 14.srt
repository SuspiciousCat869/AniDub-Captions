1
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,333
[in Russian]

2
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,000
Smothered Mate.

3
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,250
Thank goodness...!

4
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,583
I can't believe it!
You're both all right!

5
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:18,625
I missed you so much...
And you too... All of you!

6
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:28,625
I missed you so much...
And you too... All of you!

7
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:36,625
I missed you so much...
And you too... All of you!

8
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,250
It's crazy to think about...

9
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,000
This whole time, they
could have destroyed us...

10
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,583
They just looked
the other way...

11
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,958
Like we weren't worth
their attention.

12
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,041
We thought we were
the pride of the sky...

13
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,875
but I guess that
was just a fantasy.

14
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:12,291
Why us...? What threat are we?
All we want to do is fly.

15
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,875
Oh... I forgot...

16
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:17,083
Atamora wanted me to pass
a message along to you.

17
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,916
He says our remaining ships
and people are at your disposal,

18
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,250
to help you however
you need going forward.

19
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,833
All right, Atamora!

20
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,208
He wants that? Are you sure?
For what purpose...?

21
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,958
I'm powerless now.

22
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,333
If there's one thing we know,

23
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,416
it's that you're our best
hope in this struggle.

24
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,041
If anyone can do it...
well, you're the one.

25
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,875
Thank you all so much...

26
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,083
No matter what happens,
I will never forget this...

27
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,166
No... Turan will never forget.

28
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,333
Okay, enough with
the formality...

29
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,875
Let's just do our best,
like we always do!

30
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,791
I won't let your
generosity go to waste...

31
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,583
I swear, somehow I will defeat
the Federation...

32
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,333
I'll make them pay... Not just
Luscinia, but Liliana too...

33
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:03,333
I'll destroy them both!

34
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,750
Uh... don't you think that's
a little much...? Heine?

35
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,333
Uh... Yeah...

36
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,708
First order of business, I need
to borrow several Vespas...

37
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,875
While the Federation's Anshar
is busy undergoing repairs,

38
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,958
I would like to retake it, for
use as my flagship.

39
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,500
Sure, if that's what you want.

40
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,958
Yes, thank you.

41
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,000
Is it me, or has something
about her changed?

42
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:40,041
She's been like this
for a while now.

43
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:52,958
She's been like this
for a while now.

44
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,708
I apologize for
the time it took,

45
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,666
but the First Fleet
is here, Premier...

46
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,083
That we were not swift enough
to join the other forces

47
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,083
in battle against Glacies,
I am deeply sorry.

48
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:08,458
Don't be... You still
have a part to play.

49
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:12,583
At long last, our goal
is nearing completion.

50
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:17,333
It has been how long...?
Ten years... Yes?

51
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,250
Yes... You have
supported me well...

52
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,958
and for that I thank you...

53
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,833
Sincerely, I could not have
done it without you...

54
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,625
I am in your debt.

55
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,958
I have lent you my assistance,
but the rest is your doing...

56
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,458
You have led the Federation
well these past years.

57
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,541
Thank you.

58
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,583
How long will it take
to rebuild our forces?

59
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,833
We can make the First
Fleet our primary force

60
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,333
for the time being...

61
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,750
but it will take
roughly one week

62
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,458
to resupply and reequip
the Third Fleet.

63
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,791
The Second and Fourth
can be repaired...

64
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,125
However, they're heavily
damaged from the battle

65
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,666
and require a month to
regain full strength.

66
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,416
Your reconnaissance
seems to indicate

67
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,291
that Anatoray's military power

68
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,833
has been undermined now that the
Silvius is out of the picture.

69
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,958
I think the First and Third
Fleets should have

70
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,625
no trouble dealing with
them on their own.

71
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:12,166
Impatient as ever, I see.

72
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,750
It is a fault of mine.

73
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,333
I'd hoped they would surrender
after seeing the power we wield.

74
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,625
Unfortunately, it seems they
wish to remain unreasonable.

75
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes... we have no choice...

76
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:33,166
We will attack in one week...
I leave the details to you.

77
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,208
Gloria, Augusta.

78
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,041
And your plans?

79
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,208
I will return in time...

80
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,166
There is a reason I came this
far north... my old friend.

81
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,583
Then you...?

82
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,791
So... The Premier
is going off on his own?

83
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,000
He is... Until he returns,

84
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,250
I am in charge of
the occupation forces

85
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,375
and the Glacien
interim government.

86
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,125
What is the meaning of this...?

87
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,625
Why would he choose
now of all times to leave us?

88
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,750
What could be more important
than our current fight?

89
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,958
It is not our place
to question him...

90
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,166
If Premier Luscinia believes
what he is doing is necessary,

91
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,375
then we must believe it as well.

92
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,625
I don't know the details
of what he plans...

93
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,166
...though I can't help
but remembering

94
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,333
something he once said.

95
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,166
He knew of something that
could usher in a time of peace

96
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,375
such as the world
has never known...

97
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,208
...and obtaining it was more
important than anything else.

98
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,208
This isn't right!

99
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,458
Would you please
calm down, Orang?

100
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,958
All we've fought
for is world peace...

101
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,500
In everything we have done, that
has always been our true goal.

102
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,416
We have shed so much blood...

103
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,625
We have suffered... And still...
that isn't enough for him?

104
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,916
Whatever he's
searching for, it must be vital

105
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,041
to the goal he's
worked for all this time.

106
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,541
Really...?
Then what is his goal?

107
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:11,666
No... clue... Still...
One thing we can't doubt...

108
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,541
The Premier has
been utterly selfless

109
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,708
in his leadership for
many years now.

110
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,791
The citizens recognize that...
and support him for it.

111
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,125
Yet this is the best we
can do for them?

112
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,125
Now you start doubting...?

113
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:31,375
We've used the Exile...
Or have you forgotten Turan?

114
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,458
I did not witness the
violence of its descent before.

115
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,541
Ah... and the 'seeing it'
is what unnerved you.

116
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,791
Death is death...

117
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,708
Maybe you end up with your
head displayed on a pike...

118
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,041
...or pulverized by
a barrage of cannon fire...

119
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,333
...or ground into
dust by an Exile.

120
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,208
Does the method matter...?

121
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,041
All casualties of
war end the same.

122
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,333
So...

123
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,875
You would call this justice?

124
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,208
Well... I couldn't say...

125
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:22,416
But maybe that is because I am
a mere soldier in all of this.

126
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,458
Perhaps he knows more...
perhaps he can see further...

127
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,458
Who are we to
question his vision?

128
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,833
I do know this...
This is a cold land.

129
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,791
Last Exile

130
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,250
Hey, it's her...!
We're with you Princess!

131
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,791
The people of Kartoffel
will never abandon Turan!

132
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,083
Princess!

133
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,083
Princess Millia!

134
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,625
You're looking too thin,
Princess!

135
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,208
I hope you're getting
enough to eat!

136
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,916
So... Princess Millia has taken

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,375
a liking to potato
pancakes, huh?

138
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,000
Yep, and on Fam's
birthday she even tried

139
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,125
whipping up a
batch all by herself...!

140
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,375
Can you believe a
princess would do that?

141
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,791
That's impressive for royalty...

142
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,375
Millia's road
will be a long one...

143
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,250
I think she'll need all the
support you can give her.

144
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,666
Oh, hello.
I'm glad you're all right.

145
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,458
Lily, no, how could you?

146
00:12:55,041 --> 00:13:00,125
Please stop this...! Lily!

147
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,958
Hey, Millia.

148
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,666
Hungry?

149
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,041
I'll pass for now.

150
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,333
Okay.

151
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,833
So... Fritz and
the gang are getting

152
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,375
everything prepped
so we can be on our way.

153
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,125
After we get the Anshar back,

154
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,208
maybe we should
go visit Anatoray...

155
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,000
It's supposedly way
off to the east,

156
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,250
so it'll probably
take us a while.

157
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,708
But I bet we could
find out what happened

158
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,208
to the Silvius that way...

159
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,875
We can see how the others
have held up through all this.

160
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,208
What do you think?

161
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,625
I want to continue our
alliance with Anatoray...

162
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,750
We need the strength
of their military forces...

163
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,083
But we don't have time t--

164
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,583
Millia.

165
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,958
The people of Anatoray...
they're more than a military.

166
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,750
I'm sorry...

167
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,625
Oh... no, it's okay...

168
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,208
I just want you to
let other people

169
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,791
share this
burden, that's all.

170
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:11,250
How can I...? She's my sister.
I'm responsible for Lily.

171
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,500
But obviously Luscinia's
controlling her.

172
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,125
She's under nobody's control...!

173
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,041
It's her... and whatever the
case, I have a job to do...

174
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,000
She's activated
the Exile twice now,

175
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,458
and it's my
responsibility to stop her.

176
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,541
But, still...!

177
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,416
No, it's true...!
Please understand.

178
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,250
This is something
I have to take care of.

179
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,041
So, you're willing
to kill Princess Lily?

180
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,500
I am.

181
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,208
Don't you see that's crazy...?

182
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,333
She's the only sister you have!

183
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,875
Sorry!

184
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,083
Well...

185
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,416
It's looking like they'll be
ready to go by tomorrow morning.

186
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,958
I dunno...

187
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,416
Don't you think it'd be smarter
to hold off for a while...?

188
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,625
I mean, they've been flying

189
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,666
practically non-stop,
haven't they?

190
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,250
Yeah, well...
you've seen Princess Millia.

191
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,750
Do you really think
she'd agree to wait now?

192
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,666
Sorry...! I need
you guys right now!

193
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,125
Giselle!

194
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:40,250
What's the matter, dear?
This isn't like you at all.

195
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,250
I'm sorry, Mom.

196
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,166
Is it Princess Millia?

197
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,375
Yeah.

198
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,416
Hey, Gigi!

199
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,500
Fam is looking for you.

200
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,583
You sure you
wanna try this again...?

201
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,875
Are you guys just
gluttons for punishment?

202
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,208
Hey...!

203
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,958
Do you wanna get out
here and race instead of us?

204
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,125
Oh... no... I wouldn't
wanna steal your thunder.

205
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,125
Okay, all good here.
I'm ready when you are.

206
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,416
I was born ready!

207
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, here we go...!
Three... Two! One! Fly!

208
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh! She's at it again.

209
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,375
Fam's always been this way...

210
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,041
It's what she does
when she's feeling upset...

211
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,500
She challenges whoever
she can find to a race.

212
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,958
Better pick up
the pace, Birdbrain...!

213
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,000
Unless eatin' our dust
will cheer you up...!

214
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,500
I'll show you!

215
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,958
Easy... Our engine
is already at its max.

216
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,541
Hey, Gigi... sorry
for dragging you along.

217
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,916
Don't be... I probably
need this as much as you do.

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,916
Well, good...! Let's punch it!

219
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,875
Later suckers!

220
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,750
What...?! How is she winning?

221
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,291
Well... she was part of
the Silvius crew for a while...

222
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,875
Makes sense that she's better.

223
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,458
It's not like we haven't been
through a hell of a lot, too...

224
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,250
Let's go!

225
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,541
It's an excellent match.

226
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,541
Kind of like the Grand Race...

227
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,375
I imagine it... just like this.

228
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,375
This is what I want to see.

229
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,666
Fam! Get ready!

230
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,750
Roger!

231
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,916
I want everyone to smile...

232
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,166
No matter what land they're from

233
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,083
I want everyone to
be happy again!

234
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,125
But...

235
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,083
It's just so... beautiful.

236
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,333
We're gonna show
you once and for all!

237
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,583
Heads up!

238
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,166
We lost the lead!

239
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:59,583
Fritz isn't bad, eh...? He might
hold onto the lead after all.

240
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,500
No way... Fam's got this.

241
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,958
Huh?

242
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:08,958
That's just her... She makes
people believe... Always.

243
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,333
I'll destroy them both.

244
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,708
I feel so helpless...
What can I do?

245
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,041
Once again, Fam is right.

246
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,500
I don't want to do it.

247
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,750
I don't want to.

248
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,916
Is it really so much to ask?
Just to see people smile?

249
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,125
If there's any
way to avoid it...

250
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:52,000
Lily...! I don't
want to kill you!

251
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,375
Dammit... Dammit!

252
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,708
Damn it!

253
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,791
What's the matter?

254
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,666
Such red eyes. Look at you!

255
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,083
Look at me...?
What about your eyes?

256
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:01,250
Yeah, whatever... I'm allowed
to be sad sometimes.

257
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,333
Your turn...
What's with your eyes?

258
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,666
It's nothing... I just got
a little dirt in them.

259
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,250
Right! I musta gotten a
little dirt in mine, too.

260
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,916
You said you were sad!

261
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,333
Am I addressing
Princess Millia of Turan?

262
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,166
Yes... I am Princess Millia.

263
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Excellent...

264
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,208
I come bearing a
message that requires

265
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,000
your immediate
and direct attention.

266
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,916
A message for me?

267
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,791
The official seal
of Augusta Sara!

268
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:54,333
Wha--? As in
the Federation's ruler?

269
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,708
"Let it hereby be known...

270
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,208
Augusta Sara is deeply troubled
by the repeated acts of violence

271
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,250
perpetrated by Premier Hafez...

272
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,791
and has decided he must be

273
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,333
brought to justice
without delay.

274
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,750
"To that end...

275
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,041
...she would like to
extend an offer of peace,

276
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,125
as well as the promise of
aid to all who have suffered

277
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,791
as a result of Luscina's
reprehensible actions."

278
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,750
"Princess Millia of Turan...

279
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:26,375
The Augusta humbly
asks for your support in this."

280
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,958
I don't get it.
What's happening?

281
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,291
Well if we're
reading this right,

282
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,208
the Augusta's going to get
rid of Premier Luscinia.

283
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,750
This can't be from her alone.

284
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,583
She's too young.

285
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,583
Someone from within the
Federation helped her...

286
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,333
Someone who wants to
rise against Luscinia.

287
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,916
We've never been to Ades before.

288
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,458
Everyone in the
Federation really

289
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,791
adores the Augusta, right?

290
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,333
Well, that's partially
because she's so young.

291
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,500
I wonder what kind
of place she lives in.

292
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,916
I bet it's a super
swanky royal palace!

293
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,916
That's not how
I've heard it described.

294
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,708
Oooh! I wonder if she'll welcome
us with a fancy banquet!

295
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,833
Just thinking about
it makes me drool.

296
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,083
I'm so excited!

297
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,541
That's enough, you two!

298
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,041
We're not going
there to have fun!
