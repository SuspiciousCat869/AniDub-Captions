1
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,458
We come to this holy
place to seal a pact

2
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,333
between two great peoples...

3
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,750
With this sacred water...

4
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,416
drawn from the blue
depths of the Hole,

5
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,041
source of the Grand Lake...

6
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,083
I celebrate and bear
witness to this covenant

7
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,625
between Anatoray and Turan.

8
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,083
Representing Anatoray-Disith...

9
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,750
Commander of the Vanguard
Unit... Vincent Alzey.

10
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,541
On behalf of the
government of Anatoray...

11
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,375
I hereby make
covenant with Turan.

12
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,708
Millia il Velch
Cutrettola Turan...

13
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:35,416
As proxy for Turan... and
for its regent Liliana...

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,458
I hereby make covenant
with Anatoray.

15
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,583
Illegal Move.

16
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,041
Whew...! My shoulders
are killin' me.

17
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,666
It was pretty nerve wracking...

18
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,291
Millia sure looked
beautiful, though.

19
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,875
She was every inch a princess
during the ceremony.

20
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,250
It's so good to see her
getting back to her old self.

21
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,041
Yeah, I agree...
She's one impressive girl.

22
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,458
Fam...! Gigi!

23
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,250
You actually did it...
You built her a fleet!

24
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,500
And on top of that,

25
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,416
you even got old Silvius
the Reaper on our side!

26
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,375
Looks like you might
be a rival, after all.

27
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,958
Your rival?! You wish!

28
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,500
--What, intimidated?
--Not even a little!

29
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,083
Well... we better head out.

30
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,750
We're gonna go scatter
these all over the place.

31
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,291
"Anatoray and Turan hereby
form an alliance...

32
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,958
Together, we will oppose
Federation invasions...

33
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,041
Come gather, fellow
citizens of the world...

34
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,291
Take a stand and fight
for your freedom."

35
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,833
This sounds great, you guys!

36
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,500
Doesn't it?!

37
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,791
Don't get excited.
It's non-alcoholic...

38
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,916
We're all countin' on
you to spread the word.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,375
Yeah, we loaded
you up with gifts...

40
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,333
Just don't go crashing
from all the weight okay?

41
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,708
Thanks a lot...
The kids'll appreciate it.

42
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,583
Fair winds to you.

43
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,666
Fair winds to you!

44
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,000
Good tailwinds to you!

45
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,083
Tell everyone we say "hi"!

46
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,458
Drink up, me hearties!

47
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,833
My friends... the
Federation is mighty...

48
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,333
and so... we shall work to
strengthen our alliance...

49
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,875
We shall recruit others...

50
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,916
Together, we shall
be a bright flame...

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,708
burning hot enough to
consume the Federation...

52
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,708
May victory belong to us!

53
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,833
People of Anatoray.

54
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,583
You have my deepest gratitude...

55
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,416
When we had nowhere to turn...
you gave us hope...

56
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,416
I speak for all of
Turan when I say,

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,708
"I welcome Anatoray's
return home!"

58
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,291
Let us continue
side-by-side in this.

59
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,833
Together we will make this
world a bountiful one.

60
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,708
Dio.

61
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,083
Have you touched them
yet...? The clouds?

62
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,750
I'm so full!

63
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,250
No dessert, then?

64
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,666
Maybe later.

65
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,041
I can't move... my dress
has gotten too tight.

66
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,875
Please try some of the
coffee I made, Princess.

67
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,875
It's an Urbanus institution.

68
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,041
Sounds lovely, thanks.

69
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,416
Whoa, bitter...

70
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,208
Congratulations, Princess...

71
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,833
Looks like all your hard
work has finally paid off.

72
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,208
Thanks in part to you...

73
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,000
I promise I will
uphold the agreements

74
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,041
you reached with my sister.

75
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,625
Our main forces haven't
arrived... just us so far...

76
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,166
We are still lacking
in military might.

77
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,500
Which explains why your
activities have been covert.

78
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,000
Since you know this world,
I could use your advice...

79
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,375
Who else would you recommend
we bring into our alliance

80
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,375
in the immediate future?

81
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,958
In terms of sheer
military muscle,

82
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,458
the northern nation of
Glacies is right at the top...

83
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,291
Unfortunately,
they're isolationists,

84
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,833
and have cut off all relations
with outside peoples.

85
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,250
And if we add to that,

86
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,041
the fact the Silvius commenced
hostilities with them...

87
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,875
Gettin' nations with
such different cultures

88
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,666
and traditions ta see
eye-to-eye is no easy task.

89
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,416
Tell ya the truth,
even us Sky Pirates

90
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,625
have trouble managin'
ironclad solidarity.

91
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:24,000
So this is what they mean
by an "acquired taste."

92
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,208
Who is this girl?

93
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,583
Let me introduce you...
This is Alvis Hamilton.

94
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,958
No need to be scared...

95
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,125
My name's Fam Fan Fan...
but just Fam is fine...

96
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,375
and these two are...

97
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,916
Oh, I'm Millia.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,875
And next to her's my navi, Gigi.

99
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,375
It's nice to meet you.

100
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,291
Alvis here can control
the Anotaray Exile...

101
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,625
She's a very special young girl.

102
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,000
She controls it?!

103
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,291
There's no need to be
frightened, Millia...

104
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,208
Al happens to be a
dear friend of mine.

105
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,583
She's already lost
much in her life...

106
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,166
and endured many hardships...

107
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,875
But despite what's
happened to her,

108
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,208
Al is always
considerate of others...

109
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,333
a trait she has in
common with your sister.

110
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,500
Dio explained everything
to me, Princess...

111
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,583
about how you and
your sister are like me.

112
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,333
What are you talking about?

113
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,208
The ability to activate one
of the Exiles is passed down

114
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,708
through the women of
the Turan royal family...

115
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:43,458
From mother to daughter...
from daughter to granddaughter.

116
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,208
The dormant Exiles are
in orbit above us...

117
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,166
But they will descend to
the surface when called.

118
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,833
Only one female
has this ability...

119
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,916
Should she die,
the power passes on

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,458
to the female closest
to her in age...

121
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,250
Sometimes her daughter...
sometimes her younger sister.

122
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,291
But I don't have
any power like that.

123
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,125
Which means we know
your sister still lives.

124
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,458
That's amazing news!

125
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,333
Oh no!

126
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,208
Federation ships approaching.
All hands to battle stations...

127
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,791
Federation ships approaching!
All hands to battle stations!

128
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,333
Acoustics ID'ed... Federation
ship Impetus approaching.

129
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,875
Luscinia is here?

130
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,208
Flags spotted!

131
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,833
Looks like the Premier...
and a Turan princess!

132
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,125
A... Turan princess?

133
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,500
Lily, is it you?

134
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,708
Princess Liliana is still alive?

135
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,125
I can hardly believe it!

136
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,708
Did the Federation
take her captive?

137
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,916
It really is you!

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,083
Look at that...!
It is Princess Lily.

139
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,458
Lily! I'm so happy
you're all right!

140
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,125
Millia... Thank you for
all of your hard work.

141
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,541
And Fam, Giselle...

142
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,750
Thank you for all the help
you've provided my sister.

143
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,958
Oh... Sure!

144
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,208
Uh... Lily--

145
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,833
Are you the commander
of Anatoray's military?

146
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,875
Vincent Alzey, Princess...

147
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,125
I speak with the authority
of the Anatoray government.

148
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,041
You also aided my sister...
My humble gratitude.

149
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,041
I did what anyone in
my position would.

150
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,541
Hear me, beloved
people of Turan.

151
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,208
You have endured much and still
held fast to your loyalty...

152
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,583
It fills me with a fierce pride.

153
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,833
I am happy to say that...

154
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,083
at last... your struggles
will be rewarded.

155
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,291
To fulfill my late
father's aspirations,

156
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,958
I have made a decision.

157
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:13,041
I, Liliana il Grazioso Merlo
Turan hereby assume control.

158
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,000
Last Exile.

159
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,833
To fulfill my late
father's aspirations,

160
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,708
I have made a decision.

161
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:29,458
I, Liliana il Grazioso Merlo
Turan hereby assume control.

162
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,791
As your ruler,
I proclaim to you all:

163
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:36,083
the fighting between Turan and
the Federation is at an end.

164
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:40,416
Meet Luscinia Hafez...
The Ades Federation Premier.

165
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,625
Turan has brokered a truce
with the Federation

166
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,791
for lasting peace.

167
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,458
Once unified under Ades rule,

168
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,250
the world will enter an age of
tranquility and prosperity

169
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,208
such as it has never known.

170
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,750
A truce...? What?

171
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,083
I can't believe it!

172
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,500
Your sister just sold Turan out
to the Federation!

173
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,083
People of Turan...

174
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,916
Her Majesty, Liliana,
has spoken the truth...

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,875
I ask you to heed her
words and rest easy.

176
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,916
As of this day,
the Federation hereby

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,791
guarantees your protection.

178
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes...! Hurrah for peace!

179
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,916
Long live Her Majesty,
Liliana! Hurrah!

180
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,875
What's going to happen
to the fleet now?

181
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,666
From the look of it,
Princess Lily's going to

182
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,000
commandeer the whole thing.

183
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,916
Wait, you mean she's
taking it away from Millia,

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,666
just like that?
No! That's not right!

185
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,541
We built that fleet ourselves!
For Millia!

186
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,500
That was quite a
masterful performance.

187
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,166
You speak in such grand terms

188
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,375
like unification
and protection...

189
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,791
yet, all I hear is "domination."

190
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:05,083
I've received reports regarding
Anatoray's terrorist activities.

191
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,666
Are you the captain
of the Silvius?

192
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,708
A woman. I'm surprised.

193
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,375
Your ability to thwart our
fleet was impressive...

194
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,041
Though, clearly, your
actions were the result

195
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,583
of a grave misunderstanding...

196
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,625
Relinquish the Silvius and
swear us your allegiance...

197
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,875
Do so and I'll
overlook your crimes.

198
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,916
And should we refuse?

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,791
You have ten minutes...
Consider carefully.

200
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,708
Please, Lily...!
This is madness!

201
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,500
Have you forgotten what
these people did to Turan?!

202
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,833
I do this for the good
of the whole world.

203
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,625
What are you going to do
with the fleet we assembled?

204
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,833
Millia... Your temporary
rule is over...

205
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,291
Hold your tongue
and come with me now.

206
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,833
No, Lily, I'm not going
anywhere with you...

207
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,750
This is Turan's territory.

208
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,791
I hoped it would
not be this way...

209
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,458
I therefore strip
you of your title...

210
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,416
From this day on, you are
neither Turan royalty,

211
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,583
nor my sister.

212
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,625
How could you?!

213
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,666
The next time we meet will
be on the field of battle.

214
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,750
Luscinia is controlling
Lily somehow,

215
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,625
it's the only explanation!

216
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,375
If he wasn't around,
I'm sure she'd listen to reason.

217
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,416
That's it! I just need to find a
way to steal her back from him!

218
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,916
It will only take one
order from Liliana,

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,541
and Millia's fleet will
be turned against us.

220
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,791
Even with Millia
herself still aboard?

221
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,833
I assume they will
still follow my sister.

222
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,958
Shall we turn the
Silvius over to them?

223
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,125
I don't believe for a second

224
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,333
they would leave us
unharmed if we did.

225
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,416
What should I do? It's hopeless.

226
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,333
Losing heart isn't
going to help anything.

227
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,291
Our alliance was
with you alone...

228
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,708
Far as we're concerned,
you represent Turan, not her.

229
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,875
Yeah, she's right, Millia.

230
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,291
As long as you're
aboard the Silvius,

231
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,291
the Turan refugee government
will still exist.

232
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,875
Orders from the Impetus.

233
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,875
Prepare for an immediate
attack on the Silvius.

234
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:28,375
What?! We cannot assault a
ship with Lady Millia onboard.

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,833
Princess Liliana!

236
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,833
Listen well...

237
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,916
I retitle this vessel
the Turan flagship, Lasas...

238
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,250
Accordingly, it is now
under my direct command.

239
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,416
Yummy!

240
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,291
Cake...! Cake!

241
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,041
Do we get to eat stuff
like this all the time

242
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,333
just for being friends
with Anatoray?

243
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,333
Yeah, I think that's
the general idea.

244
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,750
Then they sound like the
best allies we could have!

245
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,750
Best allies ever! Lots of cake!

246
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,791
How're the leaflets
coming along?

247
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,166
We're printing 'em out
as quick as we can.

248
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,416
Think I'll try to get
a little shut-eye

249
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,416
'til they're ready, then.

250
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,541
Federation's Third
Fleet spotted!

251
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,625
Target has been destroyed!

252
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,916
Accuracy was passable,
I suppose.

253
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,958
I bet they're starting
to panic now...

254
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,541
The little fools
thought they could relax

255
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,625
as long as they stayed above our
battleships' altitude limits.

256
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,000
Pirate scum...

257
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,875
It's time to punish them
for their detestable ways.

258
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,041
Dirty traitors...!
Why are you shooting...?

259
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,666
I caught those Skyfish
for Millia. They're hers!

260
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,166
Give cover for the
Urbanus' withdrawal.

261
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,125
Roger that!

262
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,791
Commence firing, now!

263
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,083
I'm relieved to see
you're unharmed.

264
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,833
Full combat speed...!

265
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,291
Withdraw!

266
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,416
Commence fire!

267
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,958
But, Your Majesty, Lady Millia
is aboard that ship!

268
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,083
Fate can be unkind.

269
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,541
Now open fire!

270
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,250
This can't be happening.
It's wrong!

271
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,666
Fam! Where are you going?

272
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,208
To get Princess Lily back!

273
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,500
Wait!

274
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,583
Turan ship dead ahead.

275
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,458
Cutting off our retreat...
Change course now!

276
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,375
Not enough time!

277
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,666
Full speed, then...!
We'll ram them if we have to!

278
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,416
Urbanus has withdrawn
from battle.

279
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,458
Good. Now it's our turn
to get out of here...

280
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,958
Continue firing at will.
Full speed ahead!

281
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,791
Full speed ahead!

282
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,750
Number five turret!
What're you doing?

283
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,625
Don't stop firing!

284
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,708
Number five turret!
Respond...!

285
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,291
Number Five...!
Number Five, come in!

286
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,041
Has it taken enemy fire?

287
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,291
Negative!

288
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,208
Gimme visual confirmation.

289
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,000
Stop running!

290
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,666
Don't worry, Millia...

291
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,208
I'll have Princess Lily
back here in no time.

292
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,875
She isn't under anyone
else's control...

293
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,416
I could see it in her eyes...
I know she meant it.

294
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,958
She's not going to
listen to me about this.

295
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,541
She has to.

296
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,208
It's him again.

297
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,291
Dio?

298
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,000
Go... Protect Millia.

299
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,250
Get as far as you can! Hurry!

300
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,083
Okay... Let's go!

301
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,541
But he...

302
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,208
See you guys later!

303
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,083
What the...?!

304
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,541
We have intruders onboard!
Heavy crew casualties!

305
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,458
Seal bulkheads...!
Confirm intruders' location.

306
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,291
Don't let them into
the engine area!

307
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,958
Sounds like snakes
have slithered aboard.

308
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,625
I must protect Turan territory!

309
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,625
You are going to
sit tight and behave!

310
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,166
I won't let anyone
take our land!

311
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,291
No response from turrets
number three and four.

312
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,791
Bridge! Bridge!
Fam, Millia, and Giselle

313
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,875
requesting permission
for takeoff!

314
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,375
Permission granted...

315
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,125
The Silvius is currently
fending off an enemy intrusion.

316
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,500
Take Princess Millia
to a safe location...

317
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,083
And don't worry... We'll
come to collect you later.

318
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,208
Roger!

319
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,666
Don't go gettin' shot down.

320
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,916
Same goes for you!

321
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,250
Right!

322
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,250
The captain sent this.

323
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,458
Fair winds to you!

324
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,708
Thanks...! Good tailwinds!

325
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,666
Fire at will, men!

326
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,958
Captain, they've taken
over the engine area.

327
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,916
Then we've been defeated.

328
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,500
So, a scion of the white...

329
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,875
Then you're from
the Guild, as well...

330
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,541
I've heard of
identical bodyguards

331
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,333
who serve a Maestro...
but I've never seen them.

332
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,416
What's going on?

333
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,625
Did the Silvius go under?

334
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,166
We got incoming
at seven-o'clock!

335
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,583
Climbing!

336
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,041
Turan's future is
our responsibility...

337
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,833
We'll have to make
certain we work hard, too.

338
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,208
Then I'll study a whole bunch

339
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,541
and get super smart
so I can help you!

340
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,041
While I do appreciate
your ambitions for it--

341
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,583
Here, Daddy... For good luck.

342
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,791
I'm'onna fly... and
everyone's gonna smile...

343
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,750
just like they are today.

344
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,833
Look at this, little one...

345
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:46,541
This, my Sara, is the world
you shall protect one day.
