00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.138 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Manaka.
If I didn't know better,

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:16.182 position:50% align:center
I'd say you chased after us
on impulse after we left.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
I hope you told your
parents where you went.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
Yes! Don't worry.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.272 position:50% align:center
I got both of their permissions.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
I also asked Suzu
if she would give me

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
an advance on my wages.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
And I got a little help
with booking the flight.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.864 position:50% align:center
Monroe and Sakura walked me
through the whole thing.

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
Wow. For real?

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:35.577 position:50% align:center
I surprised myself, too.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
But I didn't want to
have any regrets about it.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
Like I regret doing nothing
when Dad got transferred.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
Why did you keep
all this a secret, though?

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.046 position:50% align:center
That part was Suzu's suggestion.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.341 position:50% align:center
She said Ms. Endou
would veto the whole idea.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:52.093 position:50% align:center
And if I told you, you might
have spilled the beans.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.305 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yeah, that sounds
like wise advice.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
You're just babies.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center
But if you would
have just asked me

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
for permission in advance,

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
I probably would have
agreed to let you tag along

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.022 position:50% align:center
--as an observer.
--[AO, MIRA] Huh?

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:05.774 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] You'd still have
to pay for room and board.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
But that option was in
the application notes.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:09.611 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
Well. You're here,
so you might as well

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
ask them nicely
when we get there.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.242 position:50% align:center
I'll back you up as best I can.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.369 position:50% align:center
Thank you--

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:20.747 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.458 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I have to get better
about reading the fine print.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
But I feel way more
at ease with Ao here.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.297 position:50% align:center
I wonder what all the other
participants will be like.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
[HORIGUCHI]
Once you finish checking in,

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.906 position:50% align:center
head over to the training
room and wait.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
Ao.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
Uh... My name is Ao Manaka.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
I wasn't able to make it past
the written screening portion.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:32.587 position:50% align:center
But would it be possible for me
to be here as an observer?

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
[HORIGUCHI]
What's this?

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.465 position:50% align:center
[AO] I compiled all the
information that wouldn't fit

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
into the application essay.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
Oh, jeez!

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] I apologize
on behalf of my student.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
Can we speak to
an administrator?

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
Sure. Right over there.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Mr. Hirose!

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time!

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
Mr. Hirose's been
head of the program

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
since I attended
back in the day.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.197 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA gasps]

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
[HIROSE]
Oh, so this is her?

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.414 position:50% align:center
The handful that you mentioned
when we were on the phone.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
I'm a handful?

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA]
What's that mean?

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
[AO]
I'm sorry for being so rash.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
No. I'm just surprised to have
such an audacious student here.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
[AO sighs]

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
Well... I couldn't very well

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
send you packing
now that you're here. So...

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
Huh? She can stay?

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Thank you very much!

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
Sorry for this.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
Nah. I mean, it is our job

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
to help these children pursue
their dreams, after all.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad!

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] That's Ao. They gave
her permission to observe!

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Good for her!

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
There's no way they'd
send her back after she made it

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
all the way to Ishigaki island.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE] I knew it.
You were worried about her

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
this whole time.
That's so sweet.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Shut up, Chikage!

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
Can't believe it's been a year.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy you came back here
to do this with me again!

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
Say what--?!

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
The purpose of our being here
is as alumni chaperones.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
We're not here to
play around, Monroe.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
I can't believe they fit

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
a real-life satellite in here.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Right?

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
I saw it for the first time last
year when we came here

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.569 position:50% align:center
for our summer camp!

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.280 position:50% align:center
I know you and I are
part of the geology group,

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
but I think it's really fun
to learn about astronomy, too!

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Remember how Mira and
Ao went around asking everyone

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
who worked here about asteroids?

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.959 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah. That poor tour guide.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
They bombarded
her with questions.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
They sure love asteroids, huh?

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI] But, still.
I think what she did

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
was pretty reckless.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
Are you talking about Ao?

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI] I mean, she failed the
written screening, you know?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's right for her
to go barging in like that.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I think you make
a good point, Nana.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
I don't think anyone should
praise her for doing

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
what she did.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
Then why didn't
any of you try to stop her,

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.946 position:50% align:center
or at least help her not do it?

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
For over a year, those
two have been working like crazy

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
to achieve a dream they share.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
They want to discover
an asteroid together.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
They've given it all they have
and refuse to accept

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
that it's out of reach.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] They even moved
in together to avoid

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
being separated, which everyone
thought was reckless

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
at the time.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:20.755 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
Isolation.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
But the stones say they should
continue to move forward

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
with their goals.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.720 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI gasps]

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
Ao's refusal
to give up inspires me.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
It makes me want to forge ahead
and pursue my own dreams,

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
no matter how lofty
they might be!

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
Why do I feel so helpless?

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
Welcome to Ishigaki island.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
I'm Mr. Hanashima.

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
Why don't we get
started by going around

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
and introducing ourselves?

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's start
with you, then.

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
Hi, my name's Satou.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
I'm president of
my school's science club.

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you all.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
[AO] There are lots of
different personalities here.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
I'm Tomori Asuka.
A second-year.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
I came from Hondo.
I'm obsessed with idols!

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:12.098 position:50% align:center
My name's Makita Shiho
and I'm here from Kyushu.

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
I'm a real people person.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Uh...?

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
My name's Mira Konohata!

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
Earth Science VP!
And I love Saturn and Cetus!

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mira seems normal by comparison.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
The Shining Star challenge,

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50% align:center
or Shiny Challenge for short,
would last three days.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
There would be lectures, tours
of the observatory,

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
observations,
presentations of our results,

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
and a whole lot more!

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.292 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Oh!

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50% align:center
Is that the limited-edition
Kanto can?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
I brought it in case I got
tired during the observation.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
My nerves have been
keeping me up at night.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.387 position:50% align:center
Would you like one, Tomorin?

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
Tomorin?

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
I actually dig that nickname.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the coffee!

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that's sweet!

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
You must have a sweet tooth!

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I mean, not as a rule, no.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.566 position:50% align:center
[AO] She's making
friends already. Wow.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.944 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA] Excuse me, do you
have a quick moment?

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
[AO] The self-proclaimed
"people person!"

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
I overheard your exchange
at the check-in desk.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
You're here even though
you failed the screening?

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
I couldn't give up on my dream,
so I followed my friend here.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
Wow. You come across
as shy, but you're bold.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
Can I pick your brain?
You fascinate me!

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
Me?

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50% align:center
All right friends,
time to head out for the tour!

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50% align:center
How 'bout a rain check
on that brain-pick sesh?

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
[AO] What the heck
is a brain-pick sesh?

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
[HIROSE] Well, kids, here she
is: the VERA Ishigaki station.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Wow, it's huge!

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
It's owned by
the Geospatial Authority?

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
[HIROSE]
You sure know your stuff.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
It's a very similar antenna
to the one that used to be

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
in Tsukuba.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
And there are four
other ones just like it

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
spread throughout Japan.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
Together,
they create a radio telescope

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
that's 23 hundred
kilometers in diameter.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
This thing is a telescope?

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
How do you look into it?

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA] You don't look
into it with your eyes.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
You look at
the radio signal data.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
What? Can you really
see the stars that way?

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
Makita, are you some
kind of space case?

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.510 position:50% align:center
I get called that a lot, but no.

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
[HIROSE] The VERA's primary
function is to observe

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.599 position:50% align:center
maser bodies that emit
strong electromagnetic signals

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
to help astronomers create
a 3-D map of the milky way.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
A map?

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
[HIROSE] We triangulate
the astral bodies in space

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
by using their stellar
parallax to determine

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
their precise position
and movements.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
So, that brings me
to our assignment.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
We'll be using VERA to try and
pinpoint a new maser object.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] We'll be helping
make a map of space?

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
[AO] I should definitely
tell Ino about this.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.919 position:50% align:center
Wow. It's huge!

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50% align:center
And it's kind of cute, too.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
The Murikabushi telescope has

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
a 105 centimeter aperture.

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
It's the largest reflecting
telescope in Kyushu and Okinawa.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
Murky bush?

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
Murikabushi.
That's just the local name

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.101 position:50% align:center
for the Pleiades.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
And over here, we make
observations with visible

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
and infrared light.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
If you were hunting
for asteroids,

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
this is the one you would use.

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI] When you say,
"reflecting telescope,"

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
do you mean it uses
mirrors instead of lenses?

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.657 position:50% align:center
Well, uh...

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
The light reflects off the
primary and secondary mirrors.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
The Murikabushi is what's called

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
a Cassegrain
reflector telescope.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.917 position:50% align:center
With a primary concave mirror
and secondary, convex one.

00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
And three focal lenses for
research and observation, too.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] You know a lot
about telescopes, huh?

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
Not in practice.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
I've never seen the stars
through one before.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Huh?

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
Now that we've
finished our tour,

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
we'll be splitting up into
the electromagnetic group

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center
and the optical group.

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
Each group
will get to try searching

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
for celestial
objects on their own.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
Tomorin and Makki,
I hope we'll have fun!

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt!

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
Makki?

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
We'll begin our
observations after dinner.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
So eat up and
get some brain fuel!

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Okay!

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
Hang on.
Did Ao and Miss Endou leave?

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
I think my teacher
left too, actually.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
Oh, they sent me a message.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
They said they're
grabbing dinner.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Since they don't
provide any meals for us.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
Here. It's my treat.
So eat up, okay?

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Miss Endou.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
[AO]
I'll have to eat pretty fast,

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
since observation starts soon.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
[HAYAKAWA]
Hey, Yuki, sorry I'm late.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
Hey. No worries at all!

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.483 position:50% align:center
[AO] Oh, that's the lady
I saw in the hall.

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
I'm Hayakawa,
Makita's chaperone.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
She was in my group
when I was a part of

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
the Shiny Challenge
back in the day.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
Man, who would have
thought that we'd both end up

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
becoming teachers, huh?

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
If you would have
told me that back then,

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
I would have called you a liar.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
You can say that again.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] It's kind of fun,
though, don't you think?

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
The two of us here eating
burgers and fries,

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
just like old times?

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
[HAYAKAWA]
Yeah. Well...

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
I figured you would
be drinking a root beer.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] How can I not?
That would be sacrilege!

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
[HAYAKAWA]
It's a requirement.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
That's delicious!

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
[AO]
We're gonna be a while.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
[HAYAKAWA] You know me.
I had some earlier.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU giggles]

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.652 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] The optical group
headed to the observatory

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
to make our celestial
observations, but...

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS grunt]

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50% align:center
That was rough,
and right after dinner, too.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Yeah, that road
was not ideal terrain.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
If you're not feeling well,
you can lie down.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
We have a nap room here
for the researchers.

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
Wow, a real researcher's bed?

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
--What is it like?
--[MIRA] I wanna try!

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA] You girls sure
are excited about a cot.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU chuckles]

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
Now, then.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.182 position:50% align:center
If you had to guess,
where would you say

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
the asteroids we
want are located?

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA, MIRA]
In the asteroid belt!

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
All right. In stereo?

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.772 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
So, knowing that, what region of
the sky should we be observing?

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA, MIRA]
Opposing region!

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
Wow, unison again!

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.781 position:50% align:center
That's the region where it would
be closest to Earth, isn't it?

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
Right. Mr. Horiguchi,

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
would you help us out?

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
Sure. As Konohata said, here's
the region in opposition.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
Asteroids reflect
the light from the sun.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
So, naturally, that would mean
they're at their brightest

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
when they're in opposition.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
So, then, it's kind of like
when the idol comes to

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
the front and center so they
can bathe in the spotlight?

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
What are you even talking about?

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
Most of the observatories

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.474 position:50% align:center
and space telescopes throughout
the world have already looked.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
Their full-sky surveys
are comprehensive.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
So, any undiscovered asteroids
out there are probably

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
dimmer than magnitude 20 to 21.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center
Surveys?

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.400 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA]
Astronomical ones.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
They observe huge swaths
of sky all at the same time!

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.239 position:50% align:center
Wow...

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
And here's how you write that.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
Now, let's discuss
how to conduct observations.

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
Wait. Am I the only
one not following?

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
I can't be...

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
I just want a partner of my own!

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
Come with me!

00:13:58.588 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh?

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
'Kay!

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
This time, we'll be marking

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
each 0.2 view of
angular diameter.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
As a single section of
the region in opposition.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
[AO] The moon fills an angular
diameter of 0.5, so...

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
It's about this big?

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
We'll be taking
five shots per section.

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
With a six-minute
exposure time each,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.697 position:50% align:center
so a half hour per section.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
We'll conduct our
observations this way

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
for as long as time permits.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.703 position:50% align:center
Whoa, I am so freaking
excited to be learning

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
astronomer things in real time!

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
Before, I had just books
and the Internet!

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
I feel the same way!

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
It's just like live
concerts versus videos!

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Is she serious?

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
Once we reduce the noise

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
from our photographic data,
we analyze it

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
with asteroid survey software,

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
create a continuous
display of the images

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
by overlapping the
unmoving stars, and...

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
The moving objects
are your asteroids.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
Wow, there are so many,
just in that single section!

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Lots more than I imagined.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA] The ones
with red marks on them are

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
the currently known asteroids.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
Blue marks represent the ones

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
that are potentially
undiscovered.

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
Aw... Seems like finding
one would be hard!

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
Yeah, not to mention...

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
That is, if I remember right,
they require at least

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
two observations
of a new asteroid.

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:18.710 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
So, you're saying if we don't
find one tonight our dream

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
of finding one dies here?

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
Hey! If you do happen
to find a potential

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
discovery tonight,
I'll take charge of

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
the follow-up observation!

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center
There's another factor
making observation difficult.

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Oh, a weather monitor?

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
I was concerned about that.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center
The cloud patterns are
definitely not looking good.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
Oh, no...

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
In that case,
let's get things going!

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
We'd better get in as
many chances as we can!

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
Sounds good.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.574 position:50% align:center
So, let's start getting the
photo program uploaded.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
[HAYAKAWA, ENDOU chuckle]

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for
taking such good care

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:56.748 position:50% align:center
of us again.
We all love coming here.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
I would never do anything less
for Yuki's precious students.

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:03.672 position:50% align:center
And having you sweet kids
here is our pleasure!

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
Does he love astronomy, too?

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
He must.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.385 position:50% align:center
He's been wearing that
hat this whole time.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
The hat's a souvenir
Miss Endou got

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
at the JAXA center last year.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
[notification pops]

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Huh? 

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
What? That something
from the girls?

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Yeah. They said the
weather's pretty bad down there,

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
their observation isn't going
as well as they had hoped.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:25.735 position:50% align:center
And just when they
finally got the chance

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
to realize their dream
together, too.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI sighs]

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI gasps]
Ino, use these!

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Huh? To make
teruteru bouzu dolls?

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
Yes! We should make
as many as we can!

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
Enough to reach the island!

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, INOSE, MORINO giggle]

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'll help
you girls with that!

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
My, my, we sure
did make a lot, huh?

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
Still not enough!
We have to make more!

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Our fourth observation.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
They're all known objects.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
Hey. It looks like the weather
might be getting worse, guys.

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
Ahh! Go faster!

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:18.997 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Now, now.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Miss Endou!

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.792 position:50% align:center
Panicking never does
anyone any good, you know.

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
[HAYAKAWA] Let's have some tea
and wait for it to clear up.

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You brought so many sweets!

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
Um. Can we really have those
snacks this late at night?

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
Oh, Makita. Guilty pleasures
always taste better.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
And, we brought noodles, too.

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Wow.

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
So you both participated in the
Shiny Challenge at one point?

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
And the weather was the same
then, believe it or not.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.149 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuki. Remember
the panic you were in?

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
Determined not to leave
without getting your results?

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
Come on.
It wasn't that bad, right?

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
[GRANDMA] Yuki used to have
such a serious attitude!

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
Like the entire world
was riding on her research.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
This is the face
she always used to make.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
Are... we talking
about the same person?

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
I found some photos
of you from back then.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Are you two ganging up on me?

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
That's so embarrassing!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
So young.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
Miss Endou,
your face is hardcore!

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
This is you,
right, Miss Hayakawa?

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Who's that third girl?

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's our
friend named Nishina.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
She works as an
astronomer overseas now.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
Righteous!

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] She was always
brilliant, even back then.

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
She knew so much.

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
And not just about astronomy.
History and literature, too.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
[HAYAKAWA] She was just
the kind of person who loved

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
learning about new things.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] She's actually the one
who got me into all this stuff.

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
I never discovered any asteroids

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
in the end. But I got something
even better out of it.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
Truth is...
It's the relationships

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
we build that matter most.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
And that's what really has the
power to change people's lives.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] For some reason,
you seem more mature

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center
--than usual right now.
--Ah--!

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA] She's a remarkable
teacher, isn't she?

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
Hey! Enough about us old people.

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
You kids just talk amongst
yourselves, okay?

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
Hanashima.
I'm borrowing the nap room!

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
She's just as cute as ever, huh?

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
Well. I guess I'll be
in the nap room, too.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
Hey. That reminds me, Manaka.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
Why did you come all the
way here just to observe?

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you came
by yourself as an observer?

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
You've got some real guts.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
When we were kids,
Mira and I made a big promise.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
We promised to
name an asteroid after her.

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
And to make that happen,
I'm going to have to gain

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
a lot more knowledge
and experience.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
Wow. That's such a lovely,
high-minded dream!

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.058 position:50% align:center
I'm sad it's not the reason
I had made up, though.

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
I hoped it was voices.

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
From space.

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
[AO]
I'm gonna leave that one alone.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
Why did you want to participate?

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
To expand my horizons.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.860 position:50% align:center
And to meet all kinds of
new, interesting people.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
It doesn't have much to
do with astronomy, but.

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.573 position:50% align:center
I want to be a counselor.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
[AO]
That explains a lot.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
I came here.
'Cause I wanted to meet Neon!

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
Neon?

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
Amane Neon,
an idol who loves astronomy!

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
They hold a Star Festival
right after the Shiny Challenge.

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
She's the guest
of honor this year!

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
I get to see her!

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
I might even get
to be close to her!

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] That's literally the
last reason I expected to hear.

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
I hate to disappoint you,

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
but it doesn't look like
the weather's clearing up.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
I think we'd better
call it a night.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.517 position:50% align:center
What? For real?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
Or, wait...

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
Why don't we practice looking
for asteroids using past photos?

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Yeah!

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA] Manaka,
what would you like to do?

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
You can head back to
the dorms with Miss Endou

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
and the others, if you'd like.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
No! I'd rather be here.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
Please let me stay
and observe until the end!

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm...

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?!

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.810 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] The weather cleared up
on Ishigaki Island!

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
Really?!

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
Uh... I mean,
that's good, right?

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] I wonder if our dolls
helped make that happen.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
Well, your feelings
made quite a difference.

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:19.696 position:50% align:center
Don't you think?

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
Yeah.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Here you go, ma'am.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
What's this?
Are you leaving us already?

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
[SATOU]
Hey.

00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
What are we doing for
afternoon observation?

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
Electromagnetic
observation must be nice,

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
since it's not based on time.

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll be studying
during the day, then, huh?

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need tons of
coffee to get through that.

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 11A]
Here. Stay hydrated, 'kay?

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:48.183 position:50% align:center
That's very kind of you.

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:52.395 position:50% align:center
It's going to be warm
and sunny out there.

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:54.147 position:50% align:center
Sunny?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
I'm not tired. I'm not tired!

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
You seem spacy.
Are you all right?

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
Oh. Mm-hmm!

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:06.701 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] It's okay.
We still have a chance!

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Tonight's the night!

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.332 position:50% align:center
[AO]
I know it!

00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:49.346 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Next time:
"Connected Cosmos."
