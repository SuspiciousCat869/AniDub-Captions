00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:14.139 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Today, we're having a
nice, little riverside barbecue

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
to welcome new members and
hunt for interesting rocks!

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
Then later, we'll have
a star-gazing party!

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
There's so much to do!

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50% align:center
--[bell dings]
--[GROUP] Hmm?

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Working hard, I see!

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
It's Suzu!

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi. Why're you here?

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
'Cause I ordered delivery
from Suzuya bakery.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasping]

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:35.702 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Suzuya's a pretty popular bakery

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
in town, isn't it?

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Suzu's
family owns the place!

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
And! They have a
cute mascot named Moe-moe.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
Played by our Suzu!

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
Ugh, you could have
left that part out!

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.341 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Oh, so Suzu is
short for your last name?

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] I refused to let
Mira call me Moe-moe,

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.553 position:50% align:center
so I made her come up with
a nickname I could stand.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:54.679 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles]

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mira.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50% align:center
Speaking of nicknames,
you called me Miss Inose

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center
the other day, right?

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
Yes! You have teacher
energy, and it's cute!

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.146 position:50% align:center
Vice President.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
Do you think we should all start
calling her Miss Inose, too?

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Seems a little late for that.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50% align:center
Affectionately, you know?

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS giggling]

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:14.741 position:50% align:center
--[SAKURAI] Okay.
--Yay!

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:16.576 position:50% align:center
Also, it feels a little
formal that you two

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
call each other "President"
and "Vice President."

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.580 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hmm?

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.916 position:50% align:center
Mira, you should
give them nicknames.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Mm, mm!

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.588 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Um... Okay,
tell me your full names, then.

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:29.881 position:50% align:center
Mikage Sakurai.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
Mari Morino.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:32.842 position:50% align:center
How 'bout...

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.552 position:50% align:center
Sakura for you.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.012 position:50% align:center
And Monroe for you!

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.639 position:50% align:center
Huh? Monroe?

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:40.308 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] You've got Marilyn
Monroe boobs and a mole!

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.559 position:50% align:center
True, you do.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
Ah! This bread's so good!

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.526 position:50% align:center
It is good. I've never
had Suzu's bread before.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they sell out
of it every single morning!

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.030 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] That's right,
our in-store stock

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.866 position:50% align:center
was already gone when I left.
Welp, better head back now.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.993 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're not gonna stay?

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:02.414 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Suzu.
Your bread is simply phenomenal!

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.208 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to stop by
your store sometime!

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.793 position:50% align:center
[SUZU gasps]

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.546 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Here, Sakura, you've got
to taste this delicious bread!

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.047 position:50% align:center
Oh, heck yeah!

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
Don't you have to go back?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.219 position:50% align:center
Miss Inose is a cinnamon roll.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.429 position:50% align:center
[MIRA chuckles nervously]

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
How cool!
So many different stones!

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey, Sakura, look!

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
What kind of rock is this one?

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
I believe that one's a chert.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
It's a mineral formed
by deposits from shells

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
shed by radiolaria.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
Wow! Okay, and what's that?

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hmm... That's probably andesite.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
It's formed by volcanoes.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
And this?

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] That's Mudstone. It's
a fine-grained sedimentary rock.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
And this?

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.351 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
And that's dried dog poop!

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ah! Oh, Sakura!
Thank you for saving my life!

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
Heh. Don't mention it.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Looks like you
found a banded stone.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
Is that what this is called?

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
Yeah, do you see
the band of white

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
that's encircling it?

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
That's part of a totally
different mineral.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
Colloquially, they're
known as banded stones.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
Some people
think they're magic

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
and use them as
charms or talismans.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
--Are you listening?
--Huh?

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys,
did you find something?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
Yeah, look at this rock I found!

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
She said it's a banded stone!

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
Aw, that's cute.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
I found one that
looks just like Jupiter.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
Wow, it does!
It's got the eye and everything!

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.056 position:50% align:center
--[BOTH laugh]
--[SAKURAI] Good grief.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] You wanted to teach
her more about minerals,

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50% align:center
but she got
distracted, didn't she?

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Meh, they're both
in the astronomy section,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.396 position:50% align:center
so it's all right.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
And besides. I couldn't
get far right now anyway.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
Not until they learn the basics.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:20.111 position:50% align:center
Your hands are
telling on your mouth.

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
So then, what should
we do with these stones?

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center
First, we'll take them
back to school

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
and clean them off.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
Then we'll organize them as
specimens, by mineral type.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
--[MIRA grunts]
--[BOTH] Uh?

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
[MIRA whimpers, yelps]

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
What is your problem?

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
The stones are heavy,
and I feel like a sad turtle.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
collect every stone

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
you find, you know.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
[MIRA whines]
But they're all neat!

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
Farewell, banded stone friend.
And its banded brother.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, my sweet chert...

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
[wails]

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
Rock collecting is way
more dramatic than I thought.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
Right? So many shapes and sizes.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
And more mineral types
than stars in the sky!

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] More minerals
than stars in the sky?

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Ao! Look!

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
The river's kind of
like the Milky Way!

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh? Uh, sure.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles]

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Well, the sun's going down.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
Better clean up our picnic.

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
Ta-da! Time to
initiate phase two!

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.465 position:50% align:center
--It's a telescope!
--Wow!

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggling]

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
So, um...

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
Do you two know how
to work one of these?

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
No. I'm embarrassed to say.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Do you, Ao?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.020 position:50% align:center
Only a little bit.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
How cool!

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then why don't you get it
focused on Mars for us?

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh. Let's see...

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:47.323 position:50% align:center
 Or why don't I set it up,
just this once?

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
It's a bit tricky...

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hmm...

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
Getting it focused
takes practice.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
Whatcha doin'?

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
[AO] We're trying to bring Mars
into focus with the telescope.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
First step is
to peer through it.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
And adjust the position until
the object you want to view

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
is dead center.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
There! You can easily
see Mars now!

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
Ao, check it out!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
[AO]
It's beautiful!

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
Can I go next?

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
Sure, get in there!

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hmm... I can't see anything.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
The telescope must
only work for people

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
with good behavior.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Say that again.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
Nothing--never mind.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
It'll move out
of view over time.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
Because of the Earth's
rotation and all.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Wow, that's so interesting!

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
So, Ao, wanna take a look?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
Huh? Sure!

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Found it.

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:56.768 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I see it now!

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
Good job, Ao, you did it!

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I didn't expect Mars
to actually look red!

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
Although, it stinks having to
adjust the telescope constantly.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50% align:center
They do have equipment
that you can program

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
to follow things as
they move across the sky.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
They do? Why don't
you buy it, then?

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Huh? Can we?

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
It's 200 to 400,000 yen?

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.091 position:50% align:center
Never mind,
forget I said anything!

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
[MORINO whines]

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.803 position:50% align:center
More stars are becoming
visible by the minute!

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] The one that has the
two brighter stars is Gemini.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
[AO] And over there, that one
with the orange star is Booötes.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
How can you see that?

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
Huh? Practice, of course!

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
It's just like the way you're
able to differentiate

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
between all the
different minerals.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
Huh. Yeah, that does make sense.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:52.365 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] That one over
there that looks like

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% align:center
an upside down
question mark is Leo.

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:56.661 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Miss Endou.

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
You're a Leo, aren't you?

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
The second star past
the big dipper is called Spica,

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.336 position:50% align:center
and it's a part of
the Virgo constellation.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Oh, that's mine!

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
I'm a Virgo!

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
my constellation!

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
Mira and Manaka
are both Geminis.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
And Monroe,
your sun sign is Aquarius!

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh?

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
And Suzu is a balanced Libra!

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
But I never told you that.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
And I'm a crabby little Cancer!

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:24.147 position:50% align:center
Cancer should be somewhere
around that general vicinity.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
But some of it's stars are dark.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, that's lame.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've ever
seen Cancer completely.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Aw.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
Cheer up, Sakura. Come on!

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
We should be able to see
Jupiter in the telescope!

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
Jupiter's not gonna
look that different

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
than Mars did, but okay.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
I see its' stripes and dots!

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] The dots around it
are called the Galilean Moons!

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
You can see them well,
even with a smaller telescope.

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Sakura, you done?

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
I want to see
the Galilean Moons, too!

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy
they're all enjoying this.

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
Just like we enjoyed the rocks!

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:02.102 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I feel really happy, too.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
[AO] But that's because
you're so happy.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
My family moved
far away after that night.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
But I always hoped
that I would see you again.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.654 position:50% align:center
Hoped we'd be reunited.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
Ever since we were kids,

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
I've wanted to share
lots of things with you.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
Same! Now we can!

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Oh, that's right.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
The Lyrid meteor shower
is at its peak.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Wait, for real?

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
Does that mean
we'll see shooting stars?

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
I sure hope so.

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.169 position:50% align:center
And Vesta's near Gemini.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
A vest?

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center
No. Vesta.

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
Vesta is an asteroid that was
discovered around 200 years ago.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
Gauss named it.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
[GAUSS]
Das ist right!

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] People have been
discovering asteroids

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
for 200 years?

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center
Right now, there are countless
asteroids with names.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
Over 500,000.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Are you serious?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
Ever since people started
using advanced telescopes

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
to observe the skies,
most of the larger

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.906 position:50% align:center
asteroids have already
been discovered.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
I hope we can find one.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
I worry.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] She sure does
know a lot about this stuff.

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
So, I'm sure her worrying
is more justified than mine.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ao! Don't worry, I will do

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.544 position:50% align:center
everything I can to help you!

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
I'll study super hard so I can
catch up to your knowledge!

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
Let's do our best together!

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
[AO] How could she think
that she needs to catch up?

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
She's always
the one in the lead.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
Pulling me along behind her.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
[AO]
'Kay.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
All right!

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.603 position:50% align:center
First things first.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna hone my vision so that
I can detect the darkest stars!

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
[AO giggles] In that case,
I can help test your eyesight.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.862 position:50% align:center
Look for Mizar and Alcor
in the Big Dipper.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] What are those
two up to over there?

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
They're so close!

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
--[shutter clicks]
--[gasping]

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
Hey, what was that for?

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.704 position:50% align:center
Sorry about the flash.

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
Bright, huh?

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.707 position:50% align:center
I wanted to have some
photos for the report,

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
so I've been taking
candid shots.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You call them "candid,"

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
but I call them "sneaky!"

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
These are hot. Lemme buy them!

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Huh?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Did you guys see that?

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
It's the Lyrid meteor shower!

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
Only a few of its meteors
even show up every year.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.936 position:50% align:center
So, you're lucky
just to see one!

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
That's so cool!

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
I wonder when the next one
will stream by!

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
What now? Did you see a meteor?

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
I missed it!

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
Well, where have you
been hiding, Miss Endou?

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
I was in the car
because I'm freezing.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
But tonight,
I'm going to tough it out!

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh...?

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
It's too bad.

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
We didn't see any
more meteors after that.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah-choo!

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:41.761 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] So, our first printing
will be half-fold, four pages.

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
Each of us will
have one column to write.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
Has everyone decided
on their topic yet?

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
I'm planning to write
a piece on all the rocks

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.020 position:50% align:center
we collected at the riverside.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
I can write about Jupiter?

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
I'll use the photos I took

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
to summarize our club's
recent activities!

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
Photos?

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:58.653 position:50% align:center
Uh... Wait, you mean?

00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
--I knew it!
--[MORINO chuckles]

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50% align:center
So what are you planning
to write about, Sakura?

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
I tossed around a few ideas,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
but we want readers
so--birthstones!

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
That's a good call!

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
If you introduce one per issue,

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
you've got 12
articles right there!

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.046 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hmph. Sweet summer child.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
Every day of the year has
a birthstone which means...

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to
write 366 articles!

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
You are a veritable genius!

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
You're willing to get
held back a year? Nice!

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] You've all settled
on your topics already? Aw...

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] You mean you're not
gonna write about asteroids?

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I considered
doing that, but...

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
What if some smart person
takes an interest in asteroids

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
because of my article
and discovers one before

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
Ao and I have a chance to?
Augh! No! I would just die!

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
I don't think you should
be worried about that.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
I'd say we're safe.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:48.328 position:50% align:center
I've got my topic.
Now how do I write the thing?

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center
Doing homework for once?

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.582 position:50% align:center
No. Writing an article
for my club newsletter.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
Or trying. Think you could
give me some feedback?

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Hmm...

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Well?

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That boring?

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
Sorry. It's just
a little dry is all.

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Jeez! It's an informative
article, so of course it's dry!

I'm saying it's too impersonal.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
The reader doesn't get any
sense of you or your voice.

I mean, we even tweak
the student council reports.

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
You've gotta cloak
the information in style

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center

[SUZU] I hate to say it,
but you're in the wrong.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
You asked for feedback,
then ran away like a baby

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
when she gave it.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.550 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] But I worked
so hard on that article,

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center
and I felt like she was
dismissing my efforts!

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Yeah. I'm not
saying I don't sympathize.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.057 position:50% align:center
When Misa was the
student council president,

00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
she was so harsh and stern.

She has a terrible
communication style.

But, still.

Thanks to you being a baby,
I've made some progress chatting

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
with Misa over text,
so I'm over the moon.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
Suzu. You said that out loud.

[SUZU]
Oh?

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
I thought this
article was going to be

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
much easier to write.

for every new writer

Wasn't it any good?

Says she's looking
for some illustrations

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
to include with the article.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Ooh, hey!
Why don't you draw them?

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
That's how you can
add style and flair!

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
You've always
liked drawing, right?

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
She says "I'm looking for
images with a 'Greek Myth' feel

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
to introduce Jupiter
and its moons."

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.985 position:50% align:center
That gives me an idea!

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Greek myths, huh?

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
Yup. There are
all kinds of connections

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.783 position:50% align:center
between the stars
and Greek mythology.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center

Makes me wanna read up on 'em.

your article in manga form?

a little less informative

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
It says this is what they
call a "chloride bath."

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
'Kay, what's that mean?

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.134 position:50% align:center
It means there's salt
dissolved in the bath water.

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the salt keeps
the sweat from evaporating

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
the way that it normally would.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
which helps your
body retain more heat.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
It's good for stiff muscles
or cold intolerance.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
Inose, you know
a lot about hot springs.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
[giggles] I've studied
about them over the years.

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
There are so many different
kinds of hot springs out there!

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
For example...

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
You've got sulfur springs, and
then there's acidic springs.

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center
Acid?

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that,
like, melt your skin off?

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Some of the stronger
ones can make your eyes

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
or any open wounds
sting a little.

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
The strongest one in Japan has
a pH of 1.2, I think.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center
But a pH of 1.2 is more
acidic than lemon juice.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
I had no idea there were
even hot springs like this one

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
in the city.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think of hot springs
being in the mountains

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
or by the ocean.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
Well, fun fact, hot springs
in metropolitan areas

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.055 position:50% align:center
are increasing around Japan.

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
To be a hot spring,
the water must be 25 degrees.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
You can even dig for them.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
And for every hundred meters
deeper you dig down,

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
water temps go up three degrees.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
If you dig a little deeper here,
this could be a hot spring, too!

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
Really? I wonder
what caused this water

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.946 position:50% align:center
to build up underground
and come up.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
Could be water
that seeped down there.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
That or, it could
be fossil water.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
Fossils?

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] It doesn't mean
there are fossils in the water.

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
It refers to ancient water that
got trapped deep within

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
the strata over time.

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
Whatever happened,
we can say one thing for sure.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.299 position:50% align:center
The water we're in
right now is very old.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
Expressing my gratitude
for the water.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:22.305 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That bath was amazing!

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
Baths are the best!

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
My, my.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.777 position:50% align:center
We're not used to seeing so many
youngsters here at one time!

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
Oh, good evening.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
We're Hoshizaki High's
Earth Science Club!

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.240 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Good evening.

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
[TAKE]
Hoshizaki?

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
Ah, so you must be some
of Yuki's students, then.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
Who's Yuki?

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Could you be talking
about Miss Endou?

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you ladies
know our teacher?

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
Yes, we do!

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
She's been a regular
customer here for years.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
Are there any nice men
working at your school

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
that Yuki should date?

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
Oh, Take, please behave!

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
Don't act like you
weren't going to ask them

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
the same question!

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:03.805 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're right.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center
Yuki's always been such
a lovely, diligent girl.

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
And so talented!

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
Diligent girl?

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
And talented?

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
When Yuki first began
her teaching career,

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
she was so stressed
all the time.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
She neglected her love life.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.318 position:50% align:center
She would say the hot springs

00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
were her only release,
and the club of course.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center
That means you!

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:21.656 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear me.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
She's going to be so mad at us.

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
We're oversharing
with her students!

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] They sure love
telling people's business.

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Being a teacher must be hard.

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] We'll have to be a lot
nicer to Miss Endou from now on!

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
Oh! Miss Endou!

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for
the hot springs gift cards!

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
We already went and used them!

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
Those baths are
pretty great, right?

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.017 position:50% align:center
Yep! We got you something!

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's so nice of you!

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
You keep up
the good work, Miss Endou!

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:55.690 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Uh. Huh...?

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Okay...

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.615 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Our activities in
the Earth Science Club

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:05.283 position:50% align:center
have just begun.

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:07.494 position:50% align:center
And our dream of discovering
an asteroid is still

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
a long, long way off.

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
But I'm still excited.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
I know a sparkling
world awaits us!

00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:49.304 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Next time:
"Memories are Treasures."
