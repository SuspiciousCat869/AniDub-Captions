[INOSE]
You guys, please wait!

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.306 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.476 position:50% align:center
Look, I understand how you feel,
but we're not allowed to use

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.812 position:50% align:center
guerilla recruitment tactics!

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
Huh? I didn't know that.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.025 position:50% align:center
We're sorry...

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
Guess we got
a bit ahead of ourselves.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
For now, why don't we
all just take this conversation

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.073 position:50% align:center
back to the classroom?

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
I'll start by getting
permission from the school.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
Once we have that,
we can recruit members

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center
however we want, within reason.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.956 position:50% align:center
--[BOTH] Great!
--In the meantime,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.667 position:50% align:center
I've got work to do.
This sign needs one more dog!

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:43.668 position:50% align:center
Does it?

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Hey, hey!

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey, there, Suzu!

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
Making a spectacle
of yourselves this early

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.177 position:50% align:center
in the school year, huh?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
Everyone in my class
was talking about it.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
I had to investigate.

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.891 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Suzu. Your hair!

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
What happened to it?

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, you haven't
seen me since I cut it,

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.355 position:50% align:center
have you, Ino?

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
Spring's the time
for rebirth, right?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.110 position:50% align:center
I'm Suzu Version Two,
nice to meet ya!

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.820 position:50% align:center
It does look great on you.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
It's just such a big change!

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.032 position:50% align:center
Here's the real story.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center
She had grown it out 'cause
she wanted to be like my sister.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.038 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
But... Misa and I had a talk.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.665 position:50% align:center
She said I should just be
myself instead of trying to

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
be like her,
and I think she's right!

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
Me, too!

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
And it seems like
the public agrees,

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.173 position:50% align:center
since business is
booming at the bakery!

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.635 position:50% align:center
Jeez. How could I ever
repay Misa for all she's done?

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:35.637 position:50% align:center
I gotta say no one knows
how to get attention

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.305 position:50% align:center
like you, Suzu.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.183 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] So, what was up
with your parade earlier?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.769 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] There are only three of
us in the Earth Sciences Club.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.271 position:50% align:center
I want to ensure that
our club continues.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.191 position:50% align:center
So people can be in it,
even after we graduate!

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.611 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're starting
to sound like a Vice President!

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:54.823 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and, also, if we
can recruit more club members,

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.533 position:50% align:center
we'll be able to
get more funding.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.992 position:50% align:center
Wow...

00:01:58.076 --> 00:01:59.703 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
No! Don't judge us!

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
We don't want new
club members just so we can

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.039 position:50% align:center
buy an equatorial mount!

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.249 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
Waaah...!

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.003 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Ahem. All right, friends.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.505 position:50% align:center
Let's work out a new
member recruitment plan!

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.967 position:50% align:center
--Okay!
--Yeah, let's do our best!

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.385 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
Excuse me.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.846 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hi, come on in.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
I'd like to join
the Earth Sciences Club.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
Yes, me, too. What she said.

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.146 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] We haven't even
started recruiting yet

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
and they wanna join up?

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
[AO] Seems like our parade
this morning might have worked.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
I'm Yuu Nanami, a first-year.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
What she said,
except I'm Chikage Sakurai.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
You're a Sakurai?

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you
our Sakura's younger sister?

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
Thank you all
for taking such good care

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
of my big sister last year.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I can totally
see the resemblance now!

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you, President Ino.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
Oh. Likewise!

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
Hey, your sister told me
that you participated in

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
the Earth Science Olympiad.
I participated last year, too.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
I remember, you were loud.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
[INOSE whinmes]

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
As for you two, Mira and Ao,

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
I hope we'll have fun
together this year.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
Huh? Does this mean
you know about us, too?

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE] Yes. You're both in
the astronomy group, right?

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you know
so much about our club.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
My sister talked about
you guys at home all the time.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
How could I not?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
She said you were awesome,
and she had fun.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
Okay, so, I assume you
want to be in the geology group,

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
right, Chikage?

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE] Yes. I fell
in love with rocks,

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
thanks to my sister.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
And I love power stones
and fortune-telling, too.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
That's super exciting!

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.729 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it'll be
a big hit in the newsletter

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
and the cultural festival!

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
My sister was right about you.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.068 position:50% align:center
You're totally adorable.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
[INOSE gasps]

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
So, uh, I think...

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
...there's something you should
know before we get started.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
Our club is composed of two
groups: astronomy and geology.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
Yes, I know.
I came to your café.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
At the festival?

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
Did you really?
And what did you think about it?

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
Well... I enjoyed it,
but frankly,

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
it left something to be desired.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Yoo-hoo!

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
Megu said she wanted to visit
the Earth Sciences Club,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
so I-- What's going on?

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling
we might have made a mistake.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
No. It's fine.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
This is Suzu, a second-year
and her sister, Megu.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
They're not club members.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
But they helped with
the café for the festival.

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
Your sweets are
the tastiest things

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
I've ever had in my life!

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. I like her already!

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
So, um... What were
you just saying before?

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
How was our café lacking?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
Your displays
for the cultural festival

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
were well-made.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
And your sweets were
delicious and lovely to look at.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
But...

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50% align:center
As the Earth Sciences Club,

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.252 position:50% align:center
I think you have a
responsibility and should be

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:18.920 position:50% align:center
more aware of the issues.

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Which issues do you mean?

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
Let me just put it this way.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
I don't want to
pursue astronomy.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:28.430 position:50% align:center
Or geology.
I want to go into meteorology.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
I believe we have a duty to
explore weather and climate,

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
and how they affect us all!

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] What she said
really made me think.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
She really seems like
such a conscientious person.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.532 position:50% align:center
That's a new field,
and a new goal for us as a club.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the new Earth
Sciences Club can live up to

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.745 position:50% align:center
her expectations
and help her figure out

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
what she wants to achieve.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA sigh]

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
[YUUKO]
Don't be shy, now.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
Plenty more where
that came from!

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.673 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna fatten you up!

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Thanks, it looks delicious.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
--Here!
--Oh, thank you.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles] I'm starting
to learn what you like, Ao!

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.015 position:50% align:center
[YUUKO]
Oh, I forgot.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
Some mail came for
both of you, from, uh...

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
The National
Astronomical Observatory?

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA gasp]

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I hope this will
help us discover our asteroid!

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
Writing the short essay's
gonna be the hard part.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
Only seven people
get to participate.

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
We've been working so hard,
studying and gathering data.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center
I think we'll be all right.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm-hmm!

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
A short essay on
my feelings about space

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
and the stars?

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.753 position:50% align:center
When I first met Ao,
it was her passion

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
that made me want to
learn more about the stars.

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
When I joined the Earth Sciences
Club, I learned about rocks

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
and how fun it is to share
knowledge with everyone.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:56.685 position:50% align:center
[AO]
A barbecue?

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Our club's
in its second year now,

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
and I want it to be
as fun as last year was.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
So, I thought--

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
What if we made
the club barbecue into

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
an annual tradition?

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
I love that idea.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
We should talk to Ino and Miss
Endou about it tomorrow, too!

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
I had already
put it on the calendar!

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Of course you did.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This weekend, we're
having a barbecue to welcome

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
our new members.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
Let us know if there's
anything you'd like to eat.

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50% align:center
Sounds like fun.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] We'll collect rocks
by the riverside

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
and observe the stars and moon
while eating delicious food!

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
Not a care in the world.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
O... kay.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
She's surprisingly
adorable, right?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm-hmm!

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] White marshmallows,
yellow marshmallows,

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
and pink marshmallows!

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
Wow, say that five times fast!

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
Mira. I think this is
marshmallow overkill.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
Look, I just want
Nanami to have a good time!

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
[AO] Of course those are
the ones that she grabbed.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Now all we've got left
to do is prepare the food!

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Yeah! It's been so long
since our last barbecue.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
I can't wait!

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
The weather
report said it was

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
gonna be cloudy, not rainy!

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
I'd say we should postpone it.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
Except for the fact that we
already bought all the food.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Location change!
I'll meet you at the station!

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
--I called Suzu about it, too!
--[AO] Miss Endou.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.979 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That's our barbecue magistrate!

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
See you later!

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Interesting.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
[AO] We won't have to worry
about the rain under here.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] It was already raining
like this when I woke up.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
I really didn't
want to reschedule.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
So I did a quick search
for places with shelter

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
from the rain.

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
Thank you for bringing
bread again this year, Suzu.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
No, problem--
I'm just happy to be here!

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.003 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'll leave
you girls to do your thing.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
Wake me up when the
meat's ready, 'kay?

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE, NANAMI]
Huh?

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
[AO] I can't believe it's
raining on our first event

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
of the new school year.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Rain's not a problem here!

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
I brought lots of tissues
for us to ward off the rain!

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh! I get it!

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Oh my gosh, Ino,
could you be any cuter?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it'll clear up
if we make a bunch!

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
And we're working together!

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
I think it'd be
better to start getting

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
the barbecue set up, honestly.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
They're just as
unbothered as my sister said.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
You all seem to have
this whole thing down.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
Well, we did it last
year, and the year before, too.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
Wait, this whole exchange
feels a bit like déjà vu to me.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.474 position:50% align:center
If we were by the river,

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
we would have collected rocks
and done some major stargazing.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
We can't do either here, sadly.

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
Welp, Chika and Nana. Sorry.

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:50.734 position:50% align:center
You're Chika?

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
You're Nana?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
Mira assigning
nicknames to everyone

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
totally feels like déjà vu, too!

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
[SUZU humming]

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
That smells good.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
What are you making over there?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
[SUZU giggles]
Oh, just wait and see!

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
These kebabs are so good.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
Yep, I agree! Sometimes,
food tastes better outside.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
But this rain though...

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
[AO] Looks like it's
pouring even harder now.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
I think... It's gonna
slack up in about an hour or so.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
Are you some
kind of witch who can

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
--predict the weather?
--Huh?

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
I have an awesome
technique for predicting it

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
with my shoe.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
No, um... I just
checked the weather app

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
on my phone.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
Doesn't your technique also
get your shoes dirty?

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That was so good!

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
[AO] So, you want to
focus on meteorology.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center
Like, weather reporting
and stuff?

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
And more.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
It deals with all things
related to the weather.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center
Wind, clouds, atmosphere.

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
As well as natural disasters.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
Uh, you don't sound
too happy about it.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI] How could I be,
after my relatives suffered

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
so much because of it?

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.936 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
It happened three years ago.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
A flood devastated
my aunt and uncle's home.

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, nobody was
injured or anything.

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
But I never want to see my
aunt cry like that ever again.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry that happened.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.159 position:50% align:center
It fuels me.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
My need to stop it from
happening to anyone else.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA sigh]

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
Hey, Nanami? Here.

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
You should have this.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
It's blue lace agate.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
Sometimes people
call it sky blue onyx.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
It's said to be calming.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.221 position:50% align:center
And can help you
release difficult emotions.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
Just be careful
of pushing yourself too hard.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'm
pushing myself too hard at all.

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
What's that? I'm confused.

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
Between your eyebrows.

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
There's a wrinkle.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
Okay. Thanks, I guess?

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE] It seems to
me like meteorology hits

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
really close to home for you.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
Well. It's more
useful than other sciences.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
Unlike astronomy and geology,
it helps people be prepared

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.415 position:50% align:center
and can even save lives.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
Astronomy helps people, too!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
You can't launch satellites
that monitor weather!

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
Or watch small
astronomical objects to see

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
if they'll hit Earth!

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
Geology can help people
with their daily lives, too!

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
Like, um, I can't think of
any examples right now,

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
but I know it's true!

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
It helps predict
earthquakes and allows us

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
to excavate minerals
that we use every day.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
Some stones have the power
to make people feel happier

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
and more at peace.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
That last one got
a little pseudo-sciencey.

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
Agreed.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI'S AUNT] Photos, videos,
letters--our family history,

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
ruined by the mud.

My poor Aunt.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
I hate the rain.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
I hate that filthy,
stinking mud.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.379 position:50% align:center
And I hate how useless I feel.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
I'm just doing what
I feel like I have to do.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Well... The rain
finally dried up, huh?

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Aren't you glad I
brought all those tissues?

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey. Is that a...?

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
Look, Nana!

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
A rainbow!

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
A circumhorizontal arc!

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
A what, now?

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
In atmospheric optics,

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50% align:center
they call it a circumhorizontal
arc, instead of a rainbow.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.072 position:50% align:center
It's the light
refracting off hexagonal

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
ice crystals that creates
the rainbow colors.

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50% align:center
It's a fairly rare phenomenon.

00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
This is actually my first time
seeing one in real life,

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
believe it or not.

for our newsletter!

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
Seems like you've
studied an awful lot, Nanami.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[MIRA] Okay!

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
Well, I have a big goal.

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
It's what you do.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Yeah, but I think
studying with the goal

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
of helping others is remarkable,
especially for someone your age.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind my saying so,

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
I do think you can honor
your own feelings more.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50% align:center
Especially the part
of you that finds the joy

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
and fun in studying.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE] Your wrinkle's gone,
too, just like the rain.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
Let's take the picture quickly

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
before the rainbow's gone.
Right, Nanami?

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.334 position:50% align:center
I like the name
Mira gave me today.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
Call me Nana.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.254 position:50% align:center
Well, let's do this
then, 'kay, Nana?

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.426 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Everyone!
The baumkuchen's ready!

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
The what, now?

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasping]

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
Awesome!

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
It's perfect!

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.435 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Thanks for the food!

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
I love how you can
see the strata, too!

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
And they're bent, so these
are called "folded strata!"

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI] "Baum" means tree,
so wouldn't these be

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
more like age rings?

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
We get it. You're smart.

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
Well. I'm glad
you're all enjoying it!

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
By the way, who's
the genius that charred

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
these marshmallows?

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:59.292 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I spent good money
on those marshmallows.

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
I think the burnt ones
are the best.

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.672 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ahh, I had so much fun!

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] I have to go help
prep for the morning.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
See you guys!

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.518 position:50% align:center
Bye! Thanks for coming today!

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
I only wish
this lovely weather had

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
shown up sooner, don't you?

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
Well, then. What do you all say
we stick it out a bit,

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
until the stars come out?

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Hmm?

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
When the weather is clear,

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
we seize the opportunity to
practice using the telescope!

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Go ahead.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
The moon is so beautiful.

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:40.125 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Isn't it? The one you see
right next to it is Jupiter.

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE] What's the
magnification power on this?

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.254 position:50% align:center
Oh. Lemme see.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
The barrel's focal length
is 910 millimeters,

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
the ocular lens is 15
millimeters, so, uh, I guess,

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.345 position:50% align:center
that means...

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
With this lens, there's
about 60 times magnification.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
Why don't you try
adjusting the angle?

00:16:58.435 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
There, I got it!

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
It's amazing that
you can get a picture like that

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
with a smartphone camera.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.483 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we call that
a collimated photo.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.193 position:50% align:center
While you may not
be familiar with it.

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
you do have a knack
for it, Nanami.

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
You can call me Nana.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.658 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] That reminds me,
how are those short essays

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
coming along, you two?

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI] Short essays?
The Shining Star Challenge?

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
[AO] Yeah, the essays
are like a test

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
to qualify for participation.

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
They're not quite finished yet,

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
but we've been working together
every night to polish them.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center
Wait, every night?

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you two ignore
your curfew like delinquents!

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hmm? Heh...

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
Ao's parents moved away, and,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
since Ao and Mira are trying to
discover an asteroid together,

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
their parents are
letting Ao stay in Mira's

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
sister's old room.
Is that right?

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm-hmm.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
Ao's parents moved away?

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
It's not easy to live
apart from your family

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center
as a teenager.

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
Um, what's the matter?

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
My sister...!

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
Fortune-telling.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
Specifically geomancy.

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
You read the stones.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:09.464 position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell their fortunes.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
--I see.
--Huh?

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
Isolation.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
But the stones say they should
continue to move forward

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
with their goals.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh? No way, for real?

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center
I did it!

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
I passed the written screening!

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:27.399 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:28.942 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
Wow, congratulations!

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
That's worth celibrating!

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
This is a really juicy scoop!

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna write an article
about it for the paper!

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
We'd love to go there with you
to cover the whole process.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
But, alas, it's not
in the club budget.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
So, instead...

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
...I compiled this
packet of products

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
unique to Ishigaki island!

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.795 position:50% align:center
You can use it as a reference
when you're picking out

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
souvenirs for all of us!

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Eve, you're
getting out of control now.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
Try to rein it in
a little bit, will ya?

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Sorry.

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
I didn't make it.

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
[USAMI, EVE, MIRA]
Huh?!

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
Oh, no...

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
I think I just saw
them both die on the inside.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
Only one of them passed?

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
It seems like Chika's
fortune was spot-on.

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
This is so stupid!

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
But keep your chin up--

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
opportunity can close
doors and open windows!

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
Stop it! Now is not
the time for empty clichés!

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
Here, look at this.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.622 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mira! Ao!

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
What are you two sulking for?

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Yoo-hoo! Long time no see!

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
Sakurai, Monroe,
is that really you?

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
[INOSE whimpers]

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
Hey! Ino, why are you crying?

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
I just find it so
reassuring to hear

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
our former leaders'
voices at a time like this!

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Chikage told me what happened.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
You don't have time
to waste moping.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
I mean, you cleared
a major hurdle.

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Mm! Besides. Even if
only one of you can go,

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
you can still share the
knowledge you gain there

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
with each other.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
We're still here.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
If you need anything,
just reach out.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
Right! Thank you both so much!

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
Later!

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
Oh, dang it.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
I totally forgot
to congratulate Mira.

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sakura.
You haven't changed at all!

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
"While you may feel isolated.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
The path ahead will open up
your life to new opportunities

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
and adventures.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
Abandon your old values
and forge ahead with faith

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
in your intuition."

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
That's your fortune,
according to the stones.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
I hope you find it
helpful in some way.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sighs]

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
Miss Endou just told me
that she would be my chaperone.

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a relief.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
I know. I would
probably get lost if

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
I had to travel... to Okinawa...
all by myself...

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Mira?

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
[MIRA whimpers]

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
I just wanted us to be
doing all this together!

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Ah! Listen!

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
You have to suck it up
and move on.

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
What everyone said is right:
this is a great opportunity,

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
so seize it!

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yeah. True...

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
And in the meantime,

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
I'll be thinking
of ways I can help.

[MIRA] Hold on.
Has Ao gotten stronger?

[AO sighs]

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:17.444 position:50% align:center

Be careful.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
Yes, and the cool souvenirs!

It's just for a few days--

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center

every day that I'm gone!

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
It's so hot!

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center

[AO]
I...

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center

[BOTH gasp]

00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:01.404 position:50% align:center

Wha--? What do you mean?

00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:04.115 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Why?

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:07.494 position:50% align:center
