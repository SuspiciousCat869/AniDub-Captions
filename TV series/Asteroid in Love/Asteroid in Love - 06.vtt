[MIRA] The cultural
festival's almost here!

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
The Earth Sciences
Club is hard at work.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.559 position:50% align:center
There's so much
to do to get ready!

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.978 position:50% align:center
Ino and Sakura,
our geology members,

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
are going to be attempting a
major experiment!

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.901 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
Oh. Guess it's started, then.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
What has?

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU giggles]

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
An extension
of the agar experiment.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.299 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:15.468 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
Inose, what's going on here?

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:16.553 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Eve.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.054 position:50% align:center
Hi, Usami.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:21.099 position:50% align:center
We're out finding leads
for the cultural festival issue.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
So... what's that?

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.519 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] This is the
Earth Sciences Club's

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.229 position:50% align:center
original boring machine!

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.647 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
Oh, fascinating!

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.982 position:50% align:center
There's a story!

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.692 position:50% align:center
[USAMI] But it looks
a little bit stone-age to be

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.068 position:50% align:center
called a machine.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI growls]

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
Ah, I guess you
could say it combines

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50% align:center
a rudimentary design with
innovation and frugality!

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
Is this for that survey
you were talking about before?

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's just
a simple one, though.

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:44.748 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
Simple?

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
Yes. Ow! Oops.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.502 position:50% align:center
In a real-life survey,

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
or what they call
a standard penetration test,

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
there are tons of regulations.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
The hammer's weight, N-value
measurements, and so on.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
But we didn't want to
get bogged down with all that.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
So we narrowed our focus
and decided to just bore out

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.599 position:50% align:center
a core sample.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
That's wise. Good call!

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50% align:center
Don't act like you
understood a word

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
of what they're talking about.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
You seem to be missing
the rest of your club.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
It looks like you
could use their help.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Mm... Frankly,
they'd just be in the way.

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
The two of us can
more than handle it.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
What she means is that
she doesn't want to bother them.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.369 position:50% align:center
They have their own
preparations to make.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
Mm-hmm...

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
Isn't she cute when she's gruff?

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
--[USAMI] Huh?
--[SAKURAI] Okay, then, folks!

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
Back to work we go.
Thank you for stopping by.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
[banging]

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
We're finally a quarter
of the way there.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
Hey, um...
You wanna switch places?

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
No. I'm okay.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.644 position:50% align:center
Hey there, ladies!

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
The newspaper club
enlisted some assistance.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
What do you want us to do?

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
How can we help?

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
Huh? W-We're okay.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center
Uh, th-thank you?

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.114 position:50% align:center
This would go much faster
if we let them help.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess so. Uh...

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
Well, since you're all here...

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
You ready to show us your stuff?

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Ready... Set...

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
[BASEBALL PLAYERS]
Heave-ho, heave-ho!

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Much better.

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
[BASEBALL PLAYERS] Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
So then, this is
the kind of thing

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
your club gets into, Sakura?

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
I can't say I get
the whole idea.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
But it sure does seem fun!

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.141 position:50% align:center
You're so cool
and mysterious in class,

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
this is a nice change of pace!

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
Would you mind
elaborating on

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
--the cool, mysterious thing?
--[SAKURAI] Ino, focus!

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
[BASEBALL PLAYERS] Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
Just a little bit farther now!

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:46.494 position:50% align:center
[BASEBALL PLAYERS]
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
She doesn't get the whole idea,

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
but it looks like
she's having fun.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
Before today, I just
assumed my classmates

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
would think geology was boring.
No pun intended.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.845 position:50% align:center
They wouldn't get my interests.
I mean...

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
It's practically
impossible, to be honest.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
At least for our tiny club.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
We can't do that.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
It's not realistic.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
But, still...

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center
It would be such a shame
to write it off as impossible.

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
And so... I had to try!

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
Looks like we reached our goal!

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
[BASEBALL PLAYERS cheer]

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
We did it!

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Okay, so how do we get it
out of the ground now?

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
Oh. I... didn't
think about that--

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
Sakurai, would these help?

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.128 position:50% align:center
They're the fittings that
go with the Baseball Club's

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
batting practice nets.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
--Oh, really?
--[OOMORI] I've got an idea.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.051 position:50% align:center

One, two!

Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Heave-ho!

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.305 position:50% align:center

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Thanks, you guys are awesome!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
[OOMORI]
You're welcome! Good luck!

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
Well, see ya!

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50% align:center
--Gotta get back to practice!
--[TAKAHASHI] Later!

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
Without their help,

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
we would still be
working on phase one!

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
Ha-ha! You should
never underestimate

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
a journalist's
connections, y'know?

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
So you were right.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
It was just like
you said before.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.658 position:50% align:center
We needed a few more people.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.451 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Hey! Working hard?

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! I'm so glad
we got permission for this.

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, INOSE]
Thank you for everything!

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] It's nothin',
and none of that formal stuff.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
So, did you get your core?

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Yes, it's all there,
inside the pipe!

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] We still need to
push it out with that pole.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] What's important
is consistent pressure.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
One, two--

--[GIRLS gasping]
--Miss... Endou!

to be a solid cylinder...

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.568 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Oh, gosh,
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center

You're really terrible at this!

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
That's kinda rude, Sakura.

to be very impressive!

Thanks a lot, you guys!

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ao. Are you having trouble?

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
Do you need me to help?

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
I'm okay. I love Jupiter.
So, I wanna finish it myself.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Uh, well, can I offer
a bit of advice, then?

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
Don't forget to breathe.

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
Jupiter's lovely, huh?

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
The patterns,
the moons--all of it!

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I was so
impressed when I saw it

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
through my telescope as a kid.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
It was different than
seeing it in pictures.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
I got a sense that it
was actually up there.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:38.625 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
I can relate.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.002 position:50% align:center
It's so much fun to
track the moons, too.

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
To see that they've
changed positions when

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
you observe them over time.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah!

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.008 position:50% align:center
I finished Saturn!

Hey, I finished one, too!

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
Here's the moon!

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
Took me way longer
than I thought!

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA gasp]

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.060 position:50% align:center
You got the craters,
mountains, and seas right!

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
Monroe, this is
incredibly detailed!

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
[AO] But at this pace, we won't
meet our quota for the day.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Let's speed things up!

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Huh?

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Uranus and
Neptune don't have much

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
of a pattern to them.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Oh.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
Hey, Monroe, what would
you say is your favorite planet

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
in the solar system?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Hmm...

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
I think my favorite is the Moon.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
[AO]
That's not really a planet.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] It's so bright
and beautiful, isn't it?

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
Yes, and also...

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
"It's the farthest point human
feet have stood upon.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.885 position:50% align:center
But it's the closest celestial
body to planet Earth."

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
Cool, huh? That's what
my grandma used to say.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
That's why I love astronomy.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
My grandmother was
really into it.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
Wow, you mean that
your grandmother had a love

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
for astronomy, too?

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:44.190 position:50% align:center
Yeah. When I was little,
she would tell me all about it.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
Passion for space
exploration was so widespread.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
Back then, everyone was
glued to their televisions,

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
watching men walk on the moon.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
I'd love to try hopping up
there like they did.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
I'm sure everyone will
be able to go to space one day!

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
By the time that happens,

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
I'll be too old and frail
to do it, though.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
But, still. I have bought
some land, just in case.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
Where is it?

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
On the moon, of course.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
I hope to be buried
up there someday.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
[AO] Is hearing that what made
you decide you wanted

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
to become an astronaut?

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Well, one of the reasons.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
But there are others.

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50% align:center
Look, this is my grandma.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
Your dream's been handed
down through the generations

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
like an heirloom!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Yeah. I guess so.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
Me and my grandma, we're
planning to have a video chat

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
once I get up into space.
[giggles]

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Wow. Your grandma sounds
way ahead of her time.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Oh. It's already dark outside.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Man! This is the perfect
spot for gazing at stars!

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] It's almost time for
the Harvest Moon, huh?

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you so much!

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
Wow, incredible!

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
--It's beautiful!
--[AO] Um, guys?

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
Don't you think we'd
better get back to work?

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
It's done!

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
Here's Venus!
That was the last planet!

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
You're really fast
at this, Mira.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50% align:center
All the planet models
are finished now.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
What else?

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
The display board's
all that left.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
And since it's a café, we should
make sure it looks really cute.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center
If we set out some
science magazines on the tables,

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
people will stay occupied
while they wait.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
And what am I forgetting?

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
Gosh, you have
so many fun ideas!

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Everything
is falling into space!

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
[AO] She may not be
an astronaut yet,

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
but she's a space cadet.
That's for sure.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
All right then, ladies.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
I'd say, that's enough
work for one day.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
We can talk to the geology girls
about the next steps.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Roger that!

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, huh?

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
Earlier I thought we
were behind on our work.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
But we finished
exactly as planned.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Monroe was
secretly keeping us on task

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
the whole time.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Hmm?

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
Oh. It's nothing.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Nah, there's no way.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
So pretty.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Should we turn off
the lights so we can get

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.778 position:50% align:center
a better view?

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] It's strange how
looking at the starry sky

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
never gets old to me.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I get so carried away
that I forget to sleep.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.665 position:50% align:center
There's a really
nice smell here, too,

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sighs]

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
[stomachs growling]

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] You may forget to sleep,
but you won't forget to eat.

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
Not on my watch.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Suzu, what are you doing here?

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
You guys were so
captivated by the stars,

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
you didn't even see me!

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
I brought some test
samples from the café.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:25.852 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
It's a shame the
geology girls aren't here, too.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:32.067 position:50% align:center
But, please. Rate the shape,
color, texture, and smell

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
on a scale from one to ten
and write any comments--

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA, MORINO]
Yummy! Down the hatch!

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Huh?

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
[MORINO, AO, MIRA]
Thank you so much!

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
I'll have another tasting
before the festival,

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
so it's cool, but sheesh.

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry. I was just so hungry.

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
So, is everything ready?

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.669 position:50% align:center
Yep. That's why
we were gazing at the moon.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Yeah, it's such a clear night,

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:54.339 position:50% align:center
so it looks gorgeous up there!

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
It's the first quarter Moon--
lunar age 7.9. Is that right?

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
It's what the magazine
Ao gave me said, so--

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
--[AO] I'm so happy!
--Hey, I'm blushing!

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:06.559 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Well. I think she's moved
that you actually read it.

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
Ah. Your hair smells good.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
Okay. Moon-viewing and
nice smells give me an idea!

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
Mira! Do you mind if
I add something to the menu?

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
That's perfectly fine with me!

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
But, um... could you
maybe put Ao down?

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Heh?

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Also, Monroe, please.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
Stop taking photos
of everything.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
Hah.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] That's the first time
I've missed Sakura's

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.627 position:50% align:center
salty attitude
keeping us in line.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] These themes don't
mix well together at all.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
[MORINO gasps] It's transformed
into a sweet café!

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
--How lovely! Pretty!
--[SUZU] For real?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure how well
it works as a café,

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
but I guess this mash-up feel
is what the club is known for.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, I guess
it isn't life-or-death.

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 6A] The Hoshizaki
High School Cultural Festival

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
officially begins now.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
All right, everyone!

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
Let's do our best!

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
And, Suzu.
We appreciate your help today!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I can't believe you're
skipping the festival for this!

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
I'd do anything for my friends!

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
You seem even more
into this than the rest of us.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
Well, okay.

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
Full disclosure:
I have ulterior motives.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
A food stall taste test?

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] If we win this, it'll be
the perfect advertisement

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
for our bakery, too!

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
Suzu, you're really
showing your true colors.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
Welcome to our café!

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
Oh, Miss Endou, it's just you.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
Sorry to disappoint you;
I'm not your first customer.

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:53.750 position:50% align:center
I'm just doing a
final check on your displays,

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna have to be fast.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm!

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
Wha--?!

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.219 position:50% align:center
No problem with
the length of your skirts?

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm impressed.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
Well, I might
need to check again,

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
so I'll see you all later!

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
She just ate one of
everything on the menu and left.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
Oh, she'll be back
around her normal snack time.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Here's our menu.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
Order whatever you like.

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center
Huh... What would you get?

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
Well. I'm a big fan
of our planet cookies.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
You can choose from
eight different flavors.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
I also really like
the milky way gelatin

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
'cause it's so photogenic.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.662 position:50% align:center
Um, pardon me!

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
You should try some of the
geology group's sweets, too!

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.001 position:50% align:center
The tiramisu lets you try
boring for yourself!

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
You eat this tiramisu
by sucking it through a straw!

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
What a clever idea!

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
I think I'll try some of that.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
Me, too!

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
So, let's make that two orders
of the tiramisu, please!

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
Two boring tiramisus coming up!

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
Thank you both so much!

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I think
I'm gonna need a spoon.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?!

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
[MORINO chuckles]

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
Hey, you guys!

00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:01.109 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Oh. Welcome to our café,
journalist friends!

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
We'll be doing
a complete review.

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
Wow, this all looks delicious!

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
Pegmatite Scone?

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.452 position:50% align:center
Pegmatite's a kind of rock.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
It can form when magma
cools and hardens.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
Sometimes when it cools,
large crystals appear

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
scattered throughout the rock.
That's what we call pegmatite.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
And it's more commonly
known as the "Image of a Demon."

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
That kind of reminds me
of Vice President Sakura.

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
Then maybe
we should just call it

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.218 position:50% align:center
the "Demon Vice
President's Scone."

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI snarls]

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
Good one--you've just
earned yourself a floor cushion!

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
[INOSE gasps]

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] There are roughly
8,600 stars that can be seen

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
from Earth with the naked eye.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
But in the Milky Way, there are
more than 200 billion!

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
What? More than
200 billion? Wow!

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.030 position:50% align:center
Wow, I'm so impressed
with how detailed

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
your explanations are.

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
I knew that I wouldn't remember
all the terms and numbers,

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
so I made myself cheat sheets!

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:56.998 position:50% align:center
I made some
cheat sheets, too,

00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
since I knew I'd be nervous.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 6A]
Excuse me. I have a question.

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
I'll be right there!

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
Uh, thanks for coming.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
I'm Ao Manaka from the Earth
Science Club's astronomy group.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
Since the dawn of time....

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
A script?

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
This is our handmade model.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
It isn't quite to scale, because
the classroom isn't big enough

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
to contain a model that size.
So, keep that in mind.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
Are those lines shooting stars?

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
[AO]
One is the habitable zone,

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
and the other is
the asteroid belt.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
Oh, cool. Is that big,
fluffy thing a cloud?

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
Nope, that is
the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt.

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG GIRL 6A whimpers]

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles]

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG GIRL 6A laughs]

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Here we go!

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
You're zooming through space
at the speed of light!

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
Go, go, go!

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Hey, Sakura,
are you looking for someone?

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
Well, kind of.

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
Just the classmates
who helped us out

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
with the boring experiment.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
They said they would
stop by our café.

00:16:58.393 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
Did they really?

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
When they get here,
I'll handle the shop.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
That way you can give
them the explanations.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
[HARUNO]
Yoo-hoo! Hey, there! We made it!

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
Welcome in! Sakura-- Huh?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
Hey. Thanks for coming.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.075 position:50% align:center
Why'd she change?

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
--Hey!
--Wow.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
I always thought the Earth
Sciences Club would be stiffer.

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Right. Oh, hey,
check out the core sample

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
we extracted the other day.

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
[OOMORI, TAKAHASHI]
Whoa...

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
[HARUNO]
So, this is how it turned out?

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
Right beneath the embankment,
there's a layer of mud and clay.

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
We hypothesized that this
area was once a rice paddy.

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
Is that why drainage is so bad
on the school grounds?

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
Possibly, yeah.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
What? But I had heard
that the school was built

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
on top of an old graveyard!

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I've heard
that rumor, too!

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
Ino, please!

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
There were also rumors
that the drainage problem

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
was caused by a ghost.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
A heartbroken woman
who can't stop crying.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
I've heard about
the sad ghost lady, too!

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
Ino? Please advocate
for science here!

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
Gah! Hi, welcome!

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
Misa, aren't you
the head judge today?

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:02.582 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
I heard the Earth Science
Club's pancakes are the best.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
So I came to try 'em.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
[SUZU snarls]

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Suzu? Are you okay?

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] I can't believe I get
to feed Misa my pancakes.

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
It's my big chance!

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
Hey, take it easy over there!

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:22.894 position:50% align:center
[giggling]

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
Here they are:
the Waxing Moon Pancakes.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
We've reproduced today's moon
phase with our fresh,

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
house-made whipped cream!

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
They look delicious.

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Fun fact:
the flavor is honey milk,

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
and it was inspired by
the scent of Ao's hair.

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
[AO] Uh, Suzu. You don't
have to share that with her.

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
The light, fluffy texture

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
and the sweet
scent of Ao's hair.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
So good.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
And also,
the flavor's incredible.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
I admit. It's just
as good as everyone said.

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
So, um, was that
her official review?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
Misa doesn't know
what to do with things

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.348 position:50% align:center
that can't be expressed
quantitatively.

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
[HARUNO] The Earth
Sciences Club's exhibit

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
was pretty amazing!

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI] I'm just happy
we were able to help out.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
--[CHIKAGE] Big sister...
--[SAKURAI] Huh?

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
Well. All we really
did was heave and ho, man.

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI] C'mon, give
yourself some credit.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
[HARUNO] Oh. Did you guys try
the manga club's pancakes?

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
--[CHIKAGE] Big sister.
--[SAKURAI gasps]

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI] I tried,
but there was a huge line,

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
--so I gave up and left.
--[SAKURAI] Hmm...

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hey, Chikage?

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
Am I seeing things?

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
My big sister
is awesome at school, too.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
[EVE] Whoa. So, this
is our solar system?

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
It's all completely handmade?

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
That's so cool!

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
Thanks! And we had
so much fun working on it, too!

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
This isn't nearly enough
of an exhibit.

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:47.812 position:50% align:center
Huh? Thanks for visiting anyway!

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
[YUUKO]
Mira!

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
Huh? What the-- Mom? Dad?

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
Why are you here?

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
Misa told us
about the pancakes,

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
so we had to come try 'em.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
I can't wait.
Bring us two orders!

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
Suzu!

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
Megu! Thank you for coming!

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
Sure. Wow, this is awesome.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
Can I help somehow?

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
No way, just eat and relax.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.005 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi. You must be Ao's mother.

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
Thank you for always
taking good care of Mira.

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.385 position:50% align:center
Sure, and likewise!

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
Mira. That outfit
looks cute on you!

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
I know!
Ao looks so adorable, too!

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
my parents are seeing this.

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
Sakura, you don't happen to have
an extra tracksuit, do you?

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
Nope!

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] Ao. Your display
turned out perfectly!

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
Uh. Thanks, Mom.

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] So, this is what
you've been working on, huh?

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
You hardly ever talk to me
about your schoolwork.

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
[AO groans]

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
It's normal, I guess.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
All the more reason
I'm glad I came.

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
Can I snap
a quick photo of you in

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:51.459 position:50% align:center
this precious outfit to
share with your father?

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
Mom, no!

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I've never heard Ao
be that loud before!

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 6A] Thank you all
so much for coming out today.

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
This concludes the Hoshizaki
High School Cultural Festival.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
We hope you'll join us
again next year!

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
It's over...

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
[AO] Talking to all those people
has totally worn me out.

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] This has been
the best cultural festival

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
we've ever had, and it's
all thanks to you guys!

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Sakura?

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
Of course.
Excellent work, everybody!

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
She's being genuinely nice!

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
Is this a sign of the end times?

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
You two should accept
my goodwill without question--

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful to you!

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.207 position:50% align:center
President. You had
something you wanted to discuss?

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Yes.
Everyone, listen up, please.

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:35.712 position:50% align:center
What's this about?

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
We have some news.

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50% align:center
As of, right now, we're...

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] ...stepping down
as pres and vice pres.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO, INOSE]
Huh?

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
Hold on... You mean...

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:49.434 position:50% align:center
You're quitting the club?

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
We're just stepping down
from leadership.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
We'll still be in the
club until graduation.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
With that said, I'd like
to formally ask you to be

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
the next Earth Sciences
Club president, Ino.

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:02.614 position:50% align:center
[INOSE whimpers]

00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
Whaddaya say? You in?

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:11.998 position:50% align:center
Huh? What...?!

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:49.179 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Next time: "The Starry
Sky is a Time Machine."
