[MIRA] Today, I'm having
study-time with Ao at my place!

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.307 position:50% align:center
It's the best.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center
Hey, check this out.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.060 position:50% align:center
Looks like the Johnson
Comet will move up

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
to magnitude five this month.

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:22.313 position:50% align:center
Up to five?

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
You mean we'll be able to
see it through a telescope?

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
[AO] Mm-hmm. We should
definitely be able to see it

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center
at that magnitude.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
As well as the Pan-STARRS comet,

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
along with the Tuttle-
Giacobini-Kresák comet, too.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but
that name is too much!

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center
[AO giggles]

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
I know that illustration.

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
This? It's great, isn't it?

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.130 position:50% align:center
I'm a pretty huge fan
of whoever drew this thing!

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
Funny. That's actually
my mom's drawing.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:53.136 position:50% align:center
So, your mom is, like,
a real-life artist, then?

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
[AO] Mm-hmm. She's what's
typically referred to

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.307 position:50% align:center
as a science illustrator.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. How cool!

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.895 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Hey, make-up test-takers!

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, hi, Suzu.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center
Good thing I came
to check on you.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.693 position:50% align:center
Now, why don't you stop
slacking off and get to work?

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
[BOTH groan]

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.947 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Sometimes,
reality is super harsh.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Wait, Mira needs
physics and English,

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.840 position:50% align:center
and Ao's retaking math?

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:54.966 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.968 position:50% align:center
Huh? What're you talking about?

00:02:57.052 --> 00:03:00.013 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Ao, I just would've
assumed you'd be great at math!

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.014 position:50% align:center
[AO grunts]

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.477 position:50% align:center
[AO]
This is embarrassing.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
I saw a star the night before
the test that was so pretty.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
I ended up writing its name
instead of my own.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.610 position:50% align:center
So, I got a zero.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
I won't be telling her that.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
Suzu, help me, I'm dying here!

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
Would you look? I don't
understand this problem at all!

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
Okay, okay.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.079 position:50% align:center
Now. Let's see, here.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
For this problem, try using
that formula to substitute

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
for this value here.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
Oh! I get it now!

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
Just be mindful
of your units, okay?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Right, got it! Thanks, Suzu!

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
Oh. it's nothing.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
You must be pretty comfortable
in Mira's house, huh?

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, we've known
each other for a long time.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
For example, I happen
to know Mira keeps

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
her sweet, pure, self-made
romance manga right here!

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
[MIRA screams]

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
Why? How could you?

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
Why not?
What's the problem?

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
It's pretty good!

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
That's not even close
to the point right now!

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh...?

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sighs]

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, you look
confused over there.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
I just can't believe
how many formulas there are!

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able
to remember them all.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, the best help
for that is to sing a song.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
A song?

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Just make up a song
about it, and then it's easy!

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
♪ X equals V-naught times T plus
1 half A T squared factorial! ♪

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
Sing it with me!

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center

you one more thing to remember?

Hey, Sister!

I was trying to figure out where
that weird song was coming from,

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
but I see Suzu's stopped by.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
Misa, hi!

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
I brought some of those
cream puffs and put them

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
in the fridge!
Should I go get you one?

It's so funny sometimes!

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.767 position:50% align:center
That was incredible.

She seemed like a different
person there for a minute.

Wanna know why?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
It's because she's
always liked my big sister.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center

that you're enjoying

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.387 position:50% align:center
your new club so much.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Ao. Try to keep
this one out of trouble, okay?

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
Ah! Sure!

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
Misa's so cool.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
But I have to admit.
She made me really nervous!

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe it's time
for her to study for exams

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
--and go away!
--[drill whirring]

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
[grinding, crunching]

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
What the heck is she studying?

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.496 position:50% align:center
[drill whirring]

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
There we go.
I think that'll do it.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
She still wants
an asteroid, so...

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center
Mira sure doesn't
shy away from big goals.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
Please take care of them both.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
I don't hear the noise anymore.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
Why is Misa
so perfect and mysterious?

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
I just can't get enough of her!

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Well, thankfully,
after all that,

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
Ao and I managed to
pass our make-up exams!

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
The Penniless Squad!

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.403 position:50% align:center
Or maybe the Broke Rangers!

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.654 position:50% align:center
[AO giggles]

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
Hey! Say something already!

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh? Oh.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
Yeah, guess you can't be
a solo sentai team.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:56.870 position:50% align:center
All right, here you go,

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
my new little
part-time pretties!

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get changed
into your battle gear!

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Today, I'm here with Ao,

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
working a shift at
the Suzuya Bakery!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ao, what's wrong?
Are you embarrassed?

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's the first time I've
ever worn something like this.

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
Hey, Suzu!

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.306 position:50% align:center
Since it's so frilly
and hard to move in,

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
do you think I could maybe
tuck the back up like this?

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Sometimes, I think
you have no pride.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center
Well, then. Thanks for
lending a hand, you two!

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
We're going to be
counting on you today.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Of course!

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure
to work with you.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
Could you start by
putting these treats out

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
on display for the customers?

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's a hexagon!

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
Look! Columnar jointing!

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
Would you set them out
like a normal person?

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
All right, it's just about
time to open the store!

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
Oh. Now I'm getting all nervous.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Don't worry, I'm gonna
be right here with you.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
--You'll do great!
--Aw, thank you, Suzu!

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER 3A]
What do you think I should get?

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
Mommy! If I'm good, can I have
that fairy's ocarina?

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
Look at this new treat!

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
It's called the English Maid's
Morning and it looks delicious!

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
Gotta hand it to you guys.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
That's a unique name.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
I find it a little embarrassing.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER 3C]
Oh. Are you two new here?

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! A line!

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, we don't really
know what we're doing yet.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:19.619 position:50% align:center
Uh... Suzu, a little help?

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER 3D] Moe-Moe!
You look so cute today!

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness,
would you just stop?

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
--You're always so sweet to me!
--Hey! Earth to Suzu!

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
You said you'd stay with us!
Get the heck over here!

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
Your change is 20 yen
and there's your receipt.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.718 position:50% align:center
Your order is ready!
Here you go!

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO]
Thank you so much for coming in!

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
Look at you!

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
You guys are both starting
to get the hang of this!

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your
brilliant training,

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
which consisted of leaving
us all on our own!

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
Well, if you don't mind,

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
I do have one
helpful tip for you.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
When you're dealing
with customers,

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
a smile goes a very long way!

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:52.193 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO]
Okay.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
Be right with you!

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.449 position:50% align:center
Oh, Megu!
Welcome back to the store!

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
[MEGU]
Thanks!

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
Huh? That's Megu?

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you-- Oh.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
He-he.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
Uh... I mistook you
for someone else.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. You didn't.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center
I'm Megu.
You were right the first time.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
So who is she?

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
Megu is my little sister.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
She's gotten much taller
since she's been busy

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
with her new club!

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
She was towering over me
in the blink of an eye!

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
Well, Mira. Good to see you.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.850 position:50% align:center
And it was so wonderful
to meet you, Ao!

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center
I guess I'd better go
and get ready now. Bye!

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
Wait, is this a joke?

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
Why does she get to wear that?!
She looks so cool!

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right, my sister
thought that this outfit

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
would go over a just
little bit better for me.

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50% align:center
Yep! And if you
don't mind my saying so,

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
you look very dashing!

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much
for coming back to see us!

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
Help yourself to a sample.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.667 position:50% align:center
Bye, now. Be careful, okay?

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
--[BOYS] Ohh...
--Oh, man...

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Mira, what's wrong?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
The only thing I can
do decently is stack bread.

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
--No way!
--Look, it's so tall!

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ao, can I
ask you something?

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.805 position:50% align:center
Do you think my sister
ever gets to have any fun

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
with her friends at school?

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
I'm so busy with my club duties.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
She just has to help out at the
store more than she used to.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm asking if
she's still doing okay

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
with her friends.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Hmm...

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think she's fine.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
From what I can tell.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
Why'd you pause, then?

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
Oh, that was... nothing.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
She's not in our club,
so I don't get to spend

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
that much time with her.

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
But she does watch over us
from a perfect distance, so...

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
I guess, in a way,
she's seems kinda like

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
an older sister to us, too.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
Wow! I'm so glad to hear that!

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
Aw! An older sister, huh?

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
You can be my sweet little
sibling starting right now,

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
if you want!

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
[AO groans]

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.852 position:50% align:center
Man. I am so beat!

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
Me, too. It was
really fun though.

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
I know, right?
I weirdly want to do it again!

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help today!

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
Here you go!
Take these home with you.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
A little trivia: did you guys
know the word "croissant"

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
means "crescent moon"?

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
Actually, I think it's too full

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
to be referred to as
a crescent moon!

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd say this is
more of a waxing crescent.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Great, you've
successfully ruined the moment!

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
[HANA] Here. This is
your pay for today.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
Thanks again for
being here to help out!

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
Let's do it again!

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO]
Thanks, we'd love to!

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
Our very first part-time wages!

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.
This is way more than I thought.

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry!

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center
I got to take lots of great
pictures of you guys, see?

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
So I made sure to add a little
bit extra as your modeling fee.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about my sister!

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
There's no excuse for her!

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, it's fine.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
[AO]
We're used to it.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
When I was little,

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
my friend used to
give me these maps.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
And in my mind,

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center
they were nothing less than
genuine treasure maps!

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
Let's see, towel, sunscreen...

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
Yep! We're all set!

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
I'm heading out now!

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
There you are!

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
Hey! Have you waited long?

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
[AO] Mm-mm. Just got
here a minute ago.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
That's a relief!
I'm glad to hear it.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:18.108 position:50% align:center
Ha! That sounded like
something people say on a date!

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
Uh... Did you say "date"?

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
On we go!

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.531 position:50% align:center
Let the "Shopping to Commemorate
Our First Paychecks," begin!

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
AKA, "Station Area Date"!

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
So here's the plan.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
I want to go to
the stationary store,

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
and then the bookstore,
and the...

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mira. Look over there.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Are Ino and Suzu... hanging out?

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
When did those two get so close?
How did I miss that?

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
Come on, I think
we should go follow them!

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh? Uh, okay.

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
It doesn't look like
a shopping trip to me.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
[AO] They're heading into
that residential area.

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:00.066 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Ino looks like she's having fun.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
"Ino's taking a picture
of something pretty right nao."

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
She opened a map
and started walking,

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
so I guess we're on the move.

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] "Ino's opening up
a big map nao!"

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
[AO]
And now they went into an alley.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
"Nao, they've apparently
ducked into an alley."

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
where they might be going?

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
"We don't know
their destination."

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Hey!

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
What a coincidence.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.151 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry we were
weird and followed you.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
We are totally busted nao.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.197 position:50% align:center
Enough of
the "nao" stuff, already!

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
Hey, fancy seeing you two here.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
We were just curious
about what you guys were up to.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
Is it a date?

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, no,
it's nothing like that!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
You sound happy, though.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.334 position:50% align:center
It's simple.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
I wanted to come see
the enclave today,

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
so I asked Suzu if
she'd come along with me.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:04.589 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Enclave?

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:06.508 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Yeah! It's a part of a territory

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:09.761 position:50% align:center
that lies within another
territory, like this, see?

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
Huh. And you
find that interesting?

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me? Of course!

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
I've always had a thing
for maps, though.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
So, now and then,
I go exploring like this.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That sounds fun!

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:23.316 position:50% align:center
Were maps something
the geology group studied, too?

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
They're probably considered
two different fields.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
But there's no doubt that
they're pretty closely related.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
Last year, we found
this really cool map

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
in front of the
geology club room.

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.037 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Ah?

00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
Geological maps always are.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
That day, I met my destiny.

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.254 position:50% align:center
That was what inspired
me to join the club

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
in the first place,
so it's only recently

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
that I've gotten interested
in geology and stones.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.093 position:50% align:center
How cool.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
I guess there are lots
of ways to get into it, huh?

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Ino! Come check it out,
I found our landmark!

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
There! That's it, right?

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Oh, yeah!
That's the district sign-board!

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
Time for a selfie!
I have to have a record of this!

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
Ah! Here, take another one!

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.449 position:50% align:center
She's right.
You definetly need one more!

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Oh, man, that
was a lot of walking.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
Know what I think, Ino?

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
You should totally start
doing the kind of thing

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
we did today
during our club time.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.716 position:50% align:center
We could even join you
and learn something about it.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center
This is my hobby.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
I think it's best to draw
a line between hobbies

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
and club activities, right?

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm pretty sure

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
I'd only be bothering
Sakura, anyway.

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
So mature.

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
Hey, so what is it about maps
that made you love them so much

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
in the first place?

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
Yay! I love me
a good origin story!

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure,
but I think it probably started

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
with these little maps
that my friend used

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
to draw for me
back when I was young.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
I had so much fun going out with
those and exploring everything.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
That's so adorable!

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
What kind of treasures
were you supposed to find?

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.416 position:50% align:center
Oh, gosh, praying
mantis eggs, a beehive,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.794 position:50% align:center
and some old magazines
someone threw out.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
Searching for treasure
was super fun.

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] But walking around with
the map made the parks and roads

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
I'd always used feel
completely different to me!

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
[INOSE gasps]
There're so many flowers!

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:29.109 position:50% align:center
Sadly, I lost track of
that friend after we ended up

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
going to different
middle schools, though.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:32.612 position:50% align:center
[MIRA squeals]

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
I want to try it!

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
Treasure-hunting!

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
Ino, will you draw me
one of those maps, please?

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
I-I mean, I don't mind, but...

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.580 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, we need paper.

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
Hey. I know!

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
Draw it on my hand!

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
Listen, why don't you
just give me a little time?

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.880 position:50% align:center
Then I could draw you
a proper one.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
We should probably get going.

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
I'd love to cover the bill
as a thank you for today.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO]
So mature!

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
How weird.

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
This might be the first time
I've ever drawn a map myself.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Uh, hello?

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center
Hey! Do you happen
to have a minute to talk?

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Sure!

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
Oh, good! Thanks for
sending me that picture.

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Well, I just happened
to find some stones

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
that had your name.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
And that made me feel happy,
so I wanted to show you!

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI chuckles] I've already
made it my wallpaper!

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Huh...

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Ino? What's the matter?

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Can I tell you something?

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Sure.

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I kind of ended up
agreeing to draw a treasure map

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
for Mira and the others today--
which I'm excited about--

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
but now I'm wondering
what kind of map

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:48.563 position:50% align:center
they might like, you know?

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
I love that!

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
Now you're sharing your fun
with them, that's cool!

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] What do you mean,
"sharing my fun"?

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:57.906 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Look, whatever you
find fun is the real treasure.

00:19:57.989 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
So, if you draw a map to that,
I have no doubt

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
all the girls will love it.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Mira.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I made you wait a bit
for this, but here you go!

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
Wow! Thank you.

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited!

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
I wonder what treasure
she wants you to look for!

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh,
I just can't wait to see!

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
[INOSE giggles] Try to find it
together after school,

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
if you can, okay?

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, SUZU]
Okay!

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
[school bells chime]

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.191 position:50% align:center
We're about to embark on
our treasure hunt, you guys!

Let's go do this!

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
So first, we'll walk
through this passage

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
and then we'll head toward
the special classroom wing.

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN screaming]

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
Run away from
the creepy anatomical dummy!

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] It says, "The Koi in
the courtyard's pond

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.586 position:50% align:center
are super cute,
so take some photos."

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
This is kinda fun.

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
It's really cool getting to see
the city through Ino's eyes.

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
[SUZU chuckles]

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you could actually
enjoy maps this way!

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
[MIRA groans]

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
It's the final landmark!

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
The back of a cool map.

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, look.

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:11.229 position:50% align:center
This is the one!

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
Wow, its really cute
and colorful!

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
[MIRA groans] Oh. Yeah, there's
something on the back!

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
It's a letter.
And the photo from yesterday!

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
[squeals]
That's it! I'm dead!

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
Ino has officially killed me
with her cuteness!

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
It's over!

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Whoa!

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey, Ino!

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
We found the treasure
and it's perfect!

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:35.378 position:50% align:center
It was so much fun.

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:36.588 position:50% align:center
We really loved it.

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center
Promise you'll draw
another one sometime!

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center
Sure! Love to!

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] This was how I was
finally able to share

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
the fun I had with those
treasure maps I loved as a kid

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.100 position:50% align:center
with my new friends.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
And it felt even better
than I thought it would!

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:54.981 position:50% align:center
I hope I get to
keep sharing that joy.

00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:58.193 position:50% align:center
That would be pretty great.
I think I will!

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] You wanted to see me
about summer camp?

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.906 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
You haven't decided
where to go yet, right?

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.910 position:50% align:center
Well, I have an idea for you.

00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
Please tell me it's a nice idea.

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:11.915 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] It sounds like
the Earth Sciences Club

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:14.501 position:50% align:center
is about to get
even more exciting!

00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:49.387 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Next time:
"Exciting! Summer Camp!"
