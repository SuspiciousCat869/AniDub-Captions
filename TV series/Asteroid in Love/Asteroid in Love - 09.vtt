[MIRA]
Living together?

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.638 position:50% align:center
--[MISA] Yep.
--Oh, wow!

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.473 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a great idea.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:18.018 position:50% align:center
That instantly solves
the problem, doesn't it?

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
this'll work out or not,

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
but let's do our best
to convince our parents!

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.276 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.497 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] So, what did
you need to talk about?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.375 position:50% align:center
[AO] Well, it's about
our move, actually.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.376 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.169 position:50% align:center
It's... just that...

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.879 position:50% align:center
I don't want to go.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.382 position:50% align:center
I'd rather just
stay here by myself!

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.758 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Uh...

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
My friend and I promised
to reach a goal together,

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.806 position:50% align:center
so I really want to see
that commitment through.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.017 position:50% align:center
Oh, now, I see.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.061 position:50% align:center
But the transfer's set,
and I'm not sure we can afford

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
to let you live on
your own right now.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.858 position:50% align:center
On top of that, cooking
and laundry aren't really

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
your thing, are they?

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.571 position:50% align:center
Well. I could practice
doing housework till spring.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.489 position:50% align:center
And these are some
thoughts on where I'll stay.

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Take a look!

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50% align:center
You... put this
together yourself?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.538 position:50% align:center
A few of my friends
helped me brainstorm a little.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
I think they came up
with some great ideas.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.461 position:50% align:center
I see, living with Mira, huh?

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:53.465 position:50% align:center
Well. It's a sensible
idea, but honestly,

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
this is a pretty big "ask" for
a parent to consider, honey.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.470 position:50% align:center
You haven't factored in
how hard it is

00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50% align:center
to leave one's child.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
Not to mention
the financial aspect.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
[AO sighs]

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
[AO] I knew it. As kids, there's
nothing we can do about it.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
No! That's just not right!

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
You are still a child, Ao.

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:15.278 position:50% align:center
So, why not act like one
and put up a bit of a fight?

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
I know I'm asking for a lot!

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
But, please.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
I just want to pursue my goal!

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
My dream, with Mira!

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you!

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] I wonder how long it's
been since she's opened up

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
with us like this.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
We've asked so much
of her for so long.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
[chair creaks]

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] Tell you what,
let's discuss this again

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.513 position:50% align:center
with your father
when he gets home.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:42.681 position:50% align:center
[AO gasps]

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
But try not
to get your hopes up, okay?

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm-hmm. Thanks a lot, Mom!

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. I just got
a text from Mira's mom.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
[YUUKO]
Mira told me what's going on.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
We're open to
discussing it anytime!

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
Let's talk it out!
I'll be waiting!

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
They're so alike.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] We'll have another
discussion about it.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.913 position:50% align:center
--We'll talk!
--Thank goodness.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
So, I guess we've
cleared the first hurdle.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
Well, we've still got
a long way to go, though.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
The families need
to discuss it together.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
[MIRA squealing]

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
Mira, try to chill out.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
Heh. One question:
why did you agree so quickly?

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
[YUUKO]
It sounded like fun to me!

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
Huh? Seriously?

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
No, honey, I'm just teasing you.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
It's a serious responsibility,

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
and it requires
a lot of thought.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
That said, I want to support
my children's dreams if I can.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Mom.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[YUUKO] Well. I'm pretty sure
I'm not the only one.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
So? Tell us how it went.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50% align:center
Great! Thanks to
all of your help,

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
both of our families
gave us the okay!

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Thanks so much for
all of your awesome ideas!

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
Can't believe we did it!

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad it worked out!

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
Well. I knew it'd
work out in the end.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
I wasn't worried at all.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
Really? You're gonna
try and play it cool

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
even though you were

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center
--crying your eyes out earlier?
--[SAKURAI] Would you shut up?!

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
--I was not!
--By the way...

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking about what
a dramatic chain of events

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
this has turned
out to be, and...

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
Guess what?!

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center
I'd like to print an article all
about it in the newspaper!

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Huh?

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
I already
told her we shouldn't do

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
anything tacky like that.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
I'm sorry!

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
Here I am, suggesting we cover
something other than scandal

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
for once, and you
won't support me!

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
So! How 'bout that interview?

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they both kind
of ran out at top speed.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey. I'm sorry I didn't notice

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
how much you were
agonizing over this.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
I was so oblivious.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
[AO]
No, I should apologize.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
I kept it from you because
I didn't want you

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
to feel bad about it.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.676 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
I really should've
talked to you sooner.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll do my best

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
to be more considerate
going forward. Okay?

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
Yeah! And, I'll
try to do my part

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:53.061 position:50% align:center
by making sure to tell you
how I'm feeling from now on.

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Hmm.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Oh! We need
to go thank Suzu, too!

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah!

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
[entrance bell jingles]

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
Welcome, come on in.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
Whoa. You seem
down in the dumps.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
Nope! That's not true at all.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
Let me guess.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
Is it maybe because
you're jealous that Ao

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center
will get to use
my sister's room?

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
No. I wouldn't let
a thing like that get to me.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
In fact, now that I think of it,

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
Ao moving in there means
I can come over to hang out

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50% align:center
and actually enjoy the smell
of Ao and Misa at the same time!

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
--[MIRA sighs]
--[SUZU chuckles]

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
Anyway. Thanks a lot for
your help at the meeting.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thank you, Suzu!

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Mm-hmm! I mean, I didn't
want Ao to be sad, after all!

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Still, I can't
believe Misa's about to

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
go to college so far away.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
I wish she had told me herself.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Suzu?

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Ah! Sorry, what?

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
Hey, here's an idea!

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
Let's celebrate you two
taking your first step forward

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
by pigging out!

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Triangle bikini pie?

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
Yeah, these
are a bunch of designs

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
that were actually rejected.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.460 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Oh, wow, thanks.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Still no response.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
Maybe she's just busy?

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
Right. She's dealing with
leaving for college

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
and handing over
the student council.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.304 position:50% align:center
[notification pops]

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
Mm?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
Sakura texted me?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.896 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bother you during work.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.273 position:50% align:center
Oh, not at all!
I'm on my break, anyway.

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm so happy
to hear from you,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
I could totally break
into a dance right now!

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean by that?

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Heh... Still as
intimidating as ever!

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
So, hey, what did
you wanna talk about?

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
Well, uh...

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
I was kinda hoping
you could teach me how

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
to make Valentine's chocolates.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
Geh-- Why aren't
you saying anything?

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
What kind of chocolate
would you like to make?

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to know
what the person likes?

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
No, uh... But I need a lot.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.514 position:50% align:center
Who all are you dating?!

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center
Say what?!

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it. You're
giving it to the club members!

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.730 position:50% align:center
I thought you had
a crush in mind.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
Look, friendship
gifting is embarrassing enough.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
I've never given anyone
chocolate before in my life.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
Oh, now I see.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
So you're a friendship
chocolate virgin, huh?

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
My lesson will be as tender
and thorough as possible!

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
Would you mind adjusting
your phrasing on that, please?

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Okay, I'll text
the ingredients later.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:21.751 position:50% align:center
Great, thanks.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:24.170 position:50% align:center
If you need me to,
I can also buy your share.

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Huh?

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
You're giving
some out, aren't you?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
Friendship or
romantic chocolate?

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] I just kept getting
all kinds of shaken up today.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
I hope I didn't reveal too much.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
[notification pops]

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
Finally!

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Sorry for the late reply.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
I plan on moving toward
the end of March.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
I finished making
arrangements today.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.196 position:50% align:center
So, not only is it late,
it's super-short.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] I guess soon...
it'll be goodbye.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
I've given her
chocolate every year,

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
but what should I do this time?

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:00.999 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Thanks for your help.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Oh, sure! Just leave it to me!

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
Now, let's start by getting
you changed into this.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
This is a major
event for a girl!

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
You should be
more excited about it!

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
More emotional!

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get it,
but you're scaring me right now!

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] First, we'll make
some chocolate using molds!

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
I mean, don't you
just let them cool

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
until they harden or whatever?

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
No, no, you mustn't
underestimate it!

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
It takes an awful lot of work
to make delicious chocolates

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
that melt in your mouth!

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
The key to amazing
chocolate is navigating

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
the melting characteristics
of the cocoa butter.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
You'll want to temper it,

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
meaning you have to adjust
the heat so that it forms

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
a uniform crystalline structure,
and control it carefully

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
as it cools, which will result
in giving you a glossy,

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:38.953 position:50% align:center
soft chocolate
with a delicious...

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I wonder if
this is what I sound like

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
when I talk about rocks.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.375 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] That's a lot
harder than it sounds!

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
--It's done!
--Yeah!

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
And the shape and gloss
are perfect, see?

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
Now all we have
to do is decorate!

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
So, it's basically a taste test,

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
but would you accept
my first friendship chocolate?

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
It's delicious!

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
That's good to hear!

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] You know, you'd be
very attractive if you would

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
open up more like this
instead of being

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
so stand-off-ish.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
You're one to talk.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
You act like a spaz instead of
showing your true feelings.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
[SUZU whimpers]

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
I mean, let's be honest.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.799 position:50% align:center
We both end up suffering for it.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
So!

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what do I do next?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Happy Valentine's Day!

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
The two of you guys
have done so much for us.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
So these are to say thank you!

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
Thanks, and these are from me!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
I have some, too!

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Aw, thank you so much!

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
[AO]
You didn't have to do that.

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sakurai, this is for you!

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
Happy, um, uh, Valentine's Day.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
Just take it!

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.410 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasping]

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
I... I mean, I know
I've only known you

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:03.621 position:50% align:center
for a little while...

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.665 position:50% align:center
...but it's been
fun enough and all.

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
So I appreciate it.

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
Thanks, that's so nice!

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Wow! Did you make them yourself?

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I did.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
I actually had Suzu
teach me how to make

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
star chocolates
and Earth truffles.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
They're so perfect that
I can't bear to eat them!

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Thank you so much for these!

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hmph.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
And they're handmade,
like they're chocolates

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
for your love!

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.273 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
[MORINO giggling]

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
They were delicious!

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Hey! You should've
savored those more!

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
I put a lot of work into them!

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they were delicious!

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever.
As long as they were good.

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I wonder if she
managed to give hers away.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.296 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Come in.

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
Hey, Suzu.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
Wow, it feels like
it's been a while.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
I've been swamped going through
all this backed-up paperwork.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
What is it?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
I have something for you.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
To show you how I feel.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
Monroe, there you are!

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
Congratulations on passing!

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.543 position:50% align:center
Hah! Thanks, you guys!

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
[AO]
So what are you doing now?

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
Searching for an apartment.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
Commuting that far every day
would be much too difficult.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I guess
since you and Sakurai

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
are graduating soon,
you'll both be moving away

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
after that, won't you?

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
Don't make it sound so sad!

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
Wow, graduation.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
it's been a year.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
It went by so fast.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Merging the clubs?

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
Starting in April.

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry the school
is making you do this.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
But that's so sudden!

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
I can't and won't accept this!

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
They need to at the very
least provide our club room

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
and budget first, don't they?

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
Morino, don't you have
an opinion on this subject?

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Um.

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
I don't think we're
going to get along very well!

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
Are you picking a fight?

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Honestly,
I couldn't understand why

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
Sakurai was so angry about it.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
Merging, huh?
I never saw that coming.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
But now that I think about it,
it might look better

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
on our college applications if
we get a proper club together.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
What's that, Sakurai?

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Looks like our
club activities and policies

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
are totally different
from Morino's, so...

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
I thought it would be best
to split us into groups.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
Gosh, you really
do hate me, don't you?

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
What are you talking about?

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
You're the one that started it!

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Um, hey, let's try
our best to get along, okay?

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.121 position:50% align:center
What are you doing now, Inose?

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, I...

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
I just thought I should try
to take a neutral stance!

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] At first, I guess
Sakurai had a hard time

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
getting used to my
matter-of-fact nature.

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center
After that, we managed
to gain some new club members.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
They shared the big dream, too.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
Something they both could
get lost in together.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
My dream for the future
was still a long way off.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
So I only ever thought of
our club in terms of being

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
just another step towards
that distant goal.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
I'm a little jealous.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
No, stop.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
My role as president is to make
sure the club runs properly,

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
so that's what I'm gonna do.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
I need to manage our schedule,

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
take photos for the newsletter,
edit that for printing,

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
and guide the younger members.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:39.754 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] But when I take
a step back and look at it.

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:41.381 position:50% align:center
Am I having any fun?

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey. Monroe?

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
Hey, Monroe!

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Oh, sorry, what do you need?

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I was hoping we
could all take a group photo

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.850 position:50% align:center
after the graduation ceremony!

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
I love that!

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
Should we take it outside
of the club building, then?

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:56.646 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yeah!

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.189 position:50% align:center
[AO]
We're looking forward to it.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] To think this
would bother me now,

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
after all this time.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Congratulations!
We're so proud of you!

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
This is sad! I can't
believe you're going away!

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
It's impossible for me
to say goodbye to you!

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] C'mon, it's nothing
to cry that much over!

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sakurai,
your handkerchief is all wet.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oops! Wrong one!

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
Use these instead!

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] It looks like
you've got the camera

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
set up just right!

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.841 position:50% align:center
Well, duh, that's
because you taught me

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.426 position:50% align:center
so well, Monroe.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
And I'll do my very best
to keep taking good pictures

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:29.971 position:50% align:center
even after you're gone.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear it!

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
However, you did
forget one thing.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Hmm?

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] You might need
a memory card in there.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Ah!

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center
Mira! I think
you should do it now.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yeah.

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
So, Monroe and Sakurai...

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
To commemorate your graduation!

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
Thank you. That's nice.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's the model of the moon
from the cultural festival!

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
I was hoping I'd have time to
draw a few more craters on it!

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean it wasn't finished?

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Did you guys make
a miniature boring core?

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
Yep! And it's filled with the
dirt that we extracted together!

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
Also, here! We added
more pages to the album, too!

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
I really hope you like it!

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
Pictures of me?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Yes! We realized you
weren't in many photos

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.438 position:50% align:center
since you were always in
charge of taking them,

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
so we collected pictures
of you from everyone!

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
[MORINO gasps]

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Look at that.
Did I really smile this much?

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:34.994 position:50% align:center
Thank you all.

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles] We just need
to add today's photo

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
and then it's complete!

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Hey, girls, sorry I'm late!

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center
--Just give me a second.
--[MIRA] Oh, good, hurry!

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I'll set the timer
for ten seconds, okay?

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Inose! Come on,
get in the picture!

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
--[ENDOU panting]
--[INOSE] Five.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
Four.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
Three.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
Two.

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:55.223 position:50% align:center
One!

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I'm glad they were
able to see us off with smiles!

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
Inose was kind of
a mess, though.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
We had our share of troubles.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.449 position:50% align:center
But all in all, the club
was pretty fun, right?

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Yeah.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
And it looked like,
I enjoyed it.

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
More than I thought I did.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
--Hold up.
--[MORINO whimpering]

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's the matter?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
So, you couldn't
figure out whether or not

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:30.884 position:50% align:center
you actually enjoyed the club?

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.220 position:50% align:center
You get stressed about
the strangest things.

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
[MORINO whines]

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
Once April gets here,
try not to worry about anything.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
Just dig in and enjoy
college life to the fullest.

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
I'll be right there
with you, after all.

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
So, once we're at college,
do you think you'll join me

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
for some mixers?

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Are you kidding?

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
You're actually
interested in that stuff?

00:17:56.951 --> 00:18:00.080 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Nah, I just want to
see you get all flustered.

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] During spring break, Ao
finally moved in with my family!

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Okay, that's
the last of the stuff!

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
Thank you.
I can handle the rest myself.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding? No way!

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
I'll help you unpack.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey, hold on!

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.763 position:50% align:center
Don't be shy,
we're living together now!

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
"To Mira"?

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, is this for me?

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
How sweet! Can I open it?

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
[AO]
No. I...

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
You don't have
permission to do that!

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
[YUUKO]
What's going on with you two?

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
Such frowny faces.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
Ah. A fight between
two astronomy lovers.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
How sad.

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
Mira's wrong!

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.747 position:50% align:center
I told her the moon
was formed from a comet

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
that struck the Earth.

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.752 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
The Giant Impact Hypothesis.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
Ao has no sense
of romance at all!

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
Some people believe the moon
came flying in all speedy-like

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
and got caught by
the Earth's gravity.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
The Capture Hypothesis.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
That's what I think.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
Well, I, for one,
am on board with Ao's take!

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO]
That's not what this is about!

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it. Mira went
through your luggage, huh?

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about that.

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
[AO] It's okay. I know I
shouldn't have shouted, either.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:14.029 position:50% align:center
I really am happy that
we live in the same house,

00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
but if this is how
our first day goes...

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
It's only natural
that you'd be worried.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
[AO sighs]

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
You grew up
in different environments

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
and now you're living together.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
I'm sure all kinds of things
will come up between you two.

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
Besides,
if you're feeling this way,

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
then I can promise
you that Mira is, too.

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Hmm?

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
I'm talking like I know
it all when I'm just as worried

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
about my new life.

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
The housework.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
I just really suck
at laundry and cooking.

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
[AO] Suddenly, I feel
much closer to her.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Oh, hey, by the way.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
Sorry to ask, but could you
do something for me?

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah, what do you need?

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center
[MISA] If you wouldn't mind
watering the plants

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
on that shrine once a day
and maybe cleaning it sometimes,

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:53.902 position:50% align:center
that would be great.

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Sure.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:56.446 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Thanks.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
One more thing.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mira, I'm coming in.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Uhh...

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ao!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Wow, a constellation pattern!

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
Cute.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
[AO] I was actually
planning on giving it to you

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
when I said goodbye
before moving.

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
But now, we can start
using them together.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
I look forward to being here.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
Ao, I'm so sorry and
I promise I won't go through

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
your things anymore!

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
Also!

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
I support the
Giant Impact Hypothesis, too!

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[AO]
She worried about that?

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
[AO]
This feels good.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Hey, Ao, I made some
coffee if you want some.

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:45.370 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Thanks.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh my gosh, look!

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
Venus is out!

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
[AO] It's hard to see
since it's so low,

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
but maybe Mercury's nearby.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
They said that it
should be easiest for us

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
to spot next week.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] The greatest
eastern elongation, right?

00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
It'll be visible since
it's farther from the sun, huh?

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
I've grown
a little bit, too, haven't I?

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Just think, we were
each looking at different stars

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:11.146 position:50% align:center
last year and now.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
It's kinda surreal.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah, it is.

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Please promise
to take care of Mira

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
while I'm gone, okay?

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
[AO grunts]

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:24.117 position:50% align:center
Oh no, are you all right?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
[AO] How many sugars
did you put in this?

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I didn't know
how you liked it.

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
So I just made a guess
and put about five in there.

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
That wasn't enough,
though, was it?

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
[AO]
From now on, I'll take it black.

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Hi, there! It's so nice
to meet new students!

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
We're the Earth Sciences Club!

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
So, would any of you
be interested in learning

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50% align:center
more about chasing the stars or
cracking rocks open with us?

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:51.353 position:50% align:center
If you think you might be,

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
then please come to the Cultural
Club Building after school!

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:56.316 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] We have to get
permission to recruit!

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
Please, wait!

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.487 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Hey, new students!
We're the Earth Sciences Club!

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.947 position:50% align:center
--Come check us out!
--[INOSE] Mira, no, wait!

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
So, that's...

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
...the Earth Science Club?

00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Today starts my second year!

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:12.624 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the younger ones
will look up to me.

00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:14.584 position:50% align:center
What'll that be like?

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:49.346 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Next time: "Rain with
Occasional Fortune-Telling."
