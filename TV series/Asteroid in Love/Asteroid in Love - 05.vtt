00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.430 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Suzu's been pretty
busy helping her family out

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.016 position:50% align:center
during summer break,
but today, she suggested

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.976 position:50% align:center
we go to the beach!

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
I love the beach!

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mira, what're you
doin' over there?

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.151 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I'm collecting rocks, see?

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Huh.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.947 position:50% align:center
Kinda cool. She's been
getting into geology lately.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Yep, classic geology
club behavior, right there.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.332 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Ino, what's the matter?
You all right?

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I was just thinking how
beautiful you both look.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
And so mature.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should have gone
with a swimsuit like that, too.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center
Here, you can use
my wrap if you want!

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
[AO, SUZU squeal]

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50% align:center
--[SUZU] So frickin' cute!
--[AO] You look adorable!

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:56.181 position:50% align:center
--Yes, girl! Nice! Work!
--Seriously! You really do!

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
[INOSE chuckles weakly]

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.650 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Isn't it nice?

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
I wish Sakurai and Monroe could
have hung out with us, too!

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.531 position:50% align:center
I know, right?
Summer classes sound rough!

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.949 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mira, don't do
that without warning me!

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
Seems to me like
you two have grown

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.747 position:50% align:center
a lot closer lately, am I right?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.331 position:50% align:center
You're different, Ao.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.626 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh. Yeah.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
I can talk to her
like normal now.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
We had a sleepover,
and we went to a hot spring!

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.259 position:50% align:center
It's been awesome!

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.970 position:50% align:center
The beach is just
the best, don't you think?

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.347 position:50% align:center
--Wanna swim some more?
--[SUZU] Now that I think

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
about it. I'm pretty sure
this is the first time

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
another girl's been closer
to Mira than me.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.979 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh.

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
Could this be... jealousy?

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ugh. I'm so hungry!

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
Would you guys be cool
with eating lunch now?

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Lunch!

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Ao, let's have a match!

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
A contest to see
who's Mira's best friend!

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
We'll do best-of-three, 'kay?

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
But Mira--!

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Round one!

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
And our first challenge will be
preparing Mira's favorite food!

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, INOSE gasp]

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
How did this happen
and why am I here?

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
I know Mira loves strawberries!

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
[AO] If I'm remembering right,
she really likes pork cutlets.

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
And... Showdown!

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
I dunno, I love them both!

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
It'd be tough to choose
between those two.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
Hard to compare
savory and sweet.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
[SUZU gasps]

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Now for round two!

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
For this challenge, we'll
compete to see who can

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
swim out and touch Mira first!

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ino. Would you be
willing to start us off?

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
Oh, hold on,
before we start...

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
Look at this, and make
sure that you both keep

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
a good lookout for riptides.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.006 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Riptides?

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
Oh, riptides are
strong currents that flow

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
from the shore
out into the ocean.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
If you happen to get
pulled into that current,

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
then you'll drift farther
and farther from the shore.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
So, you have to be
super careful out there.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
[AO, SUZU]
Huh?

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Mira!

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
[SUZU, AO groan]

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout that!

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
You girls weren't coming so,
I just started swimming.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
[AO] I'm so glad you
weren't being pulled away.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] I forgot to
even care about our match.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
So, back to business!

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
I think we should have Inose
decide on the final match!

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
It's only fair!

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh? Are we still doing this?

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
Okay! Why don't
we have everyone ride

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
one of those, then?

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Wow, that looks so fun!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's a bit choppy out here,
so the boat might rock a bit!

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Okay!

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Suzu, your hair is all--

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry--

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Did... she let go?

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I'm falling!

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
Mira!

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.278 position:50% align:center
Careful!

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Huh?

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
[MIRA laughs] I won't lie--
that was pretty scary!

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
It was so crazy when both of you
guys started falling together!

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.541 position:50% align:center
Mira...

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
I was just falling because
I was trying to rescue you!

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same here.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.381 position:50% align:center
Except I was trying
to rescue Suzu.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
I'd like to point out
that you both

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
ignored the contest.
That was really cool.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
Look, stop me if I'm crazy here,

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
but if you can be
that good to each other,

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
why can't you all
be best friends?

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.395 position:50% align:center
Oh. All of us?

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
I get it!

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.945 position:50% align:center
Wait, did Inose propose
the boat for the match

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
because she saw this coming?

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
Is she that great with people?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
Wow, look at this!
It's incredible!

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
You can see
the strata so clearly!

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
I wish I could show this
to Sakurai, too!

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Yeah. Maybe not.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Looks like we've lost Ino.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
Yeah. She's worn out
from all the fun!

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Ao...

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
I'd like to apologize
for dragging you

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
into my silly jealousy issues.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
--Sorry.
--What?

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
Oh. I didn't know
you felt that way.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
Now I get it.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm sorry, too.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I'm the worst.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
I don't often pick up
on how others feel.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
Well, from now on, I'll be more
clear about how I'm feeling.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.873 position:50% align:center
Does that sound good?

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
I'll start by
putting this out there.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
I'm so looking forward
to getting closer to you.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
Since we'll be best friends
forever, now!

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
[AO whimpers]

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.385 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.846 position:50% align:center
Hey! I got a text from Monroe.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Uh? Huh?!
Why's she in a swimsuit?!

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
And Sakurai, too?

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] She says, "we've finished
our summer classes,

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
so now we're relaxing
at the school pool."

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
Sounds fun!

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
Please, I'm your bestie--

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
you have to let me
have those photos!

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] What exactly is
your definition of "bestie"?

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Hey! Jupiter.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
Huh? You can see it?

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, there it is!

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
Wow. Impressive!

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
You can tell which
planet at a glance?

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah, generally.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
Based on the color
and brightness.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
[SUZU gasps]

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
The only things I
know about stars,

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
I learned in a class at school.

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should make an effort
to learn a little more.

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
--[AO] Huh?!
--Uh? What?

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.431 position:50% align:center
Um... That's...

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
She's probably trying
to show affection.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
You should take it.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Oh. O-Okay!

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] And with that,
Suzu's very fulfilling day

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
came to a lovely end!

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
It wasn't much longer till the
last night of summer break!

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yay, it's Sakurai!

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
Going to a mineral show?

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
Not sure what that is,
but I'll totally go anyway!

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] I'm sorry,
I have other plans already.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.334 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] What a shame.
I have plans that day, too.

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Same here. I'm so sorry.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center
Huh? No one else can go?

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
So, that means...
I'm gonna be all alone.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
With Sakurai.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hi! Good morning!

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
G'morning. Wow, you're early!

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yeah, um...

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
I got a little nervous
when I realized

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
it was just gonna
be the two of us.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
You take things so seriously.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
I kind of figured that you
were likely to get mad at me

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
if I was late,
and the thing is,

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
you're really scary
when you're mad, Sakurai.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
--You don't say.
--Ow, ow, ow, owie!

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
What a coinkydink--
I'm nervous, myself.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, owie! Is this
you when you're nervous?!

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Look how many people there are!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.417 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Have you noticed
a lot of them are women?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
They're also selling
power stones and stuff

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
to make accessories.
Cool, right?

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
Mira, are you even listening?

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
Ow! Why would you peek at
my phone?! It's embarrassing!

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
Ow... What is it you're
looking for here, anyway?

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Mm... I haven't settled on

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
anything specific yet.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
If I'm being honest.

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
I'm mainly here to get
a break from studying.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.323 position:50% align:center
I think it's fun just wandering
around and looking!

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
I guess you could say you're
window-shopping for stones!

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
Oh! The chisel set
I've been looking for!

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
I'll take it! And this!

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
Ah! Could I get
this, too, please?

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]
Pretty!

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 5A]
Hi.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
Which power stone do you want?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
Um, I... I don't really, uh...

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.638 position:50% align:center
Hi, excuse me.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
Would you be willing to
come down on this price a bit?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 5A]
I'll check.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
Just a moment, please.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.191 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You're so cool and grown up.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna leave
your side again all day.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50% align:center
Hey, come on now.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.406 position:50% align:center
Stop with the sweet talk.

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Those have
rubber bands around them.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh! Yeah, those are geodes.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
Check it out.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]
It came apart!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] The inside is made up
of crystallized minerals.

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
If I'm remembering right,
there's a demo corner

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
where you can split
geodes yourself.

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Cool, a rock-splitting show!

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect chance
to show off your iron fist!

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I'm not entirely sure

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
that's supposed
to be a compliment.

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
This is so crazy!

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
There are stones as far
as the eye can see!

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
Minerals, fossils, and meteors.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Meteors?!

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
Did you see, Sakurai?
They're selling meteors!

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
Look, can you take it
down a notch?

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
If you find one you like,
why not buy it?

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:58.700 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
Aw! For Ao! A souvenir!

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gulps]

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.590 position:50% align:center
You ended up
with a fair amount of loot.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I just couldn't
even help myself.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This is that
geode we saw earlier.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
And the one that looks like it
has two layers is calcite.

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
There's a bismuth
crystal with crazy coloring.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.685 position:50% align:center
And a pretty banded stone!

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI chuckles]

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
You seem to have a knack
for finding banded stones

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
with really strange patterns!

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
[MIRA groans]

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
Your turn. Go ahead,
show me what you bought.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
Really? You wanna see?

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:38.365 position:50% align:center
Uh, on second thought,
maybe not.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Today was exactly
the kind of breather I needed!

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
I got to play with lots
of sparkly stones.

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
All topped off
with yummy pancakes.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
Now you can go home with new
energy so you can study hard!

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.088 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs]
Yeah...

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.757 position:50% align:center
That depression came on so fast.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
Entrance exams
are tough, aren't they?

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
It's more like...

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
The problem is...
I can't get motivated.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
I know I mentioned it
during summer camp.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
But I just don't
have any clear goals.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh...?

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You have a big dream.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.400 position:50% align:center
You want to discover
a star, right?

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Well, technically,
an asteroid, not a star.

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
If you manage to find one,

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
then what will
you do after that?

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
After that?

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I mean later,
like when you're an adult.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
Do you have a particular job
or career in mind

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.249 position:50% align:center
that you're aiming for?

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Hmm... When you put it
like that, I have no idea!

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
I really envy you right now.

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
Sorry for bringing that up.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
Kinda ruined the break
from real life, didn't it?

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
Let's remedy that
with another cake.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
Doesn't it look
just like strata?

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it actually does.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
You're becoming
more and more like us

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
geology girls every day!

00:12:58.153 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
All right, let's dig in!

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
This walnut fossil is delicious!

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Sorry for taking up
your entire day like this.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50% align:center
No! I had a great time!

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for everything!

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
What... What is this?

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
It's to thank you
for inviting me out today.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50% align:center
I hope we can bring
the others next time.

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
Anyway, my house is that way!

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh! Right, okay.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
See you later, then.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I forgot to thank her

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
for coming out
with me, didn't I?

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
Shoot.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Topaz.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
"The stone that helps you find
the path you should take." Wow.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
That was a pretty
classy thing to do.

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:48.411 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
"Thank you for today.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
I really had a lot of fun."

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
Nah, that doesn't seem
quite right for her somehow.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] "I was happy you
were there to listen to me.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best
with my studies."

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:01.800 position:50% align:center
Ugh, who says that?

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yay, it's Sakurai.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:08.723 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Thank you for today.

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
I'll study hard, so make sure
to give it your best, too!

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:13.395 position:50% align:center
Growr!

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Little weird.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG BOY 5A]
Teacher!

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
When I grow up,
I want to drive a big train!

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG GIRL 5A]
I want to be a cake-baker!

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG GIRL 5B]
And I wanna be an astronaut!

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
[YOUNG BOY 5B] Yeah! I want
to drive trains, too!

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
[All right! Good job!

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.836 position:50% align:center
And you, Mikage?

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
[CARETAKER 5A] What would
you like to be in the future

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
when you're all grown up?

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I don't know.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
[GIRL STUDENT 5A]
Morning!

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
[GIRL STUDENT 5B]
Good morning!

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:01.609 position:50% align:center
Hi, Sakurai!

00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
Seems like you're in
your own world.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
Oh, morning.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
I can't remember,

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
do we have a club
meeting today or not?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
Huh? Ah, yeah, we do.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
It's right after school.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hmm. That's right.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center
The cultural festival's soon.

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
We need to start making
decisions about that.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.303 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sighs]
It's still too hot out!

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:32.140 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Uh... Look, there.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
[AO]
What the heck...?

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's Ibe!

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:44.027 position:50% align:center
No! I told you to call me
"Eve," didn't I?

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.195 position:50% align:center
Don't mind her,

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
she's just one of my
friends from class.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
[EVE groans]

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.783 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You sure about that?

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
Hey! It's Manaka!

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
Yoo-hoo!

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Usami?

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Someone you know?

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
[AO]
A classmate.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout this.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
Eve seems to be a certified
pain in the butt these days!

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Reconnaissance?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
We're a secret squad within the
Newspaper Club that's taking

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:10.428 position:50% align:center
covert action to crush the Earth
Science Club's newsletter!

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
--[laughs]
--[MIRA gasps]

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
This is cool! I've never
seen covert action before!

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
Excuse her, I think
she's a bit off today.

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
But the girls of
the Earth Sciences Club

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
are pretty spacy,
too, am I right?

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
[AO chuckles]

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
So, you plan to
"crush" our newsletter.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
Sorry, could you give us
a few details outlining

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
what that looks like?

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
No! No details for you.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
It's just that our newspaper
isn't selling at all

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.244 position:50% align:center
and it sucks!
Wanna know why?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
Because your club's newsletter
is right beside it,

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
all chock full of
flashy content!

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
This is fascinating.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
I think we're being praised
and reprimanded at once.

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center
You're such an honest girl.

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
So, you're openly trying
to stop the production

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
of the Earth Science
Club's newsletter?

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I was just looking
to see if I could find

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
any scandals that we could use
against you as blackmail!

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
You know you
spilled your plan

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
within five minutes, right?

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
You might be even
spacier than Mira.

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.311 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
Well, did you find any
scandals you could use?

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I tried spying on
your club room

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
from several angles.
But I found nothing!

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
[EVE] I was just looking to see
if I could find any scandals

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
that we could use
against you as blackmail!

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Oh my, what a shame!

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
Especially since you just shared
something which we could easily

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center
use to blackmail
the Newspaper Club.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.082 position:50% align:center
Ah! When did you do that?!

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
[growls] Fine! You can do
whatever you want with me!

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Well... It's not like
you were causing any harm

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
peeking into the club room.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
Sorry. She enjoys making
things a bazillion times

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
more dramatic
than they need to be.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:34.596 position:50% align:center
Here's a thought!

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind, we need
some help dreaming up

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
an exhibit for the
cultural festival!

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
An exhibit for what?

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
Sure, I guess.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
How about creating a model
of our solar system, huh?

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm-hmm!

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.817 position:50% align:center
That's a good thought!

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
Last year, the Geology Club
made a display

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
showing off their
research, right?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Yes. Surprisingly,
though, very few people

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
actually took the time
to stop and read it.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50% align:center
I guess we need
an exhibit that draws attention.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
Something that both kids
and adults can enjoy.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I know!
We'll cosplay again this year!

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
Rejected.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
Something that draws attention?

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
Obviously, you need
something huge!

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
You wanna carry in
one of those giant rocks

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
from the mountains?
I'm sure they'd love you then!

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
Yeah! But to do that,
I'd need some explosions!

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Um, "blast" is actually
the correct term for that.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
[USAMI chuckles]
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sakurai!

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
Do you think we could
bring in some strata?

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
Would that be okay?

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Huh... You mean a
surface peel specimen, right?

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
Hmm... I've never done it.

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
We'd need a rocky outcropping
to find a specimen.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
I know! How about a boring
survey of the campus, then?

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
--[MIRA] Hmph.
--[bowling pins clattering]

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I get it, but no.

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.251 position:50% align:center
You mean "boring"
like "drilling!"

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right?

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
Correct! You drive
a pipe into the ground,

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
and you bore out a sample!

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
And then you blow it up!

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
With explosions!
So the rocks--

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
Yoink.

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
Okay, Eve, I think
that's my cue.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
You're embarrassing yourself,
so we'll just be going now.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center
Hey, boring sounds fun!

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
Which is kinda funny.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
We should really
give it some thought!

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:07.689 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Hmm.

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Excuse me.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?!

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
Are you spying on us this time?!

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] No, c'mon,
it's nothing like that!

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
I'm actually here because
something very strange

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
happened this morning.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
Ooh! Something strange?

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
See? Interesting, right?

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
It looks like, over summer
break, someone named the Koi.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
Well. I guess that could be a
filler article or something.

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.304 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda surprised that
anyone even noticed

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
these tiny little signs, though.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
It's because I've been
watching them

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
ever since my first year.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:49.064 position:50% align:center
[EVE] I guess some people
might find this interesting.

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Speaking of change,

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
you're a little different since
last semester, right?

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
Huh...?

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
If I'm not mistaken,
you didn't used to wear

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
your bangs that short before.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
I notice stuff because
I pay attention.

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
Aw...! How sweet!

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
Your heart just skipped
a beat, didn't it?

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
No, stop talking! As if!

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
--That meant nothing to me!
--[USAMI] Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
I kind of expected it.

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
But as it turns out,
conducting a real boring survey

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
is costly in
both money and labor.

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Huh? Look what I just found.

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
See, it says right here,
"The harvested boring cores

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:24.057 position:50% align:center
are kept under school custody."

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh...

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Hmm... Well. I guess the
school only has paper records.

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
Heh! This is so cute, it looks
kinda like masking tape!

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Yeah.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
This is how you report the
results of a boring survey.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, Araya.
Do you know if we have any agar?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
Right here.

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
Ooh! That's so cool!

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
I get it! It's a mock
boring survey!

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh!

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
We could serve these!
Run a little café!

00:20:57.507 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
A café?

00:20:58.508 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's great!

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
We could make a few other
science themed sweets, too!

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] So, it's a café that
celebrates Earth Sciences

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
with tea and sweets.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
Geocafé! That has a nice ring!

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
It's settled, then!

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ao! Let's brainstorm
some ideas for treats

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
--and talk them over with Suzu!
--[AO] Sure!

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] So, did we agree
on what the geology group's

00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
exhibit will be?

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] An actual, real-life
boring survey on campus!

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] We can't do that.
It's not realistic.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
We can't ask other businesses to
help with the cultural festival.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
[INOSE whimpers]

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Hey, Sakurai.

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
If you're interested
in it, why not just organize

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
whatever findings and
data you can and see?

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
But... without the real thing,

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center
it won't be a centerpiece
for the exhibit.

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
It'll end up looking haphazard.

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
And you know what?

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
That's fine.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.435 position:50% align:center
It'd be a shame
to scrap the whole idea

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:53.563 position:50% align:center
before knowing for sure.
Might as well find out!

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:54.564 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
I mean, at the very least,

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
I'd love to hear all
about your research

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center
and your thoughts on it.
What do you think?

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
I really want to know, too!

00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Mm-hmm!

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI gasps]

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] And so, our Earth
Sciences Club started preparing

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:14.501 position:50% align:center
for the cultural festival!

00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:48.970 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Next time, "Hoshizaki Festival!"
