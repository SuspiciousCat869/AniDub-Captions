[SUZU giggles]

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:22.313 position:50% align:center
Your summer camp starts today!

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.648 position:50% align:center
Where are you going again?

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
The Geological Museum and JAXA!

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.987 position:50% align:center
Miss Endou was the one
who proposed it!

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Wow, sounds nice.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
Have enough fun for me, too!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
Also, sneak pictures of
everyone's sleeping faces!

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.953 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Snore.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.833 position:50% align:center
--[MIRA gasps] A rocket!
--[GIRLS gasping]

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] That's the Expo
Center's life-size model.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
not the real thing.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] I'm guessing you
know this area pretty well?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
You guess right.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
I spent my high
school days here.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Check it out!

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
That car's like a little robot!

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Oh, for pete's sake!

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
You made me miss the turn!

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.861 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
We're here!

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.696 position:50% align:center
Well, you're unusually restless.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
What? I'm my
calm, normal self.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.284 position:50% align:center
I mean, I see rock samples
in books all the time, Monroe.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.785 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Sakurai, look at this!

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
It's just incredible!

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
Wha-- ? Where?

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.956 position:50% align:center
A molted praying mantis shell!

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
Aw, that's so cute!

--[SAKURAI growls]
--Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.377 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
What's your problem?!

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
What the heck did I do to
deserve such violent treatment?

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.339 position:50% align:center
--Here we go again.
--[MIRA] Come on!

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.632 position:50% align:center
Miss Endou came up
with a fantastic proposal

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:57.302 position:50% align:center
for how we should spend our club
summer camp this year.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:58.678 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
Who wants to go
to my grandma's house?

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS groan]

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.892 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Hold on. Hear me out.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.685 position:50% align:center
Just allow me to clarify.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
We'll stay there to
save money on lodging

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
while we visit some
attractions nearby.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
What attractions?

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.275 position:50% align:center
There's a lot.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
The JAXA Space Center,
the Geological Museum,

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
--the Geopark, and maybe...
--[GIRLS gasping, squealing]

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
So... Grandma's it is, then?

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.871 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Wow. This museum rocks!

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU chuckles]

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
They have minerals and fossils!

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
Sakura, isn't this place aw--?

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:33.963 position:50% align:center
Look! Oh, gosh.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
That is the actual stone they
use in the reference books!

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
--[guffaws]
--Hey, Ino--

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
I'm having so much
fun just watching her!

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
Sakura's having
the time of her life!

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center
I think maybe we should
give them some space.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Yeah.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Did you find
anything interesting?

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50% align:center
This one.

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Wow, it's like
a bunch of sparkly,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
golden twelve-sided dice!

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
[AO]
And this one's heart shaped.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
I wonder how they
end up like that--

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
In such pretty shapes.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
Yamanashi's prefectural stone?

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
Yep, each stone represents
a different region,

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
and is known as that
place's prefectural stone!

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.752 position:50% align:center
This one is definitely
my favorite.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Cherry Blossom Stone?

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
This is Kyoto's stone, and it's
essentially a national treasure!

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
It does have
the exact same pattern

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.220 position:50% align:center
as a cherry blossom!

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
It's cute, and incredibly rare.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
It's just like a prized flower!

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
I also love it because Sakura
has all those qualities, too!

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?!

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh...?

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
The geology group's
excitement is so amazing.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] What are you looking at
over here, Miss Endou?

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
Oh! So many precious gemstones!

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
I wonder how
much money you'd get

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
if you sold all these together.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Don't steal them.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
[AO]
What's up, Monroe?

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
What did you find over here?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
That looks tasty!

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
Always hungry.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
Well, everyone
has their own way

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
of enjoying things, I guess.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
[INOSE sighs]
I love this place!

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
You could never see it all
in a single day!

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
I never wanna leave here!

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
Mira, did you bring the stone?

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
What stone?

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
Mira found an interesting
stone the day of

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
our riverside barbecue
and it looked like

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
it might be a fossil.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
So, we figured they could
appraise it for us here.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
When I tripped and fell
on it, the rock split open.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
Ugh! What is it? Gross!

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Fossil Number One.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
So, you looked into it
on your own, right?

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:53.061 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I wasn't certain
it was a fossil,

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
so I thought I would do some
research on the subject.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Wow.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
This book is easy to understand!

00:05:58.942 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
It sure is.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
Oh, nice.
That looks fun to read!

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.698 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, INOSE]
A picture book?

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] So, basically,
for a plant or animal

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
to become a fossil,
it has to get buried in mud

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
pretty quickly after it dies.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
If not, it'll get
eaten by other animals.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
--Or just decompose.
--Cool.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
Then, many thousands
of years later,

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
with the mud having pressed it
down, it becomes a fossil.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Actually, in recent experiments,

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
they found that a fossil can
form in just a few weeks.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
Whoa, so if you
buried me in mud right now,

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
you could show my fossil
at the festival next year!

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That's murder.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
It is amazing, though.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
I can't believe we found
a fossil by the river.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
It's a lot more common
than you might think it is.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
You can find them
lots of places.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
Anywhere there's
sedimentary rock, in fact.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
Wow! Did you find all
of these fossils, Sakura?

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Eh-- This one and
this one I got from

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
the gift shop at
a science museum.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
Sakura is too honest
for her own good.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
Anyway, there's a chance
that it could be a fossil

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
that surfaced after
thousands of years.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
I wanna find out about it.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.421 position:50% align:center
They could tell us
what it might be here.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Really?

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Why are you
looking at me like that?

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
Come on, it's time to go!

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
I found it by the river
and I picked it up.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center
[MALE SCIENTIST] Can you point
out what section of the river

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
you found it in?

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Uh, I think we were about here.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
Ah, well then, that means...

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.276 position:50% align:center
Means what?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center
That this is a fossilized leaf
from thousands of years ago?!

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
Mira, come on, let him speak.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but that large,
black spot?

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
It might not be a fossil at all.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, MIRA]
Huh?

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
What? But Sakura sounded so
confident when she told me tha--

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
What is the matter with you?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
I said be quiet!

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard
of what's called

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
a "hidden stone?"

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.295 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
A hidden stone?

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE SCIENTIST]
Yes, that's right.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
It's also known as dendrite.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
It forms when manganese flows
between rocks and forms

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center

It's likely that those are

spicules of sea sponges.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
My hypothesis is that
it's the skeletal structure

from the Precambrian Era.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
in the direction of
an expert in that field?

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR 4A]
Hmm... Well, to be honest,

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
this facility is geared more
toward space exploration

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
and development.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50% align:center
So, while we have exhibits on
the discovery of asteroids,

00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
we don't know much
about searching

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
for new astronomical objects.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
You might find
an asteroid specialist

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
at one of our other centers
elsewhere in the country,

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:37.585 position:50% align:center
but not here.

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:39.754 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] I see.
Well, thanks for your time.

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yes, thank you so much, sir.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
My pleasure.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Thank you for talking to me!

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center
No luck. I couldn't
find any hints.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
Boo. Same here.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
But I learned a lot today,
and I think I found out

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
what our next step should be!

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
So, if we try each of the
space centers in Japan,

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
we'll eventually find
an asteroid expert!

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
Talk about optimistic.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Hey, Sakura.
Thanks for your help.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
Aw, it's no problem at all.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
We help each other don't we?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
This behavior is not befitting
of a future astronaut.

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Miss Endou!
We're finished exploring!

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
Okay. Sounds good

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Look, space meals!

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
They sell all different kinds!

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
A replica of a space suit, yay!

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
[INOSE giggles]

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
So, Teach, what did you buy?

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
What did you not buy?

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
All right. What do
you say we head back?

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
Hold up. Where'd Monroe go?

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
She went to the restroom.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center
[MORINO sighs]

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
You sure took your time.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with your face?

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
Outer space is far!

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
Oh, welcome back, girls!

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.000 position:50% align:center
Everything's ready
for the barbecue!

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Wow! It looks amazing!

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
Darn right! I had a lot
of free time on my hands.

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
Oh, jeez. Like I told you--

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
This isn't your summer camp.
But I got you this to apologize.

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
Oh... Yuki!

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Oh! Looks like tonight
is a full moon!

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
You are right,
but that makes it much harder

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
to see the stars.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.403 position:50% align:center
Yes, that is true,
but there's no better time

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
for observing the moon.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
I have a good idea.
I'll break out the telescope.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
I'm old though, so I'll need you
youngsters to lend me a hand.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Sure!

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, it has an equatorial mount!

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
It looks so different
from the one our club uses.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
[AO] Well, ours uses
an alt-azimuth mount,

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
that just moves the telescope
vertically and horizontally.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This one uses
an equatorial mount,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.261 position:50% align:center
which moves in sync with
the Earth's rotation.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
If you move
the handle on this one,

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
it'll follow that star forever,
which makes things much easier.

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
I want to see it, too!

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
I thought the moon would
look a lot bumpier than this.

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:07.277 position:50% align:center
It's so much flatter
than I expected.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Oh, well, you see,

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
the moon reflects the
sun's light a lot more

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
during the full phase.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center
And that makes it
a lot harder to see the bumps

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
from the craters.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] The bright part
with lots of craters

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
is composed mostly
of anorthosite.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
And the darker parts
are made of basalt.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
Did you know that?

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Wow, really?

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:28.256 position:50% align:center
Oh? I detect some relief.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
Looks like someone
studied up on this.

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI growls] It would do
you guys well to study rocks

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
every once in a while!

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.639 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hey! No need to lash out!

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
Girls! Want some watermelon?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
Heck yes!

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
Oh, also, Yuki.

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
I found that thing that
you asked us to look for.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
Nice! That's great.
Thanks so much.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's this?

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
It's a program.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.032 position:50% align:center
"Astronomical object discovery"?

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
Whoa! No way!

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?!

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] It's the Shining
Star Challenge program.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
They hold it at the observatory
during summer break.

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
I participated in it
back in the day.

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
I couldn't find any current
info on it, though.

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
[MIRA growls]

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
Why would you keep such
incredible information

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
a secret from us?

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Well, because I didn't
know about your asteroid dream.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] But we talked
about it that first day.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Sorry. I was napping
in the next room.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
You slept through it?

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
Oh. I found the website.

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
But the deadline for this year
has already passed.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] If only we had known
about this before now!

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
It's held on Ishigaki island.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
Okinawa? That's awesome!

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]
Ishigaki Island... Okinawa...

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.161 position:50% align:center
Clear, blue water.

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
Mira?

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
The Shining Star Challenge.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
It's open to all high
schoolers in the nation.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.087 position:50% align:center
Seven students get chosen,
based on submissions.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.588 position:50% align:center
Sounds hard to get in.

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
And we wouldn't be guaranteed
to find one, anyway. Boo.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.635 position:50% align:center
But despite that...

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
Our goal feels closer.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
You're right. One small step.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
Or even a giant leap!

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah!

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
Just like old times.

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
I remember your eyes sparkling
just like theirs are now

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
when you came home from
your time on Ishigaki Island.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU giggles]

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sighs]

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
We toured JAXA, had an
awesome barbecue,

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
and stargazed together.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
And it ended with fireworks.

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
We've been going all out.

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
I gotta say, though, I never
imagined Miss Endou was

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
the kind of person to hunt
for asteroids, you know?

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
I would have never
thought of that, either.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
My heart's been
racing all day long.

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
I guess this was a big
day for the Astronomy Club.

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
You're that much closer to
achieving your goals.

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Our goals?

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
Hey, you guys.
I want to become an astronaut.

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Really?!

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.860 position:50% align:center
So that's why you
seemed so serious all day today.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
It's such a big dream.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
I was embarrassed
to talk about it.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
You should never be embarrassed

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
to talk about your dreams.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
Not if you really
want to achieve them.

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
I still haven't found
a goal that really drives me,

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
so in my mind,
you're all amazing

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
because you know what you want.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't hold back.

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
Not in pursuit of your dreams.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
Sakura. Thank you for that.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Hmph.

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
So, uh, does this mean...

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
...you're not mad at us, then?

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
Cool.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Hmm... I was
trying to encourage you.

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:28.311 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Oh, it was hard to tell.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
Don't hold back
from your dreams...

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Hmm?

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
I think... I may have
just figured out

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
what I want to do, too.

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
Truth is, there's
somewhere that I want to go.

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
The map-making headquarters.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:46.579 position:50% align:center
The Geospatial Informational
Authority of Japan!

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
I didn't know Inose
was interested in

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
the map-making field, did you?

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
I know it's a change of plans.

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're
all cool with this?

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
No, I don't mind it at all.

00:20:57.382 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
And besides,
how could anyone complain?

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
I mean, just check out
that look on her face.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
Well then. No wonder
if felt so lonesome.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
Miss Endou?
Is something the matter?

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Hmm? Oh.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
There used to be this giant
parabolic antenna over there,

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
but it's gone.

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU gasps]

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey, Teach!

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
We found where
your antenna went!

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
I went from nostalgic to happy.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
In virtually no time at all.

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] We all discovered
a lot at this summer camp.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
Both about ourselves
and our fellow clubmates.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
We learned so much
during our tours, too.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.317 position:50% align:center
And it feels like a new world
has opened up for everyone.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
Before, our goal of discovering
an asteroid felt vague.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
Like something far off
that we couldn't name.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:07.786 position:50% align:center
But just like the little fossil
I found by the river,

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:10.330 position:50% align:center
I'm sure there's one out there.

00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:12.999 position:50% align:center
Somewhere out in space.

00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:48.678 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Next time:
"Everyone's Summer Break."
