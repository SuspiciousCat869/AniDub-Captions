00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:13.179 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
The cleaning's all done!

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's go!
You guys ready?

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.100 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, MAKITA]
Yeah.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.227 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Shoot, I forgot my phone.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.520 position:50% align:center
You two go on ahead!

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Huh? All right!

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.444 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ino.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Good morning!
I'm glad it's sunny!

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:35.618 position:50% align:center
All thanks to your
teruteru bouzu dolls!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Remember,
we're all rooting for you!

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey, Ao!

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
[AO] Good morning, Mira.
Pretty day, huh?

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
Wow. We might get to
realize our dream today!

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
All right, Ao.
Let's find your star!

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.329 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
After a night of observing,

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
day two of the Shiny
Challenge began.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
Today starts with
a study session.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.794 position:50% align:center
Why don't you
read the next page?

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:50.962 position:50% align:center
Go ahead.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:54.424 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Okay. So, here's what it says.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.218 position:50% align:center
"Asteroids are small, solar
system bodies that form

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
when rocks smash
into planetoids"...

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mira. You can do it.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] ..."trans-Neptunian
objects are said

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.728 position:50% align:center
to be ice left over from the
creation of the solar sausage."

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Not sausage!

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
[stomachs growling]

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
[HORIGUCHI laughs]

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
Let's take a little break,
shall we?

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI] Hey, would you listen
to this, you guys?

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50% align:center
It says, "Whereas an asteroid's
reflectance spectrum is derived

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
from ordinary
chondrite in S- types.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
It's derived from carbonaceous
chondrite in C-types.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
What's that even mean?

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.959 position:50% align:center
Basically, when you
analyze an asteroid's light,

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
you can identify its
general composition.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.090 position:50% align:center
Wow. So, you mean,
there are actually different

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
types of asteroids?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.677 position:50% align:center
For example,
the asteroid Hayabusa

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
was launched at was
the S-type, Itokawa.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
Whereas, the one
Hayabusa 2 was launched at

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.809 position:50% align:center
was a carbonaceous C- type.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
The thing is, unlike planetoids,

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
most asteroids out there haven't
gone through thermal evolution.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI] Meaning they're
the same as they were

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
a long time ago?
Kinda like unbaked cookie dough?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
Right! That's why,
if we study the rocks

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
that come from asteroids,
we can trace the history

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
of our solar system.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I see.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] So, people go to space
and bring back rocks, huh? Nice.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a joint project
for astronomers and geologists.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
You're in the
Earth Sciences Club, right?

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
Why did it get split up, anyway?

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Well...

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
It was two different
clubs, originally.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI] Hmm. I guess it's true
that there are a lot of fields

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
lumped into the Earth Sciences.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
Being the science
of the Earth and all.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
 Some people call it
"geological sciences," too.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
"Geoscience" for short.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
Geoscience.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO]
Geoscience Club.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
This should be all
the reading we'll need to do

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
to prep for tomorrow's
presentation.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
All right! I guess
the only thing left to do

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
is hope tonight's
observation goes well!

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
Looks like the
weather's gonna cooperate.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.509 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Thanks, Hanashima, Horiguchi.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
Take good care of them, okay?

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
[HORIGUCHI, HANASHIMA]
Sure.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
Well, good luck, you guys!

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
Don't forget. Have fun, too!

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Thanks!

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
Okay, now we'll
start photographing.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
This'll take
a little time, though.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
So, why don't you all
go outside and take a look

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
at the stars while it's running?

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Can we?

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
s Of course.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
[HORIGUCHI] There aren't
many clouds out today,

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
so you should have
a great view of the sky.

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
We still have some of
last night's candy left, huh?

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.621 position:50% align:center
Yep, a lot!

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Let's bring drinks, too!

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
[AO]
I need my camera.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Look at that! The Milky Way!

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
[AO] It's my first time
seeing it this clearly.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mars is amazing!

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA] Yeah, it's in
close approach this year, too.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
It's around negative two
or negative five right now.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Hey, a shooting star!

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
Ao, look!

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
So, after this is over,
it's straight to

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
entrance exams for you.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
I am taking them
this year so I can get started

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
on summer courses.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
And what about you two?

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI] What will you do
after you discover an asteroid?

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA] Do you think you might
try to become researchers

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
like Hanashima?

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
Our teacher asked us
the same thing once before.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
But I guess I still
don't know yet.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
All I really care about
is getting to discover

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
an asteroid and name it Ao.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
If we're able to
make that dream come true,

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
then maybe I'll finally be
ready to focus on finding

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
a new dream to take its place.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
[AO chuckles]

00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.961 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I get it.

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
You're taking it
all one day at a time!

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
That's great.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50% align:center
That doesn't surprise me.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
You both do seem
to live in the present.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.095 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO]
Yeah.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
We'll do our best to find one.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
It would feel really
good to help you two

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
achieve your dream, after all!

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
Totally agree!

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO] We've done it.
We've finally made it this far!

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA] All right, the first
round of photographs is done.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
And let's do our best to
cover yesterday's share, too.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Right!

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
There are even more
stars than last night.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Yeah.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:43.380 position:50% align:center
[AO] Aw... Doesn't look like
there are any new ones.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.173 position:50% align:center
Send me the data, too, would ya?

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.008 position:50% align:center
I'll do a quick double-check.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA]
How about this region, here?

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Nope, nothing.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I can only see known ones here.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.249 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
Conditions aren't bad tonight,

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.835 position:50% align:center
so it all depends on
your luck and tenacity.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Luck, huh?

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
Asteroids are always rotating.
And so many are misshapen.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
So, they can suddenly
appear to be brighter

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
depending on the angle.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
Mira! Look, there!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
It's moving!

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA gasps]
Which one?

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
That one.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
The image is unclear,
so the auto-discovery program

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
isn't reading it.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
There's also a chance
that it could just

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
be noise, too, right?

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
[HORIGUCHI] Hanashima, just to
be sure, could you try updating

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
our database of
known astrological objects?

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
Right, yeah.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ao.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
Okay, then, what would you like?

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
Shall we photograph
the same region once more

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
just to confirm?
Or maybe aim for another region?

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
It's 30 minutes
to photograph one region.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.049 position:50% align:center
And we need time to put
together our presentation

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.508 position:50% align:center
for tomorrow, so...

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
We only have time for one more.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
If you need time to work.

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
Then I vote that we photograph
the same region again.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.101 position:50% align:center
We should place our bets
on the highest probability.

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.644 position:50% align:center
I agree!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
Okay. Thank you!

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
Same region, please!

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.197 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
You've got it.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Okay. Initial processing
of the data is done!

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
It's the moment of truth!

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]
Hey, let's push it together!

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA]
Kinda feels like a sports team.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
What's wrong with that?

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
Spirits up!

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
One, two...

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
It's a known object.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
Sorry, that's a shame.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Still, now I know
it's actually within reach.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
We can find an asteroid.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
It's just a matter of
not giving up till we do!

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm-hmm.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI groans]
Presenting our results when we

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
haven't found anything
feels so lame.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center
I know, but we
still need to do the work.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's important
to write your report.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
Even if it didn't produce
the results you hoped for.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Huh?

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.095 position:50% align:center
[HANASHIMA]
The record of your experience is

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:40.557 position:50% align:center
precious information for
anyone observing after you.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA gasp]

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
You know. The same way
you all referenced

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
past research documentation
for this project.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
That's right!
Thank you, all who came before!

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
Kind of exciting, isn't it?

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I think this works
for our explanation

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
of the telescope.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I agree.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
Oh, I actually have
a picture of the Murikabushi.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
That would be great!

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
It'll be easier to
understand with pictures!

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
Aocchi, can I
borrow your camera?

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.550 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
Mira, let's write the pages on

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
the observation procedure
while she's doing that.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a plan to me!

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
Let's use pictures
of stars, too.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.934 position:50% align:center
That's a good idea.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
[HORIGUCHI, HANASHIMA]
Hmm.

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
The summary pages
are all finished!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:40.241 position:50% align:center
Wow. Morning, already.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
All these memos and
photos you took throughout

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
the process were
such a big help, Ao.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
I felt bad for butting in
when I was just an observer.

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
Although... I had
so much fun last night!

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA] In that case,
maybe we can shift the subject

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
and have a private convo
about your people skills.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
How about that?

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
Only a few hours
until the presentation.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Naptime.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
So, in the end,

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
neither of the groups
were able to discover

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
a new astronomical object.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
However, I don't
consider this experience

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
to have been a waste.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
As Hanashima told us,

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
"This will become precious
information for the others

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
observing after you."
And I think that's pretty cool.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
We'll make use
of these first results.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
And then, one day, I'm sure
we'll discover a new object!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, TOMORI, MAKITA]
Thank you all very much!

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:48.935 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA giggle]

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
[AO] Thanks so much for
letting me sit in and watch.

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yeah, thank you for everything!

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
So tell me, how was
the Shiny Challenge for you?

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
Amazing! I'm glad I came.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
It's inspired me
to study even more!

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna discover
an asteroid someday.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
This is the start.
What I learned here.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
I know it.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
I'm really looking
forward to that.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
Come back and see us.

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
--All right!
--Yes!

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA] If I end up getting
accepted to a university

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
near you, I'll visit!

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Okay.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
Oh, I want in on this!

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
I'll come see you guys once I
save enough to come back down!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
For Neon's tour!

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.770 position:50% align:center
Hey. Please say I can
stay with you when I do.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.563 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course!

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.857 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI] Oh, right!
I want us to take a picture!

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA] Great idea!
Where should we take it?

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
Taking a photo? In that case...

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
There's only one place.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU chuckles]

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh...?

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
I'm ready whenever you are!

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
One, two...

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] And that was
the final button on our

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
Shining Star
Challenge experience.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
It went by so fast.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah. But I had a lot of fun.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I'm glad we got
to meet Tomorin and Makki.

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
It was so cool
getting to work with

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
a whole bunch of people.
From all different fields.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
Y'know, in a way, itt's like
the Earth Science Club.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
With both astronomy and geology,
and now, meteorology, too.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
[MISA] How did it go
on Ishigaki Island?

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Awesome! It was so much fun.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
[MISA] Oh, good.
That's really great to hear.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I got to hang out
and chat with new friends

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
under the most
perfect starry sky.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
Oh, and we stayed up all night
preparing for the presentation!

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a great experience.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles]

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] When do you think
you'll be coming home next?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
Good to have you back!

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
Both of you!

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah, welcome back!

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Thanks, you guys!

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
Now, listen, you two.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking of running
a special feature.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
First issue after break: The
Shining Star Challenge and you.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Are you serious?

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
So, I hope you'll
be willing to give us

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
an interview soon!

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
An interview...?

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
Hey, you guys.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
How is everyone doing?

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
It's Suzu and Megu!

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
Wow, long time no see!

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
Right? It really
has been forever!

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
I brought you some of Suzuya's
delicious breads and sweets.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.358 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. You already
have a bunch, huh?

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] They're souvenirs
from Mira and Ao.

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
Looks like this
is snack-overkill.

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Not possible.
We love Suzuya's bread!

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
I've been dreaming
about it forever!

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.078 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
I've missed you!

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:54.496 position:50% align:center
Um, hi.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
[MORINO chuckles]

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Thanks for the snacks!

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
Big Sis, I need to
head back to my club now.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
I'll see ya later.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.549 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Oh, this is for you, Megu.

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
Is it star sand?

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50% align:center
Look how cute!
Both stars and sand.

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
Just like the
Earth Sciences Club!

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
Well, actually.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
Those are the shells of a
creature known as Foraminifera!

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.854 position:50% align:center
Yeah. The older ones
are index fossils.

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
A.K.A, facies fossils.

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
They're used to determine
the geological period

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
and the environment of the time.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Megu, it's okay,
you can go on without me.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
Okay, thanks again
for the souvenir, guys!

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
See you all later!

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
This is still incredible stuff!

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you collected
this much in just three days!

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Yeah, it was
a little challenging.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
But we had Ao
helping us out, too!

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Um.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh? Y'okay?

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
Thanks for helping me do this.

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have made it
to Ishigaki Island

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
without you guys.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
I'm certain of that.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.019 position:50% align:center
I never could have
gone on my own.

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
We wanted you
both to go. Together.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Everyone was here,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
cheering you on during
our entire summer camp.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks so much for
the teruteru bouzu dolls, too!

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.491 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] We can't take all the
credit--that was Nana's idea.

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
Wow, really?
Thank you for that, Nana!

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
They helped us a lot!

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
But it's not really a big deal.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I've
uploaded the photos.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
[INOSE gasps]
I can't wait to see!

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Me, neither!

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
Oh, gosh! So pretty!

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
No kidding. I kinda wish
I could've seen it in person!

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
Looks like fun.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
These two girls
are Tomorin and Makki.

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
We were in the
same group together.

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
Tell us more about that!

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.527 position:50% align:center
From the beginning!

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, it's from Tomorin!

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI]
Yoo-hoo!

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
Guess what?

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
I got to meet Neon in person
at the Star Festival!

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Wow! Good for you, Tomorin!

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
[TOMORI] I was so happy,
my memory's missing in places.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
[AO]
What?

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:06.002 position:50% align:center
[MAKITA]
Sounds like temporary amnesia

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
caused by extreme stress.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Hey. Why don't
we all go stargazing

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
together since
it's been so long?

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
I already got
permission for you.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
You did?

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
How long have
you been standing there?

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
Thank you! You're the best!

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
Ah, so she wasn't
just the barbeque pit master.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
I am your advisor, you know.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
We do get a much better
view from the roof, don't we?

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
Incredible!

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
I've got it
all lined up! On Jupiter!

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.795 position:50% align:center
Thank you.
You're an expert at that now!

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles]

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
Can I take a look?

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Go ahead!

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
It's striped.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
[AO] Yeah. And tonight,
you can see four of its moons.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
Nana. Could I have a turn next?

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
[CHIKAGE]
It is striped.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
[AO chuckles]

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.482 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
Hey, Mira. Ao?

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Um... I...

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
I'm just sorry that this time,

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
you weren't able to
discover an asteroid.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
But, look. Please keep trying!

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
Hah! Okay! We plan to!

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
Look at that.
Nana's smiling a lot more

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
than she used to.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
What was it like?

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Now that you mention it...

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You're so right!

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:35.800 position:50% align:center
And Chikage.

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
She's taken an interest
in astronomy lately.

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
Oh, has she, really?

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
That's the same way
it happened for us, too.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
Spending so much time around
both Sakurai and Ino.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
Our interest in geology
just naturally grew.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
So much has happened!

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Everyone has
certain things we love

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
and certain things
we're good at.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
If we isolate ourselves,
that limits our experiences.

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
But if we connect our
little world to others,

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
then the possibilities
are endless!

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
Just like the great unknown.

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
The cosmos.

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ao. Let's discover one.

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.373 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
We're gonna find it.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.249 position:50% align:center
[AO]
And it's gonna be amazing.

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:17.379 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
We'll fulfill our promise.

00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:18.880 position:50% align:center
Together.
