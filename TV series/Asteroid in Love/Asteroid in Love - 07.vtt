00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:12.971 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] The day that Monroe
and Sakurai gave us

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:15.974 position:50% align:center
the super-surprising news
that shocked us all

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
we had a good talk with Ino, who
was now our new club president!

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
I became the vice
president, which is awesome.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
And Ao is our new treasurer!

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
Our lives at Hoshizaki
High School seemed like

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
they were back to normal.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
Except this one thing
that happened several days ago.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
Coming!

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.956 position:50% align:center
[USAMI gasps]
Student Council President?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.332 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hi. I was
wondering who wrote

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.918 position:50% align:center
--this article on the koi?
--[gasps]

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
That was actually me.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Turns out, my sister
was the one who named the koi

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.633 position:50% align:center
in the inner garden! Who knew?

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.385 position:50% align:center
Thanks to her,
word of the article

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
spread around campus
like wildfire.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
And their latest issue
sold out in a flash!

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
Eve was basically
beside herself with joy.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.229 position:50% align:center
I think we've
gotten it pretty clean now.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center
Hey-o! Suzu's arrived!

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh! Hey there, Suzu.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:09.652 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Here you go.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
It's the invoice for
the cultural festival.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.073 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Thanks.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Aw, I'm so happy to see
you're doing better now, Suzu!

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.286 position:50% align:center
Please, as the mascot
of the Suzuya Bakery,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.121 position:50% align:center
I obviously couldn't
let a little thing like that

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
keep me down!

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Unfortunately,
the pancakes Suzu entered

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.878 position:50% align:center
for our club got second place
in the cultural festival's

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50% align:center
food stall contest.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center
I mean, of course
losing was kind of a shock,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.721 position:50% align:center
but I'm good. I don't have time
to let it get to me.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:40.517 position:50% align:center
Right, um, Suzu?
This is over our budget.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.478 position:50% align:center
From now on, I'll be
going on the offensive, yo!

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.313 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Suzu's pretty
obsessed with defeating

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.023 position:50% align:center
the manga club, now.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.317 position:50% align:center
At this point, the only ones
who hadn't gone back

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:50.860 position:50% align:center
to life as usual were...

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
What's up, everyone?

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
Hey, Monroe and Sakurai!
How are ya?

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:58.076 position:50% align:center
Good! We're just here to pick up
the books we left behind.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.577 position:50% align:center
I know you haven't
been messing with

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.288 position:50% align:center
any of my stuff now, have you?

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.332 position:50% align:center
Sakurai, why...?

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.670 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Look, I'm really
sorry for suddenly leaving

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.214 position:50% align:center
the presidency to you,
but don't let it stress

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.382 position:50% align:center
you out like this.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.467 position:50% align:center
[INOSE whimpers]

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
It's just that I'm not
very good at this kind of thing.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.348 position:50% align:center
Let's face it, I can
barely take care of myself!

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.142 position:50% align:center
Inose, if you're overwhelmed,

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.519 position:50% align:center
try to think of the job
from a different perspective.

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:25.729 position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.605 position:50% align:center
When you're president,
then you'll get used to

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.233 position:50% align:center
everyone else
as little extensions of you!

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.569 position:50% align:center
I'm very disturbed
that you said it like that.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone!

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.823 position:50% align:center
Hey, Teach!
Something you need us to do?

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.408 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Take a look.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.910 position:50% align:center
We just got this request from
the neighborhood kids' group.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.080 position:50% align:center
They want to learn about
astronomical observation?

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.499 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Some folks who saw your
exhibit at the cultural festival

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
reached out to us.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
Of course, you don't have to
accept if it's too last-minute.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.130 position:50% align:center
Any thoughts?

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.465 position:50% align:center
[INOSE whimpers]

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I say yes!
I really think we should do it!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Huh?

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Oh. Wait, hold on.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
Sakurai and I have mock exams
that day, so we can't be there!

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] That's okay! We can do
it with just the three of us!

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.019 position:50% align:center
--Right?!
--Wait, come over here.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
What? Why?

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
[AO] I don't think
we should host anything

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
till Ino's more comfortable.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] No, I think that's
why we should do it!

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
Don't you see?

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
We can take more of a lead
at an astronomy event.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
So if it goes well...

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.825 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] I see. If it's
a big hit, that might build

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
Inose's confidence
as club president, right?

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Right! Wait.

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
Suzu, were you planning
to come with us?

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] I'm on the offensive,
and I'm in it to win it!

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
So, duh, bring on
that night marketing!

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.633 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Right. Well...
Then, I guess we'll accept.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
[MIRA giggles]

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.887 position:50% align:center
Look at our
new club, taking action!

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
Go, us!

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
[INOSE sighs]

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
[AO] Considering the
height of most kids,

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:23.114 position:50% align:center
we won't even need
to extend this tripod.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.784 position:50% align:center
Hey, will this
work for the eyepiece?

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
Well, it looks like
south is that way.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
So maybe over here?

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I'm so sorry. I hate
that I can't be more help.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
That's not true!

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
On the contrary, you have
the very important job

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
of taking photos
for our newsletter!

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. I do, don't I?

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
Well, here we go!

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Hey there! Are you guys
just about finished setting up?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
The kids will be
here any time now!

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're all set!

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
Aw. I'm so nervous!

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
--[CHILDREN murmuring]
--That's what I said! But--

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
So. It's nice to meet you.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
We're the high school's
Earth Sciences Club.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.622 position:50% align:center
And, uh...

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.666 position:50% align:center
Tonight, we'll be
using a telescope so we can

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.209 position:50% align:center
all look up at the stars!

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 7A]
I'm excited, though!

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
[BOY 7A]
You won't get away with this!

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
Wow, they're
not listening at all.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50% align:center
Attention, everyone!

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
We're about to talk
about something

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.761 position:50% align:center
really cool and important!

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
Where's the potty?

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
Yikes! Let's go!

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
Um, does anyone
else need to go potty?

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
[BOY 7C]
Ha! You missed! Yeah!

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 7D] Ow! Hiro just
stepped on my foot!

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
[INOSE whimpers]

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Sorry for the wait!

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.900 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, hey! You guys made it!

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] All right, give me
your attention, please!

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
We have special
star cookies for you!

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
If you'll pay attention to
what these people have to say,

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
you can eat these
while you listen!

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
Ahh...

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
[Okay! Go for it!

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
Wow, thanks so much!

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
That was awesome!

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
So, today, we're going
to start by looking at

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
this planet through
the telescope.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's Saturn! Right?

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Bingo!

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
As you may know,
Saturn is another planet

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
that orbits around
the Sun, just like Earth.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
This represents the Earth.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 7A]
It's so tiny!

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
That's how much
bigger Saturn is.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
[AO] Saturn is roughly
the size of nine of our Earths.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.275 position:50% align:center
As you can see, here, it's
surrounded by these big,

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
hula-hoop-looking rings
of ice and rock.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
[BOY 7B]
I'm good at hula hooping!

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 7D]
Me, too!

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 7C]
Where's Saturn?

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Who else here wants to see it?

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Me!

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Great! Then why
don't we all take a look?

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
Look right through there.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
The telescope moves easily,
so try not to touch that spot.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
[BOY 7A]
Jeez, it's tiny.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
Are you sure it's bigger
than Earth, or not really?

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
[MIRA chuckles]
Yes, it's true!

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
But did you know that
inside, it's all empty?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
It's even said that it
could float on water!

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
--[GIRL 7A] I want to see that!
--[BOY 7B] Me, too!

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course, one at a time!

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
I think they're
really getting into it now!

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it looks like
they're having fun.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Okay, then! Who's up next?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.907 position:50% align:center
Well? Did you
get a good look at Saturn?

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] Yep. Looked the same
as it did in my field guide.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
So what's next?

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, right! Let's see...

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER 7A]
Teacher. Care for some tea?

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
Oh! Thank you so much!

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Take a look at M-31.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
The galaxy within the
Andromeda constellation.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
See, a galaxy is a
cluster of many different stars.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
Which becomes clear when
you look through a telescope!

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 7A gasps]

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:38.143 position:50% align:center
Take a look. It's different
from the last one.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:40.937 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's just
some fog. I dunno.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] There's one girl
here who's proving to be

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.902 position:50% align:center
a bit of a challenge.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh...

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
[AO] Now, let's try looking
for stars you can see

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
with your own eyes.
For instance, that's Vega.

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
That star is Altair,
and that one's Deneb.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
The three of them together
form a constellation.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
It's known as
the Summer Triangle.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
Wow. So, you can
see the summer stars

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
in the fall, too?

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
I think I found the triangle!

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 7A]
No way! Where is it?

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
[AO] In the fall, there's also
the Square of Pegasus.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Well, it's not like
we can expect it to be

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
everybody's new
favorite thing, right?

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
Yeah...

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center
Lady, look! I found it!

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:24.189 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Hey, um... Not into it?

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
The stargazing?

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
Is it--Haruka?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA sighs] I didn't want
to come in the first place.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
There's no one here
I get along with.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
But my mom told me
that I didn't have a choice.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Oh...

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.959 position:50% align:center
Why do you think it's so fun
to look at the stars, anyway?

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
They're all just a bunch
of shiny dots that all look

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
exactly the same to me.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
[AO] Yeah, they're pretty
much shiny dots in the sky.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
But look. Do you
see how those stars

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
form a big "W" when
you look at them together?

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
That's the constellation
Cassiopeia.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Oh.

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
[AO] And a spectral analysis
of the light from a star.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
It can tell you the surface
temperature and elements!

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
Studying stars gives us an idea
of what the universe was like

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
in the distant past.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm not
the best at explaining this!

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
The universe
of the distant past?

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, yeah.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
It actually takes the light
from a star a long time

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
to travel to Earth.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
For example, our current view of
Saturn is the way it looked

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
80 minutes ago.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
The Andromeda Galaxy
is even farther away,

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
so what we see now is
really how it appeared

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
2.3 million years ago!

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
Then, what happens
if you look at a star

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.265 position:50% align:center
that's even further
away than that?

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
Good question!

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
You might see how the universe
looked at the very beginning.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
They're shiny dots in the sky.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
But seeing them off
in the distance,

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
it's kind of like
using a time machine!

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
Don't you think that's
pretty incredible?

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
In fact, there are
people studying them

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
for just that reason.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.409 position:50% align:center
Would you excuse me?

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
Now that I know that,
I wanna look at that fog again.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Wow, this is what it looked like

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
millions of years ago?

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
[BOY 7B]
Hey, teacher, look at that!

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
It's a weird shooting star!

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
It's a what?

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's actually a satellite.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
[BOY 7B]
Ooh, a satellite! Cool!

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can only
see it because it reflects

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center
the light of the sun.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
You'll notice lots of them
when stargazing.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
--Cool, huh?
--[KIDS gasping]

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
Oh, right!

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
I totally forgot
tonight's the best night

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
to be able to see the Orionids!

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
So, you'll be likely
to see shooting stars

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
till tomorrow morning.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
Keep your eye on the sky!

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Here's our landmark, Orion.

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:41.910 position:50% align:center
It looks like this.

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
They'll fly off in all
directions from here.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
[KIDS gasping]

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Look at those smiling faces.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
They're the best.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Yes, they really are.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] There's no rush
on any of this, you know.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
Take your time. Even have
some fun along the way.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
Work towards being the kind of
club president only you can be.

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
Pretty exciting, right? I...

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center
Well, then. I think
now it's about time

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
for me to start really
pursuing my dream.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.487 position:50% align:center
Wait. Do I know
about this dream?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
Huh? I never told you?

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
My big dream is to turn
Suzuya into the very best bakery

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
in the whole world, of course!

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
I want to open cafés on every
single continent so everyone

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
can enjoy our bread and goodies!

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
Wow, you've got
a pretty lofty dream, there.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Yep, so, starting now,
I'm going to be

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center
a one-woman marketing machine!

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
Good evening.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello!

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
I thought I recognized
your face, Moe-Moe!

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Thanks for visiting
the store so often!

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
[MEGU]
She's so amazing.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
I hope to be like her one day
after I get into high school.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Amazing work, you guys.

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
I heard the kids loved it!

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
I guess the viewing party
was a big success, huh?

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:57.861 position:50% align:center
No, I failed, Sakurai!

00:12:57.944 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Huh?!

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Oh, they're all blurry.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
[wails]

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
There's Orion! Right there!

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.046 position:50% align:center
[AO]
They're shiny dots in the sky.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
But seeing them off
in the distance,

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
it's kind of like using
a time machine!

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Ao, do you have a second?

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, another one just passed!

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
Didja see it?

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah...

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
Hey, if we could
really travel through time,

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
what do you think we'd
all be like way off

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.154 position:50% align:center
in the distant future?

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
I really hope that by
then, you and I will have

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
discovered an asteroid.

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah, me, too...

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
Ao! Let's eat lunch!

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
Oh. She's not here.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
Manaka actually
isn't in class today.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
--[MIRA] Huh?
--[SUZU] Really? I wonder why.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
I don't know,
the teacher just said

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
that she wasn't feeling well.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
What in the world?

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.685 position:50% align:center
She was totally fine when
I saw her last night,

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
and now she's suddenly
absent and sick?!

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
Can you at least try and
calm down before you yell at me?

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] You think it's your fault
she's not feeling well?

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.653 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?
I don't get it.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
Because instead of sleeping,

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
we were watching the Orionids
together on the phone all night.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Hmm...

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
Okay, but you
were up all night, too,

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
and you seem perfectly fine.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] That's because I was
all bundled up in bed.

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Well, looks like your
laziness paid off, I guess.

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
Um... Hey, Mira.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
If you want to, why don't we all
go visit her after school today?

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
Visit her?

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:44.634 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I mean,
as the club president,

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty worried
about her, also!

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
Because if you really
do think that you're

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
the reason she got sick,

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
it's partially
my fault for not managing

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
our extracurricular
activities better!

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center
So, I think I need
to go apologize.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
Our first joint task...

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
As the president
and the vice president!

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
Stop, slow down!

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
The point of visiting a person
when they're sick is to

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
make them feel better, right?

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
How do you think she's gonna
feel if two of her friends

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
mope in all guilty?

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
You have a point.

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center
I need to go home
to help out, but hold on.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
I'll give you
some advice instead!

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
--[phones vibrating]
--[BOTH gasp]

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
"A hundred sweet pick-up
lines that women will love?"

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
You're welcome!

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
Try it. Trust me.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Hi there, welcome.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
Please, come on in.

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
Good evening!

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
Pardon us, but...
is Ao feeling any better today?

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] Oh, she's fine.
It's just a cold.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.644 position:50% align:center
The long bath may
not have been a good idea.

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry you were worried!

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Thank goodness.
You look better than I expected!

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
[AO] Yeah, I think it's helped
that I've rested all day.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Here. We stopped at Suzu's place

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.824 position:50% align:center
and got you some pudding.

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
Wow. Thanks,
that sounds really good!

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Also, uh...

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
"You are my sun and moon.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
I-I really want you
to get better soon.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
So you can light up
my heart all over again!"

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Suzu is a big, fat liar!

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
--[AO] Mm! [giggles]
--[INOSE] I see.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
So, in terms of effectiveness,
desserts are actually

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.767 position:50% align:center
a whole lot better
than pick-up lines.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
What're you writing?
What's that?

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's a memo
book Suzu gave me.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
She asked if I would mind taking
notes on anything

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
interesting that might
happen during our visit.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center
It's an important duty!

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Confiscating.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
You know, you really
surprised me

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
after how well you
were doing yesterday.

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center
I got so worried that you're
sick because of our phone call!

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
No! I've always handled
cold temperatures well.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] That reminds me, your
mom just mentioned something

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
about you taking a long bath.

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Were you having
a deep think about something?

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh... Yeah.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
I was actually thinking
about this book.

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
Wait, is that...
the asteroid book

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center
you mentioned earlier?

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.223 position:50% align:center
[AO] Yup. It's an older book
I found online a while back.

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] It's personal
experiences of those

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
who discovered asteroids?

00:16:58.935 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
Is it a rare book?

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
Did you have
a hard time finding it?

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
Sort of.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
There are plenty of books
out there that do a great job

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
of introducing the asteroids,
but there are

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
hardly any that talk

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
about the process
of discovering one.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
Ao. Is it okay if I borrow this?

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
[AO] Yeah, I was planning
to lend it to you anyway.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
Yay, thanks!

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
Wow. You guys,
this person discovered

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
over 800 asteroids!

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
[AO chuckles]

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
Sorry we're the ones
having all the fun

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
when we're supposedly
here to check up on you!

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
No, it's okay.

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
I'm having fun, too.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
As long as you're sure.

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:33.386 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh?

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
I'm sure.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
My fever's down now, so I should
be back at school tomorrow.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.893 position:50% align:center
That's good to hear!

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
We'll see you tomorrow, I guess!

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Thanks again.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Look! Our girl,
Ao, is all better now!

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, Mira kept crying,
so it was almost impossible

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
to get anything done!

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
Hey, Suzu!
That advice yesterday...

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
It was a load
of crap, wasn't it?

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
Now I know you were
just messing with me!

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
Well, you're just
such an easy target!

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
--[AO chuckles]
--[INOSE] Hey, Ao?

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I know we're not all
that reliable, but I promise,

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
we're gonna do our best as
president and vice president.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
So, if you ever need anything,
I hope you'll let us know.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:26.981 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
Seriously! It was the worst!

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
I get it, okay? Let go!

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
What's all the fuss about today?

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center
[INOSE gasps]
Hi, Monroe!

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] I was wondering if the
photos from the viewing party

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
might have been blurry because
of the shutter speed.

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
I wanted to take
them without the flash,

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
but I guess I
adjusted it too much.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
I even tried taking
some more after

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.129 position:50% align:center
resetting some things, but...

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
They're still blurry.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you doing the thing
where you only half-press

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
the button first?

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:55.635 position:50% align:center
Half-press?

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
Watch this.
First, you have to press

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
the shutter button down
halfway to focus.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
Got it!
I'll give it a try again.

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
There!

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think there's
more than one reason

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
it didn't work.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Can't I just take
them with my smartphone?

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
Of course you can!

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it really is better to
stick with what you know rather

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
than forcing yourself to
try something brand new.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Hey, guess what?
I got the recommendation!

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
If it comes down to it,
there's retouch software.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Ooh...

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
Look, I don't know
what you two are talking about,

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
but it seems obvious
that you're messing

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
with me right now.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
So, you got the slot?

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess
the notice just got

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
to my house today so my mom
sent me a text letting me know.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] That's amazing!
Congratulations, Sakurai!

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
[MIRA, AO]
Congratulations!

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI chuckles]

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy for you, Sakura!

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
Hey, thanks!

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
You should be getting yours
soon, too, if I got mine!

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Mm-hmm!
I'm sure it's there!

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] We both applied
for a recommendation

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
for the same university.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
We'll have totally
different majors, though.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
We decided to
keep quiet about it and wait

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
until the exams were over
because we didn't want

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
you guys to have to
worry about it, too!

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
Hey! What're you doing?

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
Quit talking about random stuff
and get yourself home

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
to check for your letter, too!

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
Okay. I promise
to text when I find out!

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
See you guys tomorrow!

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] But the text
from Monroe never came.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Not even by the next day,
which seemed weird.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Man. This is nuts.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Mira? It's almost time
for homeroom to start!

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh? Inose?

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
Hi. Hi, Ao!

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
Looks like she hasn't
gotten to her classroom yet.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
Great, I'm getting
even more worried, now.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:40.240 position:50% align:center
[MORINO whining, groaning]

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] See, this is why
we didn't tell you guys

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.662 position:50% align:center
about the exams in
the first place.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS groaning]

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] We couldn't stand
the idea of watching you get

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
all worried and flustered
over us like this.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
But, of course we--

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Nope, no buts!

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
There are still more exams to
take, so you better make sure

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
you don't let Monroe see
you looking like that!

00:20:57.507 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
So, look.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.469 position:50% align:center
When it comes down to it,
there's not much we can do

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
to help her with this, anyway.

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
So instead, focus on
keeping a handle on yourselves!

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Yes...

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Good!

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Though I admit.

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
I might've gotten a little
carried away yesterday, too.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ao! What if we try organizing

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
all the info we have
on asteroids so far?

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:23.950 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Uh, sure.

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Let's see, what should
I be doing right now?

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.255 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Earth Science Olympiad?

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:38.340 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
I'm taking my very first step.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be an independent
club president!

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Sometimes it
really is better to stick with

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
what you know rather than
forcing yourself to try

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
something brand new.

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] They're being kind
to make me feel better.

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
I can't listen!

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Miss Endou, you here?

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.900 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Uh. Inose, what's going on?

00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Um. Do you think
we still have enough time

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
to apply for this
Earth Sciences competition?

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Well, let's see.

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Sometimes, you just
have to keep moving forward.

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
Because even if some things
don't go the way we hope,

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:11.748 position:50% align:center
we can have faith that
a wonderful future's

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.834 position:50% align:center
waiting for us.
It has to be!

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:48.803 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Next time:
"Winter Diamond."
