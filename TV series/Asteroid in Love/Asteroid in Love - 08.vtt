Inose entered the Earth
Science Olympiad by herself?

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.808 position:50% align:center
[AO]
She did.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.227 position:50% align:center
And apparently, the preliminary
tests are this Sunday.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Wow. I'm kinda surprised.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
She's not one to
take on big challenges.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.319 position:50% align:center
I wish I could have
participated, too!

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
And they only
hold it every four years,

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
so I'll just have to wait!

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
I wonder what kind of
sporting events are even

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
in an Earth Science Olympiad.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.080 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Sporting events?

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
It's not for sports.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
But, it's called an Olympiad,
so I assumed it was sports.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
You know what
they say about assuming,

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
here take a look at this.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:49.883 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
Ooh...

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] The Earth Science
Olympiad is a world-wide,

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center
earth sciences competition
held annually

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
for middle and
high school students.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.101 position:50% align:center
The preliminary competitions
are held domestically.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
And select winners represent
their nations internationally.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
How do you know
so much about it, Sakura?!

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
My little sister's
participating, too.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.695 position:50% align:center
Your sister?

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:13.239 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you even
had a little sister, Sakura!

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:14.574 position:50% align:center
She's in ninth grade.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:17.035 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] She's in her
last year of middle school?

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
She hopes to make it
through the domestic rounds.

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:22.374 position:50% align:center
And go to the international
competition in Thailand.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
Thailand.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
[AO] Mira, don't get
ahead of yourself.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50% align:center
Anyway, Inose doing
this seems out of the blue.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.509 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Here's how she got the idea.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.803 position:50% align:center
From our summer camp pics.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Oh, cool.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:39.182 position:50% align:center
That's a display from
the Geological Museum.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.934 position:50% align:center
We're such a tiny club, ya know?

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
I just assumed stuff like this
was out of our grasp,

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:44.771 position:50% align:center
but I guess I was wrong.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:47.232 position:50% align:center
She's chasing her
dreams--good for her.

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:50.735 position:50% align:center
Yes, Mira?

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
Aw, Sakura.
I love your face so much!

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.866 position:50% align:center
It looks so freaking
sweet right now!

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
What's that supposed to mean?!

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.786 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying, it's sweet!

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.496 position:50% align:center
--So what?!
--[MIRA screams]

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Oh, wow.

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
I guess there used to be
a river here a long time ago!

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I can come back
and explore after the test.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Because, right now,
I'm representing my club.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
I have to stay focused!
And strong!

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Gosh. I'm so anxious.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
There are a lot more
participants than I imagined.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
And they're all people from
schools I don't know, too.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
[RIO]
Howdy there, neighbor!

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
Good luck today!

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center

[STUDENTS gasping]

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
[INOSE, RIO]
Sorry 'bout that.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
[RIO giggles] Hey, you're
funny, you know that?

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.300 position:50% align:center
My name is Saeki.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
I'm Inose.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to be rude,
but you seem super nervous.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
Is it your first time?

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
Sure is.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
And I'm pretty sure I'm the only
person here from my school.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
 Also... I don't
like the thought

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
that everyone in here
is competition.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
Makes me feel alone.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
Competition?

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
I understand!

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
[RIO] Not to brag but, I made it
to the main event last year.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
And, don't get me wrong,
I have no intention

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
of falling behind
the others this time.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
But, once you start talking
to people, you'll realize

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
they're all just kids who
love the earth sciences

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
just as much as we do!

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
Plus, several colleges
will consider your results here

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
for admission, so some
people are participating

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
for that reason alone.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
Huh? Is that really a thing?

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
It's listed in
the application guidelines.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
Oh. Oh, that's right.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I probably shouldn't
tell Monroe about that part.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
Oh! Looks like
it's about that time!

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
Well, I wish you luck.
And have fun!

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center

Good morning. Welcome, everyone!

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
We'll be handing out
your test sheets now.

Saeki's incredible.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
She made it to
the main competition!

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she's super smart.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
I bet she's going to fly
right through the exam!

Now, participants, please begin!

that's spotted its prey!

[gasps]
Focus, focus.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.141 position:50% align:center
I should tackle the
geology problems first.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
How to read a clinometer,

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
the law of superposition,
index fossils.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
At least these
problems are fun to solve!

00:05:57.232 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
There's a geologic map
and volcanoes and magma!

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Meteorology.

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
Oceanology.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
Environmental science.
Those are my worst subjects!

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
I've studied all
of them a little bit.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
But I don't know exactly
how these things work,

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
so I don't think I solved
those problems right!

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
That just leaves... astronomy.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
Questions about the planets.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
Huh? These are easier
for me than I thought!

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] It's because those
two are always talking

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
in the club room!

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
As of now,
you have ten minutes left.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
What do I do?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.901 position:50% align:center
There's just one question
left that I don't understand.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center

early are starting to clear out!

You okay?

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I feel like I just
released all the data

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.814 position:50% align:center

I decided to do this!

There were a lot
of feelings I felt

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center

time coming here!

now that the world is

I ever imagined!

saying that she's short.

to go see on my way home.

No.

was made by filling in a river!

got your results back?

myself, and it was a disaster!

So, then... Why do
you seem so happy?

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
Well! Because I learned
there are a lot more kids

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.915 position:50% align:center
like us around the world,
and that's awesome!

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
Like us?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
Yep. Wanna see pictures?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
Do you even have to ask?

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Wow...

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
She took a big risk,
and went for something

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
even bigger than the
two of us ever did!

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Hmm. I know.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.928 position:50% align:center
You going home?

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Yeah. I feel much
better after seeing you guys.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center
And I'm inspired to give
my big goal another shot!

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.978 position:50% align:center
Well, best of luck!

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center
--[MIRA] Oh, is that Saeki?
--[INOSE] Yeah!

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
We took this to commemorate our
adventure on the way home!

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Well, it's clear
as day, good job!

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that's probably
because Saeki took it

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.240 position:50% align:center
instead of me.
Next one's mine.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah...

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ta-da!

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
The "big surprise"
was a hot plate?

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.757 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Yes. Since Miss Endou
told us we weren't allowed

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
to have a portable
stove in here,

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
we borrowed this
hot plate from Miss Araya!

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Should we start
getting things set up?

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yeah!

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelp]

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
The culture clubs all
share a breaker, you know!

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
Be considerate.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
What's that? A hotpot?

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Um, it's for
our Christmas Party!

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Would you two like
to come celebrate with us?

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
Nice of you to ask,
but the newspaper club

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
is having one, too.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, that explains the outfit.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
Merry Christmas, and
Happy New Year to you both!

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
Dang, we just got scolded.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
How embarrassing.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
Well, there's a terrible
draft in here,

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
so turning off the
heater isn't an option.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
Oh! I know!
Let's do a hot rock pot instead!

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] It's a primitive cooking
method where you heat a stone

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center
to high temperatures...
and cook food with it!

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see!

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
Okay, so, first...

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
We'll have to hunt down
some dacitic tuff,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
which should be quite an
adventurous undertaking,

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
all things considered.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where from?

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
The Oga Peninsula!

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Request denied!

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Let's see what Ao has to say.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center
--[phone vibrates]
--Ah.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Pfft! Heh!

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Apparently,
we can't use the heater

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
and the hot plate
at the same time.

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Uh...

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
Well, to keep warm,
we could just get out

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
some extra blankets instead
of using the heater.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
We could also make
the hot pot a bit spicier.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
That should warm us up.
How's that sound?

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.690 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Pfft!

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.442 position:50% align:center
[SHOPPERS gasping]

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
[AO] Honestly, Mira's
goofiness always cheers me up.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
I wish there was something I
could do to repay her for that.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] All right, folks! Time
for the Earth Science Club's

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
first Christmas and New
Year's hot pot party!

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah-hah!

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
Thanks for inviting us.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
I never imagined we would
eat hot pot in the club room!

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50% align:center
What's with the blanket?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.013 position:50% align:center
It's weird and shiny.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Mira lent it to me.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
It's a thermal blanket--
like the ones they use

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:26.269 position:50% align:center
on artificial satellites.
Cool, huh?

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
I bought it on
our summer trip to JAXA!

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.
You went crazy that day.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
I do love wearing it.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
It makes me feel like
an artificial satellite!

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
How exactly does that feel?

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
It does look warm.
I'll give you that.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
Better taste the hot
pot to see how it turned out.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
Gah! Mira!
This is way too spicy!

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, that makes no sense.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
I only used store-bought kimchi.
What the--?

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
[INOSE groans]

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.593 position:50% align:center
What the--?!

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Um. I think I might know
what the culprit could be.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I said to use chili
peppers to spice it up,

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
but not all of them!

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
But, you told me to
throw everything into the pot,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
so I assumed that's
what you meant.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.023 position:50% align:center
Hold on! It's super spicy.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
Be careful!

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
Not bad, it has
a pretty decent kick to it.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
I feel much warmer!

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
[AO, INOSE, MIRA]
Huh?

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
I see. I guess adults
have a tougher palate than us.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
--[door squeaks]
--[ENDOU] Whew!

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center
It's freezing out there!

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mira. Here's the key
to the roof, as requested.

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you for that!

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI, MORINO]
The roof?

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
That's right!
Once we're all warmed up,

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center
I thought we could
do some stargazing!

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that a kimchi hot pot?

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
Yes, please!

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU grunts, coughs]
Gah! Spicy!

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] So much for adults
having tougher palates.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah! We can see so far!

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
[INOSE gasps]

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
[AO] It's really clear.
That's 'cause it's cold out.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I can
see the Winter Diamond.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center
There's Sirius.
And Rigel. And, uh...

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Aldebaran and Capella.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Pollux and Procyon.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
Wow, Sakura.
Did you look them up?

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
Nah, I managed to
remember a few, but only 'cause

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.040 position:50% align:center
they're named after rocks.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:12.334 position:50% align:center
--[MORINO laughs]
--Stop laughing, Monroe.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
If you add in Betelgeuse
from the Orion constellation,

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
then that makes up the Great G.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
Wait, G,
like in the Roman alphabet?

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
Correct! You link
those right there.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
Strange, isn't it?
I'm the geology buff after all.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
I should be keeping
my eyes on the ground,

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
not in the starry skies.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] After all this time,
are you still mad

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
that they merged our clubs?

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] If I was, do you
think I would've made this?

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center

all my secret photos

had taken so many!

some embarrassing ones

that I wanted to include in
there, but narrowing them down

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
became a lot of hard work!

Are you okay?

[AO]
Yeah.

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] The hot pot's
heat is wearing off.

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
We should water down
the soup and make a batch

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
of udon with it!

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Man, the cold hits
a lot harder when you get

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
to be my age.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
I don't know how you girls
can wear such short skirts

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
in this weather.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
Heater, heater.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
Miss Endou, don't!

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:13.705 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Huh?

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Miss Endou!

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] There are still
tons of people making

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
their first shrine visit
three days after the new year!

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ino. Are those...?

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
They're maps!

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know that!

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
What I meant was...

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
Why do you have two?

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] There have been so many
flood control improvements

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
made to this area.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
So I wanted to compare
an old map to this new one.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
The commemorative stone for

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
the flood control construction!
We should take a picture!

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.656 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Ino. Don't you think we
should say our prayers first?

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, you're right.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] After we pray,
let's draw our fortunes,

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
then have dango at the tea shop!

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
I want to drink amazake, too!

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:00.543 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Are those...?

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Fortunes with natural rocks!

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I want to draw one of those!

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
I can't see the sign at
all from way over here.

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
From the colors,
I think they're quartz crystals,

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
onyx, red jasper...
It's hard to tell.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center
[AO] Hey! We need
to say our prayers!

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
May Ao and I
discover a new asteroid

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
by the end of the year!

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
Uhh... You really
shouldn't shout here.

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I heard saying prayers
out loud makes it easier

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
for the gods to hear them
and come to your aid!

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Come on, Ao. Ino, you too.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
Out with 'em.

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
[AO sighs]

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Can we go talk
over there for a second?

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Ao. It was odd when you

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
stayed home
from school.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
You cried at the party.

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
You seem down.

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
Is there something
bothering you that you'd

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
like to talk about?

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.473 position:50% align:center
If you'd be open to it,
I would love to help out.

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
You can tell us anything.

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm?

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
It's just, my dad's job
is transferring him far away,

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
and I'm supposed to move
with him when he goes.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.736 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
And when is that
supposed to happen?

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:12.615 position:50% align:center
In mid-March. On spring break.

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] No way. We're supposed to
discover an asteroid together!

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
We promised when we were little!

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
Mira, you need
to calm down okay?

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
It's not fair!

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
Have you even considered
how Ao might be feeling?

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
[MIRA gasps]

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
Right now,

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
we should just enjoy what
time we have left together.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
So, Ao. Can you tell us a little
bit more about the move.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
Like, what do you know?

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
Emergency meeting of
the Earth Sciences Club!

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
I wanted lots of different
perspectives, so I've asked

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.817 position:50% align:center
the newspaper club
to join us today, as well.

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
A meeting right
after opening ceremonies?

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
So, what's up?

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
You mentioned something about
Manaka having to move away?

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center
This meeting's topic is
her farewell party, right?

00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:58.995 position:50% align:center
I have some ideas.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
No, just listen!

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
It might not be our
place to intrude--

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
since this is a
family matter, after all,

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
and it's not our business--

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
but still...

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
You don't want
these two to have to abandon

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
their dream, either?

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
Sakura...

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Exactly, so that's
the subject of today's meeting.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.971 position:50% align:center
We want to brainstorm
ways Ao can...

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I didn't even notice.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
Ao was having a hard time,
without any support from me.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
I'm a complete failure
as a friend.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
Where's that
annoying pluck and spirit

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
when we need it?

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
You should be throwing out
your ideas right now!

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
Take a page from Monroe's book!

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
She's busy studying
for her exams,

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
and I'm still getting
a slew of texts.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] She's right. This isn't
the time for self-pity.

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:44.916 position:50% align:center
I need to suck it up.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
How can we do this?

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:51.631 position:50% align:center
I know we can.
We'll realize our dream!

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
I'm so sorry I'm late, everyone!

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
Hey, Suzu!

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
Ao. I can't believe
you'd abandon us like this!

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Let's run away together!

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
Let's elope--it's not too late!

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:05.395 position:50% align:center
Wait! I had a dream
with her before you!

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center
[SUZU whimpers, sniffles]

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:10.650 position:50% align:center
If Ao and I can't elope,
then why don't we take turns

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
being her weekend commuter wife?

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
She'll be four hours
away from here by bullet train,

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:18.199 position:50% align:center
so I mean... I just think that
might be cost prohibitive.

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
Then why don't
we have campouts during

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
our longer school holidays?

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
And plan concentrated
observation nights?

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
That sounds awesome!

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
Though I think that might be
more of a personal activity

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
than a club activity,
to be honest.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
Would you guys be able
to borrow telescopes

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
and other equipment
from the school?

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
They'd have to negotiate that.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
And hauling it there
would be a pain.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
Well, what if
I became her legal guardian

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
and I was supporting her?

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
I'm getting my driver's
license soon, as it is.

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
[AO]
I don't... get it.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasping]

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
Why are you doing all this?

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
You're putting so much
thought into my situation.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:58.573 position:50% align:center
You dummy.
It's because we care about you.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
Like, a whole lot.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50% align:center
I mean, last night,
even Sakura was beside herself.

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
She couldn't stop
messaging me about it!

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Inose!

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
You promised you
wouldn't tell anyone!

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:13.380 position:50% align:center
[EVE] Still, though. This is
a pretty tough situation.

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
What should we do?

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
I suppose. The most
realistic idea is to conduct

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
your activities separately
and meet remotely.

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
[EVE]
I guess so.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
There are plenty of ways to
stay in contact these days.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Excuse me.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
I know that voice!

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
My sister?

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Nice outfit.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
We were instructed
to remove any personal items

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
from the council room.

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Okay. What exactly do you
guys do in the student council?

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
Mira told me the situation.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
Listen. I might know of
a way that Ao could avoid

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
having to move
in the first place.

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
But, her dad's transfer
is already set in stone.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
There's no changing that, right?

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you,
suggesting that Ao throw

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
a tantrum and refuse to go?

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Exactly.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
Exactly?
Are you serious about that?

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I suppose
I should clarify.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
First, I have one question.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
Ao, have you even
told your parents

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
you don't want to move away?

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
You haven't, have you?

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
I bet you've just accepted
your fate, and said nothing

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
to them about
your true feelings.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
You're right, I haven't
told my parents how I feel.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
Adults shouldn't have to
jeopardize their career paths

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
to satisfy the whims of a child.

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sighs]

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
That's true,
but you are still a child, Ao.

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
So, why not act like one and
put up a bit of a fight?

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
Except, you'll be
armed with a specific solution

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
about how you want
to live your life.

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but what?

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
Can you just talk to us
like the children we are?

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
[MISA]
Hmm. Yes, of course.

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
Ahem. As we all know,
I'm enrolling

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
in a distant
university next year.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
That means, starting
this spring I'm going to be

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:49.684 position:50% align:center
living all on my own.

00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:52.771 position:50% align:center
So, Ao, you should
live in my old room.

00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:55.190 position:50% align:center
In other words, for right now,
why don't you propose

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
the idea of living with
Mira to your parents?

00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.861 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:01.071 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Live...

00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:02.781 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
...together?

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:06.576 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] When I heard the news
that Ao would be moving,

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
I had no idea what to do.
But living together?

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
I can't even.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:14.834 position:50% align:center
What's going to
happen to us now?

00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:49.054 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Next time:
"True Feelings."
