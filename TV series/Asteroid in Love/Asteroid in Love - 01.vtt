[MIRA]
When I was little,

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
I went on the town camping trip
where I met an interesting boy.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
--[MIRA] Hey!
--[AO gasps]

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:45.170 position:50% align:center
What are you doing way
out here all by yourself?

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
[AO]
What am I doing?

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
Trying not to be mad.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.217 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.604 position:50% align:center
All the light from
the campsite interferes.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:04.022 position:50% align:center
Look, there's Jupiter.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
Which one?

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.401 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Here.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you!

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.738 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Look, right up there.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.909 position:50% align:center
Oh! That dot?

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Dot? Uh, yeah.

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.331 position:50% align:center
You can't see it
with binoculars,

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.833 position:50% align:center
but Jupiter has stripes
and thin rings circling it.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Whoa...

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.504 position:50% align:center
Also, it has about
70 moons in its orbit.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.172 position:50% align:center
Wow, you know a lot!

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.175 position:50% align:center
So then, what's your name?

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.218 position:50% align:center
I'm Ao.

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.678 position:50% align:center
And my name's Mira!

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.346 position:50% align:center
Ah! The star!

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center
I'm a star?

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's not what I meant.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
The variable star, Mira.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.812 position:50% align:center
It's in the Cetus constellation,
and it's unusual because

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
its brightness varies.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
How cool!

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.234 position:50% align:center
I never knew I shared
a name with a star!

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:52.529 position:50% align:center
What about you, Ao?
Is there a star with your name?

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.156 position:50% align:center
No way. My name's
too weird for that.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.491 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's weird!

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:57.701 position:50% align:center
Your name's cool!

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:58.702 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:58.785 --> 00:01:59.953 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Besides...

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:02.163 position:50% align:center
You could always just
name one after yourself!

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.957 position:50% align:center
Name one?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50% align:center
Nah, maybe an asteroid.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.254 position:50% align:center
If I discover an asteroid,
I'll get to name it.

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.840 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Let's find one together, then!

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.926 position:50% align:center
Let's do it! Find an asteroid!

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.219 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.683 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] After that night,
I never saw the boy again.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.230 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
And now, I'm in high school.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.190 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited to begin
the new school year

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:30.442 position:50% align:center
with all of you.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
Especially those
who are just starting here.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
As we all work toward our goals,

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
let's support each other and
help our peers do their best.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] As of today,
I'm a high schooler!

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
And the one thing I've been
looking forward to most

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
in high school is...

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.250 position:50% align:center
...gone?!

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong,
Mira? You okay?

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:52.005 position:50% align:center
Suzu! They've always
had an astronomy club,

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.631 position:50% align:center
but now it's gone!

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
I was so excited to join it
when I got into high school,

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.762 position:50% align:center
but now my dreams
have all been crushed.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:02:59.763 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Yeah. About that...

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh... Hi, Miss Endou.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
The Astronomy Club and
Geology Club have merged now.

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.939 position:50% align:center
Why don't you join
the Earth Science Club?

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Earth Science...?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I can't believe
the clubs have merged!

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
Why would they do that?

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
Maybe they just weren't
big enough on their own.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's not true!

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center
Remember last year's
cultural festival?

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
Welcome to our sexy planetarium!

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.043 position:50% align:center
It was an enormous success!

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's got
something to do with it.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
They were
punished for that stunt.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
But that's not
the reason they merged.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.759 position:50% align:center
Punished, you say?

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
They lost a few members,

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center
and there were some other issues
on the school's side of things.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
So, we decided merging
the clubs was the best option.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
and that's how we got
the Earth Sciences Club.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
But looking up at the heavens
and down at the ground

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
are literally opposites,
so how would that work?

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
I don't know.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
They're kind of the same
if you're looking at Earth

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
from outer space.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
Good call! I really like
your galactic perspective!

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what galaxy
is the club room in?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.626 position:50% align:center
Very clever.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
The building is on
the far end of the campus.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] It's ancient. You think
it's still safe in there?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Oh, stop.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
There are still of couple
drafty spots here and there,

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
but we got all the leaks
repaired, at least.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
Hey. I brought
two prospective members!

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
"Sky." "Earth." "Man"?

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center
Is it aliens?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
I don't think so?

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Sorry. We're still adjusting.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
The club merger is
new to all of us, too.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
I'm the club president, Morino.

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
From the Astronomy Club.

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
And I'm vice president Sakurai.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
I used to be
in the Geology Club.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
Now choose!

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Choose what?

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.509 position:50% align:center
Geology or astronomy.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
Which one were
you hoping to join?

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
If you're here for geology,

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
you get this power stone set
that boosts your luck!

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
It's for new members
only, though.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
--Now choose!
--[INOSE] Vice President!

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
If you're too aggressive,
you'll scare her away!

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
So sorry.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
Uh... She's really concerned
about the club ratio.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
Oh! I'm Inose, a second year.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
Geology.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
Manaka, a first year.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.033 position:50% align:center
I'm here for astronomy.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad that
there's another newbie!

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
I was hoping for astronomy, too.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
So, um... You like stars?

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Yeah!

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
And there's something that
I've always wanted to do!

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
You see... I wanna
discover an asteroid!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty lofty goal
you've got there.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
Is that, like, a hard thing
to do or something?

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
Some high schooler discovered
one in the past,

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
but that was, like,
a world record.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
It's practically impossible,
to be honest.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:52.936 position:50% align:center
At least for our tiny club?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] You don't have to
crush her dreams like that,

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
Vice President!

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but I made a promise
to a boy when I was little.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
What? Mira, why haven't
you told me about this?

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
'Cause if I'd told you about it,

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
you would never have
stopped grilling for more info.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Yeah! I'd string him up!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
Tell me his name!

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center
Ao. We promised we
would discover it together.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
He told me that he wanted
to have an asteroid

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.336 position:50% align:center
named after him.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
The sad part is, after that,
I never saw him again.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.968 position:50% align:center
Don't you guys think
we ought to break it to her?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
That is the ethical thing to do.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Wanna tell us
why you're blushing?

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
Earth to Ao Manaka.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
What...?!

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
You're him? Or... her?

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
The kid from the camping trip?

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center
My name does sound kinda boyish.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
And my hair was
really short back then.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.321 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
Do you remember me
from that night at camp?

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
Of course I do!

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
I've been trying to
discover an asteroid

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% align:center
ever since we talked about it!

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center
And look!

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
A whale charm?

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
You thought that would
help you remember my name.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Uh-huh.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
Quite the development.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
Yeah, things have taken
an interesting turn!

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
And so, the boy I met that night

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
at the campsite turned
out to be a girl!

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Good evening!

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
Today was a big surprise!

00:08:55.577 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
I never imagined you'd be in the
same high school club as me!

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy we're reunited!

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry
I mistook you for a boy.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
It's good to see you again!

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mom! I need help!

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
I'm borrowing the book!

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Huh?

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] Is she planning to get
a part-time job or something?

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
[MIRA groans]

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Mira.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
Hey, is something
the matter with you?

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you've
finally been reunited

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
with your old flame from
that fateful night so long ago!

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
Smile!

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
My old flame? Please.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
You're having entirely
too much fun with this.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
You're always mean
to anyone who tries

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
to get close to
me, so what gives?

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.336 position:50% align:center
Duh.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
Manaka's a girl, and
a super cute one, too--

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
it's not the same.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
I so support you
getting close to other girls.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
[MIRA whimpers]

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
So, what's your deal?

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Hmm, pretty formal.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
I remember her being so much
more open and expressive.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
Do you think her
tone could mean

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
that she doesn't
like me anymore?

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
I only see one problem here.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
Too many texts.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
What are you talking about?

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
If you're that worried about it,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
why don't you go talk
to her in person?

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
You know what
I've always considered to be

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
your best quality?

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
You take action
without overthinking.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm-hmm!

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
--Excuse me!
--[STUDENTS gasping]

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
But then you take it too far!

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Oh, hi!

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
Ao! Wanna eat lunch
together today?

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Huh...?

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
Mira has no chill whatsoever.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
Ao, I'm sorry for bombarding you
with all those texts last night!

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Huh?

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
I am so embarrassed.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
I really wasn't
trying to annoy you.

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
No-- No way!

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
Why did you think
that I was annoyed?

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
You weren't? I'm so glad!

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it. I didn't send
you back any cute replies.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, too.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
This is so adorable!

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
--[AO] Hmm?
--Don't mind Suzu.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
She's always been
a little on the weird side.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Oh. Hmm.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] You seem so different
from the person I remember

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.504 position:50% align:center
when we were kids.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
I thought you
were pretty chatty,

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
based on what I
remember from camping.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
Now, you have this cool,
mature beauty thing going on

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
that I really like.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Aw. Mira!

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I'll go clean myself up!

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
I hope some of your
composure wears off on her.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
Thing is... I actually
don't have any composure.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
At all. I keep panicking.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.239 position:50% align:center
'Cause I can't think
of what to say.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
I'm so scared to say something
stupid around her I clam up.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
Why does she scare you so much?

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
[AO]
It happened in middle school--

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
I said the wrong thing

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
and everyone
laughed at me for it.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.256 position:50% align:center
So hot.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
Anybody feel like
it's super wet today?

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
I think humid is the word
you're looking for.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:00.887 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys!

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
Ao just said
something really dirty!

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 1B laughs]
Ao is dirty!

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 1A, GIRL 1B laughing]

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
Since then...
I've had trouble speaking up!

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] That changed
her whole personality?

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Well, don't worry.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know way
more words than Mira does.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
I've been friends with her
since we were kids,

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
so you can trust me on that.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ah-choo!

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
You'll be fine.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt the two of you
are going to discover

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
an asteroid together.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
You two share
the same dream, you know?

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the awkwardness
will wear off in no time.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
[AO gasps]

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
Suzu. Look, I made it worse!

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
Aw. Mira!

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
Jeez, it would have come out
if you'd just patted it

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center
with a paper towel!

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
[MIRA sobs]
Help me...

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
[AO] I heard what Suzu said,
but I'm still nervous.

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] You seem so
different from the person

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
I remember when we were kids.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
[AO] My hair's grown out,
and I'm taller and quieter.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
So, it makes sense
that I'd seem different now.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
But... my feelings
haven't changed.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
[receiver ringing]

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hello?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
Hello. Mira? This is...

--[crash]
--[MIRA] Ah! Ow...

Mira?

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Sorry about that.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
I just found
something really cool!

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
Uh, what?

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
That isn't what it sounded like.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
Ao, can you go outside?

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
The sky! Look to the west!

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
[AO gasps]

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
That's Mercury, isn't it?

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:37.984 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
I got it right!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
You'll be happy to know I've
been studying a whole lot,

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
and it's all thanks to you, Ao!

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ao?

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
[AO] I'm okay.
It's nothing, don't worry.

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
[AO] I'm sorry for calling
out of the blue like this.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
I don't really have
anything to talk about.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's okay with me!

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
I love it when you call!

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.090 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Love it, huh?

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:01.299 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey.

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center
So, is Venus visible
in the sky right now?

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Uh, Venus?

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
I think you can see it
shining brightly

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center
in the mornings right now.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:13.520 position:50% align:center
So maybe... it's probably
around magnitude minus four.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:15.605 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah.

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Good morning.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Good morning!

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Hmm! You sure seem happy today.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
Yeah! 'Cause Ao and I
talked on the phone

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
forever last night!

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Oh? Well, good for you!

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
Ah. So, does that mean...?

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Suzu.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
Ao doesn't seem like a cool
beauty anymore, does she?

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
[AO sighs, giggles]

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
She's super cute!

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center

[MIRA groans]

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
It's time for...

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
...the Earth Sciences Club!

--[MORINO giggles]
--[MIRA] Yay!

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
So, what do we do now?

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
We haven't quite defined

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.864 position:50% align:center
what our club
activities will be yet.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
So, if there's anything you want
to do or think we should have,

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
we're open to your ideas! Okay?

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
I want this!

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Rejected!

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
Huh? But you just said
you were open to our ideas.

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
Yes, that is what we just said.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
But we have to stick
to the club budget.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
Okay, how much is the budget?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA]
Uh...

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:27.677 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
That look's not gonna make

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
more money magically appear!

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
That's what you get when
neither of your previous clubs

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
has any achievements
to speak of.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
The clubs that participate
in tournaments and win awards?

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
Those are always the ones
that get bigger budgets.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
That does make sense.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
So, if we're ever going
to be able to afford

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
a decent club telescope..

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
...then we're going
to have to earn it

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
by doing something remarkable.

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
I see...

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
So when are we having
a club barbecue?

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Rejected!

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center
By the way, where's Suzu?

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:01.002 position:50% align:center
Suzu was never
planning to join the club.

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
She's too busy helping out
with her parents' business.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's a shame.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
If Suzu had joined for geology,
then we would've been

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
perfectly balanced with
three members on each side.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Vice President.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
Turn that frown upside down!

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:18.144 position:50% align:center
I promise you that I will work
hard enough for two people!

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Uh. Thanks, Inose.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
But, I'm not really
sure how that helps

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I've listed all
of our club activities

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
from before the merger up here.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
We already have that equipment,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
so I think we can keep
doing those for now.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
The challenge is stuff
that cost money

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
like summer camp and
the cultural festival.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI sighs]
The cultural festival...

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
That reminds me, friends:
no repeat of last year, 'kay?

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
Really? Boo.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
What, this?

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Put it up, what's your problem?

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
I just think there's something
wrong with sexualizing

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
the earth sciences, you know?

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.553 position:50% align:center
It was a super
popular event, though.

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Sorry, the vice
president has been fuming

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
about that ever since last year.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.225 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you for real?

00:16:57.308 --> 00:17:00.103 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI] Attracting customers
through cosplay isn't fair!

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
You should have at least put
together an actual exhibit,

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.648 position:50% align:center
like the one we did.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] Though we only
drew in about a tenth

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.238 position:50% align:center
of Astronomy Club's visitors.

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
Inose, you're not
helping at all.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
[MIRA laughs]

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
Hey. Ao, what's the matter?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
I don't like that
we're so divided.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Huh?

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ugh. You're right.

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
None of these are activities
both clubs could do together.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
I think we should remedy that.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
A joint project, huh?

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
We could just do the previous
activities together.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
Or come up with
something entirely new.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
What do you guys think?

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
How did you understand her?

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
That was like telepathy.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Listen, I have a proposal.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
So how about this?

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
Both clubs put out
a joint newsletter.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
A newsletter?

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
Yes. We can put together
a kind of pamphlet that

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
introduces the
clubs' activities.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
That sounds fun!

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm-hmm!

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
What exactly would be
the point of the newsletter?

00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
Vice President?

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
Look. I know we didn't draw
a ton of visitors last year,

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
but I was still super proud
of the exhibit

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
that we all created together.

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
I thought we did a good job.

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] If we could somehow
make our club well-known

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
before the festival,
then I think a lot more people

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
will come visit us!

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
Think so, huh?

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Miss Inose?

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center
Can we write whatever
we want for the newsletter?

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
"Miss Inose"?

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure!

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
I mean, as long as
it relates to the club!

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
Hey! I could write up
an introduction

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
to the solar system!

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
If we have interesting,
informative columns,

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
then more people
will want to read it!

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
Well then!

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
I'll write a column
that introduces

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
different kinds of minerals!

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
Great idea!

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
So what should we call
our newsletter, then?

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Ooh! I have the perfect title!

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
How about:
"Find an Asteroid Weekly"?!

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
We'll include telescope
parts with each issue!

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Yeah--rejected!

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
That's way too focused
on the astronomy side!

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:59.889 position:50% align:center
Weekly might be too hard.

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.474 position:50% align:center
And it sounds pricey.

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Well, what do you think
a good title would be,

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
Vice President?

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
How's this?

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
[INOSE]
No way!

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
I know! How 'bout,
"Aim for an Asteroid"?

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Mm-hmm!

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
You girls have a lot of nerve,
trying to steal the spotlight.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be
a challenge getting you all

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
to work together.

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
But it'll be worth the effort.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] This is hard.
I'm drawing a blank.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
Sorry to interrupt just when
you're getting things going,

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
but it's time to wrap
it up for the day.

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
Hey, let's go home, you guys!

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
What about, "Heaven and Earth"?

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:32.672 position:50% align:center
No. That isn't it.

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
And why not?

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
It needs to be something cuter.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Cuter?

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.929 position:50% align:center
They're not even listening.

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
Who wants to
grab a cheese burger?

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Hmm?!

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU whimpers]

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
Ah! So pretty!

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
I do think something
that really encompasses

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.487 position:50% align:center
the beauty of rocks
would be ideal.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I hear that,
but why don't we wait

00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
to brainstorm over burgers?

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
[SAKURAI]
Okay. Man, I'm starved.

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Sparkle?

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Mm-hmm.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
That's a great idea!

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
Yeah, because both
gems and stars sparkle!

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.547 position:50% align:center
Uh! It's not too weird, is it?

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm-mm. I think it's adorable!

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
I'm all for a sparkly name!

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
Sparkly.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.143 position:50% align:center
Inose? I'm sorry.

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
I was so focused on
doing my job properly

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
and playing by the rules.

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
I guess I lost sight of the fact
that we need more people

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
to understand what
our club even does.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
Vice President...

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
But now, I see the path clearly.

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
We should break down the walls
between ourselves first!

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
So, with that in mind...

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
What do you think
of this project?

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
[INOSE] I'm always surprised
by her awkward side.

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU] Well? How is
everyone getting along?

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:57.716 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I was worried
about Sakurai and her habit

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
of being prickly around
people she doesn't know.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] Inose's doing
a good job of mediating,

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
so it's going
pretty well so far.

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
I see. Well. That's good.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm happy to report
an addition to the budget.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
[ENDOU]
Here you go.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
[MORINO]
Huh?

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
It should be fun.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
Just make sure everyone's
free next weekend.

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
[MORINO] So, you want to
do this, no matter what, then?

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I love winter.

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
The constellations
are so pretty right now.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Yeah.

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Hey, Ao?

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Hmm?

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] I think it's
so amazing that we're able

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
to watch the stars and
chat together like this.

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we're reunited.

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
It's crazy, don't you think?

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
Uh, Ao?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
[AO]
I'm glad, too.

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
I always hoped
that I'd see you again.

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
And now it's finally happened.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Mm.

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.648 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
Well, I'd better go.

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:56.900 position:50% align:center
See you at school!

00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:58.193 position:50% align:center
[AO]
Okay.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
[MIRA]
I want to find one.

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
[AO]
We'll make it happen.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:11.331 position:50% align:center
[AO, MIRA] Just like we said,
when we made our promise.

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:49.220 position:50% align:center
[MIRA] Next time:
"The Riverside Milky Way."
