Two men who work for Shishio

the Blind Sword.

302
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:44,942
His name is Usui,

303
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:47,142
bloodthirsty killer
of them all.

304
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,182
With his animal cunning,
his skill as a fighter,

00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,222
and his love of killing,
I'm impressed that Misao

306
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:54,022

a fight with this guy.

307

311
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,202
You know I don't like
to be interrupted.

312
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:07,182
Killing innocent civilians
serves no purpose, Usui.

313
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:08,212
Let her go.

314
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:11,012
Shishio's plan has failed,
it's time to regroup.

315

So what?

316
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:13,032
I will kill her
because killing

317
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:14,942
is what brings me pleasure.

318
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,072
Then I promise you,
as your blade does to her,

319
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:18,942
mine will do to you.

320
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,022
Come back and kill her
some other time if you must,

321
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:26,062
but you will not dishonor me
by doing so in my presence.

322
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:29,132
After that, they didn't say
anything, anything at all,

323
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:30,982
They just stood there
for a long time

324
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:32,032
staring at each other.

325
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:35,102
And then they left.

326
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:37,132
The other one,
the one called Anji,

327
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:38,962
there's something about
him that's different

328
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:41,162
than the other guys
in Shishio's group.

329
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:43,032
And he must be
one heck of a fighter

backed down like that.

is the one responsible

332
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:49,202
for saving Misao's life.

333

killed her just for fun.

Hmm, what is it, Yoshi?

Well, there's something
that's really important

338
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,182
that we have to talk about.

339
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,062
Aoshi is in Edo.

340
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:06,112
What?

341
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,072
Yes, and I've got
other news as well.

Yeah, go on.

343
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,102
No, let me tell him.

344
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:13,942
After all, I'm still
the leader of the Oni gang,

345
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:17,172
so I consider it my duty
to give Kenshin a full report.

There's no time to lose!

353

for making you worry.

365
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:06,042
Kenshin, I have a favor to ask,
but first, there are things

366
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:09,222
I must tell you.

367
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:13,162
Kenshin, how much do you know
about Aoshi Shinomori?

368
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,092
Does this favor have
something to do with him?

369
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:18,012
Indeed, it does,
but please,

370
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:20,132
before you ask me what it is,
allow me to tell you

371
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,142
what has gone before.

372
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:25,042
I raised Aoshi as if
he were my own son,

373
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,192
and he grew into a good
and honorable man.

374
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,162
He in turn raised Misao
as if she were his daughter,

375
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,052
but when she was
about ten years old,

376
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:35,022
he suddenly changed into a man

377
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:37,222
obsessed with one thing
and one thing only,

378
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,172
the need to become
what he calls

379
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,972
the most powerful,
but what I call

380
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:43,122
a cold-blooded murderer.

381

Aoshi Shinomori if you can.

I gave him everything,

and how did he show
his gratitude?

387

by stabbing and slashing

if he no longer

412

if he was the insane,
heartless killer

that you say he is,

Even though he
viciously attacked you,

416
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,962
perhaps some part
of him held back,

why you're still alive.

I believe he's sick,
and that this sickness

creates a wall

Ama Kakeru Ryu no Hirameki,

470

it'll end up controlling you,

Yoshi!

494
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,102
What's the matter with you?

495
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,952
You and I gotta talk.

496
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:06,162
This poor guy's
going into a battle

497
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,982
from which he
could never return,

498
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:10,052
and all you can do
is talk to him?

499
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:12,222
The least you could do is
give him a little kiss or two!

500
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:14,132
Well, what's that look for?

501
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:16,142
You know just what
I'm talking about!

502
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:17,172
Yoshi!

503
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:20,042
You just better mind your
own business, understand?

504
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,162
If you keep being such a brat,
I'm going to tell Tsubame!

505
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:25,042
Now wait a minute,
she's got nothing

506
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,192
to do with this!

507
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,222
Yoshi, I expect you

508
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:29,384
to take care of everyone here

509
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:30,163
while I'm gone.

510
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:30,883
Hold on!

511
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:32,152
You mean, I gotta stay home?

512
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:34,092
Course you do.

513
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:36,022
I can't risk losing you, Yoshi.

514
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:37,192
If anything were to
ever happen to you,

515
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:40,142
who would pay my tab
over at Lenny's restaurant?

516
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:43,092
Not funny!

517
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,132
Oh.

518
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:45,182
I am going with you!

519
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:47,062
There's no reason
why I shouldn't

520
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:48,992
and a whole lot of
reasons why I should.

521
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:50,092
I've been in constant training

522
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:51,132
ever since you left.

523
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:52,182
I'm a whole lot better fighter

524
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:54,142
than I was before,
a whole lot better,

525
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:55,082
believe me!

526
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:56,082
Yeah, I agree.

527
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:57,952
That's exactly why
I want you to stay here

528
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:58,962
and guard the town!

529
00:20:58,962 --> 00:20:59,932
Huh?

530
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,052
You never know
what's going to happen

531
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,102
during a war, I mean,

532
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,202
what if Shishio's
men were to try

533
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:05,092
and sneak into town
and you weren't there

534
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:07,002
to sound the alarm
and warn everyone?

535
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:08,932
You see what I mean?

536
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:11,012
We've all got a job to do,
and yours is right here,

537
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:13,042
making sure that
everyone here is safe

538

until it's over
and I can come back.

539
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,942
There's nothing to worry about.

540
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,062
Nobody has anything
to worry about

541
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:19,972
as long as I'm around!

542
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,932
And while I'm
looking for Aoshi,

543
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:24,022
do you think that you
could protect Aoiya?

That's if you see him.

545

You got it.

546
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:28,182
So that's why you were crying
so much this afternoon,

547
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:30,152

Don't worry about Aoiya,

the only thing you
need to think about

is beating the Juppongatana.
