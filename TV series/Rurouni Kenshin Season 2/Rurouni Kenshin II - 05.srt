I need you to answer
a couple of questions.

89
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:52,463
Ha!

90
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:55,393
My first question's
about the Kobe incident.

91
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:58,473
One night, 50 expert fighters,
members of the police force,

92
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:01,493
and the army were taken
out by a lone assassin.

93
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:04,423
Can you think of anyone among
Shishio's Juppongatana group

94
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:06,523
who could've pulled off
an attack like this?

95
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,253
I could,

96
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:10,343
and so could just about
any of Shishio's assassins.

97
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,233
It wasn't that tough,
they had lousy security.

98
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,233
And you're a liar.

99
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,263
Now, tell me the truth.

100
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,493
Hey, don't call me a liar.

101
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:18,233
I mean, why should I?

102
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,443
Stop it, you're
just wasting time.

103
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,443
Tell the truth
and I'll talk

104
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,423
to the authorities
and get you outta here.

105
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,263
There's no one
out there I wanna see

106
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,864
and no particular
place I wanna go.

107
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:26,443
What you mean is

108
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,243
you're afraid of Shishio.

109
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:31,243
It doesn't really matter
what you tell us.

110
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:32,283
He'll have you killed anyway

111
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:34,233
because you're not supposed
to let yourself fall

112
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,483
into the hands of the enemy.

113
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,433
It's safer in here
where he can't get to you.

114
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,413
Isn't that right?

115
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:40,263
Hey, you can think
whatever you want,

116
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:41,373
but I ain't talking.

117
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:44,313
And I'm not afraid of anyone--
Shishio or anybody else.

118
00:05:44,313 --> 00:05:46,323
So, if you think I'm a coward,
you better think again,

00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:47,373
you big bird brain.

120
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:50,273
I was up the entire night,
and when I get cranky,

121
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:52,343
I get real tired,

Don't just stand there,

136
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:21,433
give us some kind of
start signal, will ya?

137
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:24,273
As soon as it hits the floor.

Hi-yah!

Well, what do you know?

those manacles for ya,

otherwise it wouldn't be
a fair fight, now would it?

146
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,423
Yeah, right.

147
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:52,473
We'll take off those nasty
leg shackles, as well, 'kay?

148
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:54,243
N--I...

149
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,303
Y-You don't need to do that.

150
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,393
You made your point.

151
00:06:58,393 --> 00:06:59,303
Say it.

152
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:00,283
You win,
I lose.

153
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:01,473
There's no way I can beat you,

154
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,403
and you're right,
I'm a dead man if I leave,

155
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:05,363
so go ahead and ask
your questions.

156
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:06,313
Mmm hmm.

157
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,423
Now that we're all
on the same page,

158
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:10,413
you can start by answering
the question I asked earlier.

159
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,243
(simultaneously)
Neither one of us is the winner.

160
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:13,313
He is.

161
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:16,443
I need the name of someone who
could've killed all those men.

162
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:18,423
Fifty men in two or three hours.

163
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,283
Know of anyone
who could handle that?

164
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:21,283

You gotta be kidding me, right?

168

You said 50 guys in
a couple of hours, right?

Listen, if it weren't
for the time limit,

I coulda done it myself.

everyone else in the group

blind swordsman, Usui.

222

Usui was called
the blind sword,

223
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,483
and he was one of
the greatest swordsmen

in Japan at the end
of the Tokugawa era.

He and Shishio
fought each other once.

Usui was slashed across

called Shingun,
or "eyes of the heart,"

00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:48,443
and now he's even deadlier
than when he could see.

everything...again!

326
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:39,313
No one's gonna destroy Edo.

327
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:40,463
I won't allow it!

328
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,273
Glad to hear it.

329
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:47,283
We've also gotta watch
the Shinsen group.

330
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:49,353
They'll use an emergency
as a means of taking control

331
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:52,393
of the whole country.

332
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:54,233
What?

333
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,403
I never thought that you
and I would agree on anything.

334
00:13:58,403 --> 00:13:59,423
Hmm.

335
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,353
Oh, well, looks like we'll
have to finish our fight

336
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:02,323
another time.

337
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:03,413
Right now, what we gotta do

338
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:04,523
is find Kenshin.

339
00:14:04,523 --> 00:14:07,423
Yes, it'd be a waste of time
for us to fight each other.

340
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:10,253
We've got to find
Kenshin immediately.

341
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:12,403
Well, don't just sit there,
bird brain, get moving.

342
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:13,483
We've got a lot of work to do.

343
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:15,323
Or weren't you paying attention?

344
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,433
Hey, don't order me around.

345
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,243
I'm not working for you.

346
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:19,333
All right, stay here.

347
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,483
Locked up with asparagus head?

348
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:21,483
No thanks!

349
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:23,373
Move your tail
feathers, bird brain.

350
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:25,473
-Don't call me bird brain!
-Okay, chicken lips.

-Thank goodness.
-What's wrong?

354
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:35,313
What are you so upset about?

355
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:36,353
(panting)

356
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,403
Where have you been?

357
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:39,473
I was going crazy being
stuck out here for so long,

358
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,293
so I went into town
and got some really

359
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:43,253
tasty desserts
for us to nibble on.

360
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,283
Calm down,
don't worry,

361
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,463
I got the kind you
like, too, Ayumi.

362
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:48,273
So, that's why you were
gone for three days?

363
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,233
Yeah, I couldn't decide
which ones to get.

364
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,373
You don't know
what happened here.

365
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:54,373
That madman, Usui is
completely out of control.

366
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:58,293
And what did Usui do?

367
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:01,303
Hey, Blind Sword, man,
it's nice to see you again.

368
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,263
Here, have some.

369
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:04,303
(sniffing)

370
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,513
Yatsuhashi.

371
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:08,393
You offer sweets
and sweetness, Sojiro,

372
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:11,403
but your soul is
covered with frost.

373
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,624
You have your own agenda,
and you think that you're

374
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,744
a whole lot smarter
than the rest of us are.

375
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:16,523
Eyes of the heart,

376
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,503
see through the
deception of your smile

377
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:22,243
to the emptiness
of your inner core.

Right now, whatever
it is you're hiding

380
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:27,433
is none of my concern.

381
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,473
(groaning)

382
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:32,493
Oh, one more thing.

383
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,233
The meeting will begin
in just a few minutes.

384
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,503
Everyone has finally arrived,

385
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,383
and once we've
gotten organized,

386
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:40,263
nothing is going to stop us.

387
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:44,503
Hi, Kamatari.

388
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:47,273
Sojiro, how are you?

389
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:49,323
Ayumi, it's good
to see you again.

390
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,443
It's been a long time.

391
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:52,403
So, you're still
with Shishio, huh?

392
00:15:52,403 --> 00:15:54,403
That's really surprising
considering the fact that

393
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,253
he only likes younger women.

394
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:57,393
You're wrong,
he likes women

395
00:15:57,393 --> 00:16:00,383
who have the experience
to give a guy what he wants,

396
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:01,483
like good advice.

397
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,273
Sure.

398
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:06,433
You youngsters are
so entertaining.

399
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,263
Mr. Saizuchi,

400
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,523
why you look younger every year.

401
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:13,323
Heh, I tell myself that,
but I'm a liar like you.

402
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,483
At least you make an
attempt at civility, Sojiro.

403
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:18,383
Most young people have no
respect for their elders.

404
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:21,233
I could teach 'em a lesson
by turning them into toads,

405
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,075
but I'm not responsible
for their manners.

406
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:23,513
Right.

407
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:24,523
Where's Fuji?

408
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:27,263
Hasn't that guy always
been your right-hand man?

409
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:29,423
Oh, he's outside,
he's superstitious.

410
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:32,473
He said this place
gave him the willies.

due to the delay,
which was necessary

the time has come
to destroy the government.

442
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:49,273
We'll begin the Edo Fire Plan
tomorrow night at 11:59

443
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:52,293
and the city will be destroyed!

444
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:56,433
Edo will burn to the ground!

Hey, wake up sleepy head.

447
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:18,503
Huh?

448
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:20,353
You told me all about the ones
that were waiting for you

449
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:21,453
back home and you
also told me how much

450
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:24,353
they were counting
on you, right?

451
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,283
It's time for you to
get a move on, Kenshin.

452
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:30,333
Huh, huh?

453
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,463
Sensei?

454
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:34,483
Sensei, ahh!

455
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:39,373
I got a thing about
men trying to hug me.

456
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,383
It's just not my cup
of tea, understand?

457
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:46,523
Sensei, the medicine worked,
you're not sick anymore.

458
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,463
Huh?

459
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:50,353
Well, you're wrong about that.

460
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:52,443
None of this stuff has
any medicinal value at all.

461
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,283
It couldn't even
cure a runny nose.

462
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:55,333
Huh?

463
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,423
But, wait, I don't understand.

464
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,403
You will, in time.

465
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:00,473
Know what this is?

466
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,303
Sure I do, it's
a reversed-edged sword.

467
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:04,273
Look more closely.

468
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,433
You see this peg
below the haft?

469
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,443
It's like a spring,
it helps absorb the force

470
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:10,443
of an opponent's blow,
so that my hand remains steady.

471
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:15,273
This is an excellent sword
that can intuit the purpose

472
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:16,473
of the person who wields it.

473
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:17,433
(gasping)

474
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,323
Mr. Shakku.

475
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:21,383
I've kept the secret
of the nail for many years.

476
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:23,433
In fact, I thought that
I would never tell anyone,

477
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,483
yet I sense that now
the time has come for me

478
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:28,243
to pass this knowledge
on to another,

479
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:31,373
to someone who I believe
will use it wisely.

480
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:32,413
Huh?

481
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:35,343
But, you must promise to
develop your technique alone,

482
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:36,513
within no boundaries,

483
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:39,343
with the freedom known
only to a wanderer.

484
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:40,273
So, you are forbidden

485
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:41,453
to swear allegiance to anyone.

486
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:43,443
