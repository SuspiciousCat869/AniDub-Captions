perhaps we're not

00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:36,149
as experienced
as you in battle,

336
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,179
but we know something
about strategy.

337
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,039
Faced with a
superior weapon,

338
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,929
we needed to level
the playing field,

339
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:43,169
and we did so.

340

You had me really
worried, Misao.

I didn't have any choice.

Aoshi's

about me anymore.

we have the upper hand,

finish her off!

Let me ask you, Kamatari.

356
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,029
Considering your situation,
are you prepared to withdraw?

357
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:14,149
Your weapon's
been destroyed

358
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:17,969
and so have your chances of
defeating us head to head.

you might well die.

Ha!

What makes you think I can't
defeat you head to head?

364
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,919
Believe me, you are the
one at a disadvantage here.

I'm using my
