00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:45,133
I didn't know that
you'd changed your name

167
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,213
and that you're living
quietly as an artist.

168
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:50,173
Can you tell me why
you're living like this?

169
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:52,343
Being a ceramic artist is
a very good thing to be

170
00:08:52,343 --> 00:08:54,403
if you want to avoid
meeting other people.

171
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:58,313
Besides, true genius can
excel in any occupation.

172
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:02,303
I see that you're
just as humble as ever.

173
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:05,233
Are you trying to
change the subject?

174
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,243
You have something very
important to tell me

175

and you're having a
hard time saying it.

176

Remember that I
was your master.

It's easy for me to
feel your anxiousness.

All right then.

Mitsurugi style,

I can see that
this training

193
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,313
is very important
to you, Himura.

194

This guy's
Kenshin's master?

195
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,153
I can't believe
there's such a person.

196
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,373
Yeah, Seijuro
Hiko is his name.

197
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,243
I understand that
he is the master

198
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:03,153
of the Hiten
Mitsurugi style.

199
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,263
He has studied this
technique for 20 years.

200
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:07,233
So are you saying
Kenshin doesn't know

201
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,393
certain techniques of
the Hiten Mitsurugi style?

202
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,273
Maybe there are certain
aspects of the technique

203
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:13,393
he doesn't know, that's why
he went to see the master.

204
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,403
So, if he would master
those techniques--

205
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:18,373
Then he would be even more
powerful than he was before.

206
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:20,263
Wow, that's incredible!

207
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:22,173
As it is, he's
not even human!

208
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,163
This will make
him a monster.

209
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:26,223
(laughing)

210
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:30,313
I can't believe I'm going
to see Kenshin again.

211
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:31,373
I can't wait.

212
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:34,173
Every second seems
like an eternity.

213
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:38,303
I see, so Mr. Shishio
is back in town

214
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,403
and you have to go back to
being Battousai the Slasher

215
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,133
in order to
defeat him,

216
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,403
but you don't want to
kill him, is that it?

217
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:45,383
And in order to defeat
him without killing him,

218
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,313
you have to become
more powerful.

219
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,313
You want to develop
more strength and power,

220
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:51,283
and that's why
you've come to me.

221
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,383
But that's impossible.

222
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:55,193
Why is that?

223
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:57,213
Remember when you
were my student?

224
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,133
Remember what
I taught you?

225
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,293
A sword is
a murder weapon.

226
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,293
Swordsmanship is
a murder technique

227
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:05,373
no matter how you try
to look at it, Himura.

228
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,283
And no matter how you try to
make it clean and beautiful,

229
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:10,183
those are the real facts.

230
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:12,383
It's impractical to maintain
your optimistic ideas

231
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:15,223
in the face of death.

232
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:18,383
This mistake began
15 years ago.

233
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:22,203

234

-Yes.
-You fool.

236
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:27,243
You should concentrate
on your training

237
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:29,383
and not pay attention to
what's going on outside.

238
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:31,263
But how I can
ignore it, Master?

239
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:33,253
More and more people have
been dragged into the mess.

240
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:35,313
They're being killed
even as we speak.

241
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:38,133
Isn't the motto of the
Hiten Mitsurugi technique

242
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,243
to protect people
from the pain of life?

243

And so you think that
you're going to do that?

244

Go ahead if you
want to leave.

You're the one who
doesn't understand!

Listen to me, Himura,
the Hiten Mitsurugi style

brings victory for the
person who masters it

because of its power.

255

efficiently, understand?

Go talk to him!

328

You finally found him

330

Mm-mm.

331

Wow.

332
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:14,403
Kaoru, what in the
world's with you?

333
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,213
Hmm.

334
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:22,133
So, this is the master that
taught Kenshin how to fight.

335
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,233
He may be a master

336
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:27,243
but there is something very
strange about this guy.

337
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,183
Will you answer
some questions?

338

-Yes.
-Yes.

339
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:31,293
We have a question for you.

340
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:33,293
So how old
are you anyway?

341
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:34,253
Old?

342
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,293
I'm 43.

343
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:37,143
What difference
does it make?

344
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,273
(shouting)

345
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,163
He's a master
at that age?

346
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:43,133
Yeah, well,
Kenshin's only 29!

347
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,143
Is that right?

348
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,323
That's what I
said, didn't I?

Hey, don't
get so angry,

I'm just asking.

351
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:50,173
So, how's his
training going?

352
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:53,243
Oh, is that the reason you
came here, to find out?

353
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,423
Not really.

354
00:15:54,423 --> 00:15:56,403
I came to Kenshin.

355
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:57,423
Oh, yeah?

356
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,153
Huh?

357
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:00,423
You see him and then
what do you want to do?

358
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:03,173
You want him to go back to
Kyoto with you, is that it?

359
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:04,233
Do you want to
open your heart

360
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,283
and tell him
how you feel?

361
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:07,283
Or maybe you just
want to fight with him.

362
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:08,403
Uh, no.

363
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:11,423
I just wanted--I just
really wanted to see him.

364
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:14,233
Just one more time,
that's all I wanted,

365
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,383

366
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:16,333
Huh?

367

I really don't
know what it is

368

that you all see in that
foolish student of mine,

369
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,895
but he certainly seems
to be very popular

370

You don't know
anything about Kenshin.

You haven't seen
him for 15 years!

374
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,494
And that's exactly the reason

375

that I want to
talk to all of you.

00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:02,373
I came all this way to
see Kenshin and I saw him.

487
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:04,383
I have an idea, you two
could stay at my place

488
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,153
for as long
as you like.

489
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:07,143
Thanks a lot.

490
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:08,143
I wonder what the secret

491
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,173
of the Hiten Mitsurugi
style is anyway.

492
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:11,263
I don't know
but I understand

493
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:13,393
that it's a very
closely guarded secret.

494
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:16,333
Ah, really, I hear it's
the most powerful one.

495
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,133
That's really exciting.

496
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,163
Dang, there was something
I meant to tell Kenshin

497
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:21,243
but I forgot
what it was.

498
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:24,333
I can't believe how
lame my memory is lately.

499
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,383
I know, Aoshi!

500
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:28,393
That's right,
Aoshi's in Edo!

501
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:30,233
He's here to go
after Kenshin,

502
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,303
we have to warn him
about it right away!

503
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:35,223
Hey, I'll run
back and tell him!

504
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:37,393
Wait!

505
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:39,183
Misao!

506
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:40,223
Why'd you do that?

507
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:42,163
Is it true, what
you just said?

508
00:21:42,163 --> 00:21:44,183
Is Aoshi really
here in Edo?

509
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:45,213
Aoshi?

510
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:46,373
He is!

511
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,293
Get away!

512
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:49,263
Yoshi!

513
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:50,293
Stay back!

514
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,353
This girl's one
of the Oni gang.

515
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,313
-Huh?
-What?

516
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,183
Why did you get
close to Kenshin?

517
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:57,283
Was that your orders?

518
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,173
Aoshi tell you to?

519
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:01,203
Or were you revenging
Han'nya and the others?

520
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:02,183
Revenge?

521
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:03,193
Han'nya?

522
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:04,203
What are you saying?

523
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:05,423
Please, I want you to
tell me what happened

524
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:07,383
between Himura
and Mr. Aoshi.

525
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:10,173
What happened to
everyone in the Oni gang?

526
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:11,213
Please tell me.

527
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:14,203
Don't act so innocent.

528
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:16,323
Just a minute,
Yoshi, calm down.

529
00:22:16,323 --> 00:22:18,233
Kaoru, you don't
know what she is.

530
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,223
All I know, Yoshi,
is that because of her

531
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:21,393
I was able to see
Kenshin again.

532
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:23,223
Hey there, Kaoru.

533
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:26,263
You must know everything
about Mr. Aoshi, don't you?

534
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:29,203
Please tell me!

535
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:32,133
I'm begging you!

536
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,413
Ah, Kaoru,
don't tell her.

537
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:35,293
She has to hear this.

538
00:22:35,293 --> 00:22:37,363
I'll tell you what
you want to know,

539
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:40,243
but I warn you,
it's a painful story.
