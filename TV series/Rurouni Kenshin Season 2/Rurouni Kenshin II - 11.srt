00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:19,456
You're going to have to fight a
guy who refuses to kill you.

326
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,166
But look at it this way,

327
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,316
at least you're gonna
get to fight him

if the two of you ever
stop talking that is.

329
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:26,386
Make it quick, Kenshin,

330
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:29,196
or else we won't
get to Aoiya in time.

331
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,406
I know that this
fight has to happen.

332
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:34,386
The question that has to
be answered right now,

333
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,446
is which one of you is
the more skillful fighter.

So, go on, let's find out.
