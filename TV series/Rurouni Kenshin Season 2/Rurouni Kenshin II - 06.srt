I think so too, and
believe me when I tell you

00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:29,555
the Shishio group is definitely
the most dangerous and cunning,

and they don't make
stupid mistakes.

Shishio uses mostly assassins
and the elements of surprise.

42
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,435
His men never get
caught, and if they do,

they never talk,
unless they're told to.

So, maybe it's a setup.

45
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:47,455
Maybe Cho leaked Shishio's plan
as some kind of a diversion,

46
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,545
or Shishio would've sent
somebody to kill him

before he had a
chance to squeal.

You're right.

There's got to be some
other kind of secret plan

Shishio lives for
deception and revenge.

62
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:29,445
I'm sure there must be some
hidden meaning behind this ploy,

63
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,445
something we haven't
thought of, I'm sure of it.

00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,335
But what could it be?

65
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:36,355
There must be a clue.

00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:37,295
Hm?

Saito!

68
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,495
When the Shogun Yoshi
Tokugawa betrayed his allies

69
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:44,475
he traveled by ship
to Edo from Osaka.

70
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:48,355
His defection gave rise
to the Imperial Army.

71
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,295
What if Shishio is using
Yoshi Tokugawa's victory

72
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:52,295
as his own victory?

73
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:54,275
That would make sense!

74
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:57,325
That would mean
the ships are here.

75
00:04:57,325 --> 00:05:00,545
Setting Edo on fire is
just step number one.

76
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:04,365
He's planning to bombard Edo
from the ships in the bay!

77
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,385
You're right.

78
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,435
They're going to make
this place a fiery hell,

79
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:10,505
and those maniacs will
stop at nothing.

80
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:12,415
I'm telling you, Shishio
wants to overthrow

81
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,485
the entire government.

82
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:17,315
His plan is the own this
city from the ground up,

83
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:19,545
but he'll have to
get by us first.

84
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:23,315
Let's go and stop him before he
has a chance to get out to sea!

85
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:25,435

86

00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,525

A little dizzy, Kenshin?

92
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:44,555
I'd say from the look of things
that maybe you could use a hand.

93
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,555
Oh, man.

94
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,425
Well, I'll tell ya,
it looked to me

95
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,435
like it was a very
lucky punch, Sano.

96
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,545
Who asked ya?

97
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,365
You're wasting our time, Saito!

98
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:55,525
We might as well start running!

99
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:58,305
You can't run to
Osaka, you idiot.

100
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:01,545
-We'll take the carriage.
-I get the front seat!

101
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:05,355

102
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:06,515
Straight ahead!

103
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:09,275
Straight ahead to Osaka!

104
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,265
We're going all the way!

105
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:12,525
(screaming)

106
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:14,375

108
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:19,345
Saito, just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

109
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,485
Trying to shut you
up so we can talk.

110
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:23,555
Ha, forget that!

111
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:26,265
Now then, where the hell was I?

112
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:29,315
Oh, yeah, we put 5,000 police
officers on alert in Edo,

113
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:32,285
and now that's more than
10 times Shishio's manpower,

114
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:34,545
so we should be able to handle
anything he can dish out.

115
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:37,485
What about the telegram
that I sent him?

116
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:40,275
I arranged to have the
officers make the delivery.

117
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,385
So, why don't you tell
me what the message was?

118
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:45,275
Even if the police can
stop Shishio's scumbags,

119
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,445
we'll still need support
in protecting Edo from fire.

120
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:50,355
I wrote for Misao's help.

121
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,465
The Oni gang have guarded Edo

122
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,445
since the end of
the Tokugawa era.

123
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:56,355
Now, they must be
prepared to die for it.

124
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:03,485
(birds chirping)

125
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:05,365
Hm, interesting.

126
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:08,555
I see.

127
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:13,335
Hey, hey there, Omasu!

128

Can't you see we're

129
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,555
I mean, yes?

130
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:18,485
Hey, you might know this.

131
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,345
How much would a black
market Gatling gun cost?

132
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:23,355
(explosions and screaming)

133
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:26,385
-Misao, no more explosives!
-It's really starting to hurt.

134
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,365
Whoa, sorry about that.

135
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:32,495
But you ladies should know
we must always be prepared

136
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,465
with gunpowder if necessary.

137
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:37,425
My obligation as the Oni leader
is to have enough equipment

138
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:41,455
to defend this city against
Shishio and his army.

139
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:43,455
Misao, a Gatling gun
would be helpful,

140
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,555
but true strength
comes from within.

141
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:47,325
Huh?

142
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:49,535
I actually believe that Kenshin
saw you as some kind of warrior

143
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,545
with a strong mind, and that is
probably what made him make you

144
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:55,345
his confidant in
the first place.

145
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,425
Don't you see?

146
00:07:56,425 --> 00:08:00,295
You are already more powerful
that any gun could ever be.

147
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:03,435
That's because true
strength comes from within.

148
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:04,495
You're right, Kaoru.

149
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:07,265
Now I know that
Himura believes in me.

150
