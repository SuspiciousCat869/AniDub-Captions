No one compelled

was a dangerous job

You don't want
to kill Shishio.

305

In fact, you'd
be scared to try,

306
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,030
because you know that after
your experience in the forest,

307
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,230
when Shishio himself was
betrayed and was badly burned,

308
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,280
he was even closer
to death than you were

309
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
and the power he
developed as a result

310
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,270
is much stronger than yours.

311
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,260
So, when you joined
the Juupongatana,

312
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,150
you did so only
on the condition

313
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,210
that you could
attack Shishio

and try to kill
him at anytime.

315

Now, why would
you insist on that

As long as everyone knew about
your agreement with Shishio,

319
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,180
it would appear that Shishio had
to be on guard against you,

320
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,250
which would make it appear
that he was afraid of you,

afraid then they would be too.

Yes, and we'll
coordinate our efforts

based on which opponent
each of you is fighting.

If you've won your fight

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,170
and your opponent
is no longer dangerous,

485
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,000
go and help someone
else who's in trouble.

Shirojo, you and the others

Huh?

If we get through
the first stage

493
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,260
of the attack
successfully, we'll regroup

494
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,080
and decide on
our new strategy.
