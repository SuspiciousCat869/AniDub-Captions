Oh, come on.

You're not about

really are a fox!

Hey, what are you talking
about, you dim little twerp?

385

Yeah, Yoshi, I can
understand about Misao

386
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,625
because she's not
that attractive,

387
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,555
but there's no way that
Kamatari is sexier than me.

What are you
talking about, Kaoru?

389

You're supposed
to be on my side.

390

Oh, right,
I'm sorry.

00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,535
Yoshi,
we demand an apology.

392
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:20,535
What?

393
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:21,565
But it's true.

394
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,585
Oh, Yoshi,
you're an idiot.

395

What do you see in that
tall drink of water anyway?

396
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,655
She may not be ugly but
she's probably cold as ice.

397
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,495
It's not worth it, Misao.

398
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:31,585
He wouldn't
know a real woman

399
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,635
if she were staring
at him in the face.

400
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:36,485
Those women must be really
desperate, poor things.

401
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:37,635
They need to find
themselves a boyfriend

402

before they both dry up.

403

be really something

right training.

So, how about it kid?

You'd be really smart
to join up with me.

00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:48,445
Yeah, just what
are you talking about?

409
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,435
I don't want any part
of your stupid training

410
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:51,625

man into a woman.

Come on, Misao, cool out.

what to do about this.

responsibility alone.

option is Misao.

technique as much as I have.

488
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,525
Why do you turn
your back on me, Henya?

489
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:27,545
(clucking)

490
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,365
Are you chicken?

491
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:30,645
Let me tell you,
you wanna fight with Kenshin,

492
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:32,515
then you'd better
start with me.

493
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:35,645
Alright, boy, if you're
so bent on dying young,

494
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:39,385
then let's get on with it.

495
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,385
I'm not going to
kill you slowly.

496
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:42,445
First, I'll
make you regret

497
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:45,485
that you ever tried
to ridicule me, boy.

498
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:47,435
Now, get ready to suffer.

499
00:21:47,435 --> 00:21:48,455
Keep an eye on
this wingding,

500
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:50,475
he's got something
in his hands.

501
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,375
It looks like
some kind of bomb.

502
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,505
I thought he had more
imagination than that.

503
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:57,435
Too bad.

504
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:58,625
I thought you
were a real warrior,

505
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,585
but you're just
a phony and a coward,

506
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,605
and you were bragging
about how good you were.

507
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:04,365
What a big liar!

508
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,365
I never said I was going

509
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,445
to kill you in
just one blast, boy.

510
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:10,575
This is for fun.

511
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:14,565
(shouts)

512
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:16,625
This is my own
battle technique.

513
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,615
(laughing)

514
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:22,585
I'm the winged warrior
of the Juupongatana.

515
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:24,535
It's flying
blaster time.

516
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:26,395
(gasping)

517
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:29,385
No matter what technique
a person has mastered,

518
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:31,605
he can't beat someone
that he can't touch.

519
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:34,465
You're a sitting duck, kid.

520
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:35,645
You dare humiliate me?

521
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:40,585
Now, you're going to regret
that and die, you fool.

522
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:42,385
(shouting)

523
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:44,886
Yoshi!
