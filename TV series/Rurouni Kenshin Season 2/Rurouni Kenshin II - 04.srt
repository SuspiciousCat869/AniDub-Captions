166
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,496
Please, Master, talk to me.

167
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:28,496
Your nine-dragon attack
was almost perfect,

168
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:30,526
but even using the same
technique, the effect will have

169
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:33,526
different results depending
on who's delivering it.

170
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,616
When you do a rough attack,
arm strength is important,

171
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,516
and when you're charging
someone, having some weight

172
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:39,396
can be really helpful.

173
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:42,436
Two factors that make your
attack inferior to mine.

174
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,636
In other words, your nine-dragon
attack doesn't match up well

175
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,396
to mine, because you need
to be heavier and stronger

176
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:49,466
to do it better than me.

177
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,426
I don't have time to
gain strength or weight

178
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:54,476
so I guess this attack
won't work for me.

179
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,466
I hope he can think of
another way to help him

180
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:59,486
prove my chances
against Shishio.

181
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:00,506
Relax.

182
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:02,476
I have another power
technique that can defeat

183
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,626
the nine-dragon attack,
but if I teach it to you,

184
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:07,626
you must swear to me to
keep it an absolute secret.

185
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:10,586
This technique I developed
is called Hirameki,

186
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,556
but can you keep it
a secret forever?

187
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:14,436
Of course.

188
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,486
You should feel very flattered
because I've never shared

189
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:17,656
this form with anybody else.

190
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:19,396
I'm ready!

191
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:20,626
This secret you wish
to know can be found

192
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,536
within the nine-dragon attack.

193
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:24,366
Think about how
to stop its speed,

194
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:25,516
and you'll find the secret.

195
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:29,396
So, this other secret
is a riddle I must solve.

196
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,416
Think!

197
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,656
-Huh?
-Good luck.

198
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:35,656
By the way, here's an excellent
hint that might just help you.

199
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:38,586
Listen, the nine-dragon
thrust is my own technique,

200
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:41,376
but I only showed
you half of it.

201
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:44,486
Huh?

202
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,376
That's just great.

203
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:47,616
Discovering this secret
was one of the greatest

204
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:49,416
breakthroughs I've ever made.

205
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,376
You see, by teaching the
nine-dragon attack style,

206
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,376
I found a way to beat it,
and I'm not just gonna

207
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:55,406
tell you the secret.

208
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,586
You must think it
through yourself.

209
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:58,616
If you can beat me with
your nine-dragon attack

210
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,536
without more weight
or strength than me,

211
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:03,646
than in that process you will
find the secret that you seek.

212
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:06,556
Think about the kendo components
that make up this attack.

213
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:08,476
What characteristics
change when you speed up

214
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:11,416
each of the nine
slashing movements?

215
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,606
You'll find the answer.

216
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,626
So, I'll learn the
answer through experience.

With any luck, Himura will learn

-What?

330
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:17,536
Kenshin has a habit of
handling problems by himself

331
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,396
instead of teaming
up with someone.

332
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:21,416
That makes me worry about him.

333
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,386
I know it's important to
know a higher technique

334
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:25,546
when he's fighting Shishio's
gang, but he might do better

335
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,466
to organize a group
to help him instead.

336
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:31,386
Besides, the toughest battle
he's fighting is within himself

337
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,396
between Battousai and Kenshin.

338

Here I am pouring
out my heart to you,

a need to worry about him.

Kenshin's taken care
of himself up until now,
