00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:56,043
Mr. Shishio, we've received word
that Saito, Kenshin Himura,

4
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:59,253
and Sanosuke Sagara are
on their way here now.

5
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,093
Good, summon the Juppongatana.

6
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:03,063
Finally.

7
00:02:03,063 --> 00:02:04,163
We should've dealt
with those troublemakers

8
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:05,213
a long time ago.

9
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:08,033
Pardon me, sir, I'd like
to suggest a strategy

10
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,123
which would ensure
our total victory.

11
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:12,073
Strategy.

12
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:15,253
Of course, why not?

13
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:18,303
Exactly what is this
strategy you'd like to suggest?

14
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:21,063
Tell us, Hoji.

15
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:22,283
What I have in mind
is not just getting rid

16
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:24,173
of those three men,

17
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,053
but an absolute complete
and total victory.

18
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,163
Sounds interesting so far.

19
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:31,053
-Go on.
-Thank you, sir.

20
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,273
In the upcoming battle,
those three men

21
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:34,273
will have to fight
our entire group.

22
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:36,153
Ten opponents in all!

23
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:38,293
So the odds are
greatly in our favor.

24
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:40,293
I would say that's
putting it mildly.

25
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,073
What are you getting at,
Hoji, what is your point?

26
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:45,113
My point is that no
matter how much the odds

27
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:46,143
are in our favor,

28
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:49,103
we must eliminate even the
slightest chance of defeat

29
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:53,043
by demoralizing our enemies
before the battle begins!

30
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:55,153
I suggest we keep only
the three strongest fighters

31
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:56,313
of the Juppongatana here

32
00:02:56,313 --> 00:03:00,113
while the rest of the
group obliterates Aoiya.

33
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,263
The only ones left alive

34
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,223
will be the ones we
choose as messengers

35
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:05,243
to bring the news to
Himura and the others

36
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:07,103
that their friends
and supporters

37
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,053
have been destroyed.

38
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:10,163
Good idea.

39
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:11,283
This strategy would also serve

40
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:14,103
to get rid of the
troublesome Oni gang members

41
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:16,083
and those who are loyal to them.

42
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,083
For years, they supported
Himura in any way they could,

43
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,183
such as spying on a group and
giving him vital information.

44
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:25,213
It was a mistake not to have
taken care of them sooner.

45
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:29,123
That's right, but a
sneak attack's not right!

46
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,293
Only one thing matters now,

47
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,303
and that's for Mr. Shishio

48
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,243
to gain control of
the entire country

49
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:35,103
and nothing less will do.

50
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,323
When you're playing
for stakes this high,

51
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:38,103
there's no right or wrong.

52
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:40,203
We have to make the best
of this opportunity!

53
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,263
Results are all that matter,

54
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,123
and if a sneak attack on Aoiya

55
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,243
will increase our
chance of winning,

56
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,053
that's what we should do!

57
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,083
I see.

58
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,043
Just one question.

59
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,123
How can I trust anyone

60
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,083
who suggests a strategy
so dishonorable?

61
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,233
Huh?

62
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,183
I told Himura that I was
challenging him to a duel,

63
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,263
an honorable battle
between two worthy opponents,

64
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:02,173
and I will not break my word!

65
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:04,243
And it will be a
fight to the death!

66
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,233
Those are the
conditions we agreed upon,

67
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,063
and being a man of my word,

68
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,123
that's how it's going to be!

69
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:11,313
Understood?

70
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,213
The three men who
are on their way here

71
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:16,223
are three of the finest
fighters Japan has ever seen.

72
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,093
So even against ten to one odds,

73
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,263
they're bound to kill
a few of our men.

74
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:21,183
Now that the Rengoku
has been destroyed,

75
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:24,053
the only asset we
have is Juppongatana.

76
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,263
So we must do
everything in our power

77
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,103
to protect it.

78
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,253
I swore an oath that I
would do anything I could

79
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,243
to lead you to your
goal of total victory!

80
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,163
To help you become
the most powerful leader

81
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:37,173
since Ieyasu Tokugawa.

82
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:39,193
We can no longer worry
about what is right!

83
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:41,253
Victory is the only thing
that matters right now!

84
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:43,083
Failure is unthinkable!

85
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,313
The stakes are too high.

86
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:46,203
You know I'm right!

87
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,143
We have to do whatever's
necessary to gain control!

88
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,213
You understand?

89
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:53,033
By foul means or fair,

90
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,113
any act is justified
as long as we win!

91
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:56,193
You may hate me for saying it,

92
00:04:56,193 --> 00:05:01,053
but that's the way
it has to be, sir.

93
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,243
You've convinced me that
you want me to win, Hoji,

94
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,073
I appreciate that.

95
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,053
Sojiro, summon the Juppongatana!

96
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:09,103
Yes, sir.

97
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:12,233
I want the entire group
assembled in ten minutes!

98
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,283
The three swordsmen
are on their way

99
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:17,103
and will be here shortly,

100
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,293
but before the duel begins,

101
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:21,293
I want to explain what
happened to the Rengoku.

102
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:24,133
We were wondering about
that and another thing.

103
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,203
We were supposed
to set fire to Edo,

104
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:27,313
but they were ready,
and we weren't able

105
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:29,133
to carry out the job.

106
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,253
Yes!

107
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:33,253
You know it was almost like
they knew what our plan was!

108
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:34,273
Why is that?

109
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:36,203
Unavoidable, I'm afraid.

110
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,183
Edo is going to be
burned the same way

111
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:41,293
the Tokugawans burned
Yeido over 250 years ago

112
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:45,133
with the guns of the Rengoku
causing most of the destruction.

113
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:48,213
Unfortunately the plan
failed due to the negligence

114
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:51,083

00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:03,183
This is the Rukutsurane
shrine, Shishio's hideout.

166
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:07,183
Let's show Shishio and his
gang they're not so tough.

167
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:09,263
(footsteps)

168
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:16,063
Huh?

169
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,263
Welcome, Yumi
Komagata is my name.

170
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:23,223
Mr. Shishio asked
me to greet you

171
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:25,053
and to take you to him.

172
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:26,303
Our defenses are impenetrable

173
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:28,303
to anyone who doesn't
know the way through,

174
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:30,253
so I will be your guide.

175
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:33,043
Probably sent a woman so
we'd let our guard down.

176
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,313
Does he really think
that we're that stupid?

177
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,033
Not quite, he only thinks
that you're that stupid,

178
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,243
and he's absolutely right.

179
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:39,313
Stick to fighting, Sano.

180
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,273
We'll do the
thinking, all right?

181
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:45,173
Follow me, please.

182
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,223
Whoa, this isn't just a maze,

183
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,293
it's a huge
underground labyrinth!

184
00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:54,213
One wrong turn and you'd
never find your way out!

185
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:56,143
I've got to admit,
Shishio certainly does know

186
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:58,093
how to protect himself.

187
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,093
(water tinkling)

188
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:05,163
Allow me to explain the rules.

189
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:06,193
Each of you will fight

190
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:09,313
one member of the
Juppongatana in single combat.

191
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:12,243
While that duel is going on,
the other two may watch,

192
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:14,233
but are not allowed
to interfere.

193
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,163
Do you accept these conditions?

194
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:17,143
Yeah, we accept.

195
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:18,113
Whatever you say, lady.

196
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:19,303
Now, come on, can
we get on with it?

197
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,263
I'd just as soon beat
all of them at once,

198
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:23,243
but if Shishio
prefers it this way,

199
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,173
I'll go along with it.

200
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,173
Battousai, you agree?

201
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:29,143
I agree, but there's
one more condition

202
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:30,323
that I will have to insist on.

203
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:32,223
That these duels
are not to the death.

204
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,133
When one fighter is
clearly the winner,

205
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,293
the other is allowed to concede.

206
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:37,143
I'll meet any
opponent in combat,

207
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,303
but I won't stand
for any killing.

208
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,073
Is that understood?

209
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:41,093
Yes, of course!

210
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,263
I understand.

211
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:47,203
Shishio, I don't mean to meddle,

212
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:51,053
but isn't it somewhat dangerous
allowing Sanosuke Sagara

213
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,243
to fight against Anji?

214
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:54,093
Anji was his teacher!

215
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,113
He taught him the
extreme fist technique,

216
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,103
and you know how
strong the bond can be

217

between teacher and student.

218
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:02,153
Anji may feel sympathy
for his former pupil,

219
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:04,193
and he won't be
able to kill him.

220
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:06,223
Anji may be called
"The Depraved Monk,"

221
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:09,073
but he's a monk nonetheless
and has more compassion

222
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:12,153
than the rest of the
Juppongatana put together!

223
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,313

00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,263
and now I've become an
expert at focusing the force

326
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:31,243
of Futae No Kiwami.

327
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:34,053
When I was travelling
between Shimotsua and Edo,

328
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,123
I practiced constantly

329
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,243
by breaking hundreds
of rocks along the way.

330
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,183
You were the one who taught
me the extreme fist technique.

331
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,063
Now that I've perfected it,

332
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,043
somehow I don't think
it would be right

333
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,133
to use it against you.

334
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,053
Perfected it.

335
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,233
I don't think so!

336
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:57,263
The only things you learned
were the basics, Sano.

337
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,253
I'm the only one
who has perfected it.

338
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:06,153
I thought I was his equal,

339
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:10,203
but he's a whole lot better
than I thought he was.

340
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:13,073
Looks like Sanosuke
might be in trouble.

341
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:14,193
Sano!

342
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,273
(groaning)

343
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,123
I thought I could make you
understand why I'm doing this,

344
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:23,323
but it doesn't really
matter whether you do or not.

345
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,183
I won't allow you to get
in my way, understand?

346
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,153
How can I possibly defeat him?

347
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:31,143
He can use the Futae No Kiwami
technique with both hands,

348
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:33,123
both feet, his
knees, his elbows--

349
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:35,253
with any part of his
body, even his head!

350
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:38,033
And all I can do
is use my right hand.

351
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:42,323
So, want me to take your place?

352
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:44,123
No way!

353
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:46,053
I'm not through yet.

354
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,123
You still don't get it, do you?

355
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:48,153
You can't win.

356
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:52,203
I thought you were smart
enough to understand that.

357
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,263
Understanding isn't
his strong point.

358
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,133
Mind your own business!

359
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,193
Sano, focus!

360
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:58,203
What'd you say?

361
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:00,233
Even with an attention
span as short as yours,

362
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,163
you can come up with a way
to win if you just think!

363
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,093
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Kenshin.

364
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,033
Listen, a guy who
fights with one sword

365
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,213
has just as good
a chance of winning

366
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,283
as a guy who fights with two

367
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:13,283
as long as he knows
exactly how to use it!

368
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:15,273
I told you what the rules were.

369
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:17,223
No interference, remember?

370
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,213
You are forbidden
to help him fight.

371
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,233
I know, that's why
I put it into words.

372
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,293
You never said I
couldn't talk to him.

373
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:28,113
I know I can beat
you, Anji, yup.

374
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:32,033
If you think that,
you're a fool.

375
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,053
You don't have a chance, Sano.

376
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:35,073
Is that so?

377
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:36,153
We'll see!

378
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:38,273
(grunting)

379
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:42,113
Just as I thought.

380
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,093
He's trained so hard,
he's become muscle-bound.

381
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:46,153
His muscles have lost
some of their flexibility.

382
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:48,033
His fists are still
incredibly fast,

383
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:51,103
but the rest of his body can't
keep up with his hand speed.

384
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:53,083
He'll have to beat him
with a single blow.

385
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,323
It's the only way.

386
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:58,273
One hand is all I need!

387
00:16:58,273 --> 00:17:00,263
(grunting)

388
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:04,213
See ya later!

389
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:05,283
Got him!

390
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,173
It can't be!

391
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:12,073
Amazing, Anji used
the reverse force

392
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,163
of a blow to his own body

393
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:16,073
to absorb the power
of Sano's punch.

394
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:18,133
As I told you before,

395
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,063
you've perfected nothing!

396
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:26,143
That was a close one.

397
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:30,083
I was lucky to avoid the
full force of his strike.

398
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,233
Sano!

399
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,083
Even though he
barely touched me,

400
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,163
the impact caused
a lot of damage.

401
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:37,033
His strength is incredible.

402
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,253
Sano.

403
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:40,053
I don't want to kill you.

404
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:41,243
Surrender, and
I'll let you live.

405
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,323
Let him live?

406
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:45,153
He can't mean that!

407
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:48,083
Of course he meant it, and
if Sano has any brains at all,

408
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,223
he'd know he has no choice
but to accept the offer,

409
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:54,043
but of course he
won't, the fool.

410
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,093
Anji, what do you
think you're doing?

411
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,093
Shishio gave
everyone instructions

412
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,273
to kill whoever they fought!

413
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:01,313
No, Shishio agreed
that it's up to me

414
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,213
to decide which of my
opponents live or die.

415
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:05,253
So that's it!

416
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:08,063
Now I understand!

417
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:10,153
Having the power to choose
who lives and who dies--

418
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:12,183
that's what it's all
about, isn't it, Anji?

419
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,053
That's what you're hooked on!

420
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:15,323
And Shishio's the one
who gave you that power,

421
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:18,223
so naturally you
worship him like a god!

422
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,293
How sad that you gave
up what you believed in

423
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:22,153
to worship a maniac.

424
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:23,113
You're wrong.

425
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:24,143
It's not like that at all.

426
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,293
I told Shishio at the very first

427
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:28,233
that I would join the
Juppongatana on one condition.

428
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,233
That I would decide which of
my opponents would live or die.

429
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:33,083
I joined him because he knows

430
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,313
the government
must be destroyed.

431
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,113
Shishio will create
a new government,

432
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:41,203
and if Shishio proves
unworthy, I'll destroy him, too.

433
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,273
(gasping)

434
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:46,043
So, the destruction doesn't
end until you're satisfied!

435
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,113
Is that it?

436
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,103
What if you're
never satisfied, Anji?

437
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,083
What then?

438
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,273
Do you just keep on
destroying everything

439
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:53,073
for the rest of your life,

440
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:54,233
tearing down what
the rest of society

441
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,193
has spent years trying to build?

442
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:58,273
You think that you know what
the real world is all about,

443
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,113
but you don't have a clue!

444
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:02,213
The real world is
made up of people!

445
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,143
People who care
about each other,

446
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,263
who work hard because
they believe in the future,

447
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:09,093
and believe that the future
is worth fighting for!

448
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,143
Believe me, Anji,

449
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:12,243
I don't like the Meiji
government any more than you do,

450
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:15,113
but I'll be damned if I'm
gonna let you or Shishio

451
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,103
or the Juppongatana
decide what's best

452
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:19,093
for the people of Japan!

453
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:21,283
I'm gonna win!

454
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:23,123
No problem!

455
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,183
If he really believes that,

456
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,193
I'd say he's a bit out
of touch with reality.

457
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:27,233
What do you think?

458
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,173
I remember the very first
time I ever fought Sano.

459
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,183
He used exactly the same words.

460
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,323
"I'm gonna win," he told me.

461
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,263
I hope he means it this time.

462
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:38,033
(yelling)

463
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:48,033
Seems to me that
Sano doesn't realize

464
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:51,233
that Anji can't be defeated
by a multi-strike attack.

465
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:55,223
One blow correctly
placed would finish him.

466
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:57,263
It's clear that Anji is
defending his left side,

467
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,073
so that Sano can't strike
with his right hand.

468
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,123
You worry too much.

469
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:02,283
Trust me, Saito,
sooner or later,

470
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:04,143
Sano's gonna find an opening.

471
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:05,253
Anji's going down.

472
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:08,043
Hey, how much longer
is this gonna take?

473
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:09,233
You should be done by now!

474
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,223
Come on, Anji, get it over with!

475
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:12,273
This is the first fight,

476
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:15,073
and we're already
behind schedule!

477
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:19,263
♪

478
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:20,283
Well, Sano.

479
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:23,143
Do you give up or do
I have to kill you?

480
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:26,173
I'd rather not, but I
will if you force me to.

481
00:20:28,113 --> 00:20:30,033
Surrender and live
or fight and die.

482
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,303
What is your decision, Sano?

483
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:33,193

Are you really that
concerned about Sano?

486
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,073
What concerns me
is how his death

487
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,143
would affect your
ability to fight.

488
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:44,103
And I gotta quit smokin'.

489
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:47,303
Sano will win, so don't
worry about it, all right?

Nice knowing you, Sano.

You should've surrendered

All right, I admit you
were right, Sano won,

507

he just got lucky.

No.

509
00:21:43,063 --> 00:21:44,263
Earlier when we first
started fighting,

510
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,173
I realized that he
was muscle-bound.

511
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,143
That, in comparison to
the rest of his body,

512
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:51,103
the muscles in his arms
and legs were overdeveloped,

513
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,243
which reduced his
quickness and flexibility.

514
00:21:53,243 --> 00:21:55,053
And once I determined that,

515
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:58,153
I knew he was vulnerable
and that I could beat him.

No one could have
survived that blow.
