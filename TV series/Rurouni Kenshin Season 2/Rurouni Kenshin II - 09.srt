And as for you,
Father Anji,

65
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,060
you spoil these kids rotten
by always being nice to them.

66
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,200
You have to get
angry at them sometimes

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,220
or they'll never behave.

68

But I'm not good
at getting mad.

I don't think I could.

70
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,100
You have to
try harder then.

71
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,130
If you're a human being,

72
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,060
you have to let your
anger out once in a while

73
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,280
or you're gonna go crazy.

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,230
I'll try, all right?

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,280
You'd better.

76
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,030

throwing snow down my back.

does Buddha know?

-The truth that's in our heart.
-The truth that's in our heart.

80
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,280
Look, Father Anji,
I wrote it down.

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,140
Listen children, Buddha is
always going to watch over you.

82
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,060
Especially at times like this
when your parents are away.

83
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,280
Buddha has a special
place in his heart

84
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,240
that he's reserved just
for little children.

85
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,030
Really?

86
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,040
Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,210
Buddha is good to us and
will answer our prayers.

88
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,020
Then will he answer me
and make me taller?

89
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,260
Will spring
get here sooner?

90
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,120
And he can make you and
Tsubaki get married sooner too!

91
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
-Huh?
-Huh?

Tsubaki as your wife.

We know you like each other,
so what are you waiting for?

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,040
Go on and ask her.

96
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,070
Yeah, hurry up.

97
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,090
Please ask her.

Be quiet, I forbid you
to talk about this.

Let's go ask Runa.

100

He'll make sure
they get married.

101

Those poor kids
don't have anyone.

They don't have any family.

103

They want us
to get married

104
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,050
because they think
that will make them

part of a family again.

106

Our wise rulers

I've been taking care of?

Their parents were all

this village is in so
much trouble right now.

127

Their fathers supported the
Tokugawa in the boshin war,

128
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,020

Because of what they did,

133
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,030
our village isn't receiving
any of the reconstruction money

that the Meiji government
is handing out.

And now that temple of yours
is just making matters worse.

136

You must leave at once.

Hmm?

They're just a bunch
of dirty little orphans

142
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,050
and one impoverished priest
without a single parishioner.

143
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,110
No one's gonna care
how we treat them.

144
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,140
Villages that were loyal
to the Meiji government

have been given huge
amounts for renovation

a matter of time

before the reconstruction
fund is depleted.

If we want to get any of
the government's money,

149

Huh?

Will they tear down
the temple where we live?

154
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,060
They say that we're gonna
have to leave the village.

You said if we prayed everything
was gonna be all right.

156
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,170
They say we're gonna
have to leave because--

157
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,190
because of what
our fathers did.

(chuckling)

159

Your fathers were
all good men.

160
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,050
I know they were, because
they hated war and killing,

161
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,070
but regardless of
what side they fought on,

162
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,130
the goal they
were praying

163
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,120
and working
for was peace.

164
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,070
They did nothing for
you to be ashamed of

165
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,070
and were guilty of
nothing dishonorable.
