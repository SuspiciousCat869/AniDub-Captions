Why would Shakku use

that he knew
would break, heh?

What?

The hilt is engraved.

365
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:50,902
It's written in
classical Japanese.

366
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:53,122
Look, "I forged
swords for many years,

367
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:55,902
my son hates that I
never have time for him.

368
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:58,902
This sword is for
my grandchildren."

369
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:00,992
He's saying that all
his life his passion

370
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:03,012
was creating
swords for killing,

371
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,972
to build a new era.

372
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:06,082
But in the end,
he realized

373
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:09,052
there was more to life
than promoting death.

374
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,114
So, he fashioned this
very special sword

375
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:13,673
to reflect his
change in thinking,

376
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,694
he found a
better way

377
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:16,832
to view his
grandchildren's future.

378
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:17,962
I'll bet he
engraved that

379
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:19,872
knowing it would
be his death poem.

380
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:21,892
I guess he knew this was
going to be his last sword

381
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,952
and he really put
his best into it.

382
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:26,042
Even after he changed
his thinking about using

383
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,002
killer swords to
build a new era,

384
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:29,972
he knew that for our
family to survive,

385
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,912
he had to keep
making them.

386
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:32,962
And so he put
his regret

387
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:35,122
and hope for a peaceful
future into this sword.

388
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:38,982
He designed a reverse-edge
shinuchi to help peace.

389
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:40,062
Shinuchi?

390
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:42,072
Yes, when you forge
this type of sword,

391
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:43,872
two pieces are
incorporated

392
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:44,962
to make one blade.

393
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,982
It takes literally weeks
of working the metal

394
00:16:46,982 --> 00:16:49,052
before it melds to
become the strongest,

395
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:50,912
sharpest blade possible.

396
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:51,952
So what you're saying is

397
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:53,982
this particular piece
of metal is the finest,

398
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:56,092
strongest sword blade
that's ever been made.

399
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:59,042
For saving my child's
life, it is yours.

400
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,892
I know it would
make my father happy

401
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:02,102
to know you have it.

402
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:04,112
It is good to see
you again, Battousai.

403
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,092
Well, maybe I
shouldn't call you that.

404
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,882
After all, you are wanted
for your slasher crimes

even though they
were the ones

407
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:12,892
that ordered
you to kill.

408
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,052
I was happily surprised
you left the royalists,

409
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,122
but what have you
done with your sword?

410
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:19,072
Mr. Shakku,
I have decided

411
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,892
that I must change
the way I live my life.

412
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:23,112
I want to find a way
to protect people

413
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,102
without killing others.

414
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:27,922
Huh, I admire
your optimism.

415
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,852
If there is such a way,
I'd certainly embrace it.

416
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,842
So, now, after killing
so many, you've decided

417
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,042
the way of the
sword is wrong,

418
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,112
you'll still need
one to survive.

419
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:37,952
I want you
to have this.

420
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:41,932
It's not my best, but
it will serve you well.

421

You will always
be a swordsman,

422
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,842
and at least this way

423
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:46,922
you will have
something on your back.

424
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:49,072
Someday you'll realize
that no matter how good

I've given you breaks,

Oh, Himura, remember this,
no matter what happens,

I will always be on
your side, my friend.

Thanks, and we
all thank you

Misao so strong.

Hi, Himura,

491
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,892
breakfast's almost ready.

492
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:25,872
Hey, wait, where are
you going anyway?

493
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:27,002
Let me guess,
you're leaving us,

494
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,982
and you weren't even
gonna say anything.

495
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:32,112
I told you
a long time ago

496
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:34,902
that some pretty vicious
people are after me.

497

I just can't have
you risking your life

498
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:39,062
just to be my friend,
it's too dangerous, but I--

499
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:41,092
And just who are you
to tell me what to do?

500
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:43,852
You've got a lot

myself, you know?

Now listen carefully,

I don't care about
your life as Battousai.

said almost exactly the same
thing when I left there.
