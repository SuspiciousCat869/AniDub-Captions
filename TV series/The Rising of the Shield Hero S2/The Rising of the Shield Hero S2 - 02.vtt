WEBVTT

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.058
[breathing heavily]

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.563
[Raphtalia] Master Naofumi!

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:22.773
[Filo] Master!

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.399
[Rishia] Are you all right?!

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.736
Don’t worry.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:29.279
[gasps]

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:31.949
[chuckles]

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.700
I’m totally fine.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.620
There’s no use in lying to me.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:39.164
- You can tell, huh?
- [Filo chuckles]

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.290
- [rocks clatter]
- [all gasp]

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.293
If I’m not mistaken,

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.296
you are the fabled Shield Hero,
are you not?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.549
Yeah. And what about it?

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.008
[woman] I thought so.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.885
I beg of you,

00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:54.638
please kill me
and put an end to this.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.681
Wait, what?

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.142
- [high-pitched screeching]
- [all gasp]

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:03.897
She’s gone.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.274
I don’t see her anywhere.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.735
[Japanese music playing]

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.910
[wind blowing]

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:44.873
[Mirellia] How are
things looking so far?

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.084
[man] After the Spirit Tortoise
destroyed the capital,

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.044
it made its way
toward this border town

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:51.088
before it suddenly
stopped altogether.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.673
And if the legends are correct,

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.216
then it will remain
in that state

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.385
for around two or three days.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.012
[man 2] You mean to tell me
that accursed creature

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.806
destroyed the nation’s capital,

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.683
took the lives
of the royal family,

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.851
and now is taking a nap?

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.229
Legends say
that the Spirit Tortoise

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.605
is more likely to attack

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:11.316
densely populated areas
than others.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.652
If we proceed
with that logic in mind,

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:15.821
then its next target
would be Lowhirot

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.365
and this was merely
a stop along its way.

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:20.701
[man 3] But the Spirit Tortoise
can’t afford to ignore

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.704
a force as large
as the one we’ve amassed for it.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.914
[Naofumi] So what kind of plan
do you have in mind

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:27.708
for destroying
something that big?

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.293
[man 2 grumbles]
The Shield Hero?

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.586
If the Queen’s right,

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.297
then we’ve got two or three days
at the most.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.676
We need to come up with a plan
before it wakes up.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.261
There’s not much time.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:42.431
A plan? We don’t need
a plan for this thing.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.641
We have brave knights
and soldiers

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.601
from every kingdom in the land!

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.104
If we charge in
with our full force,

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.647
that tortoise
won’t stand a chance.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.857
- [staff clunks]
- The man’s right.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.484
We do not need the help
of the Four Heroes!

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.069
- [chair thumps]
- [man 4] Then you’ll fail!

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.155
We must have thrown
tens of thousands

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:01.450
of our most loyal troops
at that walking fortress!

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.744
They fought
with everything they had,

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.454
and they hardly made a scratch!

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.874
Defeating it using conventional
means is impossible!

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.002
So we don’t have a choice.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.796
We need the help
of the Four Heroes to do this.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.343
We’ll help, right?

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.596
Maybe.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.097
[Naofumi] As long as no one’s

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.433
charging into battle
with a death wish.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.518
I want to minimize casualties.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.146
Otherwise it will interfere
with our real job,

00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:32.939
which is to fight the Waves.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.318
If you’re not more polite,
they’re not going to help you.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.236
Now then...

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.198
let us begin formulating
a plan that’s clever enough

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.992
to triumph over
the treacherous Sprit Tortoise.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.998
[sighs]

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.041
[Elrasla] Well, if it isn’t

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.044
my favorite nervous wreck
of a student.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.254
Hey! What’s Eclair doing here?

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.839
[Rishia] Instructor!

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:59.257
What brings you here?

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.842
I caught wind that the Saint

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:03.720
is going to fight
one of the legendary monsters.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:04.846
As soon as I heard that,

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.432
I dropped everything
to come and help out.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.100
And I did the same thing.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.603
This is a threat to my nation
that rivals the Waves.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:14.147
I hope Naofumi
can forgive me for this,

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.649
but I stopped
training the troops

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.609
in order to get here in time.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.236
I see.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.947
[Eclair] Speaking of Naofumi,
where is he?

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.658
I think...
he’s in that building.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.244
Something about a plan
to defeat the Spirit Tortoise?

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.162
It’s not fair that Raphtalia

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.414
is the only one
that gets to go with him!

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.416
And when are we getting food?

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:37.254
[sighs] So that would mean
the Queen is with him right now.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.380
[gasps]

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:41.591
[Rishia] That’s the woman
we saw earlier.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.928
You’ve seen her before?
But she’s...

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.555
[sighs]

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.890
[man 2] Before I hear
what the Shield Hero

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.309
thinks of all this,
I’d like to know what’s taking

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.020
the Seven Star Heroes
so long to get here.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:57.649
[sighs] I’ve received word that
they’ve left their countries

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.443
and are on the way,
but some are far off,

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.529
so they
may not make it in time.

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.155
[Naofumi] Seven Star Heroes?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.533
They use vassal weapons too.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:07.993
However, the weapons
that they wield

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.537
are different
from the Four Cardinal Heroes.

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.331
While some of them were
unexpectedly summoned here

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.041
from another world like you,

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.669
others were chosen
from this world.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.379
Vassal weapons, huh?

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.464
[no audible dialogue]

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:25.719
So there are other heroes
out there besides us?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.845
How strong are they?

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.515
To be perfectly honest,
as of now,

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.393
they are most likely weaker than
you and the other three Heroes.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:36.438
[Naofumi] That’s better
than nothing, I guess.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.276
[sighs] Okay, so where are
these Seven Star Heroes?

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.277
[Mirellia] Well, they’re...

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.279
- [door opens]
- [woman] Excuse me.

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.281
[Mirellia] Aren’t you...

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:47.782
It’s been many years.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.618
We meet again,
Queen of Melromarc.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.161
Hold on a second.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.996
- Isn’t that the...
- Sure is.

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.039
Milady!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.624
I’m so relieved you’re safe.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.042
"Milady"?

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.501
She is the concubine

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.630
of the now-deceased King
of the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.174
and the nation’s regent.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.260
I didn’t give you my name when
we met the other day, did I,

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.386
Shield Hero?

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.932
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.935
I’m Ost Hourai
of Spirit Tortoise Kingdom.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:18.188
[Naofumi] Ost Hourai?

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.651
Correct. And for the time being,
I am the King’s regent.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:25.236
At least, that’s
what the world thinks I am.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.863
[all gasp]

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.449
Contrary
to what you might think,

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.118
I am a familiar
of the Spirit Tortoise.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.370
What?

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.829
[gasps]

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:38.375
I’m not the first
of his familiars you’ve met.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.919
I might be the first
you haven’t slain, though.

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:44.589
[gasps] Don’t tell me.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.466
Does that mean you’re the same

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.636
as all those bats and yetis
we fought off earlier?

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:53.640
Yes. However,
I take the form of a human.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.309
My Lady, what are you saying?

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.311
Oh, forgive me.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.772
But yes, everything was a lie.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.692
- Huh?
- This was simply my job.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.235
As a human-type familiar,

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.988
I was told to get close
to the center of power

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:11.449
and use subterfuge to gather
a small number of souls.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.326
[man 3 sighs]

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.704
Hold up. What the hell
are you talking about?

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.956
Gathering a number of souls?

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:19.708
What do you mean by that?

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:23.378
It is the task of my lord,
the Great Spirit Tortoise,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.214
to block the Waves of Calamity
from appearing.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:29.134
To do so, he must use souls
as a resource.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.719
[gasps] What?

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.846
To block the Waves
from appearing?

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.556
Yes.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.352
Human-type familiars
such as myself

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.563
were tasked
with deceiving those in power

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.815
in hopes of causing
warring countries to fight

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.567
so we could gather souls.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.987
And if that failed,
monster familiars would be used

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:52.032
to gather the souls gradually
from all over the world.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.784
But if neither
of those tactics worked,

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.286
then as a last resort...

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.331
the seal on the Spirit Tortoise
would be broken,

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.709
and in a desperate attempt
to gather enough souls,

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.294
it would roam across the world,

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:06.629
taking the lives
of those crushed beneath it.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:12.343
But this time, someone broke
the seal without any warning,

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.262
meaning the destruction
that the Spirit Tortoise

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.639
is causing now
is against its volition.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:20.143
Even if it stops the Waves,
if it isn’t stopped now,

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.854
there will be
no world left to protect,

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:26.149
and I will not be able
to fulfill my sole duty.

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.110
So please, Shield Hero,
put the Spirit Tortoise

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:32.197
out of its misery
and stop this chaos.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.532
[sighs] You mentioned earlier

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.826
that someone broke the seal,
is that right?

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.788
Is that something
that anybody could have done?

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.665
Only I know the method
to do such a thing,

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:44.292
or at least I thought I was.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:47.170
A human-type familiar
is to inform the Four Heroes

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.422
how to break the seal
should they ever

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:52.342
somehow discover our plans
and defeat us.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.594
What?! And you’re telling us?

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:56.888
Why would you want to do
something like that?

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.182
When the Waves
cannot be stopped,

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:02.185
it falls onto you,
the Four Cardinal Heroes,

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:05.939
to revive the Spirit Tortoise
and gather the necessary souls.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.149
Only then
will the Waves stand still.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.693
What other options are there
at that point?

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.029
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:18.034
[Naofumi] "The world demands
sacrifices from all life."

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:22.080
[sighs] Is that
what you meant, Fitoria?

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:25.208
If everything you just told us
is the truth, then...

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.417
how very cruel.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.461
What a terrible trial
fate has concocted

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.797
for both us
and the Cardinal Heroes.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.758
I’m sorry. Please forgive me.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.593
I can’t believe it.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.637
So all this time,

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.223
you were only deceiving us
with that guise of yours?

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.851
And I thought you
to be someone trustworthy.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.562
Please forgive me,
but it was my duty.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:50.150
I wanted to look the part,
so I played the role.

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.860
Of an evil consort, you know?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.736
[Mirellia] I see.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.156
[Naofumi] So right now,
the Spirit Tortoise is out there

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.366
even though its real self
doesn’t wanna be?

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:01.619
Yes. I believe whoever
managed to break the seal

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.121
is the one controlling it.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.789
I know you’re just a familiar,

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.625
there but must be something
you can do about it, right?

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.793
Don’t tell me you came here

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.045
expecting us to do
the dirty work for you.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.338
Not at all.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.758
I’ll help when I can
and provide any advice I have.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.844
I want to find out
who’s behind this.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:19.137
[clears throat]

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.597
The Spirit Tortoise...

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:23.683
has a tendency to head towards
densely populated areas,

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.810
as more souls
are gathered there.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:29.814
Which would mean that this city
is most likely its next target.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:33.109
[Mirellia] Thank you.
I believe we already knew this

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.819
from the legends, so then...

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.779
- Eh?
- [Naofumi] Anything else?

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.323
Yes, um...

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.866
well, there’s...

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.535
The head.
Do you know about the head?

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:43.995
If you cut its head off,

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.914
then the Spirit Tortoise
will have to stop!

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.248
Believe it or not,

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.918
most monsters tend to die
if you cut their heads off.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.794
- Enough of this!
- [gasps]

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:55.048
The war council standing before
you here is a sacred place!

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.257
Is this a joke?

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.551
If it is, then I’ll
take your head off first!

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:01.137
Who knows? That might get rid
of the Spirit Tortoise as well!

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.015
Sorry.
It doesn’t work like that.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.392
You have to defeat
the real Spirit Tortoise.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.102
Otherwise, I’ll just come back,

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.146
no matter how many times
you might kill me.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.106
[grumbles]

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.902
Calm down. We know how
to defeat the Spirit Tortoise.

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:18.154
We’re just missing
a thought-out plan

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.864
that all of us can rally behind.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.741
What’s more important
right now is...

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.702
A leader. We need to decide
who will take charge.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.287
Wait, what?

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:27.580
We will.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.290
We’re providing
the bulk of the corps,

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.000
so it only makes sense
we take command.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:34.212
Oh, really? And how do you
plan on taking its head off

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.422
without the power
of our siege weapons?

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:39.259
Last I checked, we had the most,
so I should lead.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.887
That said, If I’m not mistaken,
Melromarc is providing

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.889
the majority
of the funding, right?

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:48.268
On top of that, they were able
to procure the Shield Hero.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.145
That isn’t the issue
we’re dealing with right now.

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:54.941
She’s right! It doesn’t matter
who ends up taking command,

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.652
as long as we’re all
in agreement that our battalion

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:00.280
is the clear choice to take
the vanguard of the charge.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.364
[man 1] What difference

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.032
is one battalion
going to make in a charge?

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.367
- [chair scrapes]
- [man 3] He’s right!

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.202
You should stay in the rear,
where your forces belong!

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.204
[man 4] How are we
supposed to avenge our dead

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.456
- if we’re in the rear?
- You’ll die for nothing!

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.959
[man 4] If it brings victory,
we’ll die gladly!

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.085
I’ve heard enough!

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.253
I couldn’t care less

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.213
about who’s in charge
of you people,

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:19.924
but if you keep this up, then
I’m through with all this crap.

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.012
[officers murmur]

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:25.388
Watch your tone!

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.265
You have no right
to speak like that!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.100
If you’ve got a plan
that will take down

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.768
the Spirit Tortoise
with minimal casualties,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.395
then I’ll take anybody’s orders.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.063
I’ll even give the orders.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.858
However, if you’re all
gonna waste your time here

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.485
arguing about who’s gonna get
the credit for defeating it,

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.029
then just forget it.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.238
What?

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.407
I can take care of it myself.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:48.286
The only reason I’m here is so
that I can protect my territory.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.954
Sit here and complain
all you want.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.205
[Raphtalia gasps]

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:53.291
[polite grunt]

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.626
- [footsteps fading]
- [Ost sighs]

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.885
[wind blowing]

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.181
[ominous music playing]

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.606
[Eclair] It ended
without an agreement?

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:20.068
Not that I should be surprised,
but what is he doing?

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.779
Oh, well.
Guess we’re fighting it alone.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.614
That sounds
like the Saint’s style.

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.866
Does he have any idea
what he’s done?

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.409
We can’t do this all alone,

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:31.079
not when its big enough
to step on all of us at once.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.206
Please forgive me.

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:35.375
If only I had tried
to be more mysterious,

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.001
then they
may have listened to me.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.378
[Elrasla] Huh?

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:39.629
[Raphtalia gasps]

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.256
Oh, pardon me,

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.675
but would you mind
maybe introducing yourselves?

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.803
Oh, of course!

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:50.056
I never did give you my name
last time we met, did I?

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.766
My name is Raphtalia.

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.726
And this one over here is...

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:56.312
You can call me Filo!

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:59.148
M-My name is Rishia Ivyred.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.567
My name’s Elrasla Grilaroc,

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.028
and I’m known
as the heir to Hengen Muso.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.657
And I am Eclair Seyaette,
Lord of the Seyaette lands.

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:08.866
[chuckles]

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.244
Speaking of which,
Master Naofumi

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:14.831
is a ruler of a demi-human area
within Seyaette.

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:17.291
[Raphtalia] Eclair was both
kind and skilled enough

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.293
to volunteer
and train the demi-humans

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.712
about the basics
of swordsmanship.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:24.048
On top of training
the demi-humans,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.135
she’s been training
Rishia and I in her spare time

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:30.430
[Ost] Oh, my.
How thoughtful of her!

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.723
[Eclair] My father died
in the first Wave,

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.892
so everything I’ve done
was to try and atone

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:38.771
for his failure
to protect their village.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:42.108
However, I don’t think anything
can atone for what he did.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.986
Eclair, you’ve done
your absolute best,

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:46.654
and that’s more than enough.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:49.699
I mean, just look at how much
I’ve improved with my sword.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.326
I couldn’t be
more grateful to you.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.744
That goes for me too!

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.914
It fills me with joy
to hear that.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:57.915
[all chuckle]

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.625
Oh, forgive me.

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.836
I never gave you
my name either.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.630
You’re the regent
of the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.215
I’ve heard of you, Ost Hourai.

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.092
Oh, that was just a lie.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.093
- What?
- Huh?

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.344
A lie?

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:11.888
[Ost] It’s a bit
of a long story.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:14.599
[Raphtalia sighs]

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.353
[insects chirping]

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.230
[Raphtalia]
You’re not cold out here?

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.398
[Naofumi sighs]

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.527
It gets chilly at night
around this area, doesn’t it?

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.571
Yeah, but I’m fine.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.699
[Raphtalia]
It sure is a pretty town.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.242
[Naofumi] Yeah.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.578
[Raphtalia] If it weren’t for
what happened, I bet the lights

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.289
inside all of the houses
would make it even prettier.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.916
[Naofumi] I bet.

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:41.375
[water flowing]

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:43.669
You think this town
will be destroyed too?

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:47.089
From the destruction
of the Spirit Tortoise?

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.550
At this rate,
it sure does look like it.

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.052
How sad.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.637
We can’t change that?

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.347
Who knows?

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:57.558
I think it’s amazing that our
village is so important to you.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.894
It’s quite admirable.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.729
Although,
I don’t want you thinking

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.397
the village
is all that matters.

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:04.649
[Naofumi sighs]

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.777
You might not agree
with what I’m about to say,

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.487
but I don’t think those generals

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.822
are as mean-spirited
as you think.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.658
Deep down,
I’m sure that they want

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.702
to protect their homelands
as much as you do.

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:20.039
They just want a leader
that can do that for them.

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.082
[Naofumi] Hmm.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:22.792
And you said it yourself,

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:24.293
that you’d be willing
to take command

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:26.295
if there was a good plan, right?

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.380
[gasps]

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:28.881
Then let’s think of one.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:30.841
With Filo, Rishia,
and the Queen,

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.052
anything is possible.

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.554
If our plan is good enough,

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:37.807
the generals will have nothing
left to complain or argue about.

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:41.435
Which means everyone
will want to rally behind you.

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:43.229
I mean, why wouldn’t they?

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.147
You are the Shield Hero,
after all.

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:46.816
[wind blowing]

00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:48.317
[gasps]

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.443
[chuckles]

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.153
Some pep talk.

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:54.907
[dramatic music playing]

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.117
[Naofumi]
If the Spirit Tortoise goes

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:58.369
wherever there’s
a large number of souls,

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:01.747
then there’s no reason for us
to wage battle inside the town.

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:03.749
We’ll use our numbers
to lure it out.

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:06.210
And remember,
you don’t need to defeat it.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:09.797
You only need to pin it down.
We can take care of the rest.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:12.508
Haikazuya will provide
a dragon-rider battalion

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.176
to serve as decoy.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:17.680
When it comes to cavalry,
heavy troops, and archers,

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.683
no one comes close
to the strength of our nation.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.893
And as for pinning it down...

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.938
There’s no need to worry.
Lowhirot has already stationed

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.690
every siege weapon
in its control.

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.400
No matter how large it is,

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.361
we can at least
knock out one of its legs.

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:33.654
That’s good.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:36.324
However, that still
might not be enough.

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:37.325
[gasps]

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.952
That’s not in use, is it?

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.370
[man 2] I highly doubt it.

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:43.414
That’s a fortress
from the last great war.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:46.375
It’s safe to say it’s
been abandoned for decades.

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:48.461
Think we’re able
to bring it down?

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:49.962
With ritual magic or something?

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:53.341
I’m sure Mideus can provide
the mages that could do it,

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:55.635
but keep in mind
it will only work once.

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:58.346
We’ll do it as many times
as you want,

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.890
as long as you don’t care
how many mages die.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:02.975
On the other hand,

00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:06.062
we have more than enough bombs
to blow up a mountain.

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:07.938
We never got
a chance to use ’em.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.857
[Naofumi]
Let’s go with the bombs.

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.610
We’ll keep
the multicaster magic for later.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.612
Very well.
We’ll proceed with that.

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.530
[Mideus officer grunts]

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:19.492
Now then, we might have
all that taken care of,

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.410
but we need a plan for its head.

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:24.038
It would be hard
to do it with this.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.706
You think I could eat it,
Master?

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:27.041
Probably not.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.584
What?

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:31.545
We’ll head back and
come up with a plan ourselves.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:34.256
Agreed. With me
and my student’s Hengen Muso,

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:36.425
along with
Raphtalia’s swordsmanship,

00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:39.220
I’m sure there’s a way
to take this tortoise down.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.639
Naofumi, sorry to interrupt,

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.766
but is there
anything I can to do help?

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:45.059
Hmm.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.353
Why don’t you go with Ost
and try to learn

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:48.938
what you can
about the Spirit Tortoise.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:50.272
Huh?

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:52.483
[Naofumi]
That’s an important job, Rishia.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:53.484
Probably.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.611
Let’s do our best!

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:56.696
Right.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.743
[music playing]

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:40.781
Oh, right. I stopped at
the capital before coming here,

00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:41.991
where your friend Erhardt

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:43.909
trusted me
with something to give to you.

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:45.202
[Naofumi] Hmm?

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.120
I’ll get it.

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.916
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.835
[gasps]

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.754
[Rishia] How do I look?

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.130
Kweh! Kweh!

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:57.590
[Raphtalia]
Just like the real thing!

00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:59.925
[Filo] When have I
ever said, "Kweh"?

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.886
- [laughter]
- [Rishia] Kweh! Kweh!

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.140
So you’re journeying
with the Shield Hero

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.350
for the sake
of the Bow Hero, huh?

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:10.644
You want to fight by his side
one day that badly?

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.396
That sums it all up.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:13.856
But when you say it like that,

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.942
it makes me sound like
an awful person, doesn’t it?

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:19.320
It was my choice
to bring you with me,

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.322
so try not to be
so hard on yourself.

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:23.324
R-Right.

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.826
I bet you’re in love
with the Bow Hero, aren’t you?

00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:27.411
Eh?!

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.704
If you are, then I have

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:30.623
just the perfect advice
to give you!

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:33.125
I’m not too sure I can help
with the Spirit Tortoise,

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:34.251
but I can with this!

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.379
Y-You think so?
What could I do?

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.257
The key is to get intimate
as fast as possible!

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.051
- [gasps]
- Hmm?

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.844
Make a move and think later!

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:46.639
I’ve lost track of how many
royals I’ve been able to seduce

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.265
just by making the first move.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.976
Wh-Wh-What? I can’t do that!

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.896
And after all, it’s not
like I’m in love with him!

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:55.189
- Come on.
- [Elrasla chuckles]

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:56.857
You’re telling me
you haven’t considered it?

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.651
- [gasps]
- [Naofumi] Who knows?

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:01.362
Maybe something will come of it
if you plant one on him.

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:02.988
- Stop! I’m begging you!

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.366
[Elrasla] Oh, to be young
and in love again.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:07.493
- [chuckles]
- Does that really work?

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:08.911
And how would you know?

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.622
- [high-pitched screeching]
- [all gasp]

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:16.585
[Ost] The Spirit Tortoise.
