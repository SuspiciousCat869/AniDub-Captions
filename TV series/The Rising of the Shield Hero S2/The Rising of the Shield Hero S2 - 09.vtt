WEBVTT

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:10.802
[rain pounding]

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:13.847
[grunts] Kizuna,

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.474
hurry and send us
back over there!

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:17.142
Calm down, Naofumi.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.478
That’s just what
that Kyo guy wants us to do.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.688
Who cares?! I’d rather

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.565
fall for whatever trap
he’s got waiting for us

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:25.776
than leave Raphtalia there
to fight for herself!

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.195
[sighs]

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.158
[gasps] I can’t.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.410
That means they must have
shut it off from the other side.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:38.038
[groans] Of course he did,
that piece of shit.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.542
- [gasps]
- What do we do now?

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.544
Look, Naofumi,
I know someone here

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.462
who has a real talent
for finding people.

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:47.965
If we ask him for help,
I’m sure he’ll find her,

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.883
so calm down, okay?

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.468
- [man] Dame Kizuna?
- Huh?

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.804
Oh! It really is Dame Kizuna!

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.806
[both panting]

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.349
[whimpers]

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.643
No need to worry.
These guys are from Sikul,

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:00.811
so they’re on our side.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.564
I’m overjoyed
to welcome you back home.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:04.815
Good to be back.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:05.732
Hmm?

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.071
Sorry, but I need
a favor from you.

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.574
Can you see
if Ethnobalt is around?

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.409
[music playing]

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.578
- [lizard squawking]
- [animals growling]

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:21.540
[man] Quit struggling,
and come on!

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.459
Stop! I don’t wanna go!

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.671
Let go of me, please!

00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:29.631
[man growls]

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.925
Thanks to all
this damn rain we’ve had,

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.385
my customers
have been driven away.

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:35.429
[whimpers]

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.264
[energy surges]

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:40.225
[chuckles]

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.978
[chirping]

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.104
Quit your yappin’!

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:46.273
Lucky for me
I found a mutant like you

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.442
who’s gonna make me
a lot of money tomorrow!

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:49.484
[chuckles]

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.694
[chirps]

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.622
[birds chirping]

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:26.957
[nobleman] Then it’s true!

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.292
They really did capture
our nation’s Cardinal Hero

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.086
and lock her up
in the Infinite Labyrinth!

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:33.046
This is an unforgivable act!

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.966
I can guarantee Mikakage
will be hearing from us!

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.510
[Kizuna] Yeah, you guys
go ahead and do that.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.429
Escaping from
the Infinite Labyrinth

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.098
is thought to be impossible.
How were you able to do it?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.599
With help!

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.852
It’s all thanks to them
I escaped.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.187
- Oh!
- It all makes perfect sense.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.190
You went out of your way to save
our country’s Cardinal Hero.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.025
We can’t thank
the two of you enough.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.152
Wait, what?

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.695
Oh, it was nothing, really.

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:57.988
Seriously! [laughs]

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.866
- You can call her Rishia.
- [chuckles]

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.285
And his name
is Naofumi Iwatani!

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.453
And get this.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.537
He’s a Cardinal Hero,

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.747
- just like me!
- [crowd exclaims]

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.165
Except he’s from another world.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.666
[both gasp]

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:11.460
[uneasy music playing]

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.963
[crowd grumbling]

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.466
Was it something that I said?

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.927
Dame Kizuna, distance yourself
from that vile man.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.345
Call the guards at once!

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.474
The only reason he’s come here
is to destroy our world.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.976
You think Naofumi’s here
to destroy our world?

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.978
[Rishia] Huh?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.480
[growls]

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.106
That doesn’t make any sense!

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.984
How can you say such a thing
after he saved my life?

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.111
If not for him,
I would have died there.

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.529
[Naofumi groans]

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:46.411
Where are you going?

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.038
Naofumi, wait!

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.671
Oh? and where do you
think you’re going?

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.759
[gentle music playing]

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:01.968
[Kizuna] Hey, Ethnobalt!

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.389
It’s been quite some time,
Kizuna.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.016
I feel like
I spent the entire day

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.267
trying to get ahold of you,

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.144
but I’m too slow
and keep missing you.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.104
And who the hell are you?

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.856
[chuckles] I take it

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.108
you’re the Cardinal Hero
that’s from another world.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.860
You wanted me to find someone
for you. Is that right?

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.237
[gasps]

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.447
Pleased to meet you.
I am Ethnobalt,

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.241
wielder of
the Boat Vassal Weapon.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.661
Kizuna, take this
if you will, please.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.330
It’s no exaggeration to say
that he missed you quite a lot.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.290
[Kizuna laughs] Thank you!

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.918
I can’t believe that you
held on to him for me!

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.920
Of course.
However, it was Glass

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.255
that was keeping him at first,

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.881
but she has been
rather busy lately.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.800
[energy warbling]

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.595
[squeaks]

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:46.805
Oh, Chris!

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.431
[squeaking]

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.767
I’m so happy to see you,
I could explode!

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.602
S-Sorry, Kizuna...

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:53.603
but what is that?

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.981
Eh? Oh, this little guy?

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.400
Allow me to introduce you
to my shikigami, Chris.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.401
[squeals]

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.112
A shiki... gami?

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.657
Yup. Glass and I are actually
the ones who made him.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.452
Four days ago, Chris suddenly
started acting crazy.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.955
Thinking back, that must
have been right around the time

00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:14.499
you escaped from the Infinite
Labyrinth, wasn’t it?

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.876
Yeah.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.837
Lucky for us, Chris will
tell us where Glass is too.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.549
I see! Shikigami are good
at finding people!

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:24.467
Uh, hold on.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.177
If Chris can only
help find Glass,

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.179
then how do we find
Raphtalia and Filo?

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.307
I guess we’ll
have to make Naofumi

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.850
a shikigami for himself.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.852
[Naofumi gasps] But how?

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.854
Huh. Let’s see.

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:38.023
Well, first you’ll need
the blood of the owner

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.734
and then something to function
as a shikigami catalyst.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:44.070
Something from Raphtalia,
maybe like...

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.864
A single strand
of her hair would work!

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.116
[Naofumi]
A strand of her hair?

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.993
I absorbed some in my shield.

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:52.495
Raphtalia’s hair...

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.955
This is it.

00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.461
Oh, wow.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.588
I guess he had some after all.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.466
[Kizuna] All that’s left is
a bit of your blood, Naofumi.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:09.638
Now the ritual to create
the shikigami shall begin.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:12.057
[mysterious music playing]

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.898
Conjure something
to protect them,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.608
something that can offer
them power

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.901
in their time of need.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:26.029
A creation born from
a fragment of their magic

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:27.781
that serves as servant.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.784
Let the one
who lives to protect be born!

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.744
[gasps] Could it possibly be...

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.038
D-Does this normally happen?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.959
It does. It’s just happening
much faster than usual.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.378
Who in the world
does this catalyst belong to?

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:47.300
I unlocked
the Shikigami Shield?

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.178
[squeals]

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.846
[gasps]

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:52.764
- [gasps]
- Huh?

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.019
[shikigami] Raph!

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.688
[Naofumi] This is a shikigami?

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.357
It sure is!
Nice work, Naofumi!

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.775
[Ethnobalt] You know,
for a moment there,

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.068
I was worried it wouldn’t work.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.153
I’m glad to see
it panned out after all.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.530
[shikigami] Hmm?

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.993
[grunts] Raphtalia?

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:15.203
You should be celebrating,
Naofumi!

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.247
Since the ritual worked,
that means the person

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.832
the catalyst
originally belonged to

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.625
is still alive
out there somewhere.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.793
[gasps] So then that means--

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.586
That Raphtalia’s
safe and sound.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:24.921
[sighs] What a relief.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:27.173
[gasps]

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.342
The shikigami sure is cute, huh?

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.011
But there’s no telling for sure

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.887
just how long
Raphtalia will be safe,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.889
which means we should
get a move on, you guys.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.142
Yeah, I’m well aware of that.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.936
But it’s not just Raphtalia.
There’s Filo too,

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.604
and we’re finding them,
no matter what,

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.814
- right?
- [Rishia] Right!

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.941
Your name is Ethnobalt,
isn’t it?

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.985
You didn’t have to do this,
but you did.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:47.986
You have my thanks.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.821
Well, then, I wish you
the best of luck

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.281
in your continued search
for your friend.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.365
[sniffs] Hold on.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.242
- Are you human?
- Eh?

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.286
[Kizuna] You could tell
just from sniffing him?

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.829
[chuckles]
You’re amazing, Naofumi.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.039
To be honest,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.957
I could tell something was off
from the start.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.127
[gentle music playing]

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.712
[Naofumi] A rabbit?

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:06.796
Huh?

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.298
But he’s not just a rabbit!

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:10.341
He’s a descendant
of a species of monster

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.677
that have protected
this world for generations.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:16.139
He’s a descendant of monsters
that protect this world?

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:18.725
So that’s what’s going on.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.894
Well, this is
out of the ordinary.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.729
You almost never reveal
your true form

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.981
in front of people
you only just met, Ethnobalt.

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:27.275
I can’t explain it,
but oddly enough,

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.360
it felt safe to do
in front of him.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.029
Oh?

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:34.532
I’m beginning to think that
animals really like Naofumi.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.909
[grunts]

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.828
Anyway, just because
you can make shikigami,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.497
doesn’t make you good
at finding people,

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:41.873
unless I’m missing something.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.249
He sure is blunt.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.794
That might be true,
but it’s just who Naofumi is.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.546
But of course I can do
much more than that.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:52.217
Ethnobalt is actually the
Boat Vassal Weapon’s wielder.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:55.637
His boat can take us to
the person you’re looking for.

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.931
You can’t use
the Return Dragon Vein again?

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.766
If the place
we were trying to go to

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:02.227
wasn’t totally locked off,
I could.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.521
But his skill
is way cooler than that!

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.606
How? It’s just a ship, isn’t it?

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.316
All right,
let’s go someplace else

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.442
so I can show you.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:23.915
[Rishia gasps]

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.544
Th-That boat
is floating in midair!

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.171
You mean the "boat" was
that thing he was standing on?

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.381
[shikigami] Raph!

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.427
Where is Raphtalia being kept?

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.428
Raph?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.596
Don’t tell me

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.515
you’re not going to give it
a name, Naofumi.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.184
A name?
I mean, sure, eventually.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.186
Now tell me
where Raphtalia’s being kept.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.730
Just give it a name,
for crying out loud.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:48.898
And ask nicely.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.067
Hey, Chris,
do you know where Glass is?

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:51.985
[trills]

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:54.404
Raph.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.364
Huh? Does that mean...

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:59.409
That they’re somehow
located in the same place?

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.327
- [Ethnobalt] That’s not good.
- [gasps]

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.163
[Naofumi] And why is that?

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:06.457
They’re in Raybul,
who are allied with Mikakage,

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.626
the ones that locked me
in the Infinite Labyrinth.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.296
To give you an idea
of what it’s like over there,

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.590
that jerk Kazuki is from Raybul.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.133
So it’s an enemy country?

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.218
You seem to have
an awful lot of those.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.803
It’s not like it’s my fault.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.556
Practically the whole world has
been on edge for some time now.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.058
I mean, a war could break out
at any given moment.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.186
If Raphtalia and Glass
are still in Raybul,

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.395
then that means...

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.981
That it’s likely
they’ve both been captured.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.275
Even if it’s a trap,
we have to go.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.694
I hope by some chance
Filo is there too.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.988
I’ll shall begin
warping the ship, then.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.115
So you can use portals
to travel?

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.575
We’re riding
along the connections

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.285
between dragon hourglasses.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.120
It’s not a portal,
but it might be better.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.580
It is for us,

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.624
since we don’t have to first
register with the hourglass

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.584
or be transported
right in front of it.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.085
I see how it’d be dangerous

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.588
if the hourglass were right
inside their headquarters.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.758
Seems like a major improvement
over Return Dragon Vein.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.801
[chuckles]
While it’s a useful ability,

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.553
I’m afraid that it’s
all I can do.

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.639
Are you kidding me?
That’s more than enough.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.098
I told you that Ethnobalt

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.975
would be able
to help us find her.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.727
[chuckles]
Waiting for your return

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.229
was worth it in every way.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.897
I can finally be of use to you.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.945
[man] Wow! I’ve never
seen anything like that!

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.947
Open those wings, you brat!

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.406
- Do it!
- [whip cracks]

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.867
[whimpers]

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.619
[crowd murmuring]

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.121
[crying]

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.748
Now put on a show, and sing!

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:29.874
Sing, goddamn it!

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.794
If you’re out there,
Master, please help!

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.712
[birds chirping]

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.341
[Kizuna] If we showed up
in the sky above them,

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.093
we’d stick out
like a sore thumb,

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.804
so we’ll land outside the town
and sneak our way in.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.391
Just say the word,
and I’ll return!

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.559
- [both laugh]
- Stay safe, and good luck!

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.605
[street chatter]

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.152
Besides being a bit more modern,
it looks just like Mikakage.

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.948
Looks like the sun
is starting to set.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.534
What should we do? It’s not
like we can stay at an inn.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:06.536
We know what direction she’s in.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.037
I say we just walk all night.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.831
The faster we get there,
the better!

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.791
I’ll do my best to stay up!

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:14.669
Oh, wait. Hey, what was
all that nonsense back there

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.629
about Naofumi
destroying the world?

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.841
I don’t know what the people at
the castle were talking about.

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:21.551
I meant to ask
Ethnobalt about it

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.594
while we were back there,
but I forgot.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.930
He also mentioned that Glass
was busy with something.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:26.848
[gasps]

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.434
I never asked,

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.103
but what was she doing
in your world, Naofumi?

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.187
What’s the matter?

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.731
[grunts]

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:38.359
I can hear it.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.485
Huh?

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:40.903
[panting]

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.071
Hey, where are you going?

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.906
[Rishia]
That’s the wrong way, Naofumi!

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.074
[sighs]

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.872
[ominous music playing]

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:52.081
[panting]

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.958
[thinking]
<i>It’s not Raphtalia’s...</i>

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.460
<i>but that voice...</i>

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:57.628
[gasps]

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.464
No way. Could it be?

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.841
[running footsteps]

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.760
[crowd murmurs]

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:07.013
[panting]

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.182
What has gotten into you
all of a sudden?

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.726
Behold the celestial maiden
from the heavens!

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:14.479
We’re wrapping up shop
for today, ladies and gentlemen,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.106
but make sure to stop on by
to see her tomorrow!

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.649
The celestial maiden?

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.068
What is going on here?

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:23.029
Celestial maiden
from the heavens?

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.448
[Rishia] Oh, no.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.991
[Filo] Get off of me!

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.701
Somebody, please help!

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.328
Rishia, Raphtalia,
where are you?!

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.288
[man] It makes me
sick to my stomach.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.623
[man 2] I know what you mean.

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:35.041
[Filo] I’m begging you!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.959
- Master, please!
- That’s enough out of you!

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.961
- Take her away at once!
- [chain clinks]

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:40.004
[man 3] Is that really singing?

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.381
I don’t know
what she’s saying,

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.257
but it sounds to me
like she’s crying.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.635
[man 4] I feel bad for her,
to be honest.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:47.470
Filo.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:48.471
Filo!

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.265
No! Naofumi, stop!

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.935
Causing a fuss here will
only get us captured again!

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.187
Let go. I’m going to kill him
where he stands.

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.231
I want that too,
but we can’t do it here.

00:14:58.272 --> 00:14:59.649
It’ll cause
too much of a scene!

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.359
If we wait for night to fall,

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.860
we can sneak in and save her!

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.532
You’re being way too loud.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.034
I don’t think anyone here can
understand what she’s saying,

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.327
but we have to be careful.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.454
You’re right.
We need to get Filo back safe.

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:16.165
If we get captured, there’s
no getting her out of there.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.334
[wind blowing]

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.088
Do you think it’s possible

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.965
that this is another one
of Kyo’s traps?

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:26.426
I don’t give a shit if it is.
I’m sick of this.

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:27.593
We can torture that guy

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.470
until he tells us the truth
about everything.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:31.597
At least tell us
you’re gonna question him.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.391
Is there really
that much of a difference?

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.143
Well, no. It’s just that...

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:37.145
Let’s go.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:40.481
When they get intense,
those two are kinda scary.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.027
[animals grunting]

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.242
[sighs] It feels like
breaking and entering

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:52.952
has become
a new hobby of mine.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.163
It’s not like the laws here
mean anything to us.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.919
Filo, it’s us.
Where are you, Filo?

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.754
[chirping]

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.717

- [chirps]
- [both gasp]

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.396
[Kizuna]
That’s a humming fairy chick.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:23.316
They’re bird monsters
said to be able to sing.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:26.068
Whatever it is, it doesn’t
look like it’s a filolial.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.069
Let’s look somewhere else.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.280
No. It’s Filo!

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:32.241
[chirping]

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.202
[laughs]

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:35.953
But it’s not a filolial.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.705
It’s you, isn’t it, Filo?

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:38.915
It has to be you!

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.875
[chirping]

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.585
You really think it’s Filo?

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.171
What’s wrong?
How come you can’t transform?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.632
[Rishia] It looks like
there’s talismans on the cage!

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.217
They’re servant talismans.

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:52.178
That’s strange. You usually just
put one on the monster itself.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.013
He must have put them
on the cage too,

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.265
in order to keep
her monster crest from working!

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.266
How cruel!

00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:59.227
[chirps]

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:02.271
Kizuna, Do you think
you can cut open the cage?

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:05.066
Of course I can, but I
have no idea what’ll happen

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:06.943
if I destroy
all those talismans.

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.653
If I can use
the monster crest...

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.991
Filo, hang in there
just a little longer!

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:17.620
[squawks]

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.124
Now, Kizuna!

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.252
I’m on it!

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.048
I knew you would come, Master!

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.425
[crying]

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.637
You’re okay.

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.014
Thank goodness. What a relief.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.474
But I don’t get it.

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:41.519
How were you able to tell
that humming fairy was her?

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.646
How could I ever mistake
my dear companion

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.523
- for anything else?
- [door slides]

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.275
Who’s causing all this ruckus?

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.693
Oh, I get it.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:49.986
A bunch of lowlife criminals

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.238
broke in trying to steal
my golden goose, huh?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.490
You think
we’re the criminals here?

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:58.077
I ought
to teach you some manners!

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.414
[shield shrieks]

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.040
[groans]

[screams]

<i>Sing for us!</i>

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:12.800
[screaming]

[wind blowing]

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:21.017
[Kizuna] That shield’s power
is simply amazing.

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.686
Raph.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.230
Speaking of which,
that shield kind of broke him

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.190
after he confessed everything.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.775
It broke his mind, I mean.

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:32.862
It’s a bit underwhelming that he
was just the son of a noble

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.530
making a little money
off a sideshow.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.324
But he did mention that his dad

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.117
was the person
who came across Filo

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.328
when she was
completely unconscious.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:43.748
If so, then it may have been
Kyo who gave her to his father.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:47.126
[sighs] That guy was
a total scumbag, huh?

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.920
How could he do that to
a cute little crybaby like her?

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.505
[laughs] Believe it or not,

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.550
Filo’s normally full of energy
and almost never cries.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.802
Really?
Well, here’s a question.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:58.638
If she’s what you
called a filolial,

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:01.057
then why did she become
a humming fairy in this world?

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:03.559
[Naofumi] If filolial
don’t exist in this world,

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.478
she may have been assigned
a similar race

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:06.937
to make up for it.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.065
But she can still transform
into a human.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:12.401
I’m guessing that means
she must have a unique power

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.278
as a future filolial queen.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.238
Raph.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.658
[both chuckle]

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:20.618
[peaceful music playing]

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:26.415
Master, are you awake?

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:27.917
What is it, Filo?

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:31.587
You’re not going to disappear
like that ever again, are you?

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:32.546
[gasps]

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.759
[no audible dialogue]

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:42.056
Never. The two of you
are stuck with me forever.

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.933
[chuckles]

00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:51.273
[footsteps shuffling]

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:52.733
Raph!

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:54.068
Back off!

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.655
Master was my master first,
which means he’s mine!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.657
She seems to be
feeling a lot better,

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.575
but now she’s
not leaving Naofumi’s side.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.619
She must have
been really scared back there.

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.706
Hey, Master, who is this
riding on your shoulder?

00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:09.834
Because whoever it is smells
a whole lot like Raphtalia.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.378
It’s a shikigami
made from Raphtalia’s hair,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.296
and It’s been traveling
with us since yesterday.

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.006
Oh?

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.133
You could be Raphie!

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:20.094
[all] Raphie?

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.929
Raph.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.806
- Raph!
- Well, I guess that’s its way

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.099
of approving the new name.

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.727
Hi! I haven’t
introduced myself yet.

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.646
My name’s Kizuna Kazayama,
and this is my shikigami Chris!

00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:31.689
[squeaks]

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:34.066
Kizuna and Chris
are my new best friends!

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.776
She’s adorable.

00:20:35.818 --> 00:20:37.945
I bet Filo’s a good girl,
isn’t she, Naofumi?

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:40.030
Maybe just start
as friends first.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.449
Watch it, Naofumi.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.908
[man] You’re not safe
anywhere these days.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.869
- Huh?
- [crowd murmuring]

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.749
People might already be talking
about what happened yesterday,

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.125
so you have to hide, Filo.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.001
[gasps]

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.424
Does it say anything important?

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.426
Yeah, it’s all about
how Filo was stolen.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.887
From the looks of it,
the room was too dark

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.930
for them to make out
any description of us, though.

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.641
Lucky your bird form
is so small.

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:09.643
It also says...

00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:12.313
[gasps] This one’s
about something different.

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:14.106
"Katana Vassal Weapon wielder...

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.900
was found,
but then somehow escaped."

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.569
The nation’s doing
everything it can to find them.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.738
The Katana
Vassal Weapon Wielder?

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.406
But how is that important for--

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.366
[gasps] What the...

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:26.410
What’s wrong, Naofumi?

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:28.329
No. [gasps]

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.997
Raphtalia’s stats...

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.123

But why?

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:34.794
I don’t know.

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.212
Something felt wrong,
and then...

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.130
[gasps] No way.

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:40.132
You don’t think...

- that Kyo...
- Raph!

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:45.054
[Naofumi] But if this thing’s
still here, then...

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:48.015
Then that means Raphtalia
should still be safe!

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:50.851

Hurry up, and get out of there!

Hurry, Master Naofumi.
