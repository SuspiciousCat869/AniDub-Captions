WEBVTT

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:12.513
[Naofumi] Before I was
summoned to another world,

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.932
I was like any other otaku.

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:17.893
I dabbled in everything,
from games to light novels.

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:20.145
[Kyo] The real world
is a complete shithole

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.897
where people like me
don’t belong,

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.107
and video games
were the one thing

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.859
that helped me forget that.

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.612
[Naofumi] While I spent
most of my time selling items,

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.322
every now and then,

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:33.075
I’d lead clans
against high-tier raids.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.578
[Kyo] In-game, I was a genius,
I could do anything!

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.121
I was famous throughout the land

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.749
for my experiments
and inventions.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:42.459
[Naofumi]
But playing online games

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:45.462
was just one of the many things
I did as an otaku.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.340
[Kyo] Games were all that I had.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.385
My life in those games
was my reality.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.054
[Naofumi] The life I lived
was an ordinary one,

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:56.390
and I was content
to live that way forever.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.849
[Kyo] But I wanted more.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.186
I wanted to wake up
from this nightmare.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.438
[Naofumi]
So then, why am I here,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.982
and what am I doing?

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.441
I’m in a new world

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.860
with powers people could
only dream of ever having.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:12.906
Yet I’m just following orders
and doing what they told me to.

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:14.658
[singer vocalizing]

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.869
[Kyo] Right, like I’d bother
wasting my time with that crap!

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.914
This is the second life
I’ve always wanted,

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:24.209
so you better believe I’m gonna
seize it for all its worth!

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.087
Divergent worlds...

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.214
ruled by their different laws.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:32.134
Shatter both
of their independent barriers,

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.094
and manifest its power
right here!

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:37.806
The Wave of Calamity,
Dimension Wave!

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:42.811
[vocalizing ends]

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:47.566
[Raphtalia] Master Naofumi,
isn’t that...

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.402
[Naofumi] Yeah.
Somehow a Wave is here.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.779
[Raphtalia] Then does that
mean the others are...

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.323
[Naofumi] Since we’re
in their world

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:55.866
and they’re
the Cardinal Heroes here,

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.701
they were sent
to fight against it.

00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:58.827
No way.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.079
It came even though
we had time left,

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.456
but how?

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.291
[Filo] Master, look! In the sky!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.003
Get in, everyone! Quickly!

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.676
[Naofumi] Where are
Kizuna and the others?

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:16.595
They stayed
to help with the Waves

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:18.930
while I came to pick you all up.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.141
[Yomogi] Kyo is the one
behind all of this.

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:22.601
[all gasp]

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.479
He must have used the power he
stole from the Spirit Tortoise

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.397
in order to create a Wave.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.024
[Naofumi groans]

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:33.779
You knew this could happen,
and you still helped him!

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.697
[sighs]

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.240
[shudders]

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.076
[Raphtalia] Master Naofumi!

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.369
I did...

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.622
but I never thought
he’d do something like this.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:47.542
I truly believed he was going to
use the Spirit Tortoise’s power

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.045
to protect this world
from the Waves!

00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:51.338
[Yomogi shudders]

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.006
[Naofumi scoffs]

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.467
If you’re
so desperate to help Kyo,

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.011
then what are you
doing here with us?

00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.971
I’m here, because I
want to help you.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.724
Kizuna told me
they would handle the Waves

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:03.934
and that I should come here

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.936
because I’d be
of more use to you.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:06.937
Huh?

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:08.230
Though I’m a fool,

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.774
Kizuna made a choice
to believe in me,

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.985
and so, for her sake,
I will throw aside my pride

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.155
and bring the Shield Hero
to where Kyo’s hiding!

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.241
As the Wielder
of the Boat Vassal Weapon,

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.575
it would be my great pleasure

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.411
to bring you to Kyo,
wherever he is.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.412
[Raphie] Raph!

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.163
Right.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.748
Let’s do this, then.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.168
Take me to where
that bastard Kyo is.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.504
Bait Lure!

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.800
Blank-Stance Rondo: Moon Break!

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:39.761
[yelps]

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.724
That was close.
Thank you, Glass.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:44.850
It was nothing.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.892
[yells]

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.644
How are we supposed
to stop these things

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.354
when they just keep coming?!

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.189
[Therese] I hate to say it,
but defeating Kyo

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.817
might be the only way, since he
was the one who summoned it.

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:54.818
[Kizuna grunts]

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.195
[Kizuna] Naofumi.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:00.866
So this is it?

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:01.867
[Yomogi grunts]

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.494
Yes. This is Kyo’s lab.

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.998
[Naofumi] Thanks for
the ride, Ethnobalt!

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.458
We can handle the rest
from here.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.459
[sighs]

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.836
[Naofumi]
Kizuna isn’t like the others.

00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:14.629
She hasn’t seen
the Waves before.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.007
I’m sure she’d feel
a lot better with you there.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.301
[chuckles] Very well, then.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.720
Try to stay safe, everyone!

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.638
That goes for you too,
Ethnobalt!

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.562
Let’s go!

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.525
[Rishia squealing]

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.361
These are all part of
Kyo’s experiments, aren’t they?

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.198
Yes. That’s exactly right.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.659
[all gasp]

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.536
[Tsugumi] Vengeance.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.623
I will have vengeance
for what you did to Kazuki!

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.166
Hey, those look like...

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:53.043
Chimeras.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:56.671
They’re a fusion between
a human and a Byakko copy.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:57.881
Kyo!

00:04:57.923 --> 00:04:59.007
[gasps]

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:01.676
Hold on.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.429
Isn’t that the same sword
Yomogi was using?

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.765
The three of us will defeat you,

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:10.268
and when we do,
Kazuki will be returned.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.562
Kyo promised
he could be brought back!

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:16.233
Looks like Kyo talked them into
being his sacrificial pawns,

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.651
like he did with you.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:18.652
[grumbles]

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.986
[Yomogi] Stop this!

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.656
Killing us isn’t going
to bring your master back!

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:23.824
[growls]

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.200
[yells]

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.451
I hope you can forgive me.

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:30.580
But we can’t afford
to waste any more time here!

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.582
[all yell]

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.626
[chorus vocalizing]

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.381
[Yomogi] B-But how?

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.174
I think that jewel
Therese gave me

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.134
helped me out a lot
with my speed.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.594
It seems like it gives you

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.680
the same power
as Filo’s High Quick.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.766
Hey! I’m still just as fast!

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.476
[chimeras groaning]

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.980
For Kazuki.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.982
This is for what you did
to Kazuki!

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.318
[Naofumi] Watch out!

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.028
Air Strike Shield!

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.531
Second Shield! Dritte Shield!

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.658
Shield Prison!

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.034
Meteor Shield!

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.119
[all gasp]

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:18.503
[coughing]

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.922
[sighs] You guys okay?

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.132
[coughs] Yes!

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.718
- Yeah, I think so.
- [coughs]

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.678
It’s too dusty in here!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.638
[groans]

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.890
[sighs]

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.516
[Kyo] Well,
there goes any chance

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.476
of using this lab ever again.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:34.603
[gasps]

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.898
Of course you three
managed to screw it up.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.524
You’re just as useless
as the others.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:40.609
[Yomogi] It’s Kyo.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.943
Hey there!

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.695
We meet again,
Shield Shithead!

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.573
I’d say, "Nice to see you,"
but you make me miserable.

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:48.241
I agree.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.119
But coming here was
the only way to kick your ass.

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.120
[chuckles]

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.707
- [man groans]
- [all gasp]

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.792
[laughs]

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.210
Kazuki, you’re alive!

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.212
- He really did it!
- [singers vocalizing]

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.797
- Hmm. See?

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.216
I told you I’d be able
to bring him back to life.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.428
But how? That should
be impossible. [gasps]

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.721
A mirror?

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.057
Look at him.
He didn’t come back to life.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.142
- [all gasp]
- It’s not even him.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.646
- It’s a homunculus Kyo made!
- [groans]

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.648
[Yomogi] The soul
that dwelled in his body

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.360
during his life is gone,
so his body is just a shell.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.278
Instead, he forced the soul

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.697
of the Mirror
Vassal Weapon Wielder into it.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.742
[Naofumi] What?

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.036
[Rishia] The wielder
of the Mirror Vassal Weapon?

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.746
You mean the one
who went missing?

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.332
- Hey, come on! At least
give a spoiler warning

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:38.833
before you ruin
the fun, bitch.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.418
[gasps]

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.629
[Yomogi] There’s no blood
flowing through his veins,

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.506
and his soul
is a different person’s.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.341
That thing standing before us

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.134
is anything
but the comrade they loved!

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.594
[gasps]

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:50.762
But you said that...

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.013
you’d bring him back.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.682
[Kyo laughs]

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.392
And bring him back, I did!

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:56.851
Try not to have too much fun

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.771
dying against a dead guy
without me, you idiots.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.356
[grunts] Get back here!

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.066
- [growls]
- [Kyo laughs]

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:04.526
[gasps]

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.944
Raphtalia.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.238
Master Naofumi,
allow me to handle this.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.406
I can hear the voice

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.616
of the Mirror Vassal
Weapon Wielder within him.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:12.617
[gasps]

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.786
And he’s begging
to be released.

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.329
I get it.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.998
That means
the Vassal Weapon Wielders...

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.416
are resonating!

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.961
You go ahead! Leave him to us.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.380
But you need to move quickly
before Kyo can escape.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.799
- I wanna help too!
- Raph! Raph!

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:28.842
Understood.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.510
[Naofumi] Let’s go, Rishia!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:31.845
Eh? Uh...

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.055
yes! I’m coming!

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.765
[grunts]

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.600
- [grunts]
- [yelps]

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.769
[yells]

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.398
[Mirror Weapon clatters]

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.609
Hooray! I can fight
like I did before!

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:47.986
- Raph!
- [both chuckle]

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.238
[homunculus groaning]

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.952
Eww! What is that thing?

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:58.121
As someone who helped Kyo
get to this point,

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.915
I feel it’s my responsibility
to end your suffering.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.421
No, I’ll be the one
to liberate him.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.131
[clanking]

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.132
[Naofumi] Kyo!

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.802
[ominous music playing]

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.556
[grunts]

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:19.059
[Kyo] Well,
it’s about damn time.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.437
Believe it or not,
I’ve been waiting for you two,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.772
the green-haired moron

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.982
and the Shield Shithead
who got in my way.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.859
You’re the only two vermin here

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.819
that I have
an indescribable need to kill

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.446
with my own two hands!

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:32.864
Let me take a guess.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.115
You caused the last Wave

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.284
using the power you stole
from Ost, didn’t you?

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:38.912
Of course I did!
I mean, isn’t it obvious?

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:42.457
The Turtle’s power that I took
is right in front of you!

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.250
Sure, I used a lot of it,
but hey,

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.252
I can always just go back
to your shitty world

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.963
and get more if I need it.
Am I right, or am I right?

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.009
Oh, wait. Forgot you
let the stupid Turtle die.

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.010
[gasps]

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.887
What was the other Beast again?

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.139
Some kind of oversized bird
or something?

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.724
- [Naofumi] Shut up.
- Huh?

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.351
I can’t hear you,
Shield Shithea--

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:02.268
Shut up!

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.897
[grumbles]

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:10.860
[Naofumi] I’m sick of it,

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.445
sick of hearing your voice,

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.531
sick of seeing
that smirk on your face.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:15.907
Enough is enough!

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.368
Try to stay calm. [gasps]

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.912
Who the hell
do you think you are?

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.997
Coming into our world
and treating it

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.542
like it’s another one
of your little experiments!

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.586
[Kyo] Huh? Right now,
you’re the ones in my world.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.255
So it’s "our world" now?

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.507
Ah, well,
I guess it makes sense.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.969
I wouldn’t wanna go back to your
train wreck of a world either!

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:36.970
[Naofumi growls]

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.097
[laughs]

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.723
Yes! That’s it!

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:44.435
That’s the look I wanted to see
smeared across your face!

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.895
I loved what I saw

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.481
when I took that annoying
demi-human girl from you!

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:49.691
[heart beats]

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.234
It’s a shame
things with the bird girl

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.235
didn’t work out!

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:53.820
She was supposed
to be fried chicken

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.072
by the time
you finally found her!

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.282
[heart beats]

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.701
I hope you enjoyed
the hell I put you through,

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:02.162
because that’s what you get
for trying to play hero

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.122
and ruin my plan, you bastard!

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.082
[heart beats]

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.667
[yelps]

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.085
Naofumi, please!

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.461
Tell me, Shield Hero.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.756
How do you feel right now?
Angry? Pissed off?

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.842
Want to rip me in half?

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:18.261
Oh, I bet you do, don’t you?

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.721
Don’t you? Don’t you?!

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:21.139
That’s exactly right!

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.515
You sealed your fate

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.309
when you decided
to mess with my friends.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.395
Now shut up, and prepare
to die where you stand!

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.314
Just go ahead
and try to kill me!

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:33.776
[roars]

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.111
[winces]

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.697
Please, Naofumi!
You can’t use that!

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.866
Foolish sinner,
I hereby sentence you

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.993
to cast your screams
unto the heavens!

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.786
Within the dragon’s jaws

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:46.039
that have been born
from my very flesh,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.791
become an offering
to the gods as you howl!

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.126
Naofumi!

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.544
[heart beats]

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:54.255
[Dragon]
You finally chose to use it.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:57.967
- [roars]
- [Naofumi gasps]

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:01.304
Now that you’ve called
upon me, Naofumi Iwatani...

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.347
[winces]

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:05.308
I will become one
with your very being!

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.227
[groans]

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:10.563
[screams]

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:11.731
[gasps]

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.483
[laughs]

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:14.901
Get a load of this loser!

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.946
He got so pissed off that he
let his Shield take him over!

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.448
Wait, did you
call them your friends?

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.326
What a bunch of bullshit.
You control them

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.954
with the slave crest
and monster crest!

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.163
[gasps]

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.873
You’d think if they
really were your friends,

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.583
you wouldn’t need
to enslave them!

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.252
That’s not true!
He was only trying--

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.711
Give me a break!

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.005
The fact that you helped your
little slave band get stronger

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:40.009
doesn’t change how scummy
what you’re doing is, you idiot!

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.136
Try to stay in control,
Naofumi!

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.138
- [Naofumi grunts]
- [laughs]

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.265
- [growls]
- [hand clenches]

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.891
So what if I did?

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.101
Who gives a damn?

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:50.895
Naofumi...

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.273
[Naofumi and Dragon]
Both Raphtalia and Filo

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.358
were weak and useless
to begin with.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.820
But they’ve gotten stronger,
so they’re useful to me now.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.905
That’s why I keep them around!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.491
There’s nothing wrong with them.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.536
Too bad I can’t say
the same for you.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:09.205
You’ve been a useless whore
from the start.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.999
Just looking at you

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.210
pisses me off
as much as Kyo does!

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:17.088
Why the hell am I stuck
taking care of an annoying girl

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.384
whose life goal has been to get
into the Bow Hero’s pants?

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:24.345
[laughs]

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:27.307
You make me wanna puke,
you ugly slut!

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:30.351
I’ll kill you
before slaughtering Kyo!

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:32.687
[Rishia grunts]

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:33.855
Finally...

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.898
I got to hear
what you really think of me.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.899
[Naofumi] Huh?

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.484
I knew you were too kind

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.487
to say what you really thought,
so I’m glad.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:45.033
I’m glad I got to hear what
your true thoughts about me are.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.661
And I’m okay
with what you said about me.

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.956
But Raphtalia and Filo

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.625
are a different story
than me, aren’t they?

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.586
- [yells]
- Sure, I can understand

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:59.422
that maybe you were using them
at first to get by,

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:00.882
but who could blame you?

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.009
It’s not like
you had a choice, right?

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.761
There were more things
you had to do,

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:07.221
and making them your slaves
was necessary.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:10.516
Besides, it kept them safe,
and it kept you safe.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:11.642
- [groans]
- [Raphtalia yells]

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:12.977
[Rishia] And believe it or not,

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.771
I’m sure they understand that!

00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:16.439
Furthermore, they know

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.025
that things are different now
between you,

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.027
that you think of us
as treasured friends,

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:25.281
as opposed to slaves to do
your bidding and protect you.

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.450
Ost also thought that.

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:33.998
I don’t know
who or what you are,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.417
but Naofumi
doesn’t need you anymore!

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.586
[Naofumi and Dragon groaning]

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.380
[screaming]

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.340
[Rishia gasping]

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.925
[coughs]

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:45.593
[Kyo] Agh! What are you doing?!

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.846
I spent far too much time and
energy for you to ruin my show!

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.724
Oh, forget it. Never mind.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.227
I’ll just kill him
while he’s in crazy mode.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.229
But first...

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.730
I’m going to eviscerate you!

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.319
[gasps]

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:04.487
[wincing]

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:05.780
It happened again?

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:06.781
Damn you!

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.741
[gasps]

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:11.077
[energy humming]

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.041
Even after all this,

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.460
you’re still relying
on the Spirit Tortoise’s power?

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.462
You’re as weak as ever!

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.047
What did you say?

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.924
How dare you insult me?!

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.801
[Naofumi wincing]

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.177
[Rishia] Wake up, Naofumi.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.263
We need you to fight. Wake up!

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:31.889
[yells]

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:32.807
[grunts]

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.310
[growls] Die! You bitch!

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:39.105
[gasping]

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.066
Naofumi, please!

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.736
[Dragon] What’s wrong?

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:48.698
Don’t let that woman’s words
deceive you!

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:52.034
[Naofumi] No, you’re
the one trying to deceive me!

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.787
I’m only making you an offer.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.664
As a Cardinal Hero,

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.958
it’s your duty
to fight the Waves, isn’t it?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.252
[gasps] My duty?

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:05.506
And for that, you need my power,
a power destructive enough

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.217
to burn everything
that stands in your way!

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.179
It burns everything in my way?

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.849
Yes. Now you’re getting it.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.143
[ballad playing]

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:20.146
[Ost] <i>I told you before,</i>
<i>didn’t I, Shield Hero?</i>

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:23.608
<i>You don’t need those flames</i>
<i>to be strong.</i>

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:26.235
- But how?
- <i>It’s up to you.</i>

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.821
<i>Do you want to stop Kyo</i>
<i>at the cost of my friends</i>

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.573
<i>or find another way?</i>

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:34.494
<i>Naofumi, only you can decide</i>
<i>what your duty is.</i>

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:35.411
[gasps]

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.626

[ballad continues]

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:06.609
Rishia!

[gasps]

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.695
Huh? The hell?

[gasps]

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:14.492
Damn it. Damn it! Damn it!

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.953
Prepare to be burned to ashes!

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:20.164
Forbidden Tome: Revelation!

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:23.167
Die!

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:29.966
[laughs]

00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:31.425
I’m willing to bet my life

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.844
that I can keep this up
longer than you can!

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.429
[grunting]

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:39.976
- Master Naofumi!
- Master!

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:43.271
I owe it to you,
Raphtalia and Filo. Thank you.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.857
Naofumi, you’re back!

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:50.152
You too, Rishia! You were able
to stop the Wrath Shield

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:53.197
and my anger from
completely taking me over!

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.907
But all this anger...

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.910
this pain, this sorrow...

00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:00.413
I have to accept it
and move forward!

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:02.206
[grumbles]

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:05.293
[gasps] Is that
the Mirror Vassal Weapon?

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:07.420
Ost was right about me.

00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:10.381
I’m the only one
who could decide my duty!

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:11.382
[gasps]

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.217
Sorry for playing hero

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.846
and ruining your plans
to launch a Wave, Kyo Ethnina.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:18.055
Huh? Wha?!

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.099
[Naofumi]
I’m sure you had your reasons

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.101
for thinking this was right,

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.979
but I’m not doing this
to follow a greater will

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.106
or for the sake
of doing what’s right!

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:30.943
I’m doing it for myself,
of my own free will!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.903
I will defeat you!

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.822

Fine by me!

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:49.587
Enjoy your empty victory,
Shield Hero.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.464
Guys like you
who do whatever they want

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:54.425
always end up looking
like idiots in the end anyway.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.927
You’ll find out for yourself
soon enough!

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.221

[Rishia] Ost.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.419
[Yomogi] Thank you, Shield Hero
and his followers...

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:31.712
[gasps]

00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:33.714
for defeating Kyo.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:35.925
You have my utmost gratitude.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.138
- [Kizuna] Hey! Up here!
- [gasps]

[peaceful music playing]

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:51.982
I see. So Kyo’s dead, huh?

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.610
[L’Arc] We found the missing
Mirror Vassal Weapon too,

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:57.530
so we don’t have to worry
about a war starting for now.

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:59.198
It’s time for the king
to show us

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.783
what he’s got, right, L’Arc?

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.201
Well, good luck, Young Master.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.245
Would you stop
calling me that, kiddo?!

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.413
What about you?

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.248
What are you going to do,
Naofumi?

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:08.374
I don’t really know.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.334
I thought that I
had to ride the Wave home

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.878
the same way you guys did
back in my world.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.588
But now it’s gone,
so you can’t.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.340
[Kizuna] Well,
you’ve got about a month

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:17.967
until the next one comes around,

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:20.136
so why not relax here
until it comes?

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.388
[sighs] I guess
I don’t have a choice.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.973
That’s good enough for me.

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:26.851
How’s about we head back to
the castle and have a banquet?

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:27.893
Sounds great!

00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.187
[Kizuna]
We should all go fishing, too!

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.189
I was hoping we could try--

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.315
[Naofumi gasps]

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:34.859
What’s going on?

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.944
[Naofumi] Looks like
we’re headed home after all.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:38.279
And from the looks of it,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.030
we don’t even have
a minute left here.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.031
- [gasps]
- Huh?

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.742
Thank you all for everything!

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:45.494
Um, right. I hope
we meet again sometime soon!

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.496
- Bye now!
- Raph! Raph!

00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:48.622
Wait, you can’t go yet!

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:51.333
What about fishing
and having the banquet?

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.877
Don’t be ridiculous, Kizuna.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.253
They have to go.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.421
But they can’t.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:58.048
Well, I kind of saw it coming.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.675
[Kizuna] Naofumi, you jerk!

00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:02.887
I haven’t even gotten the chance
to thank you for everything!

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.263
[sighs]

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.848
[chuckles]

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.057
[gasps]

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.642
Thank you, Naofumi,

00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:10.603
for everything you’ve done.

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:11.979
Don’t worry.

00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:14.857
As one of the Cardinal Heroes,
I’ll do my best here.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.859
[Naofumi] I bet.

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:19.153
Is it okay
if I visit you sometime?

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.113
That is, if I even can...

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:23.073
Of course.
As long as you’re not coming

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.825
to kill me,
like the other three.

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:26.368
Don’t be silly.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.661
You know I could never...

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:28.996
[Naofumi]
See you around, Kizuna.

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:29.914
Huh?

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:42.051
Up until the last minute
he was here, Naofumi was...

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:44.470
[cries]

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:46.365
[birds chirp]

00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:48.993
[Naofumi] Upon returning
back to the world

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:49.994
I was summoned into,

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.121
I was given
a medal by the queen

00:22:52.162 --> 00:22:53.747
for defeating
the Spirit Tortoise

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:56.000
and awarded
the title of viscount.

00:22:58.419 --> 00:22:59.920
I heard later on

00:22:59.962 --> 00:23:03.007
that when Kyo’s Wave appeared
back in Kizuna’s world,

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:06.010
that another one simultaneously
showed up here in our world...

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:10.764
and that while we were gone,
Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:13.225
pushed themselves
to their limits to defeat it.

00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:16.562
Maybe I’m wrong,
but I have a feeling

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:18.272
they just wanted
to restore their names

00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:21.692
after how useless they were
against the Spirit Tortoise.

00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:24.612
The Waves, the other world,

00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:26.530
more and more problems
are popping up

00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:28.616
faster than I can keep track of.

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:30.576
Not to mention
there’s the Phoenix,

00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:33.037
the next Guardian Beast
to awaken.

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:36.457
I’d be lying if I said
it’s easy to stay positive

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:37.583
with the challenges ahead.

00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:40.002
But I know in my heart

00:23:40.044 --> 00:23:42.546
that as long as I have
my friends by my side,

00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:44.465
I can keep this world safe.

00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:47.384
Not because it’s my duty,

00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:50.429
but because I...

00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:52.389
...am the Shield Hero!
