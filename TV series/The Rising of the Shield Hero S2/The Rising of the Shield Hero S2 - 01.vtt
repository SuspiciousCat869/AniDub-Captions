WEBVTT

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:13.222
[Naofumi] After overcoming
the worst of the Waves,

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.558
I was rewarded and became
ruler of Raphtalia’s home,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.769
Lurolona Village.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.773
As we began to rebuild,
new allies joined us.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:25.150
Things are looking up
for a change.

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:28.278
But when the next Wave comes,
everyone will be in danger...

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.738
- [children laughing]
- so I have to...

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.532
[Naofumi gasps]

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.784
Whoa. Be careful, you two.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.744
Right! Sorry, My Lord!

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.288
- Let’s go!
- Okay. [laughs]

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.042
- [Rishia inhales]
- Almost!

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:45.045
Try to let your ki build up
in the pit of your stomach.

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:47.256
[Rishia]
Y-You mean like this?

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.257
[Elrasla]
That’s it!

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.717
I knew you had
a real knack for this!

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.096
You’re sure to become a master
of Hengen Muso in no time.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.932
[Rishia]
Huh?! You really think so?

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:58.767
Hold on. I don’t even know

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.895
what all this ki stuff
you two are talking about is.

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:04.064
[gasps] Shield Hero!

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:05.941
Well, would you look who it is.

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:08.610
Seems like you’re
working hard, Keel.

00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:10.153
[Keel]
You betcha!

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:14.283
And by the way, don’t be
going too easy on Rishia.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.117
[Rishia]
Eh?!

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.369
Her base stats are
borderline cringe-worthy

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.745
for someone of her level.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:21.915
[laughs] There might be
some truth to that!

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:24.835
[Naofumi]
I gotta say the costume’s

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.212
working pretty well,

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.340
but she shouldn’t continue
to just rely on it.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.426
[Rishia sighs]
Yeah.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.303
I understand
what you’re saying.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.555
But when I’m wearing this,
I can try harder,

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.765
’cause no one
can see me feeling down,

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.517
if that makes sense.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.604
I see. In any case,

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.732
this girl has a natural talent
for manipulating her ki,

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:50.193
so it’s best to strengthen
that ability of hers.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.403
Look, I’m not trying to be

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.072
the bearer of
bad news here, old lady,

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.074
but the concepts
of whatever-Muso you use

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.202
don’t exist in this world.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.454
Hey, Instructor,

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.956
so can I help fight against
the Waves with the others now?

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:05.125
- Absolutely not.
- Huh?

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:07.836
There’s less than a week
until the next Wave.

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:09.546
And if you think
that’s enough time

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:11.548
for you to learn
how to really fight,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.842
then I’m afraid
you’re horribly mistaken, Keel.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:15.010
[Keel groans]
Fine.

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:16.637
Well, then what about
the Wave after that?

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:17.804
If I train hard enough,

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.431
you’ll let me fight that one,
won’t you?!

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.391
[laughs] That’s the spirit.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.560
But you can’t learn
sword skills just from me.

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.145
- [woman screams]
- [both gasp]

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.022
- [crowd yelling]
- [bats hissing]

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.565
What is all that?

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:29.733
Follow me!

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.026
Right!

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:33.487
Wait! I wanna help, too!

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.742
[screeches]

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:47.626
[boy sighs]
Thank you!

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:50.087
Give me one second, okay?

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.171
Sure!

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.799
[Filo yells]

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.676
[Raphtalia grunting]

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.023
You two okay over there?

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.400
Master Naofumi!

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.527
Oh, hey! It’s Master!

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.863
Hmm. Looks like
they beat us to the punch.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.241
Yeah, I guess so.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.452
Huh? What are these things?

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.090
"Familiar"?

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.592
Is it some type
of dimensional monster?

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.929
No way. The next
Wave is too far off.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.267
[gasps]

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.935
[Naofumi]
The countdown...

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.353
[Raphtalia]
What about it?

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.313
- [Naofumi] It’s stopped.
- [Elrasla] What?

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:53.233
And now this blue number
has appeared.

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.694
Do you have any idea
what that could mean?

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.404
[Naofumi]
Not really.

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:01.783
[high-pitched screeching]

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.453
[both gasp]

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.163
[all gasp]

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.018
[Raphtalia gasps]
What’s the matter?

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.269
[Rishia sighs]

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.105
[Raphtalia gasps]

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.902
Your former party members,
they’re here.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:37.944
[Filo groans]

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.154
[Mald scoffs]

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.116
[sighs]

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.370
You all have my thanks
for coming.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:51.583
I hope this urgent meeting
didn’t cause any inconveniences,

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:55.086
but I called you here
to discuss an important matter.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.839
This is about
those bat monsters, isn’t it?

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.300
I hope. Those things
are giving me the creeps.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:03.261
I guess that means
you encountered them too.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.347
You know something about them?

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.598
- [sighs]
- Mm-mmm.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.059
No, I’ve never seen them
up until now.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.769
Even so, they don’t seem to be

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.313
dimensional monsters
from a Wave either.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.816
Oh, yeah.
Speaking of the next Wave,

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.400
seems the Wave
countdown stopped.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.487
[Mirellia] If what you say
is true, then it must be back.

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:21.822
[Naofumi]
What does that mean?

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.241
I wasn’t sure at first,
but this means

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.785
the legendary monster
called the Spirit Tortoise

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:29.329
must have revived
in the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.622
So much for our progress.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.582
- [all gasp]
- Spirit Tortoise?

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:36.253
Once every few centuries,
the Spirit Tortoise is said

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.589
to bring a horrific disaster
to the world.

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.801
We believe that the monsters you
Heroes described encountering

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:45.470
are an effect of its revival.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.347
[Naofumi]
Horrific disaster, huh?

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.682
Sounds like the Waves.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:50.183
[chair scrapes]

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.561
Sorry. I have something
else to attend to.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.437
- Ah, me too.
- Excuse us,

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.231
but we’re a little
too busy for this.

00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:57.232
Sit down.

00:05:57.274 --> 00:05:59.651
Need I remind you
that in fact the only reason

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.486
we were summoned here
in the first place

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.196
was to fight the Waves.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.740
We don’t have time
to deal with anything else.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.702
Isn’t that right, Naofumi?

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:17.961
[doors open]

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:19.796
[gasps]

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.840
- [doors close]
- [Mald] How’d it go?

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.133
- Doesn’t matter.
- Uh...

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.260
Did you remember?
To ask my mother

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:28.096
if she would ever consider
making me a princess once again?

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.556
I’m sorry, My--

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.057
Uh, I mean Bitch.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.226
I’ve got bigger
problems right now.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.729
- Let’s go.
- [gasps] Hey!

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.564
Sir Motoyasu!

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:40.233
[scoffs] Useless fool.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.321
Huh?

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.906
Seems you’re doing well.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.366
Um, Sir Itsuki.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:49.492
Oh, by the way,

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.870
have you been keeping in touch
with your parents?

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.496
[gasps] Y-Yes!

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:56.166
I sent a letter yesterday!

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.584
Right?

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.502
Glad to hear it.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.098
Sir Itsuki!

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.768
I want to journey alongside you
to save the world!

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.811
Let me join your party again!

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.813
[Itsuki]
You’re not strong enough.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:22.442
And you never will be, no matter
how much Naofumi trains you.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.944
Huh?

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.156
Sir Itsuki!

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:30.492
[gasps]

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.369
Why do you think Sir Itsuki

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.621
banished you from the party
in the first place?

00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:37.707
To keep you away from all
the dangers of the battlefield?

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.626
- [gasps]
- [Mald] Think again.

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.630
He tossed you aside because
you’re weak, slow, and useless!

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:44.839
[gasps]

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.508
Stop it, Mald.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.218
That’ll be enough.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.678
[Mald scoffs]

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.016
Are you okay, Rishia?

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.685
He was a jerk.

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.443
[Naofumi]
Well, that went well.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.028
Let me get this straight.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.114
This whole meeting
was to try and get us

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.199
to handle this
Spirit Tortoise thing?

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.952
That was my intention, yes,
but it doesn’t seem

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.204
like the other Heroes
are too excited about that.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.956
I think I see why.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.875
This Tortoise thing sounds
like some kind of raid boss.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.168
- Huh?
- Nothing.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.253
Don’t worry about it.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.754
[coughs]

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:27.382
So then, do you think
you have what it takes

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.718
to handle this job for me,
Shield Hero?

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.888
As long as you don’t mind my job
as Hero taking a back seat.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.725
While the Spirit Tortoise
Kingdom is a vast area,

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.978
the Tortoise has already
destroyed several territories

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.939
and important checkpoints
as it nears the capital.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.608
Countless people
have already died.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.527
Even though
the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.780
is located far off in the east,
it won’t be long

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:53.491
before it reaches us
here in Melromarc.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:55.744
If that happens,

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.746
it will more than likely
have to trample

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:01.041
through your own lands
before it gets here.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.917
You sure know
how to persuade people.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.002
[Mirellia chuckles]

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.671
By the way,
is Melty doing well?

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:11.009
She is. She’s somewhat
of a supervisor of my lands.

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:14.179
It was Melty’s idea actually
to have the place function

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.474
as a type of bridge
between humans and demi-humans.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.142
And then,
if you can believe this,

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:22.562
she told me to leave
the place to her and go see you.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.563
[Mirellia]
I see.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.398
It seems the journey
she went on with you

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.152
fostered her growth more than I
ever could have imagined, then.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.112
[Naofumi]
Definitely.

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:34.991
So for the sake of her dreams
and the people of my lands,

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:38.078
I guess I’ll fight this
weird Spirit Tortoise thing.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.370
You really mean it?

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.956
Oh, my.
That’s certainly a relief.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.667
I can’t thank you enough.
I’m in your debt.

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:47.670
I think it’s safe enough now
to focus on the tortoise,

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.673
considering the Wave countdown
has come to a stop.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.802
Concerning. The countdown
should never stop.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.845
I’ll try looking into it later.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:59.766
So am I supposed
to fight this thing on my own?

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:04.104
[Mirellia sighs] Not exactly.
Allow me to explain.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:07.565
[Erhardt]
I see.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.360
So then you’re headed off
to fight the Tortoise too, huh?

00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:12.278
You sure hear things fast.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.239
Who told you that bit of info?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.575
Practically the whole country’s
talking about it.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.285
Melromarc is
sending its knights

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:22.372
and joining with other nations
to fight alongside you, right?

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:24.499
[Naofumi] Yeah.
And the Cardinal Heroes

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.292
were told to go ahead
of the main army

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.753
in order to conduct
a reconnaissance.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.505
[Erhardt chuckles]
Our queen sure knows

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:33.258
how to splurge
when it comes to a fight.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.425
You’ve got that right.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.094
- Hey, Rishia...
- [Rishia yelps]

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.637
...what do you think about this?

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.556
[Rishia gasps]
It looks neat and all,

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:43.643
but I use magic
a lot more than I do swords.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:47.438
It doesn’t matter what I use.
I’ll still just be a failure.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.190
- Try it!
- [gasps]

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.112
[Filo] Hold on, Rishia!
You really think that?

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.990
Yes. I am a failure.

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.034
[Naofumi] At least you’re
able to hold a sword.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.871
[gasps] Oh, I’m sorry.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.880
Well, damn. That got
depressing rather quickly.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.591
[gasps] I’ve got an idea!

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.885
Eh?! What is it?

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.637
It might sound odd,
but trust me, okay?

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.306
- Eh?
- Huh?

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.603
Hold on.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.521
- Um, Raphtalia, isn’t this...
- [slaves murmuring]

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:29.981
- No need to worry.
- [animals calling]

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.774
I promise it’s fine.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.276
Huh?

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.821
[snarling, screeching]

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.490
- [snarls]
- [shrieks]

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.368
Hmm?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.622
Oh! So nice
to see you again. [chuckles]

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.291
It worked for me,

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.335
so why don’t you
try becoming a slave?

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.128
Me? A slave?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.796
What?!

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.257
If you become
Master Naofumi’s slave,

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.718
then the Shield Hero’s power
would make you strong enough

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.471
to where you wouldn’t feel
so badly about yourself anymore!

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:04.265
Wha? But then...

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:05.475
[Raphtalia]
Think about it!

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:07.185
You would instantly
become more powerful

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.312
than all of
the Bow Hero’s followers!

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:12.607
Now take off your cloak and
show me that chest of yours!

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:13.900
- Eh? [wails]
- Raphtalia...

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.653
- Yes?
- It’s a good idea,

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:19.822
but I’m not gonna force
anyone else to be my slave.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:20.990
[gasps]

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.825
Sorry, Master Naofumi.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.118
I just thought Rishia

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.705
would want to take
the path I did. You know?

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.624
- [sighs]
- [Naofumi] If she wanted to,

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.084
it would be a different matter.

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.628
But not everyone wants
to volunteer to be a slave.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.004
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:36.798
[Naofumi] Haven’t changed
your mind on that, have you?

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.174
- Huh?
- Forget it.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.259
Sorry, what?

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.469
Anyhoo, what is it
I can do for you,

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.887
my favorite customer?

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.265
Oh, sorry.
We don’t really need--

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.641
[Rishia]
Naofumi...

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:50.019
I’m begging you,
make me your slave!

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:53.064
I volunteer to be
the Shield Hero’s slave!

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.734
[gasps]

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:05.743
As you wish.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.623
[gasps]

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.625
[groans]

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.713
[Rishia panting]

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.423
Hang in there.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.133
Rishia.

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:24.470
[screams]

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.141
Done! Per your request,

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.852
you are now bound
to the Shield Hero as his slave.

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:32.228
You’re an odd one.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.731
Normally, you can never
make your mind up.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:37.567
But you didn’t even hesitate
when it came to this.

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.570
Itsuki’s respect,

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.822
is it really
all that important to you?

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.491
Yes. It’s why I’m so desperate

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.119
for you train me
to get stronger.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.537
I see.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.706
Then I won’t say another word.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.750
If you want hard training,
you’re gonna get it.

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:55.209
Eh?!

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.503
And step one is
to stop making that noise.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.504
Eh?!

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.799
Wait! Sorry! I mean yes! Okay!

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:05.136
You have my utmost thanks,
Shield Hero!

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.680
[Naofumi] Okay,
let’s head back and get ready.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.640
We’ll be leaving
for the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:10.975
first thing in the morning.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:11.976
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:14.729
[Filo]
I’m starving, Master!

00:15:56.706 --> 00:16:00.168
[Raphtalia] Master Naofumi,
why were all those people...

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.795
Refugees from
the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom.

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:03.754
That must mean things are

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:06.215
starting to get bad
over there, huh?

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.009
[Naofumi]
Yeah, you might be right.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.136
What’s that? Is Master here?

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.846
Yeah, he’s right next to me.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:15.266
We’re heading east
to the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:17.477
We’ve already seen
some refugees.

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:20.313
Huh? Sure,
I can ask him for you.

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:23.274
Fitoria wants to know
where we’re headed

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:26.319
and if we’re going to try
to defeat the Spirit Tortoise.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.153
Are we?

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:29.113
Wait, what? Fitoria?

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:32.450
Filo, are you
talking to Fitoria?

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.745
[Filo] Yeah! Somehow
I can hear her right now.

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:36.913
[Naofumi]
I guess your cowlick

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:39.582
functions as a
makeshift antenna.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:43.085
I see. If the Shield Hero
is near, please tell him

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:46.672
that this is the choice
that I spoke of before.

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:49.926
If the Four Heroes still
can’t work together yet...

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:52.553
[both] ...then you should
take down the Spirit Tortoise.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:53.888
There!

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.473
[Naofumi]
The choice.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:58.935
"The world demands sacrifices
from all life," huh?

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:01.020
How does that relate
to the Spirit Tortoise?

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.688
She says don’t ask her

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.815
and you should think
about it yourself.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.567
So she’s upset.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.777
I get it.

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:11.155
Hold on.
What’s Filo talking about?

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.324
[Filo] Basically, if Master
and the other guys,

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.993
like the Spear guy,
can’t get on the same page...

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:19.539
We’ll be killed by Fitoria,
who’s the Filolial Queen.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.083
What?! But that can’t be true!

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:26.420
Does that also mean
Sir Itsuki’d die, too?

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.047
Eh?!

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:32.843
[Naofumi] I guess
we’ll just have to go

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.054
to the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:48.526
[crowd murmuring]

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.072
Did you hear?

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.699
The capital’s
already under attack

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.783
by the Spirit Tortoise.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.159
Seriously?

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:59.537
It’s only a matter of time
before it gets here then.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.290
On the bright side,
I’ve heard that several nations

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:04.584
have banded together
to fight against it.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:07.878
They say even the Four Heroes
are coming to join the fight.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.256
[scoffs] That can’t be true,
because I heard

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.341
that the Four Heroes
already tried fighting it

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.635
and three of them
got themselves killed doing so.

00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:15.803
- [gasps]
- [man] Really?

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.513
What are they going to do
to handle the Waves now

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.974
when three of the Heroes
are six feet under?

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:23.019
I tell you, both the Heroes
and the fools who summoned them

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.812
are completely
out of their depth.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.522
- [gasps] Sir Itsuki’s dead?!
- Yeah, it’s been bad.

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.941
- Hey!
- Rishia!

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.195
Follow her, Filo.

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:34.488
On it!

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.703
- [Naofumi] Wait!
- [Rishia gasps]

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.542
There’s no point running off

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.419
when you don’t even know
where you’re going.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:52.089
But Sir Itsuki might be hurt!

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.469
Calm down, Rishia.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.513
Hey, Filo, can you maybe
talk to Fitoria for me?

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:00.973
Huh? Sure.

00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:02.683
Let me try to reach her.

00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:04.769
I don’t know
if she can check this,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.896
but ask her if any
of the current Four Heroes

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:09.607
have been killed
in the past few days or so.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.025
Say it’s urgent.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:14.695
[Filo]
Um...

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:16.530
she says nothing like that
has happened.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:17.531
[gasps]

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.075
You heard it first.

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.993
There’s nothing
worth worrying about.

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:22.495
[Rishia sighs]

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:23.996
[Raphtalia]
He’s okay!

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:25.081
[Naofumi]
Look, I don’t want to lose

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:27.541
any of the other Heroes myself.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:28.501
Let’s ask around to see if

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:30.127
we can find out
their whereabouts--

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.213
- [bats hissing]
- [gasps]

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.133
[Raphtalia]
Master Naofumi! Over there!

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:39.053
[Naofumi]
What? What are all those things?

00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:44.684
[Naofumi gasps]

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:45.768
Towards the checkpoint?

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.020
[screaming]

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.650
[Naofumi]
Raphtalia and Filo, follow me!

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.151
Rishia, get the people to town!

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.820
- [Raphtalia] Okay!
- [Filo] ’Kay!

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.656
[gasps] O-Okay!

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.326
Shield Prison!

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:10.793
Spiral Strike!

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:13.963
This way, everyone! Quickly!

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:15.965
The monsters
haven’t gotten into town.

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:17.133
Go now!

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.676
- Okay!
- [gasps]

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:23.556
Filo, use magic over there!

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:24.724
’Kay!

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:27.518
Drifa Tornado!

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:31.981
[Naofumi] Start rescuing
those who didn’t escape.

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:33.107
I’ll handle this!

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.233
- Got it!
- Okay!

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.985
[Naofumi]
Hate Reaction!

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.076
[Naofumi]
Bring it!

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:46.120
Tornado Shield!

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:47.955
Whoa!

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.498
He did it!

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.920
Sweet. That takes care
of most of them.

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:56.839
[roaring]

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.133
[gasps]

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:02.553
Aw, crap!
There’s way more than before!

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.055
Wrath Shield!

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.978
[gasps] Is that...

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:14.899
[Raphtalia]
Get down!

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.900
[Rishia yelps]

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.947
[yells]

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:25.951
Dark Curse Burning!

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:41.717
[Naofumi panting]

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:43.385
[Raphtalia]
Master Naofumi!

00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:44.595
[Filo]
Master!

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.388
[Rishia]
Are you all right?!

00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:49.850
Don’t worry.

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.519
[gasps]

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:56.023
[Naofumi]
I’m totally fine.

00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:58.192
There’s no use in lying to me.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.444
[Naofumi]
You can tell, huh?

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:02.613
- [rocks clatter]
- [all gasp]

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.032
If I’m not mistaken,

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:08.160
you are the fabled Shield Hero,
are you not?

00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:10.579
Yeah. And what about it?

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:12.498
[woman]
I thought so.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.542
I beg of you,

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:17.378
please kill me
and put an end to this.
