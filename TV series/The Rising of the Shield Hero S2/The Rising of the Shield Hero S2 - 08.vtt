WEBVTT

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:11.512
[yells]

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:15.265
[line creaks]

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:16.892
- Come on!
- Okay!

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.228
[peaceful music playing]

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.569
Eh?

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:28.487
Uh...

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:30.489
Huh?

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.954
Thank you, Master Naofumi.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.121
Don’t mention it.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.040
We need to get out of here now,

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:42.292
before somebody
starts coming after us.

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.752
[footsteps crunching]

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.257
[Kizuna] So this is
a countdown to the waves?

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.509
It says 10 more days.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.261
That’s not enough time.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.804
And just when
we’ve finally managed

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.222
to make it to the other world,

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:58.684
Filo’s still
nowhere close to us.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.520
We’ve got a whole lot
more ground to cover.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.272
Filo...

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.899
I know! You can start
by heading to Sikul,

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.442
the country that summoned me.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.528
I promise it’s safer
than this place.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.698
[Naofumi] All right, then.
How far away is Sikul?

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.284
Uh, I think
about a week on foot.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.577
That sounds kinda far.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:18.370
We would
probably have to go through

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:22.082
a bunch of checkpoints too
and cross a few country borders.

00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:23.625
Out of the question.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.294
Do you happen to have
a portal skill?

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.713
Sure do.
It’s called Return Codex.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.215
But since I don’t have
the tool I need for it,

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.967
I can’t use it
for the time being.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.343
Okay, then what do we do?

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.887
You must have some idea
if you suggested this plan.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.306
Of course!

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.975
We’ll head to this country’s
capital, Mikakage.

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:42.728
[Raphtalia] Huh?
Isn’t Mikakage the capital

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.105
of the country
that locked you up?

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:47.149
[Kizuna] We won’t
be staying long,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.192
’cause we’re gonna use
the dragon hourglass

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.862
inside the capital
to warp to Sikul.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.614
They have a dragon hourglass?

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:56.617
[gasps] Your world has
dragon hourglasses too?

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.119
Yeah, but we can’t use them
to warp, though.

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:02.205
I see.
So our worlds are different.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.207
We call it Return Dragon Vein,

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.585
but the Cardinal Heroes
and Vassal Weapon Heroes

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.128
are the only ones
who can use it.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.421
I see.

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:11.548
If we make our way
to the hourglass

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.759
and use its power
to warp to Sikul,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.969
there’s no way for them
to follow us through?

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.596
That’s right!

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.848
So, um, how far is the capital?

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.684
It’s closer, but still
two or three days away.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:25.771
We can use those days
to level and buy weapons.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.606
Hopefully by then,
we’re strong enough

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:29.316
to storm
the enemy headquarters.

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:31.526
Oh, I almost forgot.
There are checkpoints

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:32.944
throughout the road
leading to the capital,

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.571
so we’re gonna
have to buy a pass.

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:35.822
[sighs]

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.702
Even though we’re
in another world,

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:42.996
I’m still a traveling merchant.

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:18.967
[Naofumi] This country is
certainly Asian-looking.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.135
[Kizuna] I know, right?

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:21.970
But some of the other countries
look European.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.931
What is "Asian"?
And what’s a "European?"

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.850
[Naofumi] Their clothes
are all Japanese,

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:28.769
but the people are
all different races.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.479
[Kizuna] Those are
the grass people,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.439
commonly referred to as Grass.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.025
They’re actually demi-humans,
like Raphtalia.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.486
They look more like elves
than demi-humans.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.321
What are elves?

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.490
[Kizuna] Over there
are the jewel people,

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.074
who are often called Jewels.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.285
They’re the same race
as Therese.

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:47.621
[Naofumi] Therese was
a different race too?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.541
What’s up with them?
Are they ghosts?

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.544
[Kizuna] Not quite. Those are
the spirit people, like Glass.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.755
[Rishia] Spirit people?

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.007
But some countries
just call them Spirits.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.384
You mean Glass is a Spirit?

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.887
[Kizuna] Other races
have life or magic power,

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.680
while vassal weapon users
have soul power,

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.600
but Spirits have
only their energy level.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.228
That would explain
why my Soul Eater Shield

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.771
did so much damage.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.606
Huh? What makes them unique

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.525
is that since they
are dependent on energy,

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.151
they don’t level up like we do.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.153
Huh? They can’t level up?

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:23.323
However, Spirits with lots
of energy are very powerful.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.200
And because their bodies
are ethereal,

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.035
normal attacks don’t hurt them.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.955
Oh. No wonder Glass
was so strong when we fought.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.665
But they have a weakness.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:32.874
Unlike other races,

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.502
their energy is only able
to recover naturally.

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:38.380
So healing magic and items
don’t have an effect?

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:42.217
Nope. Compared to humans
and other races,

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.469
Spirits aren’t nearly
as proficient at magic.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.557
- [Raphtalia] Master Naofumi.
- Eh?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.559
- [crowd murmuring]
- [Kizuna] What’s this?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.310
"We suspect that
neighboring countries

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.854
are developing new weapons.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.064
They’re breeding
powerful monsters."

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.024
[Rishia] Using monsters
as a weapon?

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.401
[Kizuna] They’re also trying

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.278
to research
teleportation technology

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.489
using the skills of
the Cardinal and vassal weapons.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.449
Sounds like
they’re trying to recreate

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.159
the abilities of the heroes.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.327
[grumbles]

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.871
Whether that’s true or not,

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:13.623
one thing for certain is
they don’t know about us yet.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.959
I’d try not to jinx it
if I were you.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.378
There is a lot of concerning
stuff written here, though.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.298
Well, I wouldn’t be surprised
if most of it is gossip.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.467
[stomach grumbles]

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.468
[gasps]

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.387
We should try
to make enough money

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.598
to pay for food and shelter
tonight, shouldn’t we?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.807
You’re right.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.059
Oh! That shouldn’t be a problem.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.937
I can just sell some drop items
that I don’t need.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.397
[relaxing music playing]

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.066
[Naofumi] It looks
like old Japanese currency.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.985
Oh, the copper doumon?

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:43.945
Now that you mention it,
they do, don’t they?

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:46.323
One hundred
is one silver gyokugin,

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.909
and 100 gyokugin
is one gold kinban.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.786
If doumon are anything
like the coppers in my world,

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.330
then we’re broke here.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.498
We’re gonna need
more money than this.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.500
Well, I’m all
for getting more money.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.419
You got any get-rich-quick
schemes up your sleeve?

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.130
Funny you ask,
because I just might.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.050
I think
this should do the trick.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.636
[Kizuna] What’s that?

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.263
[Naofumi] A soul soothing
potion that recovers SP.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:13.141
[Kizuna] "SP"?
As in "soul power"?

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:15.393
Back when I
fought against Glass,

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.355
L’Arc gave her one of these,
and she became stronger,

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.858
so much so, it felt like she
gained a second wind midfight.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.693
Huh.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.445
No way! Spirits would be willing

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.364
to pay a fortune
for something like that.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.115
I figured as much.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.450
Let’s sell it, then.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:33.495
B-But that item’s practically
unknown in this world.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.914
You really think we can find
someone who’d buy it from us?

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:38.375
You underestimate my skill.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:41.920
Get ready for a busy day of
selling and leveling tomorrow.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:44.214
Like old times,
right, Raphtalia?

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.382
[sighing]

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.676
[Naofumi] Raph--Uh...

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.303
[Raphtalia murmuring]

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:51.346
You okay?

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.764
[gasps] Oh, yeah!

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.141
I was just thinking
Rishia’s food looked good too.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:58.144
Here. Take some.
After all, young demi-humans

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.021
need to eat a lot to grow,
isn’t that right?

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.272
That’s not true--

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.900
Well, it is true,
but I don’t want it to be.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:07.821
- [groans]
- [Kizuna and Rishia laugh]

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.157
[Naofumi]
Come one! Come all!

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.451
Feast your eyes
on the exquisite wares

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.245
I’ve brought
from all around the land,

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.872
like this rare
soul soothing potion,

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.208
a medicine thought
to be a myth until now!

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.918
You there, Spirits!

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.130
Look here!
This is just the thing for you.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.007
[Raphtalia]
Come right this way, everyone!

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.303
Our samples are free of charge,
so why not try it out?

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.055
[crowd murmuring]

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.516
[Kizuna] They sure know
how to put on a performance.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.018
[Rishia] I was shocked
the first time

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.227
I saw them do this too.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.648
[gasps] I’ve never seen
anything like this!

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.108
I can’t believe
I’m saying this,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.443
but my power’s coming back.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.445
Sell it to me!
I’ll pay any price,

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.904
- Just give it to me!
- Wait!

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.073
- Save some for me!
- Me too!

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.867
[Naofumi] There’s no need
to panic, everyone!

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.660
I promise
I’ll be back tomorrow!

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.163
But like I said,
it’s a rare item

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.790
that’s hard to come by,
so I don’t have many left,

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:04.377
so tomorrow I’ll be putting
the rest up for auction!

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.587
- [murmuring]
- An auction?

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.130
[Spirit] I’ll be back tomorrow.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:09.090
[Naofumi chuckles]

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:12.052
[Kizuna] You’re one hell
of a salesman, Naofumi.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.636
[birds chirping]

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:17.098
[Kizuna] See?
I can take down monsters easily.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.434
But I’m not getting
any of the XP.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.227
Maybe it’s because
we’re both Heroes?

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:23.021
Huh. Well, that’s odd.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.773
Shoot.
This wouldn’t be an issue

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.150
if we could
just get XP from items.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.444
Why don’t we try
swapping items with each other?

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:30.987
They might have
different effects on us

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.614
since they’re
from different worlds.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.369
This item is called
an earth crystal.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.205
Just by holding it,
your magic is restored.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.208
[gasps]

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.627
Hey, wait. I just got 3,000 XP!

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:46.669
Eh?

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.422
Here. Try this.
It’s magic water.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.217
Wha?!

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.052
I don’t think
it restored my magic,

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.012
but I got
weapon enhancement XP.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.264
If those two gave us
different effects,

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.725
there’s no telling
what our other items might do.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.352
We should try
as many as we can!

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:03.353
All right.

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.188
Ah!

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.651
[bidder] Two gyokugin!

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.361
[bidder 2] Three gyokugin
and 30 doumon!

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:12.612
Thirty gyokugin!

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.114
[crowd gasping]

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.032
- [Naofumi] We have 30 gyokugin!
- [Spirit] Thirty gyokugin?

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.618
[Naofumi] Thirty gyokugin!
Can anyone here top that?

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.620
[murmuring]

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.455
Nobody?

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:25.458
Then the first one
is sold for 30 gyokugin!

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:31.381
And now, for the next
soul soothing potion...

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.427
- [gasps]
- [glass shatters]

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.595
[crowd gasps]

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.347
[Spirit] Did she just
break all the bottles?!

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.349
Does she know
how valuable those were?

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.310
[Rishia whimpers]

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.313
[crying]

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.899
[Raphtalia] Wait!
One of them is still intact!

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.360
[Naofumi] What luck
that one remains!

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:55.738
But this is the last bottle,
so I’d bid on it if I were you!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.407
- [crowd grumbles]
- [bidder 3 sighs]

00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:00.785
The bidding starts
at one gyokugin!

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.912
[Kizuna] Wow!
That was so much fun!

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.540
I had no idea
you could sell things that way!

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.751
I’m sure it would’ve been more
fun if I didn’t get yelled at.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.795
Sorry, Rishia,
but Naofumi told me

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:12.380
it would help us
sell them for more.

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.757
And thanks to your help,
it worked, Rishia.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.217
You did good too, Raphtalia.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.678
[giggles] Well, thank you!

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.889
[Kizuna] We’ve got
more than enough for a pass,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.140
so let’s use the rest

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.017
to buy some weapons and armor
while we’re here.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.354
Check it out!
You all look great.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.899
[Naofumi] Are you sure
you don’t need any new items?

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.984
I’ll manage with what I’ve got.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.445
But that haori of yours
is a total mess.

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:37.572
It is?
Well, Glass gave it to me,

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:38.740
so I wanted to keep it.

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.241
Oh. Sorry.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.701
Just forget I said anything.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:44.454
Master Naofumi,
what do you think about this?

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:45.705
Does it look good on me?

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.498
Yeah, it looks real good.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.792
And you kinda look
like a ninja girl, Rishia.

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:50.960
What’s a ninja girl?

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:52.837
[gasps] Master Naofumi,

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.672
if you had to choose
between all of us,

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.132
who do you think
has the best outfit here?

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:57.759
That’s easy.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.761
Since mine has
the highest defense stat here,

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.263
I think it’s obvious
which one is the best.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.139
[all moan]

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.807
[Naofumi] All right, then.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.393
Now that we’ve got armor
and money, we can buy that pass

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.437
and leave
first thing in the morning.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.147
[merchant] Come and
take a look at our shop!

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:13.524
[crowd murmuring]

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.277
[Naofumi] Things really are
pretty lively in the capital.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.863
[Kizuna] It was like this
before I was locked up too.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.324
[breathing deeply]

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.784
[Naofumi]
Are you okay, Raphtalia?

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.827
I-I’m fine.

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.329
Just a little cold is all.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:29.791
[Kizuna] It looks like
it might snow any second.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.042
[Rishia] What’s a "snow"?

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.050
[wind blowing]

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.095
[Naofumi] Security’s tight.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.554
[Kizuna] I hope
they didn’t find out

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.682
that I escaped
from the Infinite Labyrinth.

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:48.142
[Raphtalia] Whatever it is,
something is definitely wrong.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.688
What’s going on here?

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:54.315
Don’t tell me
you haven’t heard about it.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.651
Apparently a gifted mage
from another country

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.445
somehow developed a way
to use the Return Dragon Vein

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.198
when only Cardinal and
Vassal Weapon Heroes can.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.449
[Naofumi sighs]

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.035
And they’re here now
to show off an experiment.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.956
Looks like that news
wasn’t just gossip.

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.000
I’ve got a bad feeling
about this.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.961
Master Naofumi, do you think
this gifted mage is...

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.129
Oh, no.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.839
[grunts]

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.424
Am I missing something here?

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.592
[crowd gasping]

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.846
[crowd murmuring]

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.856
[crowd murmuring]

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.568
[Naofumi] Who the hell is he?

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:40.987
So he’s not the gifted mage
you were talking about?

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.406
No, he doesn’t look
anything like Kyo.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:44.407
Kyo?

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.701
You are phenomenal, Kazuki.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.162
We believed you could do it
from the very start, Kazuki.

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:51.622
[laughs] Of course I could.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.958
I sincerely hope that when
it’s ready for mass adoption,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.335
that you bring it to us first.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:56.961
[Kazuki]
Perhaps I’ll think about it

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.505
once I’m sipping sake
and watching the snow fall.

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:00.548
[official] But of course.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.175
We already have a room
prepared for you.

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:05.345
I guess he’s the one responsible
for security being so tight.

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:07.430
I’m still shocked
that it isn’t Kyo.

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.807
Looks like he’s
just as much of a jerk.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.684
Who’s this Kyo
you’re talking about?

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:12.685
[sneezes]

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.104
- [sniffles]
- [sighs]

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.607
We should go find
an inn for the night.

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.275
[wind blowing]

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.486
[Kizuna] Whoa!
The snow’s piling up!

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.821
[laughs]

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.783
Aren’t you a little too old
to act like that?

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.660
You can never be too old
to play in the snow.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.621
[sighs]

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:33.122
[laughs]

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.582
Oh, I got ya!

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:35.833
Oh, yay!

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:36.876
Let’s go!

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:37.877
[both laugh]

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.712
You too, Rishia?

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:42.006
Raphtalia, can you
please get them to behave?

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.758
[all laughing]

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:48.554
"Never too old," huh?

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:49.847
[chuckles]

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.849
[wind blowing]

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.855
[Kizuna] I almost regret
ever asking about this Kyo guy.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.440
Based off of what you told me,

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:00.817
he sounds like
a total shithead.

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:03.027
Yes, he is, to be honest.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.904
As one of this world’s
Cardinal Heroes,

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:07.782
I’d give just about anything
to pop that jerk in the face.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.785
Unfortunately,
my weapon can’t hurt humans,

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.703
and you use a shield.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.622
And sadly, Raphtalia and Rishia

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.332
can’t do much
at their current levels.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.667
[both sigh]

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.378
Kizuna, how much time do
we have left before the Wave?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.423
Mm, we have a little less
than six days left.

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:26.592
We need to hurry and find Filo,
then take down Kyo.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:29.262
We can’t afford to waste
any more time here.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.389
[Raphtalia]
Then why don’t we just go now?

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.225
I’m willing to bet it’s
not well guarded at this hour,

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.310
especially with this blizzard.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.271
This might be
the best chance we get.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:41.774
Raphtalia, you and Rishia
don’t have your levels back yet.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.985
You’re nowhere near
being ready to fight humans.

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:46.320
I am your sword, Master Naofumi.

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.239
I may not be
my strongest right now,

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.491
but no matter
how low my level is,

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.452
I’ll protect you,
no matter what.

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:54.287
Raphtalia.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.497
- [sizzling]
- Look down.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.166
- Your dumplings are burnt.
- Eh?!

00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.667
Oh, no!

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.544
- [gasps]
- [laughter]

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.379
[Kizuna] Aw,
you guys are so silly.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:04.630
[groans]

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.841
Raphtalia, as the Shield Hero,

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:08.801
it’s my sole duty
to protect you.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:09.844
Huh?

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.804
So when you’re fighting,
don’t worry.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:14.182
I swear to protect
both of you with my life.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.433
Okay!

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.143
I-I’ll try to do my best!

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.478
[Kizuna] It’s settled, then.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:20.146
We go for it tonight.

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:22.565
- [wind blowing]
- [Kizuna] Listen, everyone.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.275
Once we’re
inside of the building,

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:25.902
prioritize
getting to the hourglass

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.820
over everything else.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.114
The second I touch
the dragon hourglass,

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:33.075
Return Dragon Vein
should activate.

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:35.786
Because you’re all
members of my party,

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.456
you’ll be able
to warp along with me.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.082
But if you’re
too far away from me,

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.584
I don’t know what will happen.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.378
Where are we supposed
to go from here, Kizuna?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.505
- Here.
- [both gasp]

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:48.132
The hourglass
is on the other side.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:53.304
- [gasps]
- Something’s not right.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.430
[all gasp]

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:55.848
That’s them, the intruders!

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.141
Surround them!

00:16:58.976 --> 00:16:59.936
It was a trap.

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.979
And we walked right into it.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.064
No, did we really?

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.567
Just leave it to me!

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.568
Raphtalia!

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:10.863
Let’s go!

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.448
I guess we don’t have a choice!

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.699
[Rishia] We never have a choice!

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.707
- [grunts]
- [all gasp]

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.128
[Rishia] A-Another dead end?

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.964
Kizuna! We need you
to tell us where to go!

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:30.341
Well, I’m a little busy
over here!

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.010
What’s taking you so long?
Is that sword just for show?!

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.763
Sorta. Need I remind you
I can’t use it...

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.473
at least not to fight
against humans?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:38.849
[guards] Hmm?

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:46.065
[guards yell]

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.150
That wasn’t so hard, was it?

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.402
[grunts]

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:57.285
[grumbles] Damn it!
Where are they?

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.495
Hold on! Wait for me!

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.289
Naofumi, we have to split up.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.498
Wait, what?

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.001
We’re just dragging
the enemy around with us.

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.003
But we don’t know
where the hourglass is.

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.380
The hourglass has to be
at the center of the mansion,

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.798
so just keep heading that way.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.342
And what do we do if we
run into another dead end?

00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:15.261
If that happens, then just
do what I did back there.

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.721
Have it your way.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.055
Let’s go then, Raphtalia!

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.557
Okay!

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.808
Now, Rishia, follow me.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.809
All right!

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.519
[grunts]

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:26.856
Damn it! Another one?

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:31.193
[gasps] Air Strike Shield!

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:32.278
[all groan]

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.947
[grunting]

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.282
[yells]

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.202
- Master Naofumi!
- Right!

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:43.039
What’s up with that kid,
and why is she so strong?

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.124
Master Naofumi, look!

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.876
[Naofumi gasps]

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.755
Very good. Well done!

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.424
It’s a pleasure to meet the
buffoons who fell for my trap.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.551
[both gasp]

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.928
[Kazuki] I deliberately
stationed fewer guards,

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.513
and you came rushing right in.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:02.016
I guess Kyo was right
about you being an idiot.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.268
So that’s it.
You work for Kyo, huh?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.104
Well, that’s certainly
one way you could phrase it.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.440
I prefer to be called
one of his business partners.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:12.526
Let me guess. He became
your sponsor for the teleporter

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.945
in exchange
for having you catch us, right?

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.530
Something like that.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:19.533
Whatever you did must have
seriously pissed him off.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.452
He was practically
foaming at the mouth

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.536
just talking about it.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:23.704
[chuckles] Knowing that

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.998
makes me feel
a little bit better about this.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.792
But just a little bit, though.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.753
I think I’m starting to see
why you pissed him off so much.

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:32.630
Wipe that smirk
off your face, prick.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:36.133
It’s almost kinda sad, because
no matter how you look at it,

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.344
you’re just
a fake-ass wannabe Kyo!

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:41.347
Let me correct you about
something you said earlier.

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:44.266
I wasn’t merely told to catch
you and bring you back alive.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.811
I was instructed
to capture you dead or alive.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.062
[guards yell]

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.272
- [snickers]
- Meteor Shield!

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:51.816
- [guards yell]
- [gasps]

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.067
[explosion]

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:57.613
- Sorry we’re late.
- But we’re here now!

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.699
Kizuna, run for the hourglass!

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.659
You got it!

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.412
Stop the little girl!
Kill her if you have to!

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:06.872
Don’t call me little!

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:10.334
[yells]

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:11.585
- Eh?
- Huh?

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:13.212
You really did it, Kizuna!

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:14.672
Shit, this is bad.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.633
Everyone, get as close
to the hourglass as you can!

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.427
[groans]

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.678
[both yelp]

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.138
Hmph.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:25.224
Here goes. Return Dragon Vein!

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.601
[dramatic music playing]

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:36.110
- [music fades]
- [Raphtalia] Huh?

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:37.820
What’s wrong?

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.196
Raphtalia?

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.282
[man laughing]

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:42.283
That voice, it’s...

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:43.284
Kyo!

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:44.869
[Kyo] That’s right!

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.954
How ya doin’, Shield Dumbass?

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.248
I’ve been waiting
for this moment,

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.376
- this awesome, awesome moment!
- Master Naofumi!

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.336
[Kazuki chuckles]

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.547
Kizuna, you have
to call off the warp!

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.966
I can’t! Once it starts,
I’m unable to stop it!

00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.469
- [gasps]
- [Kyo] She’s right, you know.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.887
Why do you think I sent you

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.889
into the Infinite Labyrinth
in the first place?

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.725
Why do you think I let you
keep the raccoon demi-human?

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.810
Why? Why?! Why?!

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:11.896
So this was your goal
from the start.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:15.149
Yup! And it was all to see
that dumb look on your face,

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:18.444
a face twisted with rage
and mangled in despair!

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.612
Bastard!

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.448
Oh, this is exactly
what I wanted to see!

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.991
Now that you’ve had
your laugh, Kyo,

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.869
he insulted me, therefore
he’s mine for the killing!

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.120
[grunts]

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.414
Get out of the way,
or I’ll cut your head off.

00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:32.625
[Kyo] No, you won’t.
I need her intact,

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:34.126
because I’m taking
the little one

00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:36.253
back to my lab for experiments.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.881
No, you’re not! Raphtalia!

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.716
- [energy chimes]
- [gasps]

00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:43.219
[Raphtalia] Go, Master Naofumi.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.637
Raphtalia, what are you...

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.097
I thought
that after I became small,

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:49.725
I couldn’t help you anymore,

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.477
but I was kind of happy.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.103
[gasps]

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.190
I got to have you
pat me on the head

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.484
and carry me,
like when we first met.

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:02.655
No matter what might happen,

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:05.032
I will always be your sword.

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:06.325
Raphtalia...

00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:07.368
- [whooshing]
- [gasps]

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.328
[yells]

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.454
[Kyo laughs] Help!

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:11.539
I’m dying!

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.457
I’m dying of laughter!

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:17.044
- [laughing]
- Raphtalia!
