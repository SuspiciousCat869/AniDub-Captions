WEBVTT

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:11.428
[peaceful music playing]

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.804
[Filo] Look! Look!

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.599
I can fly in this world!

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:17.809
Since when could she do that?

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.063
Seeing her now, she doesn’t
look like a filolial.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.149
Since coming here, she’s lost
a lot of her attack power.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.109
[Filo] This is
a new look on you.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.278
Where’d you get these clothes?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.447
A stranger
gave them to me earlier.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.823
A <i>miko</i> outfit?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.866
<i>Miko?</i>

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:34.618
Well, whatever it is,
you look great!

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.869
Raph!

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:37.955
[gasps] Who is that?

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.581
Oh, this is a shikigami.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.292
I made it from your hair since
we needed help finding you,

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.627
and its name is--

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:45.337
[Filo] Its name is Raphie!

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.338
[Raphtalia] Raphie?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.048
- [light footsteps]
- Hmm?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.552
[chuckles]

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:54.680
We only have three days left
’til the Wave.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.516
<i>I was originally summoned</i>
<i>as one of the Cardinal Heroes</i>

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.643
<i>in order to defeat</i>
<i>the Emperor Dragon,</i>

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.521
<i>who’s known as the king</i>
<i>of monsters in this world,</i>

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.565
<i>but Naofumi’s</i>
<i>never heard of such a thing.</i>

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:07.317
<i>He was summoned</i>
<i>in order to fight the Waves.</i>

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.777
<i>We’re both Cardinal Heroes,</i>

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.654
<i>yet fighting</i>
<i>for different reasons.</i>

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:14.324
<i>I wonder,</i>
<i>what are the Waves like?</i>

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.494
<i>And if they’re powerful, am I</i>
<i>strong enough to fight them?</i>

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:18.620
[Chris] Huh?

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:20.622
- [trills]
- What’s the matter, Chris?

00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:22.749
[panting] Kizuna!

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:23.792
[Kizuna] Eh?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.464
Damn brat.
She’s nothing but a thief.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.508
Try your best
not to move, Kazuki!

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.677
There’s no way I’m
letting it end like this.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.930
[Kyo] Ah, you certainly went
and screwed that up, didn’t you?

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:39.975
Not only did you fail
to get a body for my experiment

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:42.311
by letting them escape,
but you also failed

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.980
to take the Katana Vassal Weapon
from behind my back,

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:47.774
all the while letting
that girl steal it from you.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.443
Man, you’re pathetic.

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.445
Please, Kazuki,
you can’t move, or you’ll--

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.447
Sit back,
and leave the thief to me.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:54.573
When I find her,

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:55.657
I’ll--[groans]

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.953
[screams] Kazuki, no!

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.997
- Kazuki! Kazuki!
- I guess that’s why

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.957
they were telling you
not to move, dumbass.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.502
Hey, Kyo, what do we do
about the other two,

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.379
the Cardinal Hero
from another world

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:10.922
and the new Katana Hero?

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.301
Huh? Oh. What to do about them?

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.973
Using the Boat
Vassal Weapon, huh?

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.141
I’m sure those bastards

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:23.393
are planning on using it
to head back to Sikul.

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.896
I’d put
those idiots down myself,

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.982
but I’m afraid I’m a bit too
busy with my experiments, so...

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:30.609
I’ll take care of them.

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:33.445
After all, I’ll kill
anyone who’s in your way.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.210
[wind blowing]

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:14.838
[Kizuna] Easy there, Glass.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.799
Squeeze any harder,
and you’ll crush me.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:18.800
I found you!

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:21.386
After all this time,
I found you!

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.263
I’ll never let go of you again!

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:24.806
- [Chris] Pen!
- Stop it!

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:25.807
You’re killing me.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.768
[both chuckle]

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.978
I’m happy for you,
both of you.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.480
[sighs] Thank you.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.109
We’re truly in your debt.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:37.694
It’s all thanks to your help

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.489
that we were able to reunite
Kizuna with Glass once again.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.534
All I was doing was trying
to find Raphtalia and Filo.

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.621
I’m glad you found them.
I’m thankful.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.748
We both ended up finding
the people we care about.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.374
Raph, Raph!

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:52.250
Thanks.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:56.129
Oh, right! I almost forgot.

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.423
Naofumi told me
that you guys had met before...

00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.925
- [gasps]
- but in his world.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.302
You three must have went
while I was gone, right?

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:03.303
Huh?

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.763
I kept meaning to ask,

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:05.972
but stuff came up!

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.641
What were you guys
doing over there?

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:11.019
Um, well... we were only--

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.646
We had to...

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.272
[Kizuna] You did what?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.149
What the hell were you thinking?

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:18.235
You invaded their world
when the Waves showed up

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.277
and tried to kill them?

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.529
I hope you realize

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.239
that this makes you
the bad guys here!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.615
[Therese] Please, Kizuna,

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.492
try not to be
too upset with Glass.

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:26.868
Just because
I’m talking to Glass

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.870
doesn’t mean I’m not upset
with you guys too!

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:31.122
I’m sorry,
but we had no choice.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.500
[chuckles] Ruthless.

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.001
Young Master, you are needed.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.336
Very well. Let’s go.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.630
Glad to have you
back again, Kizuna!

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.090
We can talk about this later!

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.425
And try to enjoy yourselves
while you’re here!

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.845
[Kizuna] Hey, get back here,
and explain yourself!

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.763
The hell? He acts
like he owns the place.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.181
And "Young Master"?

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:51.142
Oh, that’s because L’Arc
is the young king of Sikul.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.143
Huh?

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.354
Since when was L’Arc a king?!

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.898
Well I’ll be damned.
Young Master L’Arc, it is.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.692
I’m mad at you too, Naofumi!

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.569
Why didn’t you
tell me this earlier?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.863
’Cause it wasn’t
the right time to tell you.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.824
And I had a feeling something
like this would happen if I did.

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:07.242
What kind of reason is that?

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.411
You guys are the worst!
You thought by killing

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.745
the Cardinal Heroes
in his world,

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.248
that it would be able to save
our world from the Waves?!

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.666
Do you even know
if that’s true?!

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.626
Well, you see--

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.253
Even if it is true,

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:21.047
I can’t believe you would try
to do such a horrible thing!

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.549
[Therese clears throat]

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:24.718
I’m going to find
another way to do it.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.804
There has to be a way
to save his world and ours

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.764
from the Waves
without fighting each other.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.558
And what if there isn’t?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.976
Then what do we do, huh?

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.436
[Kizuna] Hmm?

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.272
What if there’s no avoiding it
and one of our worlds

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:39.274
has to be destroyed
for the other to live?

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.568
If that happens, then...

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.615
I’d refuse.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.034
I’m not going to fight
against my friends.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.660
I can’t do that!

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.704
And while I don’t know
how to avoid it yet,

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:56.249
I promise you this.
I am going to find a way!

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.835
And if I don’t find it,
then I’ll just look again!

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.546
Naofumi,
please just help me look.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.298
[gasps]

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.341
And while we look,

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.718
I can help you beat
that dumb jerk, Kyo.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.054
I want to help you,
Naofumi, so please...

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.560
Once we defeat Kyo, we’re
heading straight back home.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.979
There’s not enough time
to find an answer.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.564
[gasps]

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.400
But when I get home,
I promise I’ll look into

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.277
what I can find
about the Waves again.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.614
Thank you, Naofumi.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.994
[liquid bubbling]

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:34.496
[footsteps approach]

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.331
Are you positive?

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:39.250
You really believe that you’re
able to bring him back somehow?

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.379
Sure. I told you guys I would,
so why wouldn’t I?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.798
Take a look for yourself.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.424
[gasps] Kazuki!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.093
I want nothing more
than to make

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.304
the ones who did this to him
suffer the same fate!

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:54.933
Please, Kyo! Only you can
give us the power to do that!

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.893
You have the nerve
to ask me for help

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.770
after I went out my way
to heal him?

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.690
You two really are a couple
of shitheads, aren’t you?

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.150
But I gotta admit,
stupid or not,

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.152
at least you two
have some spirit.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:12.033
[street chatter]

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:14.536
If we’re planning on going
to Kyo’s place to kick his butt,

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.746
we’re gonna need to upgrade
our equipment first.

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:18.164
It worked out!

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.458
The kiddo and I are
on the same team again.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.876
Glad you made it.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.878
Yeah, and I’m surprised I did
after you ran away

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.006
and left your buddies behind,
Your Majesty.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.215
Or should I say, "Young Master"?

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.384
Hey, who told you that?

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.552
Was it Therese?

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.053
Yeah, but it
doesn’t really matter.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.264
I would have found out
at some point anyway.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.099
- [crowd murmuring]
- You seem pretty popular

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.475
around here, Young Master.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.686
Come on! Will you stop
calling me that dumb name?

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.062
It’s embarrassing!

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.314
Sure, whenever you decide
to stop calling me "kiddo."

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.275
What? Those are
totally different things!

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.484
How so, Young Master?

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.902
Stop calling me that, kiddo!

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:50.864
[nervous chuckling]

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.824
[music playing]

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.535
Would Romina
happen to be here today?

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.954
Kizuna, is that you?
I’ve been worried about you.

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.539
We’ll talk later, but for now

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.750
get me
the best equipment you have!

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.710
[chuckles] Good grief.
It’s been years,

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.378
and you haven’t
changed at all, have you?

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.298
Hey.

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:10.800
I take it you’re all
with Kizuna here, huh?

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:11.718
Pleasure to meet you.

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.805
Well, look at that.

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.725
Something must be going on
for you two to be here.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.895
So this is
the Katana Vassal Weapon.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:25.690
This is pretty a dangerous thing
to be bringing into my shop.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.026
I’ll tell you how she got it
some other time.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:29.402
For now, it needs a sheath

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:31.780
so she’s not walking around
with it out in the open.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.032
Well, you can’t
just take one off the shelf.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.784
It needs to be
custom made for this.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.285
[Kizuna] And this too!

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:39.454
This is all the equipment
Naofumi and his friends

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.081
were using
back in their home world.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:42.332
Can you do something about it?

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:44.084
What is this stuff?

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.585
I’ve never seen
anything like it,

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:48.213
but I suppose, if nothing else,
I’ll do what I can with it.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.839
But it’s gonna take me
about a week.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.299
A week? We need it tomorrow!

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.051
- Kizuna, that’s impossible!
- Please!

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.345
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please!

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:57.222
That’s funny. It’s like watching

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.057
you and the blacksmith
barter back home.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.017
- I thought the same thing.
- [both laugh]

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.018
- [rumble]
- [all gasp]

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.978
[crowd yelling]

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.355
What’s happening?!

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.819
Who are you?

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.405
My name is Yomogi Emarl!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.990
Prepare yourself,

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.910
for in the name of Kyo,
I’ve come to kill you!

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.873
You’re doing this for Kyo?

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.041
That’s right!

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.417
To deliver divine punishment

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.420
to the holders of the Cardinal
and Vassal Weapons! [gasps]

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.381
How cowardly!

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:33.883
Challenging me to a fight
when you outnumber me!

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.178
Wait, weren’t you
the one who attacked us?

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.972
Who the hell is this lady?

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.141
Whatever you’re doing,
can you do it outside town?

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.934
Silence, you foul vermin!

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.894
Outnumbered or not,
I will prevail!

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:45.937
Now die!

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.021
Here I go!

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.190
[music playing]

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.862
[Filo] These songs should be
able to help you guys out.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.072
[vocalizing]

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.282
Thanks for the help!

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.533
[laughs]

00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.450
[grunts]

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.079
I came here with only my blade,

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.790
so shouldn’t you try
to fight me all by yourself?

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.959
Oh, I didn’t think of that.
Good point.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.919
Don’t agree with her, Rishia!

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.921
[gasps]

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.048
Aha! I knew it!

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.467
Kizuna, just fall back,
and provide support!

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.468
That’s mean!

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.845
This is fine, though.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.471
If I can kill you all here,

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.932
it’ll save me from having
to hunt you down later!

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.767
I’ll finish you all here!

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:25.977
If you say so.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.395
Let her have it Raphtalia.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.688
Understood.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.648
Take this! Instant Blade: Mist!

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.025
Thunder Sword!

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.697
That sword of hers...

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.866
- I’m just getting started!
- [gasps]

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.243
Meteor Shield!

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.164
[Yomogi grunts]

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.792
Directional Blade of Heaven!

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:54.088
Wow! She really is strong!

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.424
[pants]
If I weren’t outnumbered,

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:57.926
this would have
gone differently.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.386
There’s something I don’t like
about the way you said that.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.971
That’s not quite right.

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:04.057
You’re outnumbered
and outmatched.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.228
I should have known
they’d fight in town anyway.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:11.606
What an attack.

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:12.857
[L’Arc chuckles]

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.235
I enjoyed myself when we
tried to kill each other,

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.903
but it feels a whole lot better

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.780
to be fighting
on the same side, Naofumi.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.156
[chuckles]

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.492
I’m more than okay to do
either one of those, L’Arc.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:23.660
Heh! Yeah, right?

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:24.827
[yelling]

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.621
Bejeweled Blizzard!

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:29.874
Zero-Stance Rondo:
Reverse Four Seasons!

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.167
[grunts]

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.002
[yells]

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.629
[music playing]

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.547
[panting]

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.511
Look. What is her sword doing?

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:43.805
Whatever it’s doing,
it doesn’t look good.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.515
I refuse.

00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:47.976
I refuse anything
but my victory!

00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.645
Hey! Uh, your name
is Yomogi, isn’t it?

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.230
Listen, if you
don’t want to die,

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.773
you have to throw
that sword away!

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:56.317
What a childish way
to get me to surrender!

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.610
Kyo made me this sword!

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.654
Therefore, I could never
fathom letting go of it!

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.489
Kyo’s the one who made that?

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:03.449
Well, that makes this all
even worse!

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.868
That’s right. And I don’t want
to be here for what’s next.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.787
I couldn’t agree more. Therese!

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.038
[gasps]

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.249
Bejeweled Thunderstorm!

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:14.502
Combo Skill:
Thunderbolt Wheel Swing!

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.045
[yells]

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.132
[gasping]

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.638
What’s happening to me?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.349
[gasping]

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:32.645
That’s bad.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:33.771
Bait Lure!

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:35.857
[yelps]

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.068
Blood Flower Strike!

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:47.118
Circle Dance Attack Formation:
Flower Blizzard!

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:49.245
[Naofumi] Get down!

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.416
[gasps]

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.171
[scoffs] Kill me!

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.881
Whoa, I had no idea.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.466
People actually say that?

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.634
You just saw for yourself,
didn’t you?

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.303
Couldn’t kill anyone
if I wanted to.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.263
[sighs]

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:08.765
Judging from the looks of it,

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:10.683
Kyo wanted to kill
both you and us

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.143
with that crazy sword of his.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.394
[gasps]

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:14.896
No, that’s impossible!

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.939
Kyo would never do
something like that to me!

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.316
[Naofumi] Really, now?
’Cause that sounds

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.526
exactly like the sort of thing
he would do.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:24.030
Shut your mouth! That means you
don’t know anything about Kyo!

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.865
And even if he were to do that,

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.618
it would be to make sacrifices
for his noble goal, that’s all!

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:32.789
Just curious. What is
this noble goal of Kyo’s, then?

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.123
[gasps]

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:36.042
You’re one of the Four
Cardinal Heroes, aren’t you?

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:39.295
Then you know what Kyo is after.
I don’t have to tell you.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.839
Nope, I have no idea
what he wants.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.384
What Kyo wants
is to stop the Waves.

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:45.301
Huh?

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.015
What are you doing?

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.600
You’re going to get us killed,
Kizuna.

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:54.435
Relax. I’m just
gonna talk to her!

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.646
What if she has
a solution to stop the Waves

00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:57.980
that we don’t know about yet?

00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:59.148
That makes perfect sense,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.359
but why did you have
to bring her to our house

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.568
when we could talk to her

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.362
in the castle’s
interrogation rooms?

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:05.822
She would never tell us anything

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.241
if we tried to talk to her
in a place like that.

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.909
She needs to know
we’re not her enemies,

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.577
so talking like this
is our best bet.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.287
[gasps]

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:16.582
Kizuna, we are her enemy!
You only say that

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:19.001
because you haven’t experienced
what Kyo does firsthand!

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:21.212
I might not have been there
to see it happen,

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.756
but I still know everything
from what you told me.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.884
And sure, what he’s done
might be terrible, but still...

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.220
if he’s like us,

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.347
if he wants to save the world
from the Waves,

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.683
then we may be able
to solve this whole ordeal

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.560
without fighting,
by just talking with him!

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.062
You don’t get it.
Kyo couldn’t care less

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:41.149
about what happens
to our world or anyone else’s!

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.984
That’s why he killed Ost

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.694
and so many others
from our world!

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.863
[grumbles] I get that!

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:49.365
But I want to know the truth
behind everything,

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:52.785
behind the Waves, and if there
is a way to put an end to them

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.620
without having
to destroy your world!

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.621
[Naofumi groans]

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.582
[grumbles]

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.459
Do whatever you want.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.043
I’m gonna go finish
getting ready

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.503
for the assault on Kyo’s base.

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.464
Yeah, go do that.

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:07.675
At the very least, make sure
she tells us where his base is.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.552
Of course! Leave it to me.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.473
Would you guys mind
showing Naofumi around the town

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:15.016
while I talk to her for a bit?

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:16.934
I’d be glad to.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:22.023
You haven’t gone
totally crazy, right?

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:23.733
No, I’m fine, L’Arc.

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.318
All right, then.

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.989
Find a place to sit and relax.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.408
[sighs]

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.495
Man, it’s been years
since I’ve been back here.

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:38.080
Still, I can’t believe
how clean it is.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:41.959
The others must have kept it up
while I was in the Labyrinth.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.420
[pouring liquid]

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:46.380
[sighs]

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.132
Here you go.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.760
What’s wrong? You’re more
than welcome to take a seat.

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:52.553
- I’m shocked.
- Huh?

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:55.389
I wondered what the base
of Kyo’s enemies looked like.

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:57.183
I thought it would
look more malicious,

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:58.768
but this is completely normal.

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:00.603
[chuckles] Take a seat!

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.818
While it’s different
in many ways,

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.488
this place reminds me
of being back home a bit.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.031
- Really?
- Yes.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.659
It reminds me of the place
Kyo and I grew up.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.620
You don’t have to tell me
anything you don’t want to,

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.997
but I’m curious about that,
about you two.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.624
Can you tell me more about it?

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:25.294
When we were younger,
we were childhood friends.

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:28.130
[somber music playing]

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:30.591
Kyo was always a strange child.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.555
He never played with anyone,
and he wore strange clothes.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.765
But when I would talk to him,

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:40.601
he would start telling me
all kinds of fascinating things,

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:41.894
about the books he read,

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:44.689
his country, and even the Waves.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.898
[Kizuna] He knew
about the Waves?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.483
Yes. You see,

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.027
Kyo showed his genius
from an early age.

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.238
He looked up whatever
he didn’t know on his own

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.864
until he knew everything.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.825
[singer vocalizing]

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.326
I took a liking to him

00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:00.037
and learned many things myself
alongside him.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.123
Maybe it was the way
he talked about it all,

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:05.042
but the more I learned from him
and heard what he had to say,

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.211
the more I started wanting
to help him.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.755
I’m not smart like him, though,

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:12.425
so all I could do
was be his loyal bodyguard.

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:16.095
I know more than anyone else
what Kyo is truly like,

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:19.640
but I’m guilty of seeing him
go too far and just ignoring it.

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.475
Does he do it
for his "noble goal"

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:24.061
of one day
stopping the Waves for good?

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.105
Correct. But still...

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:29.025
the faces they made when they
said his name earlier,

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:31.861
did he do something
to make them hate him so much?

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.529
Because it seemed like it.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:36.574
Is he doing things that would
put him beyond redemption,

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.492
in a place
I’m just too blind to see?

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:40.119
If that’s true,

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.830
even if we stop the Waves,
it won’t matter!

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:45.916
If he’s lost his way,
I want to stop him!

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.128
This is perfect then,
’cause I know I can help you.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.630
We don’t just want to fight.

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:53.341
We want to talk to Kyo
more than anything.

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:55.009
You have my thanks.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.345
However, if what
he’s done is horrible,

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:59.639
he must atone for his sins.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.849
Are you sure?
But he’s your friend.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.601
Or at least
he was at one point.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.728
That’s exactly why!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.190
Even if it means being
put to death, he must atone,

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.858
and I’ll suffer
right alongside him!

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.819
How noble of you.

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.696
[street chatter]

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:17.698
Against all odds,
I did what you said

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.991
and finished in a night!

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:21.452
Maybe it’s me,
but the crystal on the chest

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.828
seems a bit bigger than before.

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:26.415
That’s ’cause I combined it

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:29.043
with the crystal from
the Emperor Dragon you defeated.

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.419
And with that crystal,
you shouldn’t have

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:32.463
any problem at all
using your armor here.

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:34.924
I used the bones and skin

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.801
of the Emperor Dragon
and Guardian Beast

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.427
to make that armor.

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:40.638
Getting those materials
to work together was tough.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.932
What exactly is
an Emperor Dragon?

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.393
Oh, he’s the king of monsters
that I defeated.

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:48.270
Glass and I even use
its materials in our weapons.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:49.397
No kidding.

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.232
Thank you for your hard work.

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:55.027
I went ahead
and tailored that outfit

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.612
to fit the bird girl too.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.531
It should increase
her attack power a bit.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.116
[Naofumi] Hey, you’re right.

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:02.493
With this, Filo will
be able to fight again.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:03.577
Ohh!

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.454
Awesome! Great job, Romina.

00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:07.915
You might not be saying that
when you see the bill.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:09.417
Eh?

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:10.376
[winces]

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:11.836
- Here you go, Young Master.
- Huh?!

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.170
What the hell?

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.464
’Cause your nation’s
the one that’s in danger,

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:18.008
so it’s only fair
the young master of Sikul pays.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.844
All right, fine! Just go ahead

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.012
and send the bill
to the castle, Romina!

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.223
Being the young master’s tough,
isn’t it?

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.725
Quit calling me that, kiddo!

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:27.601
If something
does end up going wrong,

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.603
I’ll use my portal skill,
Return Codex,

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:30.938
to jump with you, all right?

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.856
[sighs]

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.320
If we succeed
in stopping Kyo here,

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:41.282
we might be able
to avoid a war breaking out.

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:44.034
Yes, but remember
the next Wave is approaching,

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.412
so we need to make a move
before it arrives.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:49.081
Well, we’ve got
a little time left. It’s fine.

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:50.082
Huh?

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:52.042
What’s the matter?

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.420
Oh, no. The Wave countdown...

00:20:57.548 --> 00:21:00.760
Divergent worlds
ruled by different laws

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:03.095
shatter both
of their independent barriers

00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:04.972
and manifest its power here!

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.807
[chorus vocalizing]

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:11.395
At last it’s been completed!

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:14.356
The Wave of Calamity!
Dimension Wave!

00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:15.608
[clock chimes]

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.695
- [shudders]
- [Glass] What is this?

00:21:19.737 --> 00:21:21.363
[Naofumi]
You gotta be kidding me.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:23.449
[Therese] But how?
There was still time left

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:24.992
on the countdown timer!

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:26.410
What’s happening?

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:27.787
[gasps] Kizuna!

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:30.915
[yelps] Naofumi!

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.750
[vocalizing continues]

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.464
[gasps]

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.090
[grunts]

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.640
[gasps]

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.016
Yomogi?

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.937
That’s Kyo’s lab.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.730
Which means
he lied to me earlier.

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:59.151
Kyo was never trying
to stop the Waves!

00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:00.277
He wasn’t!

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.947
Instead, he was trying
to create one of them

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.240
to use for himself!

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:06.242
[all gasp]

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:09.912
So then this...

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:15.251
this is what Naofumi, Glass,
and the others were fighting...

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:16.293
the Waves.
