00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.844
[somber music playing]

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.185
- [chain rattling]
- [footsteps shuffling]

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:23.774
[soldier] Come on. This way!

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.067
[Raphtalia sighs]

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.030
[sighs]

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.368
[no audible dialogue]

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.577
[gasps]

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:37.079
[soldier] What’s the holdup?
Keep moving.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.914
[scoffs]

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.958
You should know that you’re
going to be held here

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.918
until we turn you over
to Master Kyo.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.379
[thinking] Master Naofumi...

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.632
I bet you’re furious
right now, aren’t you?

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:50.509
[no audible dialogue]

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:55.973
But don’t worry.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.975
No matter how bad things get,
I’ll endure it

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.310
if it means getting
to see your face again.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.937
[gate slams]

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.146
[lock clicks]

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.273
[sighs]

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.274
[groans]

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.275
[energy warbles]

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:07.276
[gasps]

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:08.485
My power is...

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:12.364
- [man] It’s useless.
- [gasps]

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:15.117
From what I’ve learned, the more
you try to use your power here,

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.827
the more
it just gets sucked away.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.537
[sighs]

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.039
And since you’re stuck
with that tiny body,

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.375
I doubt you could
force the door open.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.626
L’Arc’s here.

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:27.045
And Therese and even Glass.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.590
How in the world
do you know all of our names?

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.301
Wait, that face
and the color of your hair.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.427
Could it be...

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.762
There’s no way. Raphtalia?

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:37.723
Huh?

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.600
[Raphtalia gasps]

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:14.945
[L’Arc] Oh, I see it now.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.239
That is you,
isn’t it, Raphtally?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.157
So how did you
end up in this world?

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.535
And why are you
so much smaller now?

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:22.786
- [Raphtalia grunts]
- Huh?

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:23.787
What’s wrong?

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.372
I haven’t forgotten.

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:26.832
You’re Master Naofumi’s--

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:27.874
[grunts]

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.668
No, you’re all of our enemies.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.169
[gasps]

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.797
Yeah. You’re right about that.

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.173
- [Raphtalia] But...
- [all gasp]

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:38.719
I think we’re still under
a truce until we avenge Ost.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.637
And while
you may not care for that,

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.140
I know you want
to put a stop to Kyo.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.767
In order to do that,
we have to get out of here

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.686
before all of us
are given up to Kyo.

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.689
But I can’t do it alone,
so will you help me?

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:53.066
- [chuckles]
- [laughing]

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.403
[Raphtalia sighs]

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:58.280
Now I’m positive.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.824
You’re small, but you’re
definitely Raphtally.

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:01.825
[chuckles] Of course.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.827
We feel the same way,
Raphtalia.

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.954
Our goal is
just the same as yours,

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.707
to return the Spirit Tortoise
to your world.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.791
However...

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.376
What is it?

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.671
We made it back home after we
stepped through the portal,

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.923
but it was a trap
Kyo set for us,

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.176
and that’s how we
ended up here with you.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.886
Interesting.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.930
So you three were sent here
the same way the three of us

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.474
were sent
to the Infinite Labyrinth.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.309
- Hmm?
- The Infinite Labyrinth?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.353
You’re joking, right?
That’s where you guys ended up?

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:31.563
But the Infinite Labyrinth

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.482
is a temporal prison
that can’t be escaped.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.942
Quiet down there.
Enough talking.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.861
Well, to start,

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:41.156
we should exchange all
the information we have so far.

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.909
[rain pattering]

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.204
[Glass] She was there
this whole time? Kizuna?

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.955
Kizuna was trapped
all by herself

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.373
in the Infinite Labyrinth?

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.542
How could I
have been so ignorant?

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.045
That should have been one
of the places I checked for her.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:58.340
Well, she’s out now,
and that’s what matters, right?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.050
So Kizuna and your party,

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.385
they must be heading to Sikul
as we speak.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.055
I’m sure it’s been incredibly
difficult for Naofumi.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.515
You’re right,

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.017
and I’m afraid he might
never forgive me for this.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.894
[gasps] That’s not what...

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:13.396
I could never
thank you enough, Raphtalia...

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.273
for bringing Kizuna home.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.818
So we’ll return the favor.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:20.737
[pants] I promise.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.489
We’ll bring you back to Naofumi.

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:23.532
What’s wrong?

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.991
[L’Arc] It’s like
I said earlier.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.452
This place is called
the Prison of Exhaustion.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.996
It has a magic
that constantly drains

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.915
and exhausts
those inside of it,

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:33.792
and the guard
preventing our escape

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:36.586
has his power enhanced
with special talismans.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.421
It’s a rough place to be stuck.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.049
[breathing heavily]

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.635
It’s worse for Spirits,
because unlike us,

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.846
they’re having their
very life drained from them.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.557
I was wondering why they
let you keep your weapons,

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.724
but that explains it.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.519
Huh? Yeah, that’s part of it,

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:55.230
but a vassal weapon can’t be
taken from its wielder.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.940
[sighs]

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:57.941
[gasps]

00:05:57.983 --> 00:05:59.276
[no audible dialogue]

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:02.237
[Raphtalia] So it’s just
like the Cardinal Weapons?

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.698
[panting]

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.116
Poor Glass.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.201
She got excited
hearing about Kizuna.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:11.746
And it just ended up
making her even more exhausted.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.665
We need to hurry
and get out of here.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.458
Hmm...

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.419
[gasps]

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.256
[Raphtalia] Our abilities
might be weakened,

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:23.300
but we can still
use them, right?

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:24.926
Huh? Yes.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.013
Then I may be able
to do something.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.143
[whistle blowing]

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.936
[soldier 2] Escapees!

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:36.938
[tense music playing]

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.315
[L’Arc] Color me impressed!

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.567
Your illusion magic
is incredible.

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:44.154
Is it? Unfortunately,
it’s all I can do at this level.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.156
[gasps]

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:48.992
They’re gone.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.911
[grumbles]

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:53.204
What the...

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.460
Where were you all hiding
a moment ago?

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:00.879
Why aren’t you answering me?!

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.924
[gasps] What? My talisman.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.300
[Raphtalia] It worked,
but my abilities

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.135
are nothing
compared to Glass’.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:10.138
[L’Arc] I wouldn’t worry.
she’s in a league of her own.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.223
[Glass] Who do you
think I am, L’Arc?

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.267
Where do we go to now?

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.437
Isn’t it obvious?
We head to Sikul, of course.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.981
We need to meet up with Kizuna
and the others ASAP.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.107
Couldn’t agree more.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.780
Master Naofumi,
I’m on my way!

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.407
Soon I’ll be back.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.700
I’ll be back with you.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.829
[street chatter]

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.332
Raphtally said Kizuna’s group
went to Sikul

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.751
using Return Dragon Vein,
didn’t she?

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.087
That’s probably
the fastest thing for us, too.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.215
Sounds good. However,
we’ll have to travel to Raybul,

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.967
since that’s the nearest
dragon hourglass.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:51.137
Raybul. But what if Kyo
set up a trap for us there?

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.264
- [gasps]
- Don’t you worry.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.683
We’re gonna try
and get your level

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.518
as high as we can
on the way there,

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.187
and on top of that, we’ll be
right here by your side.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.399
That’s right. We’re gonna
get to Sikul together.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.608
[chuckles]

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.360
- [stomach grumbles]
- [gasps]

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.696
- [both laugh]
- I’m pretty hungry too!

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.198
But the guard took all
our stuff back at the prison,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.616
so I’m kinda broke.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.868
Not to mention that people
will get suspicious

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.328
if we keep these cloaks on.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.122
You leave me no choice.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.250
- [clothes rustle]
- [both gasp]

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.461
[Glass] Where on Earth
were you hiding those?

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.507
[groaning]

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.721
[gasps]

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.266
Here. For you, Raphtally.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:37.934
Oh, th-thank you.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.186
Sorry. You’d rather
have food, though, right?

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.980
[gasps]

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.482
It’s not like I’m
starving or anything.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.443
[both] Uh...

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.611
[L’Arc] You look
pretty hungry to me.

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.196
[Glass] From what
I’ve heard about them,

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.032
It seems
that demi-humans in her world

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.908
change shape
as they gain levels.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.911
I guess they need
to eat a lot in order to grow.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.621
I’ll have to sell these too.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.332
How many of those do you have?

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.084
[music playing]

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:06.337
[monsters growl]

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.341
- Hah!
- [roars]

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.139
I could be wrong, Raphtally,

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:18.308
but it seems like
you’ve grown a bit already.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:21.603
You think so? My joints
have been hurting a lot lately.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.897
It’s probably growing pains.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.191
I can tailor your kimono
to fit again,

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.401
but we’ll need to buy you
a new weapon.

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.986
[groans]

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:32.864
I-It’s okay!
It’s for Raphtalia, after all.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.699
Sorry about this.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:39.788
[whistle blows]

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.873
Sheesh. They’re still at it.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.125
They’re out there
looking for us, aren’t they?

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:47.754
You’re very good at that.

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.632
It is a bit embarrassing
to do this in front of you,

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.425
seeing as we fought
each other before.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.843
So did you make Kizuna’s?

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:54.969
Huh?

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.680
She mentioned to us
that you gave it to her.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:59.599
Did you tailor it for her too?

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:00.809
Yes, I did.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.186
That explains
why she likes it so much.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.021
That’s good to hear.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.731
I hope you see her soon.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.399
[sighs] And, um...

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.943
you too.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.736
I think she meant to say...

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.404
she hopes
you see the kiddo soon.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.156
[nervous chuckle]

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:17.909
[chuckles]

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.077
Thanks!

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.995
[street chatter]

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.752
That’s where
the dragon hourglass should be.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.004
Looks like something’s
going on here.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:33.508
They’re deciding who will wield
the Katana Vassal Weapon.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.843
There’s a candidate for it!

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.761
And it’s about time too.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.264
A new wielder
for a vassal weapon?

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.807
Seriously?

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.768
In case we needed one more thing
to worry about, right, L’Arc?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.936
Hmm?

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.855
Seems as though
a Vassal Weapon Wielder,

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.106
like myself or L’Arc,

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.275
will be selected
in this country any minute now.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.360
It’s a serious matter.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.820
The mere presence of a Hero

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.281
can tilt the military balance
between nations.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.284
I don’t understand how it’s
a problem for L’Arc, though.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.119
Come on! Let’s go check it out.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.246
As a fellow
Vassal Weapon Wielder,

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.081
it only makes sense
I take a look.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.044
[crowd murmuring]

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.379
Gather around!

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.923
We will now choose the holder
of the Katana Vassal Weapon!

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:15.884
[cheering]

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.053
While many adventurers
have journeyed from afar

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.724
to try their hand at drawing
the legendary vassal weapon,

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.392
none of them have succeeded.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.270
But it is not a test of might,
as the vassal weapon

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.564
will only heed the call
of its rightful bearer!

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.524
[murmuring]

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:33.860
It’s looks like
they’re having a big party.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.612
That’s pretty much what it is.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.322
It’s no wonder
they’re celebrating.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.490
Raybul has held
this weapon for ages.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.410
It’s not just important
for Raybul’s military,

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.578
but also the people,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.872
because it’s become
a symbol of their faith.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:49.083
By the end of this,
someone here will become a hero.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.295
It’s said wielding it grants you
wealth, fame, and power.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.923
But drawing it’s
not up to the candidate.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.091
As a matter of fact,
it’s quite the opposite.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.510
The vassal weapon
decides who its holder is.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.388
I wonder who it’s chosen
to be its wielder.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.767
Candidate,
make your way forward!

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:07.936
If you truly desire the katana,

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.647
then draw it
before our very eyes!

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:13.691
[crowd murmuring]

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.109
[gasps]

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.152
Him again.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.862
[man] It’s Kazuki!

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.989
[man 2] But will he be
the one to wield it?

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.327
[grumbles]

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:27.330
[gasps]

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.374
- [murmuring]
- [woman] What happened?

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.917
[L’Arc gasps] Huh?

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:34.754
Huh?

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.802
[panting]

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.849
[soldier] It’s no good.
We lost her.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.977
[soldier 2]
She may have run into a house.

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:51.521
We’ll search them all
if we have to.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:54.524
[panting]

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.067
But how?

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:56.985
Why am I...

00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.821
This katana...

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:00.822
[winces]

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:03.283
[all gasp]

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:06.160
[groaning]

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.996
My slave crest!

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.956
Grab that girl at once!

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:11.749
She stole
the vassal weapon from me!

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.668
It was never yours
to begin with.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.420
[soldier]
Drop the vassal weapon!

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.672
[crowd murmurs]

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.674
I can’t! It’s stuck to me!

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.926
See? Once you own
a vassal weapon,

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.177
you can’t get rid of it.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.679
That’s not important right now!

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.764
We should withdraw
from here at once.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.350
[grunts] Let’s go.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.727
[sighs]

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:31.811
Mm.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.062
Uh...

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.105
[chuckles]

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.066
Raphtalia!

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.028
Raphtally! What a fool.

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:43.990
My slave crest,
why did it disappear?

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.577
[katana pulses]

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.871
[gasping]

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:52.582
What is...

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:57.920
My body...

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.339
what is it doing?

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.465
- She’s over there!
- [gasps]

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.850
[panting]

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:11.809
[yelps]

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:20.985
[bird squawks]

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.072
[sentimental music playing]

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:25.990
Master Naofumi...

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.784
Filo...

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:29.410
[grunts]

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.039
One more time.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.332
I’ll do anything.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.168
I just want to see
Master Naofumi one more time.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.296
I know he might be
upset with me,

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:43.007
and he may never pat my head
again like he used to.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:48.679
[soldier] This way!

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.431
[soldier 2] Go around the back,
and cut her off!

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:51.516
[Raphtalia gasps]

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:53.518
- But still...
- [yelps]

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:00.358
I want to see you again
and apologize.

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:04.612
And if you’d be
so kind to forgive me,

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:05.822
then I’ll stand by your side

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.157
and be your sword again
like before.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.242
[gasps]

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.911
No, it doesn’t matter
what happens.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:14.330
You can get mad at me
all you want.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.207
You don’t have to forgive me.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.837
I’ll still fight for you
all the same.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:23.005
But I don’t want
to just be your sword.

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:25.508
I want to stand
by your side...

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.177
[wind blows]

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.595
as your equal.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.766
- [woman] Who’s there?
- [gasps]

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.227
[gasps] That katana.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.812
Then, you’re
the Vassal Weapon Hero!

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.021
- [whistle blows]
- Huh?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.819
Huh?

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:45.736
Come with me.

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:51.909
[Raphtalia gasps] Um...

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.871
[gasping]

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.038
You can relax.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.207
My clan has been
in service to the Hero

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:01.085
of the Katana Vassal Weapon
for many generations.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.587
This is all a mistake.

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:03.963
I’m not a Hero.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.924
Whether you like it or not,
you are.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:10.052
The vassal weapon chose you.
That’s proof of it.

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:13.055
[Raphtalia sighs]

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:17.351
You look wonderful, Dame Hero.

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:18.436
[soldier 1] This way!

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.896
[soldier 3]
Surround the entire shrine!

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.398
It doesn’t hurt anymore.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.401
I can feel my strength
coming back.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:28.112
Thank you
for giving me this clothing.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.739
Eh?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.824
Please, think nothing of it!

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.701
[chuckles]

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:34.619
Farewell.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.458
[music playing]

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.751
[soldiers gasp]

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.294
Look at her clothes.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.463
She’s the Hero
of the Katana Vassal Weapon!

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:46.797
- [Kazuki] Step aside.
- Huh?

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.134
[all gasp]

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.177
What’s this?

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.346
You think
you’re a Hero already?

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:55.264
Wait, why are you
taller than before?

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:58.017
I don’t want to shed
meaningless blood here.

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.727
Leave peacefully,
and you’ll be spared.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.687
[growls] You have some nerve

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.523
talking down to me,
you disgusting thief!

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:05.358
That sword belongs to me!

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.485
I’m the only one here
who’s worthy of it!

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.445
Give the katana back to me,

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.156
and I’ll be generous enough
to grant you a painless death.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:15.535
I apologize for lack
of discipline with my weapon,

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:18.788
but if you don’t move,
I cannot guarantee your safety.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.873
If that’s supposed to be
your way of saying

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.584
you might accidentally
kill me, think again!

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:26.295
[running footsteps]

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:30.132

[gags]

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.221
My magic is...

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:40.393
[gasps]

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:41.394
[laughs]

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:42.853
You demi-humans are pathetic.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.648
All that talk, and not
a scratch to show for it?

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.483
- [heavy footsteps]
- [gasps]

[grunts]

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.489
[Kazuki] Hmph.
These two friends of mine

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:56.742
are copies of Byakko,
one of the Four Holy Beasts.

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:58.661
Holy Beasts?

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.580
Then they’re Guardians,
like the Spirit Tortoise?

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.415
To hell
with the Spirit Tortoise!

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:04.584
These two are the product
of all my research

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.294
and my loyal servants in combat!

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:10.006
So you’ve resorted to using
the same methods as Kyo?

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:12.425
How dare you say
that asshole’s name to me!

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:15.052
If you want to be
Byakko’s dinner, then so be it!

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.596
[roars]

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.347
Forgive me.

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:24.520
[gasps]

[bodies thump]

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.274
She defeated them.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.318
But that’s impossible.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:31.986
[Raphtalia] The true
Guardian Beast we fought

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.529
was much stronger.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.573
These are an insult
to its strength.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:37.033
[groans]

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.618
We don’t have to fight.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.244
Leave, and you’ll be spared.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.495
[scoffs]

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:42.872
Like I’d run from you!

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.375
Very well.

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:47.627
Instant Blade: Mist.

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:48.544
[footstep echoes]

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:54.592
Huh?

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.427
[Raphtalia] Don’t move a muscle.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:19:00.306
If you do, you’ll end up
like those poor tigers earlier.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.016
[winces]

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.142
I’ll heal you!

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.353
What are you doing?

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:06.687
Hurry, and go kill her!

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:09.398
We need to get my vassal weapon
before she escapes!

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.984
But you heard her, Kazuki.
If you move, you’ll die.

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:15.112
Earning Kyo’s favor
is that important to you?

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.157
The opposite! You see,
I’m gonna put one over on him,

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:20.201
and I need the vassal weapon
to do it!

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:21.869
The next time you see Kyo,

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.372
tell him
the Shield Hero’s coming

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:27.208
to take revenge for what he did
to the Spirit Tortoise.

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:30.002
Shield Hero? Hold on.

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:32.713
Are you that demi-human kid
who was following him around?

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.965
H-Hey, wait up!

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.133
Get back here!

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.177
That vassal weapon
belongs to me, damn it!

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.096
Can’t you see
it was just a mistake

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:41.597
that you ended up with it?

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.724
Hey, are you
even listening to me?

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:46.477
Where are you going?!
Get back here!

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.105
[music playing]

[winces]

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.150
I see.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.611
I used a little
too much power, I guess.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.780

I can’t move.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.841
It seems
this is the end for me.

Master Naofumi...

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.140
I did my best, didn’t I?

It’s no good.
My attack feels weak.

Hunting Skill:
Blood Flower Strike!

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.181
Well, that takes care of that.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:06.974
Thank you, Kizuna.

Raphtalia!

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:14.565
Rishia, you came. And Filo!

Master Naofumi!

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:24.325
I’m sorry. I was...

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.993
[gasps]

Master Naofumi, everyone,

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:39.381
thank you for rescuing me.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.383
I knew that you’d come.

Where’s the slave crest
that was on it?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.642
Oh. It suddenly disappeared.

00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:53.395
Raphtalia, you’re free.

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:56.106
So does that mean
you’re leaving?

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:57.149
If so--[gasps]

Master Naofumi,
I’m back home where I belong.

Yeah. Welcome back.
