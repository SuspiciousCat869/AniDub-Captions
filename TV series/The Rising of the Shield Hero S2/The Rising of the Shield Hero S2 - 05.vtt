WEBVTT

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:15.933
Where am I?

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.312
[heart beating]

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.148
[Ost] I am a familiar
of the Spirit Tortoise.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.150
Up until now, I’ve done my duty

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.861
and taken countless souls
of the living.

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:32.074
I did it to protect this world
from the threat of the Waves.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.576
At least,
that’s what I told myself.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:37.037
But...

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.038
[heartbeat stops]

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.873
if I have no need for emotions,

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.000
then why did I need
to tell myself anything

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.961
in the first place?

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.337
Why does it feel

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.422
like there’s a knife
being twisted into my heart

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.633
each time I gaze
upon their smiles?

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:53.595
Why is a mere familiar
experiencing these feelings?

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.099
- [man laughing]
- [Ost gasps]

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.642
- Laughter?
- [laughter continues]

00:00:58.684 --> 00:00:59.893
Who’s there?

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:03.647
- [laughter stops]
- [wind blowing]

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.149
Enough! Reveal yourself!

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.068
[ominous music playing]

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.365
[gasps]

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.284
[panting]

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.038
[gasps]

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.039
[scythe clunks]

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.416
Huh?! Wait a minute!

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:23.333
That’s...

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.795
[chuckles] Long time, no see!

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:29.423
- [Therese sighs]
- It’s been a while, kiddo!

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:32.509
Why’d we even bother
with those disguises?

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.762
You had no intention of hiding,
did you, L’Arc?

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:38.223
[Naofumi] L’Arc! Therese!

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:39.933
And is that Glass?

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:42.060
What the hell
are you three doing here?

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:44.688
[Ost sighs]

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.691
They’re supposedly heroes
from another world

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.402
sent to kill
the Four Cardinal Heroes.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.863
For the sake of our world...

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.114
you gotta die.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.450
[Naofumi] But they were
supposed to have gone home

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.410
during the Wave
at Cal Mira Island.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:01:59.328
[no audible dialogue]

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.542
Try not to look
so tense, kiddo!

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:08.587
I promise that we’re not here to
try to start a fight with you.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.131
What? Then why are you here?

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.800
Come on. You must know.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.845
The guy who managed to break
the Spirit Tortoise Seal,

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:18.847
we’re here to kick his ass.

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.858
[music playing]

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.488
You’re here to defeat the one
who broke the seal, huh?

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.658
It’s our world’s problem, so why
do you have to get involved?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.827
[winces]

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.912
Because whoever it was

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:09.249
probably came from another world
like those three.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.584
Is that accurate?

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.210
It is.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.464
In fact, this isn’t
the first time he’s done this.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.132
He’s trying
to control Guardian Beasts

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:18.925
from other worlds too.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.845
What he’s doing goes against
the very laws of our worlds.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.766
The laws of our worlds, huh?

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.142
I know what you’re thinking.

00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:30.061
We want you dead,
so why would we help you?

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.148
It would make more sense
for us to help him, right?

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.775
Well, this guy’s different.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.778
He’s wreaking havoc
in this world

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.989
all for the sake
of his own personal greed.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.950
And if he isn’t stopped soon,
then his actions

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.495
will bring misery and
destruction to our world too.

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.581
[fan clinks]

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.375
So we have no choice
but to eliminate him.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.419
These words
are their feelings...

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.505
the whispers
of our vassal weapons.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.341
So then, are you guys
after him too?

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.301
Well, if that’s the case,

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:04.262
then how about another truce,
but only until we stop him?

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.430
Huh?

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.182
But, L’Arc, that’s just...

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.059
- [Naofumi] I refuse.
- [both gasp]

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.435
There’s no way I’m joining up

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.813
with someone I’m gonna
have to kill eventually.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.731
[sighs]

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:15.941
[Naofumi] That being said,

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.943
if you’re not
going to start a fight with us

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.529
or cause any trouble,
then I don’t care what you do,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.072
so do what you want!

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.365
[Raphtalia sighs]

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.826
Yeah, I figured as much.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:29.454
Well, it was nice chatting
with you again, Shield Hero.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.039
See you around, kiddo!

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:40.465
Master Naofumi.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.468
This is for the best.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.721
[wind blowing]

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.515
[rumbling]

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:50.433
[rocks falling]

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.563
- [flesh stretching]
- [heart beating]

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.942
[Haikazuya officer]
That’s impossible.

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:02.153
You mean we paid
such a high price for nothing?

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.114
At the speed it’s regenerating,

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.241
we’re not gonna have
enough time to prepare

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.034
before it becomes active again.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.996
What’s taking the Shield Hero
and his party so long?

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.081
[Mirellia] Both the Shield Hero
and his party

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.916
have entered
the Spirit Tortoise’s body.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.795
They’ve ventured deep within to
destroy the heart in its body,

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.590
in hopes of putting an end
to the Tortoise for good.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:22.799
They what?

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.259
[Mirellia] Meaning it’s up to us

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:26.678
to stop the Spirit Tortoise’s
advance at all costs

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.888
until they’re finished.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.055
[officers grunt]

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.808
Now I, Mirellia Q. Melromarc,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.019
shall lead the charge
on the Spirit Tortoise,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.813
and in so doing,
hope to inspire courage

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.607
in the hearts of our soldiers!

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.858
How noble.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.193
[grunts]

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.364
Know that we’ll be
right behind you.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.785
Let’s not waste
any more time, then.

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:55.916
[music playing]

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.126
It’s hard to believe
the one behind this

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.836
could be somebody
from another world

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.338
like L’Arc or Therese.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.715
I wouldn’t be
so sure about that.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.425
But...

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.471
Something’s bugging me, though.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:10.513
Huh?

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.265
What’s the deal
with Glass’ getup?

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.351
Why was she dressed like that?

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:15.685
Who knows?

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:22.609
Well, Ost?

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.156
[energy chiming]

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.825
[Ost] This way.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.370
Wow. She’s remembering a lot.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.829
You’re right. Which must mean

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.165
that we’re getting
even closer to its heart.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.876
I wonder which way the
scythe people ended up going.

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.381
- [tense music playing]
- [chittering]

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.176
[panting]

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.804
Uh, L’Arc, are you sure
this is the right way?

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:53.682
Sure! Just look
at all these familiars!

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.308
That means
we have to be close, right?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.310
What it means
is nothing, L’Arc!

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:58.228
[gasps]

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:00.855
[growls]

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.774
[roaring]

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.198
[grunts]

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.496
[gasps]

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:20.375
[Naofumi] Is that
a dragon hourglass?

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.127
[Filo] It’s so blue!

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.796
[Raphtalia] The sand’s
all in the bottom part of it.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.173
Does it have something to do
with the Waves?

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.384
[Naofumi sighs]

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:33.847
More importantly,
what does this icon mean?

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.099
[Ost] It shows
the current number of souls

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.018
taken by the Spirit Tortoise.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.937
Once the hourglass is full,

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.605
it’s supposed
to create a barrier

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.025
that can protect the world
from the Waves.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:47.110
So I take it
this isn’t the heart, then.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.236
Unless it is.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.320
No.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.698
Unfortunately
this isn’t the heart.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.742
It’s merely to show
how many souls

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.119
have been harvested
by the Spirit Tortoise.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.705
Only now am I remembering this

00:08:58.747 --> 00:08:59.831
[all sigh]

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.291
- [wall crumbles]
- [gasping]

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.710
[grunts] Let’s go!

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:06.046
[panting]

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:08.840
[chuckles]

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.301
This is the turtle monster’s
heart, isn’t it?

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.553
We have to destroy it.

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:16.473
But what will happen
to the Guardian Beast?

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.558
We don’t have a choice, Therese.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.478
Everything up until now
has been against its own will.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.438
We’ll be freeing it.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.564
I understand.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:25.482
[both grunt]

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.697
Eww! This is disgusting!

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.658
[Filo] What is all this stuff?

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.369
Are you okay back there, Ost?

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.205
I don’t understand anymore.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.623
Huh?

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.708
The original task I was given

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.919
was to steal
the souls of the living

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.505
and use them
to power the Spirit Tortoise.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.299
I thought by doing that,
I’d help save the world.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.760
[gasps]

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.096
However...

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.973
I had no idea
what that entailed.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:03.061
Is this world worth protecting
if it costs the lives and smiles

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.771
of those
who fought alongside me?

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:10.485
Aren’t the souls of the people
who smile like that

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:13.822
the ones I should be trying
to protect instead of the world?

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.491
[both gasp]

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.743
You can’t carry
those burdens alone!

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:22.205
So trust in us. We’ll find
a way to save them together!

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:23.915
You don’t need to worry.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.126
We’re all comrades here
after all.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.253
Comrades?

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.671
Yeah, of course!

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.382
And I bet you
Naofumi feels the same way.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:35.510
Oh, he might not like
that I’m speaking for him.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.805
He wouldn’t mind.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.683
And I’m sure that’s exactly
what he’s thinking right now.

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:42.851
And also...

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.477
[Filo] Me too!

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.312
We think so too.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.231
You’re our teammate.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.191
Thank you.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.360
As the Spirit Tortoise’s
familiar,

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:55.697
you can’t help but care
for people so deeply.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:58.032
I’m sure it does too.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.577
So then let’s find a way
to avoid defeating it.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.829
Hey! I found an exit over here!

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.876
you think this leads
to its mouth?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.670
If this is the mouth,
will we get barfed up?

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.631
I’d like to believe that its
head hasn’t regrown just yet.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.092
What do we do? Do we turn back?

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.802
No.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:22.140
[music playing]

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.355
[Raphtalia and Rishia gasp]

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:32.192
This path should take us
to the heart.

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.153
Let’s hurry.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.742
This is it,

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:42.744
the Spirit Tortoise’s heart.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.748
[man laughing]

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:53.963
My, my. I never expected you
to come all the way here!

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.682
I suppose I flirted with
the idea of you showing up,

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.851
but I’m surprised nonetheless.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.979
[chorus vocalizing]

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.064
[gasps]

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.775
It’s only right
that I introduce myself.

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:16.069
You can call me Kyo Ethnina...

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.782
also known as the wielder
of the Book Vassal Weapon.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:27.205
[Naofumi] What?
The Book Vassal Weapon?

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.207
[singer vocalizing]

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.124
[Ost gasps]

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.507
[energy warbles]

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.050
[gasps]

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.636
You’re not going
to introduce yourselves?

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:42.887
How rude.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.681
That’s not his real body?

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.891
I’m guessing
you’re the Shield Hero.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.644
You certainly know
how to attract a crowd.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:52.230
Wait, is that
supposed to be your harem?

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.315
[Naofumi] How about
coming down from there, coward,

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.692
before you provoke me?

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.151
[Kyo] Huh?

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.070
[tense music playing]

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.657
[laughs]

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.701
You certainly
live up to your reputation,

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.369
Shield Hero,
but I should have guessed

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.746
you’d have quite
the high Provoke resistance,

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:11.082
unlike the other three Heroes.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.959
Provoke resistance?

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:15.837
[sighs]

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.964
The other three heroes,

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.590
what do you know about them?

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.343
Huh? Why the hell
would I tell you that?

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:24.012
Stop asking
other people for help,

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.055
and find out yourself,
you moron.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.432
[Naofumi scoffs]

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.435
[Kyo] Oh, but I can
tell you about them!

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.061
It’s pretty funny, actually.

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.354
The muscle-brained idiots

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.440
traveled all the way
from another world

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:37.191
just to waste their time here.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.235
[gasps] You mean L’Arc’s party?

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.945
Yeah, them!

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.989
As we speak, they’re
running around this place,

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.991
destroying
the Spirit Tortoise’s hearts,

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.785
fake hearts
that keep multiplying

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.370
the more they’re destroyed!

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.709
[gasps] Damn, what gives?

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.419
Why are there so many hearts?

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.546
[flames crackling]

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.214
Wait. Take a look.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.632
These are...

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:02.717
[fan slices]

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.346
Looks like we fell
for his little trap.

00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:08.181
So it was a trap?!

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.766
[laughs]

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:11.893
They really are idiots,
aren’t they?

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:14.479
You remind me
of being back home.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.439
Please know I mean that
in the worst way.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.982
Oh, cool.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.442
Too bad I don’t care.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.944
So are you gonna tell me
what you want from me?

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.321
I’m a busy guy, you know.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.698
I was gonna ask if you’re
behind this whole thing,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.575
but it’s obvious you are.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:28.659
[sighs]

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:33.331
I don’t care who you are!

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.291
Relinquish control
of the Tortoise,

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:37.627
and return all of the souls
that you took!

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:40.797
Huh? Was that
an order or request?

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:43.424
Whichever it is, you need
to rethink your game plan.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:46.219
I mean, did you seriously
expect me to agree to that?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.470
I couldn’t care less

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.639
what you plan to do
with the Spirit Tortoise,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.933
as long as you do it
in your own world.

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:53.976
[Kyo] Huh? Are you stupid?

00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:56.437
I’m doing it in this
dumpster fire of a world,

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.814
’cause it’s way easier.

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.024
This guy is
getting on my nerves.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.026
I don’t like him much, either.

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.653
He’s rude.

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:06.155
If you truly believe
that nonsense,

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.074
then you
shouldn’t be surprised

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.076
that this world’s people
are fighting back.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:13.454
[grumbles] You don’t know
how to shut up, do you, woman?

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:14.664
Hmm?

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.041
Oh. Hmm.

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.127
Only the Four Cardinal Heroes,

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.045
who were summoned here
to stop the Waves,

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.381
can decide this world’s fate!

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.676
Which is why
you’ll give them back,

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.970
the Spirit Tortoise
and the souls.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:33.224
This is both my will
and the Spirit Tortoise’s.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.392
[both gasp]

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.644
[Kyo laughs] Okay.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.604
I get what’s happening now.

All right, then.

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:51.451
If that’s how it is,
then best of luck.

Please, Ost.

Although, things would only be
okay if I weren’t still here.

Hold on. We destroyed the heart,
yet you’re alive.

Even with its head cut off
and its heart destroyed,

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.718
the Spirit Tortoise lives.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.178
[sighs]

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:58.554
However...

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.601
That light is beautiful.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.687
I remember it all now,

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:09.273
about the Tortoise and me.

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.609
I remember who I am.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.110
[chorus vocalizing]

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.695
I, Ost Hourai,

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:16.947
give my orders
to the heavens and the earth.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.367
Sever the laws of reality,
bind them together,

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.118
and spit out the pus within!

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.329
And now I command myself

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.165
to reveal the path
to my deepest depths!

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.378
Ost, you’re...

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.879
That spell she’s casting.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.297
[gasps]

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:34.965
Please, hurry!

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.468
The Spirit Tortoise is reviving!

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.136
- [flesh stretching]
- [gasps]

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.183
- [dramatic music playing]
- [chorus continues]

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.270
[all grunt]

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.398
[sighs]

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:51.524
[grunts]

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:05.454
[rumbling]

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.249
What is that?

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.959
It’s healing?

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.585
[Elrasla] Huh?

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:14.922
Ohh!

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.132
It’s moving!

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:17.049
[soldiers grunt]

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:27.518
[shrieking]

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.152
[music ends]

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.033
[gasps]

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.832
[Ost gasps]

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.334
[Kyo sighs]
Talk about a pain in the ass.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:54.545
I was hoping
you wouldn’t show up.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.881
But since you’re here now,

00:20:56.922 --> 00:21:00.009
welcome to the Spirit Tortoise’s
deepest depths!

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.469
[tense music playing]

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.263
Damn! I’m surprised
that you, of all people,

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.848
actually ended up coming here,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.476
seeing as this must be
rather difficult for you, no?

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:11.604
I gotta admit you gave me
quite the scare back there.

00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:13.856
A scare? What’s he saying?

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.942
Your tiny brain
hasn’t figured it out?

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:18.611
Oh, but judging
from their faces,

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.821
it looks like the Shield Hero
and the green-haired girl

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:22.114
have realized it.

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:23.824
[Raphtalia gasps]

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:27.995
I don’t get it.

00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:29.330
What’s he talking about?

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.540
[sighs]

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:33.667
[Kyo] If you haven’t
figured it out by now,

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:34.835
you’re just an idiot.

00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:36.295
Then again, if you’re that dumb,

00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:37.838
you probably
couldn’t have done anything,

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.799
even if you had figured it out!

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.636
It can’t be.

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:46.847
Yup. Had you just killed that
annoying woman from the start,

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:48.849
you wouldn’t have needed
to come all the way here

00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:50.518
or let any of those soldiers die

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.102
in that pointless battle
back there.

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.604
[gasps]

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:56.690
That woman isn’t
the Spirit Tortoise’s familiar.

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.776
She’s connected
to its very core.

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:01.570
You could say she is
the Spirit Tortoise itself!

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.405
