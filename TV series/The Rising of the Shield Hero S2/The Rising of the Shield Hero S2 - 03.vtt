WEBVTT

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:10.636
[rocks falling]

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.347
[rumbling]

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.265
[wings flapping]

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.477
[large footsteps echoing]

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.565
[ominous music playing]

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.909
[warbles]

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:36.245
[high-pitched screech]

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.205
[troops chatter]

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:39.623
[ominous music continues]

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.213
[running footsteps]

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:47.589
[man] I bear a message.

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:51.218
The scouts say the Spirit
Tortoise is active once again.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.344
[all gasp]

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.304
While nothing has happened yet,

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.723
it seems
that preparations have begun

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.350
for the attack
on the Spirit Tortoise,

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.978
and they’re
awaiting your orders.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:01.937
[Mirellia grunts]

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:08.026
Then go tell
Lowhirot’s siege units,

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.654
along with the Spirit
Tortoise Kingdom’s sappers,

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.614
to take the positions
that we discussed.

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:13.699
Right!

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.617
[chorus vocalizing]

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.083
It’s only right
I take command of the sappers.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.167
Leave it to me.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.716
Good luck to you.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:31.925
[grunts]

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.940
[music ends]

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.859
[wind blowing]

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.868
You’re one
of the Queen’s aides, right?

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.119
Why are you here?

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.622
I’m here to inform you
that I’ve been trusted

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.583
with the task of being
your messenger, I daresay.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.501
[gasps] Wait a second.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.212
Aren’t you
one of Melty’s Shadows?

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:11.548
If you are,
then shouldn’t you be with her?

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.550
It was actually her idea.

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:15.802
She asked me to come
to help you however I can.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.596
[sighs] I see.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.264
- [hooves pounding]
- [Eclair] Naofumi!

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.350
[horse neighs]

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.851
We’ll do this as planned, then.

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:26.438
Yeah. We’ll be needing
your skills as an instructor,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.273
so try not to get yourself
killed out there.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.025
[chuckles]

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:32.319
Right back at you, Shield Hero.

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:34.363
Good luck!
I’ll see you in battle.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.280
Hah!

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.076
Raphtalia, can you
help me out with this?

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.285
Hmm?

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:43.830
Sure!

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.292
[metal rattles]

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.629
- Eh?
- Huh?

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.256
[Filo] What’s taking so long?
Let’s hurry up!

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.098
[sighs]

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.266
Battalion!

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:04.351
[dramatic music rises]

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:05.435
[officer] Company!

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:06.436
[officers] Company!

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.650
Draw swords!

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:13.568
- Draw swords!
- [soldiers] Draw swords!

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.153
[gear rattling]

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.447
[chorus vocalizing]

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.159
[officer 2] Ready!

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.077
[armor clanks]

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.169
[Eclair] Forward!

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.718
[gasps]

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.719
Take a look!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.720
- [gasps]
- Ah!

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.514
[soldier] That flag!
It must be him!

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.810
- The Shield Hero!
- [soldiers murmuring]

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:48.270
I can’t believe it.
How exciting.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.312
The Shield Hero!

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.772
- I can’t see!
- Shield Hero!

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:51.898
Shield Hero!

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.358
[chatter continues]

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.819
- Shield Hero!
- Over here!

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:57.112
[soldier]
We’re counting on you!

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.699
[shouting, cheering continue]

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.624
Isn’t that something?

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.209
One raise of his fist

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.378
was enough to boost
the morale of the troops.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.590
Oh, I see.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.925
So that’s why
he wanted the flag.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.178
That’s certainly part of it.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.305
But later on,
it’ll serve as word of warning

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.265
for our enemies to stay back.

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:28.769
I hope it works. After all,
I am about to summon it.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.061
Huh?

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.897
[bats screeching]

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:34.441
[gasps]

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.861
Are you ready, Rishia?

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:38.904
Y-Yes!

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.411
[Naofumi] Right.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.807
[screeching]

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.017
[gasps]

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.478
[grunts]

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.566
Now, Filo!

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:40.942
All right!

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.489
Hate Reaction!

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:54.915
It’s working, right?

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.000
It might be for now.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:57.959
Floor it, Filo!

00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.961
We can’t let them
catch up to us!

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.339
I’m on it, Master!

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.633
We’re counting on you, Naofumi.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:05.634
[chorus vocalizing]

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.177
Stay in formation!

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.971
We’re going to try and
lure the Spirit Tortoise away!

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.807
[soldiers yell]

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.107
Get the weapons ready!

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.734
[rumbling]

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.735
It’s here!

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.326
[both gasp]

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.208
Tactical column!

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.252
- Tactical column!
- [cavalry] Tactical column!

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.798
[vocalizing continues]

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:52.555
[grunts]

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:53.932
Get ready!

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.061
They’re catching up!

00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:58.979
[gasps]

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.777
Well, we’ve got it where
we want it, that’s for sure.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.196
[Rishia] W-We can’t
keep this up any longer!

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:11.324
Damn it!

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.450
Filo, stop!

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.035
[Filo grunts]

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.623
We’re taking down
all the familiars here and now!

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.083
- Right!
- [Filo] Right!

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.168
[Rishia]
D-D-Did you say all of them?

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.837
[laughs]

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:27.340
They might very well take
all of us out in one fell swoop!

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.135
Get out there and show me
what you got, Rishia!

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.095
O-Okay!

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:35.557
I, Ost Hourai, give my orders
to the heavens and the earth.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.059
Sever the laws of reality,
bind them together,

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:40.103
and spit out the pus within.

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.521
Huh?

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.981
By my power,

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.359
may the gravity of those
before me be amplified!

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.404
Ultra-Gravity Enhancement:
Sinking Temple!

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.864
[screeching]

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.240
Hold on.

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.534
Is she controlling
gravity right now?

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:57.162
[Rishia] I’ve never heard
an incantation like that.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.455
[winces]

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.499
That’s because only
a few monsters can use it.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.461
[yetis groaning]

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.921
Quick! Now’s your chance!

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.381
[grunts]

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.551
Raphtalia! Filo!
Rishia! Old woman!

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:12.469
[all] Right!

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:16.806
Fire!

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.058
[soldiers] Fire!

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.898
[roars]

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.987
[growls]

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.031
[soldiers gasping]

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.949
[chorus vocalizing]

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:44.793
Ying-Yang Blade!

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.759
[yetis groan]

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.554
Hengen Muso Secret Technique:
Crescent Moon!

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.060
[grunts]

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.061
[winces]

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:06.272
Drifa Tornado!

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.945
[Rishia] You’re all
seriously amazing.

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.072
Even so, it doesn’t really seem

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.615
like we’re having
much of an effect.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:16.783
Reporting, I daresay.

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:21.037
The Spirit Tortoise
hasn’t been stopped.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.706
The siege-weapon attack
proved to be ineffective.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:24.958
[gasps]

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.293
However, the siege-weapon teams

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:29.838
are continuing the assault
with no sign of retreat.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.005
[roars]

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.883
Concentrate your attacks
on its right foreleg!

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.886
Our goal now is to
at least take out one of them!

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.513
[rocket whistles]

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:39.597
The right leg!

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:43.226
Concentrate your aim
on its right foreleg!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.394
Fire!

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:54.279
[roars]

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.492
[soldiers scream]

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:04.956
Over 50% of their men
are now casualties, I daresay.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.124
And the sappers?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.792
Preparations are complete,

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.419
and the bombing team’s
withdrawn.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.254
But one person remained alone,

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.006
the Spirit Tortoise Kingdom’s
commander.

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:13.923
What?

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.847
[roars]

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.143
[panting]

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.687
Don’t be in such a hurry,
big guy.

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.815
I’m gonna send you back
to your eternal slumber.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.408
Another Shadow’s signal.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.035
The sappers’ bombs worked

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.412
and have stopped
the Tortoise for now.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.165
Judging from the commander’s
vulnerable position,

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.585
he met his end shortly
after the collapse, I daresay.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:51.836
I see.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.258
[both grunt]

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.729
[high-pitched screech]

[wheels clattering]

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.990
Now all that’s left for us
to do is cut off its head.

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:25.578
[Elrasla sighs]

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.081
Something like that
is beyond even me.

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.332
If my two students

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.584
had completely mastered
Hengen Muso style,

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:33.503
then it would be
a different story.

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.255
- My apologies.
- [sighs]

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.840
[wind blowing]

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:40.927
[Rishia sighs]

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.136
What’s wrong?

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.305
Well, um, I’ve been
looking through the pages

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:47.058
of these records that the Queen
found just before the battle

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.060
and was kind enough
to give to me...

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.895
and it says...

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.730
[gasps] Th-This! This is it!

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:53.856
[gasps]

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.317
- [choir vocalizing]
- [Ost] Isn’t this...

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.694
- [gasps]
- What’s wrong?

00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:58.778
Are you okay?

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.989
Our best bet is
to get close and try to--

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.990
Sir Naofumi!

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:02.991
Eh?

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.826
Even when
the Spirit Tortoise stops,

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:05.827
it’s still dangerous!

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:06.953
What?

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.289
Getting this close
to the Spirit Tortoise

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.375
seems to have awakened
some information in my mind.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.335
It appears that when
the Spirit Tortoise

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:17.630
is in a situation like this
and can no longer take souls...

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.301
What’s that?

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.593
it begins to use...

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.970
a long-range assault.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.473
- [gasping]
- What’s that?

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.600
- [thorns whooshing]
- Aw, crap!

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.936
It’s no use!
Get them to fall back!

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:33.688
Everyone, retreat now!

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.605
Huh?

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:36.607
[gasps]

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.571
[energy booming]

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:43.489
[soldiers screaming]

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:49.954
This is insane!

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.456
Is it that desperate for souls?

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:54.834
[Ost] No. It’s taking
far more souls than it needs.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:57.503
I suspect whoever’s
controlling it is behind that.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.796
[gasps]

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.131
Meteor Shield!

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.926
Wh-Why, thank you, Shield Hero.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:05.511
This thing’s
gonna slaughter us!

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.891
[gasps]

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.268
I guess I don’t have a choice.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.895
Everyone, get in the carriage!

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.021
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.232
And you... Shadow!

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.525
Here.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:23.154
Give this message to everyone
back at headquarters.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.158
[gasps] Now what do we do?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.076
[gasps]

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.497
Naofumi, what are you...

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.960
[gasps]

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:39.212
Hold your weapons high,

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:41.339
because we’re charging
the Spirit Tortoise!

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.132
[soldier]
You’ve got to be joking!

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.051
That’s practically suicide!

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.094
Take a look.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:47.678
Those thorns it’s firing

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.931
aren’t landing
anywhere close to it.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.350
It’s probably trying
to avoid hurting itself.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.227
The soldiers
will take casualties.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:55.603
We’re in its firing range,

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.398
and we don’t have
any other options left.

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:01.317
If we fall back now, when
our formation has collapsed,

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.152
then we’re sure to be wiped out.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.822
Everyone follow the Shield Hero!

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:06.948
Ready!

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:08.282
- [soldier gasps]
- Charge!

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.659
[cavalry] Charge!

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.453
Update! The Spirit Tortoise
was stopped.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.288
But the peace
didn’t last for long.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.666
It’s now launching thorns
at our troops.

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:17.750
We’re struggling!

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.544
Now reporting!

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.546
The remaining troops
are mounting a charge

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.923
on the Tortoise,
per the Shield Hero’s orders!

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.592
What?!
Has he gone mad out there?!

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:27.760
Knowing the Shield Hero,

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.054
I’m sure he has
a plan up his sleeve.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:35.268
Pardon me! The Shield Hero
has a message for everyone here.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.479
"I’m moving the plan
to stage two." That is all.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:39.689
[gasps]

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.608
I suppose
it’s our only choice now.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.527
Rally your mage units, Mideus,

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.863
specifically
the high-class multicasters!

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:50.700
Begin initiating
the incantation immediately!

[growls]

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.209
If we all keep clumping up...

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.170
we’ll be wiped out at once!

Multicaster magic? You mean...

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.630
We have to.
We’re all out of options.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:48.758
[tense music playing]

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.760
- [chanting] Here and now...
- It’s hard on the mages,

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:52.345
so we can only use it once,

00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:54.180
but if we use
the spell like a mine,

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.848
we can blast off its foot.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.850
[Ost] And even if
the spell doesn’t kill it,

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.602
it should create
a hole big enough

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:02.396
we can trap the Tortoise in
to keep it from moving.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:05.066
Yeah. But it’s so big

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.902
that we can’t count on it
fitting in the hole all the way.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:11.489
If that happens, then we’ll
just have to decapitate it.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.241
It’s by far our best option.

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:15.201
You sure?

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:17.078
’Cause if we do that,
then you’ll also...

[gasps]

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:19.997
I don’t mind.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.624
When I first asked
for your help,

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.793
I knew this outcome
would be possible.

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:55.546
[triumphant music playing]

00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:59.925
- [cheering fades]
- [music playing only]

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.208
[footsteps shuffling]

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:33.709
[music ends]

00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:35.085
We really did it!

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.629
Yeah.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:42.009
But if the Tortoise is gone,
then Ost is...

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.093
She is, yeah.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:46.013
She did her duty as a familiar
to the end.

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:48.015
[crying]

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:53.103
Hey, Ost, why is Rishia
crying about you right now?

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.397
[crying]

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:57.483
Oh, thank you very much.

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:00.069
[shrieks]

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.195
[all gasp]

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.907
But that’s impossible.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:07.493
If you’re still here,
then that must mean...

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:08.786
Huh?

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:11.622
- [Rishia gasps]
- Oh, right.

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:13.457
Well, that’s a shame.

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:15.584
As strong as you are,
it looks like

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:18.379
you haven’t defeated
the Spirit Tortoise yet.
