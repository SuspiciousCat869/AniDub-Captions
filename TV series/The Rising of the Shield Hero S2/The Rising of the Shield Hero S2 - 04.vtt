00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.138
[Rishia] Years ago,
I was born into a family

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.932
of impoverished nobles.

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:17.142
[chuckles]

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:20.145
[sentimental music playing]

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.940
[Rishia] Even though
we struggled to make ends meet,

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.191
the villagers
were nothing but kind to us.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:27.778
[girl] Hey, Rishia! [laughing]

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.614
Despite living
a somewhat frugal lifestyle,

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:33.242
my parents and I
lived happily.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.202
[laughter]

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:36.954
But then one day...

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.080
- [doors slam open]
- [all gasp]

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.501
Who are all you people?

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.295
[laughs]

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.838
[henchman]
You’re coming with us!

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.258
- [screams]
- Stop it! Let go of her!

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.969
It wasn’t
until much later in my life

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.720
that I found out a wicked noble

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.847
from the next town
had it out for us.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.309
No! Father! Mother! [gasps]

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.061
[door slams]

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:02.980
My parents
weren’t able to pay back

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.108
the many debts that were
illegally imposed upon them,

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.028
and so the noble
took me instead.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.489
And just when I thought
my life was over...

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.158
- [boom]
- [body thuds]

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.368
[gasps]

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.415
[doors scraping]

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.251
You’re safe now.
There’s no need to worry.

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:27.004
Huh?

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.797
[gasps]

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:32.009
...the nobleman’s evil deeds
were revealed

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.512
by none other
than Sir Itsuki, the Bow Hero,

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:37.097
who came to save me.

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:44.313
When no one else could,
Sir Itsuki was able

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:47.482
to save both me and my parents
from that nobleman.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.526
I see why you like him.

00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:51.069
I want to repay him.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.739
I feel like it’s the least
I could do for what he did.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.617
Or at least find a way
to help him somehow.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.076
[fire crackling]

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.286
While I may not be

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:01.246
in the position
to say this to you...

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.082
[gasps]

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.709
he’s safe.

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:07.002
I’m sure of it.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:08.337
[gasps]

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.464
That means the world to hear.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:14.426
- [footsteps approach]
- [gasps]

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:17.888
It seems the decision has been
made after all then, Saint.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.974
That’s right. We’re heading
to the Tortoise’s back.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.978
We leave here at dawn.

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.273
[Rishia] I’m sure.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.817
I’m sure
Sir Itsuki is there, too!

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.912
[wagon rattling]

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.415
[Naofumi] We cut off
the Spirit Tortoise’s head,

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.792
but its familiar, Ost,
is still alive.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.253
Which means
that the Spirit Tortoise

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.755
could potentially revive itself

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.799
and go on a rampage
at any given moment.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.426
However, the allied forces

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:23.096
need more time
to resupply and reorganize.

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.474
I’ve got a plan, but it’s risky.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.350
We climb
the Spirit Tortoise’s back

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.311
and search for its weak spot.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.271
Sounds like our only option.

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:34.065
After all, we need to finish off
the Spirit Tortoise

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.859
before it comes back to life.

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:38.069
Not to mention,
if Ost has a chance

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.447
of remembering something
by getting close to it,

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.324
then its back is our best bet.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.534
[Ost] I agree.

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.788
Oh, I almost forgot
to ask about the big meeting.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.206
How was it, Filo?

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.834
[sighs] Everybody was frowning
and pouting the entire time.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.795
And they didn’t have
any food either.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.463
Jeez! How could you say that?

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:59.424
I let you take my place, because
you said you wanted to go.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.926
[Filo] Oh?

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.385
[Eclair laughs]

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.013
Well, I’m glad that Filo
ended up going to it.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.516
She made those grumpy old men
more bearable.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:08.892
Couldn’t agree more.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.186
And if Raphtalia went,
she would’ve complained.

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:12.646
Hey, that’s not true!

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.106
While they were upset
about the Spirit Tortoise,

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.067
during the meeting,
they only had nice things

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.610
to say about the Turtle lady.

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:19.778
[Ost] Huh?

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.489
[Filo] One of them said,
"During the fight,

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:25.492
she saved the lives
of countless soldiers."

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:29.246
That’s flattering, but I
don’t deserve your praise,

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:33.375
because my real job
is not worthy of such a thing.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.877
Huh? Come on. Sure it is!

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.462
[Naofumi] Looks like we’re here.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.381
[music playing]

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.555
Those sappers
sure did a good job.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.056
Hardly anything left.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.267
Can you get us
across this, Filo?

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.269
Yeah, you betcha!

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.812
Be careful, you all.

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.064
I pray that you don’t need it,
but best of luck.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.861
Ost Hourai,
best of luck out there.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.487
[gasps]

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.155
[sighs]

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.323
Thank you.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.783
[grunts]

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.577
Here we go, everyone!

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.494
Whoop!

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:13.665
[soldiers gasp]

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.424
So this is it,
the Spirit Tortoise’s back.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.264
[Naofumi] This is gonna be
a tough climb. That’s for sure.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.980
Do you think
that kind young man back there

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.940
had any idea who I really am?

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.026
Oh, you mean
the soldier from earlier?

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.319
I’m sure he did.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.905
After all, the general
sent out a message about you.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.364
Oh, that makes sense.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.199
Why? Is something wrong?

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.410
It’s just
that I don’t understand.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.913
I am a servant
of the Spirit Tortoise.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:56.166
My very purpose is to steal
the souls of the living.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.792
It doesn’t make sense.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.712
Why would that soldier treat me
so kindly knowing that?

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:06.134
Probably because,
despite your purpose,

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.929
you chose to stay
and fight alongside us.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.180
Even so...

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.099
When the Spirit Tortoise
goes back to normal,

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.601
you very well might go back

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:17.979
to fulfilling
your original role, but still...

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.523
It doesn’t change the fact
that you saved our lives

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:21.733
out there on the battlefield.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.027
That’s probably
why the soldier earlier

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.237
was so eager to show
his gratitude to you,

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.032
because you fought
as their equal.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:32.160
You know,
as a comrade-in-arms.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.955
Their equal, as a comrade...

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.957
Well, then, if that’s
how you and the others

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.626
truly feel about me,
then I couldn’t be happier.

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.711
[Rishia gasps]

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:44.714
[Naofumi] Ost, think you
can remember anything?

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.007
Oh, let me see.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.969
[Ost sighs]

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.887
I’m afraid it’s no use.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.516
It feels as if there’s a fog
trapped inside of my mind.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:55.558
[Rishia gasps]

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:02.273
Sure enough,
there’s fog like Ost said.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.109
[sighs]

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.152
[grunts]

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.238
Is it food time, Master?

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.281
I’m starving to death
over here.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.950
That’s a tad bit dramatic,

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:14.035
but yeah, I guess
we can set up camp here.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.245
[all gasp]

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.539
Have you lost your mind,
Naofumi?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.666
You heard what Ost said,
didn’t you?

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.751
If all we do
is wander around all night,

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.294
we’re only gonna
exhaust ourselves.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.964
[laughs]
Sleeping on a monster’s back?

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.632
You’re a brave one, Saint!

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.260
It’s my fault
we have to do this.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.262
Please forgive me.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.937
They’re cute, aren’t they?

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.272
Huh?

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.606
[both murmuring]

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.609
[Ost] You would think
they’re real sisters.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.571
I know what you mean.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:50.780
Since I’m an only child,

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.991
it’s hard not to get
jealous sometimes.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.200
It did have its perks,

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.077
like getting
all my parents’ attention.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.497
Do you find that you’re lonely?

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.167
Being away from your parents?

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.711
It was my choice to leave them,

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.504
and they
both supported my decision

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.340
before and after
I decided to leave.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.551
However...

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.429
when I was banished
from the party

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.806
and I couldn’t
stand beside Sir Itsuki

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.601
when I wanted
to help him most,

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.979
I started wondering
why I was even here.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:26.399
[cries]

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:30.236
If you had stayed beside him,
would that have been enough?

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.447
Would you have
accomplished as much?

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.782
[gasps]

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.159
Oh, forgive me.

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:39.496
Please know that I
didn’t mean to upset you.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:44.125
I just thought that now
you could accomplish even more.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.210
Eh?

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.378
Could you have fought
the Spirit Tortoise

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.797
with the Bow Hero?

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.216
We’ll never know,
because only the Shield Hero

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:53.635
was kind enough
to give you that opportunity.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.388
And because he did,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.433
you might help the Bow Hero
in a way you never could.

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.519
[gasps]

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.853
[crying]

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.939
I-I’m sorry!

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.232
Wait. What’s wrong?

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.526
Don’t tell me I made you cry
after all that!

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.403
It’s just that you’re
suffering more than I am,

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:16.324
but despite that, you’re here
trying to make me feel better.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:17.951
[crying]

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.577
Of course I am.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.788
No amount of suffering
is ever worth ignoring.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:22.789
[Rishia] But...

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.958
No need to worry.

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.210
I promise I’ll be just fine.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.212
[gasps]

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.172
- [winces]
- [gasps] What’s wrong?

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:34.008
I’m not sure,
but something just...

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.511
- [winces]
- [gasping]

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:39.222
Naofumi! Ost is--

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.015
Something’s not right.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.600
The fog has lifted.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.601
Huh?

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.396
[ominous music playing]

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:48.523
Well, can you remember now?

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.859
[gasps]

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.071
[sighs]

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.072
It’s that way.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.498
[gasps]

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:18.136

[panting]

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.412
I expected this
to be hard for you,

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.123
but it seems to be affecting
Raphtalia as well.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.833
You hanging in there,
Raphtalia?

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.002
I just need a second.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.462
[Rishia sighs]

00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:55.006
She must have remembered
what happened in that prison

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:58.218
and seeing the bodies
of her friends.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.721
[grunts]

[grunts]

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.400
Thank you so much, Filo.

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.328
[gasps]

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.746
Rishia, you’re...

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.706
[chuckles]

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.336
[soldiers crying]

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.636
[Mirellia] They lived here while
the Spirit Tortoise was sealed.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.596
I’m sure they knew
this would happen,

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.682
but if what
has been said is true

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:48.601
and the Tortoise
was revived against its will,

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.646
then that only makes it worse
for those who died.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.147
Did you learn anything?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.233
The Shadows
seem to have discovered

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.277
some kind of temple up ahead.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.112
Come see for yourself.

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:00.863
[both grunt]

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:04.242
[wind blowing]

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:06.869
Your Majesty.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.997
Excellent work.
What’s the situation?

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:11.958
Like the others, there are
no survivors to be found.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.503
But there’s something I want you
to see inside, I daresay.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.256
[Shadow]
The damage is extensive,

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.842
and the structure
could collapse, I daresay,

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.093
so be careful.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.554
According to the texts,
this temple

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:27.056
was a shrine dedicated
to the Spirit Tortoise.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.725
[sighs]

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:31.144
So then is this
where the seal was broken?

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.979
I can’t say for sure,

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.773
but I’d be willing to bet
this is where it took place.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.527
- [yelps]
- Oh, no! Are you okay?

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:42.071
Y-Yes, but thank you
for checking on me.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.531
[chuckles]

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:47.285
I-If you don’t mind me asking,
are you okay?

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.411
[gasps]

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:50.580
Yeah, I’m totally fine.

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:51.914
Don’t you worry.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.959
I just need time to get used
to all this stuff.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.461
That’s not true.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:57.462
Huh?

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.339
You can’t get used to it!

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.051
And furthermore, you don’t
have to get used to it!

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:05.386
[gasps]

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.517
[chuckles]

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.561
I can’t thank you enough,
Rishia.

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:14.854
You too, Eclair.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:18.024
N-No, I-I don’t have
the right to tell you anything!

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.484
You shouldn’t thank me!

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.777
You have my thanks.

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.278
[Ost chuckles]

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.031
[music playing]

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.616
[Mirellia] This is...

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.451
[Filo] The Spirit Tortoise!

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.788
[Rishia gasps]
It’s ancient writing.

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:34.207
"Spirit Tortoise.

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:35.625
The Guardian...

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:37.627
Beast of the World"?

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:39.295
You can read that?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.297
Y-Yes. Is that strange?

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:42.715
It’s not that hard.

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.592
You see, the writing
is rather simple

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.010
for this particular field.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.261
[Rishia grunts]

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:50.098
Meanwhile, it takes
practically everything I have

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.724
to read a spell book.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:55.561
It seems like these writings
are trying to describe

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.688
what the Spirit Tortoise is.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.317
However, it doesn’t appear to
mention anything about a seal.

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.694
You know, oddly enough,
you look more alive now

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.822
than you ever have
during sword practice.

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.074
Eh? Sorry! It’s just that I’m...

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:11.327
You don’t need to apologize
for being good at something.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.287
Maybe we’re better off
having you

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:16.707
focus your time and energy
on that instead of fighting.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.126
You might be right.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:21.129
That said, her ability
to manipulate ki

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.465
is nothing less than astounding
for someone of her age.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.551
I meant it when I said
she has the potential

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:30.096
to master Hengen Muso soon
if she keeps it up.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.013
[Naofumi sighs]

00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:35.226
- [sighs]
- Hmm?

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:37.728
Master Naofumi.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.356
I hope you know
what you’re talking about.

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.693
What’s happening here?

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.862
This looks like
the writing from another world

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:47.196
that’s used by the Heroes.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.782
- By the Four Cardinal Heroes?
- [Rishia] Yes.

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.618
But I’m having trouble
making sense of any of it.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.704
[gasps] No way.

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:56.747
[music playing]

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.207
Master Naofumi?

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.543
It’s Japanese.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.504
What’s "Japanese"?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.882
- It’s from my world.
- Huh?

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:08.384
In the language of my country.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:13.431
You mean this is
from Master Naofumi’s world.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.184
It’s known here
as the Hero’s Alphabet.

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.518
I imagine it was left

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.937
by one of the ancient
Four Cardinal Heroes.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:23.024
It’s faded, but I can make out
a few of the words,

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:25.109
like "seal,"
the word "seventh,"

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.903
and "shatter."

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.739
Seventh...

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.200
Does it have
something to do with this?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.120
[sighs]

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.666
[Ost] This place
contains information

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:44.003
about the Spirit Tortoise’s seal
and how one can break it.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.422
Hold on. You can read Japanese?

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:50.760
No, I’m afraid not,
but I am starting to remember.

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:54.013
The Spirit Tortoise,
to defeat it, you must...

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.223
- [rumbling]
- [all gasp]

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:57.183
The temple
is starting to collapse!

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.185
Oh, no!
Get us out of here now, Filo!

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.603
Okay!

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:05.024
But this writing
is irreplaceable!

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.568
Your safety
is more important right now!

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.778
[Shadow] Forgive me.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.446
[Mirellia] Let go of me at once!

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.365
I’m begging you as a knight!

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.209
[Eclair] That was a close one.

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:27.505
Another Shadow is reporting
that the Spirit Tortoise

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.007
is likely to revive soon,
I daresay.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.842
How is that possible?

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.011
I’m afraid
we’re out of time here.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.972
We must hurry and climb off.

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:39.100
Damn it. And just when we
were getting somewhere.

00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:41.978
[Ost] It’s okay. I remember how
to defeat the Spirit Tortoise.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.104
[gasps]

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.982
S-So how are we
supposed to beat it, Ost?

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:48.067
The only way to truly stop it

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:50.570
is to go inside its body
and destroy its heart.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.573
Did you say inside?

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:55.575
And how do you figure
we do that?

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.243
Deep within the shrine,

00:17:57.285 --> 00:18:00.997
there is an entrance that
will lead you into its body.

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:03.040
If you follow down that path,

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.459
you’re guaranteed
to reach its heart.

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.878
I see.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.464
We’re heading inside
the Spirit Tortoise, then.

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.465
Okay!

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.800
Roger!

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:14.969
[Rishia] Oh, no. This is bad.

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.263
As for the Queen,
Eclair, and old lady,

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.723
you can head off now.

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.558
What are you
talking about, Naofumi?

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.726
We’re going with you!

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:25.021
Right! Don’t underestimate
what I can do!

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:27.565
[Rishia] It’s now or never.
I have to speak up.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:28.899
I know what you can do,

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.360
which is exactly why
I want you commanding the army.

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:34.196
If the Tortoise starts moving
while we’re not here,

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:35.823
they’re doomed to fall apart.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.159
[Elrasla] I understand.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.704
Then I humbly accept
your decision, Saint.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.790
[Rishia] I’ll be left behind too
if I don’t speak up.

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:46.751
[sighs]

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.545
[chuckles]

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:50.838
Huh?

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.757
Last, but not least,

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.384
Rishia, why don’t you head down
and wait at the rear for us.

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:56.886
- No!
- [both gasp]

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:59.180
Let me go with you!

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.431
Itsuki, right?

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:04.060
I admit I’m worried
about his safety,

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:08.439
but here in this moment,
I’m a member of your party,

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:13.027
so if you’re going in there,
then I’m going too!

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.987
[gasps] Uh...

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:17.490
yeah, you’re totally right.

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.991
Forgive me.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:24.997
Now then, Raphtalia, Filo,
Ost, and Rishia, let’s go.

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.540
[gasps]

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:27.541
Right!

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.211
[wind blowing]

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.924
- [footsteps echoing]
- This place sure is eerie.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.634
Are we inside the turtle now?

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.345
Yeah, and if I
had to take a guess,

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.597
I’d say we’re
in its large intestine.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.766
Master Naofumi,
that’s disgusting.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.018
The real unsolved mystery here

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.603
is if this thing
only eats souls,

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.021
then what does it poop out?

00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:50.564
Master Naofumi!

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.692
I’m just asking
what we’re all thinking.

00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:54.235
[Raphtalia]
No one else thought that.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.278
[Filo] I’m surprised
it doesn’t smell weird.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.905
- [Raphtalia] Not you too, Filo.
- [Naofumi] Yeah.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.865
[Filo] I didn’t say anything!

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:02.201
[panting]

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:03.828
[Ost] Thank you, Rishia.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.079
[gasps]

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.164
I’m glad you chose
to come with us.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:08.916
Oh, you’re far too kind.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:12.128
It’s really not something
worth thanking me for.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.964
I hope that the Bow Hero
and the others are safe.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.173
I’m sure that would be

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:17.758
a huge relief for you,
wouldn’t it?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.759
[chuckles]

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:19.969
[sighs]

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.345
I said this a moment ago,

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:25.224
but right now,
I’m part of Naofumi’s party.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.184
[Ost sighs]

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:30.187
And as such, I’m just working
towards the party’s goal

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.565
of stopping the Spirit Tortoise
and nothing else.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.191
- [wall crumbles]
- [shrieks]

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.902
[panting]

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.821
[chuckles]
You don’t change, huh?

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:42.283
But that’s exactly what makes
Rishia so special, right?

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.785
That’s more like
the Rishia I’m used to!

00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:46.704
[squeals]

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.164
- [Ost chuckles]
- [wall crumbles]

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.877
[gasps]

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:55.921
[rocks trickling]

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.256
[grunts]

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.592
- [man grunts]
- Get back!

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.221
Hold on. You’re human?

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.681
[gasps]

00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:07.183
Fast Light!

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:08.642
[winces]

00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:10.352
You’re adventurers?

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:12.104
But what are you doing here?

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.523
[scoffs] Oh, you know.

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:17.735
The Queen told us we should come
here as well to help you out.

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.779
The Queen did?

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.614
I don’t know about that.

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:23.324
Would the Queen
really give an order

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.743
to people she wasn’t familiar
with during all of this?

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.411
Think of it this way.

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:30.080
The more people here to help,
the better off, right?

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:32.792
Well, I guess
we better get going, then.

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.461
See you around, kiddo.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.340
Not so fast.

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.050
Raphtalia!

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:42.301
As source of thy power,

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:44.637
I order thee to decipher
the laws of nature

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.431
and reveal these adventurers
for who they truly are!

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:48.891
Anti-Mirage!

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.520
Huh? Wait a minute! That’s...

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:54.230
[dramatic music playing]

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:55.314
[chuckles]

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:57.441
Long time, no see!

00:21:57.483 --> 00:21:59.485
It’s been a while, kiddo!

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:02.363
It’s L’Arc and Therese.

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:03.614
And is that...

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.784
Why’d we even bother
with those disguises?

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:10.162
You didn’t have any intention
of hiding, did you, L’Arc?

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:13.624
Don’t tell me. Is that you...

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.501
Glass?!
