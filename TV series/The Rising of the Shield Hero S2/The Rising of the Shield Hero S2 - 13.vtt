00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:16.350
Raph!

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.267
[Filo grunts]

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:29.696
You ready?

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:30.697
Yeah.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.617
[Filo] Softly...

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.536
[wheels rattling]

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.381
Knowing Keel,

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.384
I bet he’s upset that he
didn’t get to go with us.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.971
I left Eclair and the old woman
in charge of dealing with him.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.556
They’ll find a way
to convince him.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.015
Just before we left,

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.269
she told us to try our best
to have some fun for them.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.853
That was nice of her.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.480
[Filo gasps] Look! Look!

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.818
[peaceful music playing]

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.532
[Rishia and Raphtalia sigh]

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:14.908
Oh! Raph! Raph!

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.704
[waves lapping]

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:39.766
[birds chirping]

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.646
[footsteps]

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.815
[yelps]

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:49.776
[whimpers]

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:50.944
[yelps]

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:51.987
Filo!

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.904
Raph?

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.073
[moans]

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.492
How come I can’t fly anymore?

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:00.037
You were only able to fly
back in Kizuna’s world

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:02.289
because you were
a humming fairy.

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:05.042
It’s such a shame
that filolials can’t fly.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.293
[sad] Raph.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:07.502
Ohh.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.671
Then why don’t we
go back to Kizuna’s world

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:10.964
to visit or something?

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.549
[Naofumi]
’Cause it’s impossible.

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.469
I wonder how Kizuna’s doing.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.679
I’m sure she’s fine.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.641
If I had to take a guess,
I bet she’s fishing too.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.851
[Rishia grunting]

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:24.936
You should have learned
some survival skills

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.939
from Kizuna when you
had the chance, Rishia.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.733
[yelps] Yes, I know.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.652
I was just thinking
the same thing too.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.779
I’m guessing something
like starting a fire

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.906
would be child’s play
for Kizuna.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.617
- [scraping]
- [giggles]

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.618
What’s wrong?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.412
I was thinking about
how when my level

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:44.081
went back down to one
and I shrank...

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.583
- [sighs]
- how much fun we had

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.919
picking out all of those clothes
in Mikakage.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.421
Oh! Yeah, I remember that.

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.423
[laughs]

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.300
[both laughing]

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:57.511
Huh?

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.555
[street chatter]

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:07.312
First off, let’s get you guys
some armor and clothes,

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.064
’cause your defense
and fashion sense

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.149
are both really
in need of a buff.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.234
- [sighs]
- [grumbles]

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.112
[all sigh]

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.447
[peaceful music playing]

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:22.953
They’ve got Western
and Eastern-style weapons.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.413
If we’re planning on fitting in,

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.249
then Eastern is by far
the better choice here.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.000
[Naofumi sighs]

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.169
[sighs]

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.090
Hmm.

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:36.675
Um...

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.261
What are you doing, Raphtalia?

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.429
[yelps]

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.430
Oh, wow.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.557
I had no idea they sold clothes.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.100
I thought it was just armor.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.643
[Raphtalia] Look at them all.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.604
I wish I could try on
as many as I wanted,

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.065
but I don’t know
whether or not I can.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:55.068
[Kizuna] Hmm. You seem
pretty into this one.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.903
Hmm. Well, you are a girl,

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.656
so it only makes sense
you want to look good. Hmm?

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:01.992
Eh?

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.077
Oh!

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.454
[chuckles]

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.747
Wh-What’s going on?

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:07.998
Oh, nothing.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.583
Well, for now, at least.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.877
But in a few seconds,
I’m gonna help you pick

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.546
the perfect outfit
that’s guaranteed to impress.

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:15.547
[gasps]

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.507
K-Kizuna?

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.759
Hmm.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.678
[Kizuna] Come on!
Help me dress her, Rishia!

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.180
Eh? Dress her?

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.098
- [scuffling]
- [Kizuna] That’s it, Rishia.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.266
Hold her right there.

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:27.559
[Rishia] Y-You mean like this?

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.644
[Kizuna] No! It’s gotta
be tighter than that!

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.105
- [grunting]
- B-But it hurts!

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.148
[Naofumi] Hmm?

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.524
Ta-da!

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:37.277
You look like you could be
a foreign princess!

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.363
Why do I get the feeling that
this isn’t meant for combat?

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:41.990
Well, right now, it isn’t.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.200
But all we gotta do

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.911
is grab it like this
and pull it up!

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.078
[squeals]

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.873
Forget combat!
That’s just inappropriate!

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:52.000
[sighs] Come on.
Are you kidding?

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.419
Naofumi is totally the type
of person to go for that.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.796
[both] You think so?

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.172
Next outfit!

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.257
This is the "samurai
protecting her home

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.009
from foreign barbarians" style.

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:02.052
[Rishia] Samurai?

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.804
Sorry, but it’s too heavy.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.388
I should have expected that.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.473
Next!

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.433
Traditional maid style!

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.185
[Rishia] You look adorable!

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:12.813
Isn’t this
more a uniform for a servant?

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:13.730
[Kizuna] Next!

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.651
[Rishia gasps]

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.572
This would be great for playing
in rivers, wouldn’t it?

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.658
W-Wait. Why am I
changing clothes?

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.827
Can we stop messing around now?

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.620
[Rishia] Oh, that’s great!

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.331
[Kizuna] Yes, a combination
of cuteness and mobility

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.583
with a healthy pinch
of harmless eroticism.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.877
- [sighs]
- I think it’s perfect!

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.170
[chuckles]

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.005
You think so?

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.674
’Cause I really like it!

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.968
[Kizuna] All right!
That settles it, then.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.679
I wouldn’t have been able
to choose this without you two.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.180
- Thank you!
- Oh, please.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:48.431
You don’t have to thank me.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.685
All I did was help you
get dressed here and there.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:54.521
Let’s keep our fingers crossed
that Naofumi likes it.

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.439
[gasps] Mm...

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.191
- yeah.
- [chuckles]

00:05:58.233 --> 00:05:59.860
[peaceful music playing]

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.153
[Kizuna] Check it out.
You all look great.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.698
[Naofumi] Are you sure
you don’t need any new items?

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.616
I’ll manage with what I’ve got.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:09.244
But that haori of yours
is a total mess.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:11.246
It is?
Well, Glass gave it to me,

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:12.539
so I wanted to keep it.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:13.707
Oh. Sorry.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.500
Just forget I said anything.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.211
Master Naofumi,
what do you think about this?

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.462
Does it look good on me?

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.256
Yeah, it looks real good.

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:23.550
And you kinda look
like a ninja girl, Rishia.

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:24.759
What’s a ninja girl?

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.511
[gasps] Master Naofumi,

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.346
if you had to choose
between all of us,

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.432
who do you think
has the best outfit here?

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.683
That’s easy.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.435
Since mine has
the highest defense stat here,

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.770
I think it’s obvious
which one is the best.

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.397
[all moan]

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.566
[sighs]

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.484
<i>Man, I hate to say it,</i>

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.613
<i>but Naofumi’s</i>
<i>about as dense as a rock, huh?</i>

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.620
[birds chirping]

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:52.954
[Kizuna] Even so...

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.874
it doesn’t seem like Raphtalia
minds all that much.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.043
I don’t know.
I can’t figure out

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.878
what’s going on
between those two.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.338
[Yomogi] Oh, I see.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.049
So the Shield Hero and
the Katana Vassal Weapon Hero

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.217
have an extraordinary
relationship.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.011
I wouldn’t say extraordinary,

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:11.348
but there’s definitely
something to be found there.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.558
Oh, I’m sorry, Yomogi.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.768
We’re supposed to be fishing,

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.853
but I’m over here
babbling away.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:17.938
- [chuckles]
- [Chris squeals]

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.231
Please. You’re working so hard

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.068
to repair relations between
Ruware and the other nations

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.402
that I hardly see you.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.238
I’m just thankful
I get some time with you.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.825
[chuckles] It’s hardly work
if I enjoy it, right?

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.536
If anything, I’d actually like
to hear more of your stories,

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:34.871
if you don’t mind.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.915
Oh, really? If you say so.

As long as I’m not boring you.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.086
So then, can you
tell me any stories

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.004
about your time back
in the Infinite Labyrinth?

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.214
Huh?

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.967
I heard being sent there
was a death sentence,

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.802
since no one’s ever escaped.

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:50.720
But you were trapped there
for many years

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.556
and still managed to survive
all by yourself, right?

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.892
Well, yeah. I guess I did.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.269
Time flies, huh? Hmm.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.105
So what was it like in there?

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.273
I mean, I can’t even
begin to imagine

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.442
what life must have been like
in the Labyrinth.

Should I cook it

Or maybe I should steam it.

Maybe fish stew is the move?

Eh, I’d need to make
a broth too, though.

How about I cook it
in a salt crust?

Yes, but that ball was to you
what Kyo was to me.

thinking of it.

that he was working on.

I asked him what was wrong,

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:23.112
and he asked back,
"Yomogi, where are my glasses?"

Get it? [chuckles]

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.075
Because his glasses
were right there

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.744
in the middle of his face
the entire time!

And do you know
what he said he realized it?

He looked at me and said,

have said something."

were the last fun moments
I can remember having with him.

Glass and the others
will come looking for us.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.890
I know, right? And we’ve
got one more job to do.

[Filo] Aww! It’s fine, Master!
Trust me!

hooked up to you!

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.290
Jump across?

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:58.666
I’m sorry, Filo,

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:01.043
but jumping and
flying like a humming fairy

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:03.212
are two completely
different things.

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:04.589
Aww!

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.507
[groans]

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.342
I’m sorry, Master.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.428
I’ll just take
the long way around.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.221
[wheel rattles]

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.019
This stinks.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.770
I wish I could fly again.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.189
[Naofumi] I know,
but in this world,

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.982
you just can’t, okay?

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.111
If only Ost were here.
She’d be able to help.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.821
Oh, that’s right! I forgot!

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:31.949
If she wanted to, Ost would be
able to use her gravity magic

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.576
to make both Filo
and the carriage

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:34.577
float like they’re flying!

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:36.370
That’s right!
I can just imagine

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:38.080
her smiling
and watching with us.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.081
[laughs]

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.542
[both laugh]

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.836
Remember when she’d
try to be subtle

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:45.671
and say things
she thought weren’t obvious,

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.632
but were actually
the total opposite?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.842
And it ended up
just making everything worse?

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:52.303
Uh...

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:53.846
[gasps]

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.139
Hold on.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.850
Rishia, you can’t
talk about that!

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.769
[chuckling]

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.773
[insects chirping]

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:08.486
[sighs]

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.363
Um, Ost...

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:11.614
What is it, Raphtalia?

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.866
Do you mind
if I ask you something?

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.160
Not at all! Please ask me
anything you’d like.

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.413
What exactly does it mean...

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:20.414
to get intimate?

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:21.457
[Rishia spits]

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:22.959
[coughing]

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.336
[Ost] Hmm. Well...

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:26.504
well...

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.382
"To get intimate"?
What’s that mean?

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:32.635
Ost said that when she was
giving advice to Rishia.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:34.929
I guess I just didn’t
understand what she meant.

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.556
Oh, yes, I remember that!

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:39.058
I did give her advice
on getting intimate earlier.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.059
[Rishia squeals]

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.228
Ost, please!

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.563
[Ost chuckles]

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.022
You see, Raphtalia,

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.816
when I said to "get intimate,"
I meant--

00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:48.901
Agh! No, what are you doing?!

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:51.028
I meant don’t tell her, Ost!

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.363
Oh? You did?

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.865
It’s okay, Rishia. I’ll be fine.

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.075
Eh?

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:58.327
I am Master Naofumi’s sword.

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:01.289
I can accept anything,
no matter what it may be.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.458
Yeah, I wouldn’t be
so sure about that.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.003
[Ost] Okay,
I’ll tell you in secret, then.

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:08.421
- [gasps]
- Whisper,

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.006
whisper, whisper, whisper...

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.591
- [Rishia gasping]
- whisper, whisper, whisper...

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:12.592
whisper, whisper...

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.969
[Rishia]
This isn’t my fault, okay?!

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.470
[Ost] And that’s how it works.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:17.513
[Raphtalia] Huh?

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.599
- You do what with his what?
- [squeals]

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.100
- I don’t understand.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.602
What is his "thing"?

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:24.353
And what do I do with it?

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:25.688
[groans]

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.065
It’s not fair you’re
only telling Raphtalia!

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.318
I want to be in the know too!

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.653
[Rishia] Well,
if Raphtalia doesn’t get it,

00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:36.240
then I’d say it’s
probably safe to tell Filo.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.200
Whisper, whisper, whisper...

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:40.411
[Filo] Hmm?

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.913
You told her to try
and mate with Master?

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.833
- [gasps]
- Did she say, "Mate"?

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.710
Ost, just what
did you tell Rishia

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.128
to do with Master Naofumi?!

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.632
[Ost] Oh, dear. I guess you
figured it out too, Raphtalia.

00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:53.924
I didn’t figure out anything!

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.760
I mean, I didn’t,
but I kind of did!

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.094
- Stop it, already!
- [chuckling]

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.804
Can we please
talk about anything else?

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:01.015
- Maybe I need to go into...
- Hey, are you even listening...

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.642
- ...a little bit more detail...
- ...to me, Ost?!

00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:04.060
[Raphtalia]
I-I think I’ve heard plenty.

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:06.520
[chuckles] I’d be
more than happy to listen.

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:08.648
No! Filo, it’s indecent!

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:09.940
How is it indecent?

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.109
Is mating with someone
inappropriate?

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.444
Uhh! Well...

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.654
I don’t really know.

00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:18.157
No, it’s not.
It’s a wonderful thing, Filo.

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:21.285
But when I said it, it was
in an indecent sense, though.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.287
[Raphtalia] I don’t know
what’s right anymore.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.331
And what does
"what with his what" mean?

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:27.416
Please, I’m begging you!
Stop it!

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:29.251
[Ost] Oh, my! [laughs]

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.879
[Rishia] You’re the only one
laughing about this, Ost!

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.839
[Ost laughs]

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.009
[Raphtalia] Our adventure
was a crazy one,

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:38.386
but it really was fun.

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:39.428
[Rishia] All I remember

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.430
is being scared to death
the entire time!

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:42.848
[Naofumi] What are
the three of you

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:43.974
talking about back there?

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.976
[Filo] Um, you and I, Master,

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.812
according to Ost,
are going to--

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.021
[Raphtalia] Stop it!

00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:50.523
[Filo] Huh?

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:52.441
[wind blowing]

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.987
Well, we finally made it.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.031
We’re here, Ost.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.606
Are you guys ready?

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:33.816
Yeah.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:34.817
Yeah!

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.277
Raph!

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.494
[gasps]
