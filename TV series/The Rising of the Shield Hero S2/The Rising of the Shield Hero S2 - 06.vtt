WEBVTT

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.344
You mean this whole time,

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:12.679
Ost wasn’t just a familiar,

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.015
she <i>was</i> the Spirit Tortoise?

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:17.809
[Kyo] It makes sense if you
think about it for a second.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.520
Hell, if she were a familiar,

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.189
she’d be under my control
like the bats and yetis are,

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.566
but as you can see,
she’s unaffected.

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.568
- [Raphtalia gasps]
- I gotta say,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.986
I didn’t think
the Guardian Beasts

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.905
in this world
could have that kind of power.

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:31.615
But whatever.

00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:34.868
[Spirit Tortoise shrieking]

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.371
Time to put an end
to all of this.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.372
[all gasp]

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:39.623
Looks like the Spirit Tortoise’s

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.500
head and heart
must have regenerated!

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:42.459
[gasps]

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.878
[shrieking]

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.839
[soldiers yelling]

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.966
[chorus vocalizing]

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:49.925
[both gasp]

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.971
It looks like
we’re out of time.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.848
It was an honor to serve you,
Your Majesty.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.808
[chuckles]

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:01.562
[energy crackling]

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:04.856
Is that a barrier?

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.734
In order to break it,

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.487
you’ll need to take out
its head and heart again,

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.864
but they must be destroyed
simultaneously.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.117
[gasps] I’m guessing
the Spirit Tortoise

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.869
can regenerate faster thanks to
all of the souls that it took.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.580
Nice try, but not quite.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.498
[snaps fingers]

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.000
[gasps] Sir Itsuki?

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.794
While these three chumps
were complete pushovers,

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:28.255
their Cardinal Weapons were
a different story entirely,

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:30.007
so I went ahead
and repurposed them

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.467
as a backup power source
for the Spirit Tortoise.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.052
- [all screaming]
- I’m going to siphon

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.930
every ounce of power
’til they’re dead!

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:39.641
[gasps] How terrible.

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.727
Now, if you’d
be so kind to excuse me,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.604
I’ll be getting back to my hunt.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.647
But as a reward
for making it here,

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.649
I’ll grant you front-row seats

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.110
as I crush
your moronic friends to bits!

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:52.362
[Naofumi gasps]

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.406
[Filo gasps]

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.909
[shrieks]

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.244
[Eclair gasps]

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:00.287
Wait. Look at that.

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:07.753
[yells]

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.860

[grunts]

[gasps]

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.207
[Naofumi] Is that...

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:47.125
Wait, what is
Fitoria doing here?

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.504
[Filo] Um, uh, she says...

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.255
"I’m sorry I’m late,

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.466
but now that
all this has happened..."

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:57.177
I have chosen
to assist the Shield Hero.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.097
- [energy crackles]
- [gasps]

00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:07.521
[Fitoria]
When the time is right,

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:11.149
I will sever the head
of the Spirit Tortoise for you.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.485
"But you need to destroy
the Tortoise’s heart

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.695
at the same time."

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.363
I understand now.

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.323
The Spirit Tortoise
must have realized

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.367
that I can no longer
fulfill my duty.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.368
I see.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.869
Give me a break.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.080
The Filolial Queen’s
after me now?

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:27.332
Well, I guess
I just have to keep you

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.709
from getting to the heart, then.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.419
[gasps]

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.547
Hey!

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.507
Where’s the real heart at, jerk?

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.676
Wait, what? Kiddo?

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:38.802
[gasps] L’Arc!

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:41.054
[grumbles] How many damn walls

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.973
did you have to smash
to get here?

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.183
You meatheads
all operate the same way.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.560
[Glass] No matter the cost,

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.187
I swear by my vassal weapon
that I will stop you.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.398
[blows] You’ll what?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.443
Aren’t you guys trying to
destroy this world too, though?

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.195
- [gasps]
- Sort of.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.613
Well, yeah.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.032
Great! Then it only makes sense
that we should want

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.910
to get as many souls
as we can first, right?

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.120
So what’s the problem?

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:07.873
You’re the problem!

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:12.085
Our vassal weapons cry out at
the idea of something so vile!

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.755
Isn’t yours against this too?

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.715
The thing is, unlike you idiots,

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.551
I’m not a helpless slave
to my vassal weapon.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:22.679
In fact, because I can
use it whenever I want,

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.639
it’s the other way around!

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:30.145
Composition Form One:
Bird of Flame!

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:31.480
- [grunts]
- [Naofumi] Watch out!

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:39.196
- [gasps]
- [both yell]

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:42.991
[Kyo] Does this look familiar?

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.494
It should, because this
is the very same barrier

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.245
as the Spirit Tortoise’s core,

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.248
and it uses the power
of the three Heroic Stooges.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.958
[screaming]

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.126
[gasps]

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.212
[groans]

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.844
You see,
I need to harness their power

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:06.139
in order to make my own
personal giant-monster movie.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.224
[gasps] Sir Itsuki!

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.853
- [gasps]
- Damn.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.898
[Fitoria] It keeps using
the same attack.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.816
[grunts]

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.985
[soldiers murmuring]

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:23.615
[gasps]

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.287
[grunts]

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.875
[Fitoria] <i>Not too shabby.</i>

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.842
Tell the others
to start retreating.

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.343
But, Your Majesty...

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.970
As long as we’re here,

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.764
Fitoria cannot fight
with her full strength.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.224
[Fitoria] <i>That’s right.</i>

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.184
<i>Get as far away as you can.</i>

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.401
Meteor Shield!

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.282
First Stance: Wind Blowout!

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.082
[Filo] She said to remove
the barrier from the core,

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.459
we have to hurry up
and destroy its head and heart.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.544
I know that!

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:19.129
[Glass] Is that
all that’s left to do?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.339
Let’s just make sure that,
this time around,

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.591
we destroy the real heart.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.719
[grunts] I’ll open the path
to the core for you.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.096
Too bad I’m not
about to let that happen!

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.892
[groaning]

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.351
Yup, gravity attacks

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.270
are the Spirit Tortoise’s
favorite, you know.

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:37.105
And since
I don’t want you to think

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.900
I’m totally helpless without
the Three Stooges’ power,

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.527
let me go ahead and
show you something neat here.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.114
It’s pretty cool, huh?

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.575
Feast your eyes
on the fruits of my labor.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.076
Inside of this orb is the power

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.537
of all the souls
the Spirit Tortoise gathered.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.997
[gasps]

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.707
Ooh, scary!

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.043
There’s no need to get upset.
You see?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.880
[all groan]

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.548
Once I’ve finished off
these idiots

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.301
and taken all the souls
I possibly can from this world,

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:07.969
I’ll be on my merry way!

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.179
Stop it.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.805
Stop! I’m begging you!

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.474
[laughs]

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.683
No shot!

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.518
Not after I’ve come this far!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.811
[all groaning]

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.897
What’s wrong, Shield Hero?

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.482
Where’d all
that strength you had go?

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.234
All your pretty little friends
are about to get squashed flat,

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.987
and there’s not a damn thing
you can do about it!

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.907
- [laughs]
- [groaning]

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:29.908
[Kyo stomps]

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.619
Get off of Master Naofumi.

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:36.373
Wait, leaving the three Heroes
would be a waste, wouldn’t it?

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:39.042
So I’ll leave you here to enjoy
your new life as a pancake

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.670
and take them back to my world.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.254
Screw you. [groans]

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:45.090
Stop it now!

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.633
Get your foot off of him!

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.259
Get off Master Naofumi!

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.595
[laughs]

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.930
She’s crying!

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:55.809
The demi-human’s crying
over a human! How cute!

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.520
Had you idiots just killed
the Spirit Tortoise’s avatar

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.815
at the very beginning, none of
this would have ever happened!

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.235
This Shield Hero sure is
a useless loser, isn’t he?

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.654
No! Stop it!

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.948
Quit all that whining,
you little runt!

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.534
If this idiot is
really that important to you,

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.702
then shut your mouth

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.996
so I can focus
on giving him a quick death!

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:16.997
[Rishia] Stop it!

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.081
Huh?

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.127
[grunts]

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.296
[Rishia] You’re nothing
but a coward!

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.889
[Rishia panting]

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.141
Rishia, be careful!

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.101
He’s too dangerous, Rishia!

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:40.061
Who the hell
are you supposed to be?

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.313
Funny, because I’m
fairly certain a moment ago,

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.815
you were whimpering
in the background

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.026
like a coward yourself.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.068
- [winces]
- [Rishia] You’re right.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.780
I am a coward.
I can hardly do anything.

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:53.742
Which means I understand.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.244
Huh? What are you
babbling about over there?

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.954
Wait, how are you
walking right now?

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:01.332
You’re the same as me,
aren’t you?

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.792
Huh?

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.754
You’re relying on the power
of others instead of yourself.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.964
You’re not strong at all,

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.924
just like me! [gasps]

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.052
Who the hell
do you think you are?

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.803
You don’t know
what you’re talking about

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.388
or how powerful I really am!

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.433
[yelps]

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:19.434
[gasps]

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.644
[music playing]

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.068
[gasps]

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.778
[Rishia] I know one thing,

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.113
that you’re actually weak.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.656
That’s why you make
such an effort

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.241
to prove that you’re strong,

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.036
just like a scared little animal
puffing out its fur.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.037
[yells]

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.003
- No! Rishia!
- [gasps]

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.546
[laughs]

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.548
What’s wrong?
Done talking already?

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:52.842
[gasps]

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.763
[gasps]

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.264
Damn you!

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.689
[Kyo gasps]
Hiding in the smoke, huh?

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.733
- [Rishia] I’m also weak.
- [Kyo] Eh?

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.277
[Rishia] But no matter
how you look at it,

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.904
my strength is nothing

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:16.116
compared to Naofumi,
Raphtalia, Filo, or Ost.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.119
And although I may be weaker,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.329
I’ll still never lose
to the likes of you.

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.914
Shut up.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.457
I don’t get it.

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:25.917
How is she able...

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.836
- [Ost] Shield Hero.
- [gasps]

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:31.047
[Ost grunts]

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:35.176
I give my orders to the heavens
and to the earth.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:39.848
Sever reality.
Then spit out the pus within.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.475
Shield Hero, I hereby grant you

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.519
the power
of the Spirit Tortoise.

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:45.603
[gasps]

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.564
Very well.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.732
Then, as Shield Hero,
I accept the power

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.360
of the Spirit Tortoise
and order the heavens.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:55.363
Sever our reality.
Spit out the pus within.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.699
Power of the ley lines,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.577
manifest my magic
and the power of the Hero.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:04.539
As the source of thy power,
I order thee.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:07.250
Unravel the mysteries
of all things...

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:08.459
[Kyo] What’s this?!

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.336
...and give them everything!

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.756
All Liberation Aura!

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.512
[both gasp]

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.972
[gasps]

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.141
Isn’t that this world’s
most powerful magic?!

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.728
[both yell]

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.854
[gasps]

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.816
[groans]

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.824
- [Ost] Now!
- [L’Arc] Thanks!

00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:43.453
Filo, you go with them!

00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:45.079
Roger!

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.542
[gasps] Why, you little--

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:50.668
I won’t let you!

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.337
- [Rishia] Your opponent...
- Oh?

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:53.796
[gasps]

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.590
...is over here.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.511
Damn you!

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.013
[L’Arc] Huh?

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.224
What are you doing here
with us, Little Miss Filo?

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:07.769
I can help by communicating
with Fitoria for you!

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.146
Fitoria? the Filolial Queen?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.148
[Glass] That makes sense.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.737
Master Naofumi,
are you all right?

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.530
Yeah. I’m sure I’ll manage.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.990
She, on the other hand...

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.533
- [yelling]
- We could barely move

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:26.079
with Ost’s help under the power
of that gravity magic, so how?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.288
She was the only one

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.791
who could handle
that super-gravity attack.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.709
Maybe the old lady was right

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.379
and Rishia is able to
manipulate the ki in her body.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.923
- [clang]

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.050
You...

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.010
I told you.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:43.721
Because you rely so much
on the power of others,

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.182
it makes your attacks
simplistic,

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.518
so even someone like me
can dodge them.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:51.354
Oh, my attacks
are too simplistic?

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.523
I appreciate the crappy advice.

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:56.901
Thanks! But these simplistic
attacks are gonna kill you!

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.903
Composition of Flame!

[Rishia] Hah!

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.464
What?!

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.092
And you’re a dirty trickster

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.636
with a twisted mind
that lies and deceives people

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.305
any chance it gets.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.390
[chuckles]

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:32.353
I shouldn’t have even
bothered fighting you!

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.522
I should have just done this
from the very start!

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:37.734
It’d be foolish
to take hostages at this point.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:38.651
Huh?

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.951
[gasps]

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.078
I don’t intend to forgive you.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.122
However, if you
surrender yourself,

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.123
I’ll spare you.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.584
[sputters]

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.294
Who the hell
do you think you are?

[gasps]

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.130
You’ve gotta be kidding me.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.175
I’d sooner die where I stand
before surrendering myself over

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.385
to a cowardly scumbag like you!

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.389
Hah!

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.557
[Naofumi] One thing’s for sure.

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:12.602
Rishia learned a lot more
than how to use ki.

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:14.604
It’s like she’s
a different person.

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:16.564
- [Ost] It’s time, Shield Hero.
- [both gasp]

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:19.525
I humbly ask of you once again

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.278
to please put an end to this
by killing me.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.614
But, Ost...

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.699
What Rishia said is correct.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:30.119
That man, Kyo Ethnina,
is a coward and a liar

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:33.331
[gasps]
What do you mean by that?

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.083
[dramatic music playing]

[groans]

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:39.003
I get that this is
the Spirit Tortoise’s heart,

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.463
but isn’t this a little crazy?

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.215
[Therese] We don’t have time
to complain, L’Arc!

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.841
We need to destroy
this thing now!

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.885
Fitoria says to hurry up too!

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:47.053
All right, all right!

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.141
[Fitoria] He’s using
the souls he stole?

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.727
If I dodge it,
it will destroy the city.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:00.733
[gasps]

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.282

[Filo] Fan lady!

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.461
What’s this?

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.172
Master gave it to me,
but I’m giving it to you!

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:25.049
[chuckles] Nice work, kiddo.

Let’s do this, Therese.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:31.639
Right!

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.267
I beseech thee,
jewels far and wide...

- [Fitoria] No...
- [gasps]

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.615

[gasps]

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.713
[Kyo] Did you really think
I didn’t a plan in place

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.298
just in case
that were to happen?

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.883
Oh, no.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.095
It’s more
of an emergency measure

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:55.598
that uses soul’s power
to defend the core,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.724
but oh, well.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.476
As long as I can see your faces

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.436
twisting with despair--uh...

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.688

[Ost] <i>That man, Kyo Ethnina,</i>

<i>is a coward and a liar...</i>

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:11.697
which makes me think he still
has another plan up his sleeve.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.283
And, remember,

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.578
I am one with
the Spirit Tortoise’s core.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.122
So when the time comes,
use all your power

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:21.958
to destroy it and be rid of me.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:29.966
Raphtalia, when I can’t move,
it’s up to you, okay?

00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:32.051
[sighs] Okay.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.513
Foolish sinner,
I hereby sentence you

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.140
to cast your screams
unto the heavens!

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:40.601
What are you doing?! Stop it!

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.770
And from within
the dragon’s jaws,

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.355
born from my very flesh...

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.565
No!

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:48.901
become an offering
to the gods...

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.071
as you howl.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.368
It’s no use.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.704
I don’t have any hatred left.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:00.705
Damn it.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.583
[both gasp]

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.084
Huh?

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.962
[laughing]

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.132
You mean to tell me,
after all that,

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:12.842
you’re just giving up?
That’s rich!

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:13.884
What about all the work

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.095
Mr. Scythe and the big bird
did for you?

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.847
That was all for nothing?

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:20.683
It’s so ridiculously hard
not to laugh at!

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.977
[laughing]

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.061
[growls]

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.189
[Ost] That’s fine.

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.525
It’s okay, Shield Hero.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.651
No need to worry.

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:32.903
Now the time has come

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.864
for the power
I left within your shield...

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:36.616
to take its true form.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.702
[gasps]

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.831
What is this?

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.625
Spirit Tortoise Heart Shield?

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.585
[gasping]

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.556
Ost, what did you just do?

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.558
[chuckles]

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.643
[gasps]

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.061
Please, no.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.188
Stop.

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:08.397
Just listen to him!

00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:11.901
Stop it!

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:15.946
[yelps]

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.328
[song ends]

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.163
[grunts]

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.008
[sizzling]

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.474
[panting]

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.184
- [Rishia] No! Ost!
- [gasps]

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.937
[Rishia crying]

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.772
[shudders]

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:54.568
[Filo] Ost, are you okay?

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.196
Awwww!

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:59.699
Way to go and ruin everything!

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.076
You just couldn’t resist
killing your friend.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.245
Well, now what am I
supposed to do, huh?

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.955
You bastard.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:08.499
Well, it wasn’t
a complete waste of time.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.085
After all, I succeeded
in completing my real goal.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.295
- [gasps]
- What are you talking about?

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:15.506
Did you think that once
you destroyed the core,

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.008
the souls inside would
spread out across the world

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.885
and head up to heaven?
Well, too bad!

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:21.011
Unfortunately for you,

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.222
I went ahead and kept
the bare minimum here

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:25.015
just so that wouldn’t happen.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.559
[gasps]

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.768
[growls]

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.103
If you’ll excuse me,

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:31.397
I’m on my way out of this
rotting Tortoise carcass.

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:36.777
[Glass] That’s...

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:38.863
[Kyo] I haven’t forgotten
about you, Shield Hero,

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.281
or you, green-haired girl.

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:42.950
I’ll be sure to kill you both
next time we meet.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.702
But until then,
knock yourself out.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:45.745
Farewell.

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.204
[L’Arc] Wait!

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.247
[all gasp]

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.999
[grumbles] Damn it!

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.502
[Naofumi] Why did you
activate the Shield, Ost?

00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:54.837
[Ost sighs]

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:58.924
Because you weren’t
swallowed up by rage and sorrow.

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:02.011
The Spirit Tortoise’s
Heart Shield was activated.

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:05.306
But I don’t understand.
What’s that have to do with it?

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:08.559
You don’t need to use
that shield stained with hatred.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.770
Rejoice in your freedom
from its chains.

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:11.854
[gasps]

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.773
You mean the Wrath Shield.

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:16.609
Even though
I’ve taken countless lives,

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.694
you still managed
to find some tears

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:20.112
to shed at my passing.

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:22.865
Oh, kind, gentle Shield Hero...

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.201
please don’t forget what you
feel in this moment with me.

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:26.827
No!

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:28.579
You’re wrong.
I’m not like that at all.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.790
- [L’Arc] Kiddo!
- [gasps]

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:34.710
It appears that this portal is
somehow connected to our world.

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:36.921
However,
it’ll close any second.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.131
You can trust
we’ll find a way to fix this.

00:21:39.173 --> 00:21:41.050
[Glass] Not only
will we defeat Kyo,

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:42.468
but we’ll return with the souls

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.677
he took from your world.

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:46.096
Yeah. Leave the rest to us.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.014
See you later!

00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:53.521
[gasps]

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:54.563
- [energy crackles]
- [yelps]

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:57.024
Huh?

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:02.196
But that’s impossible.

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:03.197
[Ost] Go after them!

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.491
Huh? [gasps]

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.330
If you don’t go now,

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:13.082
you’ll get left behind
when it closes.

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:14.792
- [Raphtalia] Ost...
- [Filo] Are you sure?

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:15.709
[gasps]

00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:18.504
Raphtalia! Filo! Get ready.

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:19.588
We’re leaving!

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.549
- Uh...
- [gasps]

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.008
It’s our comrade’s wish,

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.176
and we can’t let L’Arc

00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:25.302
and his friends handle this!

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.514
Mm-hmm.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.771
[Naofumi] Rishia,
you stay here with Itsuki.

00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:36.856
I won’t!

00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:38.649
- [both gasp]
- I’m your comrade

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:40.693
and her comrade too,
so no matter what,

00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.820
I’m coming to fight
by your side!

00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:44.822
[grunts]

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:47.533
[singer vocalizing]

00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:52.037
[Ost sighs] <i>"Comrade."</i>

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.330
<i>Comrade, huh?</i>

00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:56.458
<i>If I’m ever reborn,</i>

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.545
<i>next time, I want</i>
<i>to truly be their comrade.</i>

00:22:59.587 --> 00:23:03.424
<i>Wherever the Shield Hero’s path</i>
<i>may lead him,</i>

00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:07.261
<i>I pray that there’s joy</i>
<i>at the end of it.</i>

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:09.805
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:24.737
Huh?
