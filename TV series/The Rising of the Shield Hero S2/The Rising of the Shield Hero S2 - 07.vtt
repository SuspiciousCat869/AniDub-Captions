[echoing] Naofumi!

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:30.656
Naofumi!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.407
[normal] Naofumi!

[gasps]

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.537
Rishia, is that you?

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.288
[gasps] Thank goodness!

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.707
I kept calling your name,
but you were out cold.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.626
[sighs] Where are we?

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:44.461
[breeze blowing]

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:47.798
I wish I knew,

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.300
but I only woke up
a few moments before you did.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.219
[Naofumi gasps]
Raphtalia and Filo?

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.304
It looks like it’s
just the two of us.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.764
I see.

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:56.765
[gasps]

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.226
What is this shield?

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:00.602
Oh, I’m not sure,

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:02.813
but it looked like that
when I woke up.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.190
I’ve never seen it before.
What is it?

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.191
[gasps]

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.068
Is everything all right?

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.319
My level...

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.654
it dropped back down to one.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:11.905
Huh?!

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:18.495
If I’m not mistaken,

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.289
you’re also back to level one.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.290
[yelps]

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.291
[gasps]

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.376
[sighs] You can
scream all you want,

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.461
but I’m not sure
it’s gonna do any good.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.422
[muffled grunt]

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:31.633
[sighs] I’m guessing Kyo
is the one behind this--

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.719
Raphtalia and Filo
not being here,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.637
our levels being reset to one.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.097
[Raphtalia] Master Naofumi!

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:39.349
[both gasp]

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.018
What a relief!

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.353
I’m so glad
you and Rishia are safe!

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.732
Where’s Filo?
I don’t see her anywhere.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.650
Raphtalia, your body.

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:49.568
[Raphtalia] Huh?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.487
[Naofumi] What happened?!

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:54.656
[gasps]

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.617

- [gate creaking]
- It’s wide open.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.552
We weren’t locked in here
to begin with?

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.470
I don’t see
any guards here, either,

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.347
and we still have our weapons.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.891
[Raphtalia grunting]

[sword clunks]

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.188
You can’t use that.
That’s too heavy.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.606
But thing is...

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.400
it’s the only weapon I have.

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.110
- [gasps]
- Uh...

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.111

[sighs]

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.290
- What’s the matter?
- Nothing.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.876
I was just thinking back
to when we first met is all.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.295
Look, I might be back
to being level one,

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.005
and my body
might be smaller now,

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.548
but none of that matters,

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.341
because I will always be
your sword!

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.801
Yup, that’s right.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:21.928
It’s totally different
than it was back then.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.096
[gasps]

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.264

[Rishia gasps]

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.647
Naofumi, Raphtalia, look!

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.107
Eh?

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.068
[Raphtalia] It looks
like somebody lives here.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.279
There’s even a stove in there.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.448
You think it belongs to
the person who brought us here?

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.451
If someone is here, then
why do they live in a prison?

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:45.911
[gasps]

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.873
Does that lead outside?

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:52.083
Nothing about any of this
feels right.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.544
Maybe, but we have to go.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:55.462
[grunts]

00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.508
[gasps] W-Wait!

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:00.842
Don’t leave me here alone!

[waves lapping]

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.570
[Raphtalia] Eh?

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:21.780
[Naofumi gasps]

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.535
Something’s a bit off.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.328
What do you mean?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.664
[Naofumi]
Despite there being waves...

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.626
there’s no wind.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.086
[gasps]

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.588
And look!
The coast is weird too!

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.715
It almost looks like
there’s nothing out there

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.092
beyond the horizon.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.802
[gasps]

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.763
So it would be suicide
to go out into the water.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.348
[Rishia gasps]

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.688

[birds chirping]

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:03.321
It doesn’t look like Filo’s
anywhere nearby,

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.990
so it’s possible
she’s not stuck here

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.449
in this weird space with us.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.827
I hope she’s safe.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:11.079
I-I’m sure she’s just fine!

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.998
Knowing her,
she’s probably having

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.208
a lot of fun somewhere
right now.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.251
[Raphtalia] You really think so?

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:17.252
[Rishia sighs]

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:19.546
What if we don’t ever find her?

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.716
It’s just she hasn’t ever
been all by herself like this.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.593
[Rishia sighs]

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.554
Before we can look for Filo,
we have to get out of here.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.639
Right!

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.100

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.209
No, I’m not, not hurt at all.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.509
A white cardboard shield?

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.261
Well, that’s certainly new.

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.055
It must be like
an Orange Balloon.

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:16.019
Looks like we get XP too,
which is helpful,

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.730
since we should probably
raise our levels a bit.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:19.773
Let’s do it!

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.858
And that goes
for you too, Rishia.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.361

fighting these
low-level enemies.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.319
I think drinking all that water
worked up an appetite.

Oh, now that you mention it,
I’m starving!

Since I gave you my name,
it’s only fair to give yours.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.220
Naofumi Iwatani, Shield Hero...

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.513
of the Cardinal Heroes.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.557
Huh? Wait,
you’re a Cardinal Hero too?

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.227
But that’s impossible,
’cause I’ve never heard of you.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.686
Nor I you.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.980
In fact, I’ve never even heard
of a Hunting Hero.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.149
And about that name of yours,

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.193
am I right in saying
that you’re Japanese?

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.653
[sighs]

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:13.530
Yeah. You are too, right?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.365
Master Naofumi?

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:18.451
You took a lot of damage,
considering your heavy armor.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.578
In fact, it looks
like it’s bugging out.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.955
- [crackling]
- [gasps]

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.751
My defense values
are bugging out, too.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.587
Is it because my level
isn’t high enough to wield it?

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.841
In any case, let’s treat
those wounds of yours first.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.342
Then we’ll talk.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:42.100
I see. So then you’re
a Cardinal Hero like me,

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.852
but from another world,
right, Naofumi?

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.479
Oh, is it okay
if I call you Naofumi?

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.399
Call me whatever you want,
and I’ll return the favor.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.151
[Raphtalia grumbles]

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.485
[giggles]

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:56.823
And I suppose I can call you two
Raphtalia and Rishia.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.658
You lucked out, Naofumi,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.910
having comrades
who care about you so dearly.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.246
You mean
you don’t have any comrades?

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.290
I do. Well, used to.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.000
Thing is, I haven’t seen them

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.836
ever since I got locked up
in here however many years ago.

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.629
How did you get locked up?

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.464
Oh, well, I kinda screwed up

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.134
and got myself captured
by an enemy country.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.304
But why would they want
to capture a Cardinal Hero?

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.347
How else are they
gonna deal with the Waves?

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.558
The Waves? What are those?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.560
How do you not know?

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.979
The sole reason we Cardinal
Heroes are even summoned

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.564
is to help fight
against the Waves.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.275
Huh. Looks like
you and I were summoned

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:35.069
to our respective worlds
for different reasons entirely.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.946
This doesn’t make sense.

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.198
How come L’Arc and Glass

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.283
knew all about
the existence of the Waves?

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.744
Wait. What was that?

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.371
Uh, L’Arc and Glass are heroes,

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.916
and it seems like they’re from
another world similar to yours.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.126
[gasps] Are you
being serious right now?

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.711
You know L’Arc and Glass?!

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.755
Believe me when I say
Glass is my best friend.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:55.340
Your best friend?

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.967
The Glass we know is
a scary woman with fans.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.303
So, um, is she
your best friend?

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.596
Yeah, that’s her!

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.098
You’re best friends
with that monster of a woman?

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.767
And just how old
are you, anyway, kid?

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:07.644
Monster of a woman?

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.270
And I’m 18. What’s it to you?

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.688
[gasps]

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.986
So does that mean
you’re a loli...

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.488
- [sighs]
- Oh ho ho!

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.114
You were about
to say, "loli hag"!

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.742
[sighs] So then you
do know what that means.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.285
Duh. Of course I do!

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:25.286
"Lowly"?

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.287
And a hag?

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:27.789
- [stomach gurgles]
- [all gasp]

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:28.790
[sighs]

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.917
[laughs] Forgive me.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.711
You must be starving.
Let’s grab you some food.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.672
What? Why would I want to eat

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.258
with some untrustworthy girl
I met a few minutes ago?

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.426
- [both sigh]
- Well, that’s awfully rude.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.595
Need I remind you
that I saved your lives

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.889
and that we’re
both Cardinal Heroes?

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.724
Now that I know
you’re friends with Glass,

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.685
you’re even more untrustworthy.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.853
You might just turn on us
at any moment.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.563
I don’t get it.
Did Glass and L’Arc

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.065
give you a hard time
or something?

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.568
[sighs] Fine.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.486
Then suit yourself.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:01.447
Master Naofumi!

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:05.618
[gags]

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.079
[Rishia and Raphtalia gasp]

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:12.625
[grunts]

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.544
Eh?

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.629
My Cardinal Weapon is unique,

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.214
in that it can attack people,

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.633
but no matter what I do,
it cannot hurt them.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.220
[sighs]

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:26.889
See? Even if I turned on you...

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:29.142
I wouldn’t be able to hurt you
even if I wanted to,

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:30.685
because of my Cardinal Weapon.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.687
[sighs]

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.605
So let’s eat!

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.524
I’m starving over here!

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:41.696
I brought us plenty of stuff
to chow down on,

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.656
and I can cut ’em up with this.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.533
Thanks, but I’ll do it.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:48.661
Oh, come on. Do you think
I’m trying to poison you?

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:51.497
It’s a question
of who’s the better chef.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.415
[grumbles]

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:58.421
Wow, this looks
incredible, Naofumi!

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.382
Maybe I was right to let you
do the cooking after all!

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.259
- [stomach gurgles]
- [gasps]

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.344
[gasps]

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:06.054
Let’s eat, then.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.722
That’s right. Let’s eat!

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:11.476
- Huh?
- Uh...

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.394
[sighing]

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.315
[both chuckle]

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.362
[chopsticks clatter]

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.530
Oh, yeah.
That really hit the spot!

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.574
Thank you for the meal,
you two!

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:29.077
Raphtalia, don’t tell me
you’re still hungry.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.453
Wasn’t that enough food?

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.497
[sighs]
Of course it was enough!

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.248
In fact, I’m so full,
I could burst!

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.959
Really? Cause you
used to eat a whole lot more

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.252
when we first met.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:41.297
Uh, because demi-humans
level up faster than normal,

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.383
so we have to eat
more food than others.

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.760
- So then, you are still hungry.
- [gasps]

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.887
There is nothing
to be ashamed of

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:49.931
when you’re in your
growing years, Raphtalia.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.767
Hang on.
I’ll make some more for you.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:53.935
Thank you so much.

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.104
Ah, man, with you around here,

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:57.438
I’m never gonna have to worry

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.565
about there being a shortage
of good food ever again.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.944
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:03.945
but we’re leaving now.

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.489
Huh? You can’t,
even if you want to.

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.490
What?

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.409
This place is
the Infinite Labyrinth,

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.660
a temporal prison,

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.537
and once you’re inside of it,

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.122
you can never hope to leave it.

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.082
Did you say, "Never"?

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:19.252
So then, how long
have you been here?

00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:22.296
Um, to be honest with you,
I’m not really sure.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.757
I stopped keeping track
after the first few years.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.717
[gasps]

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.513
That being said, I never
once thought about giving up.

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:33.641
I spent every day here
looking for a way out,

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:36.269
thinking of
every possible solution,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.229
yet I have never found one.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.148
Just ’cause you can’t escape,

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.983
doesn’t mean that we’re
about to give up

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:43.860
and just stay here forever.

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:47.238
Very well. I’d be more
than happy to show you around.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.491
But this place has a daytime
and a nighttime also,

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.951
and it’s already
getting rather late,

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.578
so why don’t we go
in the morning?

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:57.081
Stay here for the night.
I know it’s not much,

00:15:57.123 --> 00:16:00.001
but at the very least,
the monsters can’t get in here.

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:03.254
Poor Kizuna.
I wonder how many years

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.965
she’s been trapped inside
of this horrible Labyrinth.

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.342
However long,
I know I couldn’t handle it.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:09.886
I couldn’t, either.

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:11.053
[Naofumi sighs]

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.097
What happens if we
do end up like Kizuna

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.599
and can’t get out of here?

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.226
Doesn’t matter,
because we’re not staying here.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:18.728
We still need to find Filo

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.355
and get vengeance
for what Kyo did to Ost.

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:22.607
[both grunt]

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.277
When they told me the truth,

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.362
that I’d be spending
the rest of my life here,

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:29.697
it hit me really hard.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.742
"What?! I’m stuck here
all alone forever?"

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:33.993
It was really depressing.

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.746
I’ve searched every square inch
of the island

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.706
and even tried to go out to sea.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.751
It pains me to say this,
but there was even a time

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.128
when I thought I’d
just give up and kill myself.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.715
But I had all the time
in the world at my hands...

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.551
so I thought
that I’d keep fighting

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.554
for as many years as it took,
until I found a way out.

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:57.934
You’re an incredibly
strong girl, Kizuna!

00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:59.727
Wow! [laughs]

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.145
You know, Raphtalia,

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.606
for someone who’s so little,
you sound grown up.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.316
Another thing motivating me

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.443
is seeing Glass
and the others someday.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.533
After years of searching,

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.576
I think this is
the most likely place

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.453
that leads out
of the Infinite Labyrinth.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:20.748
I think I’ve taken care
of all the monsters here,

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.500
but I’d still be careful.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.293
If you think
this is the way out,

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:26.629
then why haven’t you
tried leaving yet?

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.214
Well, then, look.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.383
That’s exactly what I
brought you here to see.

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:32.301
[footsteps echoing]

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.851
[Kizuna] This is it.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.980
[grunts]

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:45.982
What is this?

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:49.652
[Kizuna] It looks like the door

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.654
that connects the prison
to the island, right?

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.406
[both grunt]

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:54.657
I’m pretty sure

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.285
this is the far end
of the Infinite Labyrinth,

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.120
meaning there’s
nothing beyond it.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.289
Just another dimension awaits.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.749
Don’t tell me the reason
you haven’t gone through it

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.668
is ’cause you’re too scared to.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.711
Go on!

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.629
- [clang]
- [grunts]

00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:10.548
[thumping]

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.175
What’s going on?

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:15.678
See? You can’t get in, either.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.556
This is the reason I haven’t
been able to leave this place.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:19.890
Really?

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.267
But why, though?

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.478
I’m almost certain that this
is the edge of the space.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.688
That being said,

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.773
I don’t think it was
ever meant to be entered.

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:30.568
So the wall just happened
to collapse and reveal

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.028
that they hadn’t
actually made anything

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:33.821
on other side of it, right?

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.239
That’s exactly right.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.658
Wh-What does that mean
for us, then?

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.327
I don’t really
understand it, either,

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:42.038
but I’m guessing this means
there’s no exit for us.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.374
[Naofumi] It may not be an exit,

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.627
but at the very least,
it’s a glaring bug.

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:48.919
A bug?

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.047
Yeah, that’s what I
was thinking too.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.591
Whether it’s a 3D game
or 2D platformer,

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.760
when you come across
a bugged-out area,

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.178
what do you do?

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.848
Hmm. I suppose
I’d try to get inside.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.100
Wh-What in the world
are you talking about?

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:05.394
We might just be able
to make this work.

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:06.604
Huh?

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:14.028
So I went ahead and made it
just as you requested, Naofumi,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.404
but what is this thing?

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:17.531
[Naofumi] You saw
the description, right?

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.325
It’s a Bio Plant Seed.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:22.495
I can’t do anything to modify it
at my current level.

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:23.996
Oh?

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:26.916
Well, it was kinda like
strengthening a shikigami.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:28.918
So what are we
gonna do with it?

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:31.671
[chuckles] Something like this!

00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:36.842
[gasping]

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:38.969
Master Naofumi, this is...

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.347
We need to get
out of here fast!

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:52.733
[Rishia] H-Huh? The room’s
starting to swell up!

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:55.194
[gasps] Can you even do that?

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.113
All that matters
is that this little trick

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.824
is the only way for us
to force ourselves into the bug.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.036
It’s going to burst!

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.746
Raphtalia! Rishia!

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:07.248
- Right!
- Right!

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.167
Uh...

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.759
[gasps]

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.681
[gasps]

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:27.727
- Kizuna!
- [gasps]

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:29.061
Quick, come with us!

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:33.107
[yells]

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.234
Nice!

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.736
Hurry up, and jump!

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:38.070
You’re a comrade!

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.031
[chuckles]

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.701
[laughs]

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:01.010
[liquid pouring]

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:04.680
It did a great job helping us,

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:07.057
but it’ll only cause problems
if it lives.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.851
You’re the best, Master Naofumi.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:11.353
[groans]

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.272
[wind blowing]

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.904
Eh?

00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.158
[gasps]

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:27.912
I’m outside.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:29.872
Kizuna?

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:32.625
I’m outside!

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:35.461
I’m outside! I’m really outside!

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:37.588
I’m finally outside
of the Infinite Labyrinth!

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.672
I can’t believe it!

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:40.674
I’m back in the world
I was summoned to!

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:43.385
[laughs]

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.013
Oh, thank you!

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:48.015
- Eh?
- Thank you, Naofumi!

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:49.725
It’s thanks to you
that I’m free!

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.644
Thank you with all my heart!

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:55.272
[laughs]

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.233
Don’t you think
you’re being a little loud?

00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.360
[laughs]

00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:01.070
I’m finally free!

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:04.824
And now I don’t have to spend
my life all alone anymore.

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:07.660
[laughs]

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:15.042
[Kizuna] Hooray!
