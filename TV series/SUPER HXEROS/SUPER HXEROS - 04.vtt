Huh?!

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
So, you are behind these
recent lucky underwear thefts!

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
Not that there was
a single doubt in my mind!

Oh, dear.
We've got a pesky human.

Nope, not on my watch!

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center
I won't let you get away with
stealing girls' pricey panties,

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
you got that?

so hard on yourself, Hoshino.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
Remember, you're still
learning the ropes.

Huh?

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
That was the third
time, though, wasn't it?

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
What happened to the power
she had the other day?

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
Gah! What a pain in my ass!

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
Be honest with me.

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
Are you building up your
sexual energy every day?

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
Am I what?

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

happened with Retto since...?

What the heck do you mean?

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
No, of course not!

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
Hopeless!

All right, fine.

to build up the energy you need.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
It's called pornography.

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
That stuff's for boys.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be caught dead
looking at smut.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
In fact, I don't
get how any girl could be

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
shameless enough
to watch that crap!

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
Sorry, what was that?
Did you say something, boobs?

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center

someone else shameless?

Sorry, about that!

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:45.076 position:50% align:center

for anyone whose breasts

are bigger than hers!

Oh, great, thanks!
I get it, Piranha.

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
Maybe to you,
what we do seems ridiculous.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
But we're trying.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center

[MOMOKA]
What is with that girl?

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
Having those boobs
and no erotic interest

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
is like a waste of resources.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
and got top grades
in all my classes.

who broke records

in track and field.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
I even snagged
a scholarship to college.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
But in the end,
every boy I ever liked

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
ended up falling in love
with her instead of me.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] Maybe the real
reason Piranha irritates me

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
is because she
reminds me of her.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
Ah! This is...

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.159 position:50% align:center
Ah... Oh, I see.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center

Ah! So cold!

[MOMOKA]
Still, though.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
I have to admit.
This is kind of fun.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] Then what? Massage them
in a circular fashion. 'Kay.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
I'm back.

I'm the first one home.

Maybe I'll take a nice bath.

Ah! Whoa, sorry!

[MOMOKA]
Oh, hey, Retto.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
I just took
the longest bath ever.

Hey! Are you okay?

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
It's no good. I'm so
dizzy I don't have any strength.

Help me, would you?
Can you lift me out of here?

This is it, huh?

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
That thing I read about having
your boyfriend massage you.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
This must be what it feels like.

Here we go.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center

[MOMOKA]
Oh, no! My head is so foggy.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
I keep feeling
these strange things!

[RETTO]
Uh... What're you...?

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Hey, Retto. I've been wondering.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
Do you only like girls
with big boobs?

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.149 position:50% align:center
--Uhh...
--Ah!

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
No! This isn't what you think!

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
I was just
drinking soy milk in the bath,

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
like ya do, when I got
dizzy and spilled it!

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.574 position:50% align:center
I-I mean, it's not
like some stupid TV show

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
was able to convince me
I could increase

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
my breast size through soy-milk
bath massage because

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center

about my tiny boobs!

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center

that's what this was about.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Look, Momozono.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.173 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what?

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.300 position:50% align:center
In my opinion, you're
free to use your private time

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
in the bath in any
way you see fit.

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
And don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
For the record...

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
You could be doing far weirder
things in here, am I right?

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Well, thanks,
I really appreciate you

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center

Nice.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
It's good to know

I've come here to recruit you.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
I think you're
mistaking me for my sis.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
I'm just ordinary Momoka.

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center
Sonoka's the one with
all the real gifts.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
[ANNO]
No.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:14.406 position:50% align:center
I definitely came to see you,
Momoka Momozono.

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
I know you may not realize it...

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50% align:center
...but you're the one
who's capable of being a HERO,

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
not your big sister.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
This job is befitting
of your strength.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
When I was chosen to be a HERO,

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
I knew that, for the first time,

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
I'd found something I was
better at than my sister.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
I'm home!

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
Weird? Smells
just like soy milk in here.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Hey, Kirara!

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] I admit.
I definitely lack your curves.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
But I happen to be a HERO!

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
When it comes
to turning boys on,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
I can lick you
any day of the week!

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
Just know that!

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
Um... Okay.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
And unrelated.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
I haven't given up on
developing my body, either!

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
Cool.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
[TV SPOKESWOMAN 3A] Yesterday,
we told you about the use

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
of soy-milk as a technique
to increase breast size.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, that has been
disproven by our research team.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
We deeply
apologize to our viewers

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
for the error in our reporting.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
Seriously?!

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
[PANCHUU]
I'm Panchuu.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
What color are
your lucky panties?

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
What's weird?
Something wrong, Yuna?

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
[YUNA] They're not here!
My panties aren't in my locker!

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
What? Like, someone took them?

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:09.312 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
I wore those especially
because I have a date

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
after school today!

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
[PANCHUU]
Bye-bye!

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
Get back here!

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.739 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it?

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
Is that a bug?

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
[PANCHUU]
Panties.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Move!

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Are you crazy, Kirara?

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
Even if you catch them,
what can you do?

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Wait, what?

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
[PANCHUU]
Ha!

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA shrieks]

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
[PANCHUU laughs] Can't let
your guard down, human!

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] I don't have what
it takes to be a HERO.

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hoshino! Sorry I'm late!

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
Enjo? How did you know?

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.447 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Yeah, well, news travels
fast when there's a girl

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.866 position:50% align:center
running through
the halls in her swimsuit!

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
Oh, great.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.035 position:50% align:center
I had no idea.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
So is this how you
replenish your H-energy?

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
That's not what this is!

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm just glad.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50% align:center
I thought what happened the
other day might still have been

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
bothering you,
but it doesn't seem to be.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
You can leave this to me.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting them get away!

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
What's his deal?

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
Always showing up at
the exact right moment.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
[RETTO panting]

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Not like I'm saying
he's cool or anything!

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
[PANCHUU]
Hmm?

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:34.314 position:50% align:center
[PANCHUU screams]

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Got 'em.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.074 position:50% align:center
If I'm not mistaken,
these are yours.

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Ew! What?!

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
I'd never wear
something that flashy!

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
Hey, what was
that lightshow just now?

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.790 position:50% align:center
[YUNA]
Care to explain yourself, Enjo?

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
Ah! Wait. No.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.378 position:50% align:center
I swear, this is a total
misunderstanding!

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
You've been
were caught red-handed,

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
and you're still denying it?

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
It's the truth.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Enjo and I both
tried to capture the thief,

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
but they put up
a bit of a fight.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
And then they
escaped through that window.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
The good news,

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
at least we were able to get
back your stolen property.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
Don't say I never
did anything for you.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.149 position:50% align:center
Uh... Thanks.

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
I guess he's innocent, then.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I can't imagine Hoshino
covering for a boy.

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Here.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
Kirara! You're my hero!

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
Now I'll make it to
my date after school in time!

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
No problem.
Just spare me the details.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
But if you have a second.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
I could actually use
your advice on something.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
[YUNA]
Hmm?

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.
I'm still in utter disbelief.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
Never in a million years would
I believe that Kirara wanted

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
her own pair of lucky panties!

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
Give it a rest, already!

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
You've been laughing about it
ever since we left campus.

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:59.774 position:50% align:center
We're not laughing at you--
we're just excited.

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
It's nice to see you taking an
interest in this sort of thing.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
How many times
do I have to tell you,

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
it's nothing like that.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
[YUNA] I picked a few.
Let's see how they look.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Thanks, Yuna.

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:15.123 position:50% align:center
So? Does he
go to another school?

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Guh?! What?

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
He has to. All the boys
at our school are idiots.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
I said, it's not like that!

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
So he's a college student, then?

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
[gasps] If he's any older,
we need to have a serious talk!

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
That's some imagination.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
As long as that's not
the case, I'll stop prying.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.392 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Aren't these a little... risqué?

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
They're your lucky panties.

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
They're supposed to make
a bold statement!

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
And whatever boy you
have a crush on is the only one

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
who's going to see them.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.985 position:50% align:center
But I'm buying these for me,

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
not to impress some
stupid guy I like!

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
[YUNA] I'm confused.
Where's the fun in that?

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
I just remembered,
didn't you say you had a date?

00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
After school?

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
Yep, I sure do. But we're good.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.338 position:50% align:center
I mentioned I would be
shopping and to meet me

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
somewhere close by.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
So just between us,
I'm super curious to find out

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
what kind of guy Yuna
would want to date.

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
Ah! Hey!

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuna. What's up?

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
Darling!
Oh, how I've missed thee!

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
[GIRL giggles] Oh, you're
looking as adorable as ever.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center
[YUNA]
Nothing compared to you!

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
Well. I suppose we
should've seen that coming.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Mm-hmm...

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
Want to sleep
in my room again, Runba?

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.310 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
First things, first.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate if you didn't
tell anyone about this.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
Look. Just lay back for now.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:15.869 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
To be honest with you,

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
this is something I have to do.

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm doing
this to replenish your H-energy.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
This is so I can
fight the Kiseichuu.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center
I believe you, but
still, what you're wearing...

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.180 position:50% align:center
Well, that's why
you can't turn around.

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
No matter what.

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I won't. I promise.

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Now that I think about
it, this isn't the first time

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
Hoshino and I have
slept like this.

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Haven't we done this before?

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
It was snowing.

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Not good.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.625 position:50% align:center
I fell asleep right in the
middle of doing homework.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
Hoshino's the
one who invited me over,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
and she ended up
passing out too.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
This is the perfect opportunity.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
I'll get her back
for always teasing me!

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
Eh-heh! [giggles]
Your expression!

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
Weirdo.

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
What were you doing
so close to my face?

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
You weren't thinking
of kissing me, were you?

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.123 position:50% align:center
I... No!

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.500 position:50% align:center
I was gonna draw on you
while you were sleeping!

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
Like I'd want to kiss you!

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
Oh? Go ahead, then.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
Nothing's stopping you.

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
Well? I'm waiting.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Done! Oh man, feels
sweet to finally get revenge!

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
Good night, then!

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
What a wuss.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Why am I
dredging up old memories,

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
especially in
a situation like this?

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
It's not like anything happened.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
Then again, we're not in
elementary school any more.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:34.090 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Enjo? I know I told
him to face the other way.

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center
But I never said anything
about not touching me!

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Then again, I never
imagined he'd work up the nerve!

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] I'm trying
to build up my H-energy,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
but I can't make a noise
or the other girls might hear!

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Things have gone too far!

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
Perv! Keep your
hands to yourself, or--

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
Why are my pillows so warm?

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Tenkuji! This has got to stop!

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
You guys...

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
Both of you really oughta be
sleeping in your own rooms.

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
But this is my room!

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
More importantly... Um...

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
How long have you been here?

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
I went to the bathroom.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
Then climbed back to bed.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] So in other words,
the whole time!

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.685 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
What were you two doing anyway?

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
Gah! Obviously, I also
ended up in the wrong room!

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Must have something
to do with the floor layout.

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA laughs]
Well, if you'll excuse me.

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
Come on, Tenkuji.

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
Your bedroom is literally
across the hallway.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
I spent hours prepping for that.

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
Only for it be over without
accomplishing anything.

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
And besides...

00:20:57.632 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
Why was there another
girl in his bed?

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
Enjo. You're
nothing but an idiot!

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.995 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
All the H-energy I built up,

00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:31.041 position:50% align:center
not to mention the panties I
just bought, wasted in one shot!

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center
Why do I even bother?!

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] You broke through
two reinforced ceilings

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
like they were cardboard!

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
Just as I thought,
you truly are incredible!

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.561 position:50% align:center
If that's supposed to
make me feel better, it's not!

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.146 position:50% align:center
Just look on the bright side.

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.690 position:50% align:center
You were able to gather
your sexual energy.

00:21:57.734 --> 00:21:58.735 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
Congratulations.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
Those videos...
They do the trick, huh?

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:05.033 position:50% align:center
No way! I didn't watch those!

00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:07.285 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] You didn't?!
Then what? Let's hear it!

00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh?

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:11.164 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
It's kind of a secret!

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
No fair!

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50% align:center
We're on a team!
You have to tell me!

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:15.126 position:50% align:center
Start talking!

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.753 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA whines]

00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:49.512 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Next time on Super HxEROS:

the Color of the Sky"!
