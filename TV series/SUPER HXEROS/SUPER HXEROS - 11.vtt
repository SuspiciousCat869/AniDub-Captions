I guess he got called in to work
last minute or something.

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
He said that he'll be late.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
That's kinda weird.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah?
Let's see what you got.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
Watch this, babe.

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Huh?

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
[VENDOR 11A]
You only get one! Sorry, kid.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
Man! You shoulda let me do it!

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
But you just had to show off.

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling I would win.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
--[HARUKA] Shows what you know.
--Hey, Kirara.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
Is something going
on between them?

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
Don't know. I think
maybe they got together

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
once we weren't looking.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
It's cute, huh?

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
In spite of all their fighting,
they seem like a good pair.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
What about you? You and Enjo
have been hanging out

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
non-stop lately.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
Um. We're just
old family friends.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Speaking of which,

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
the fireworks are gonna
be starting soon.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
So where the heck is he?

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
I-I'm going to the restroom.

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back!

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
We'll be here!

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
Sorry I'm so late.

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I just
got here myself.

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] That was weird.
I swear, that guy in the mask

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
looked like a Kiseichuu
for a second.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
I guess work has
really gotten to me.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
Gah! Look at that line!

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
I don't really have
a choice, do I?

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA sighs]
May the river gods forgive me.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
--[rustling]
--Ah! Enjo?

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
--Hoshino...?
--Are you okay?

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
I mean, what are you doing here?

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Well, I found
a Kiseichuu on the way

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.974 position:50% align:center
to the fireworks.

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
I tried to beat it,
and look how that turned out.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
--[groans]
--Enjo...

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
Why couldn't you hold back just
this once, for the fireworks?

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Seriously? I was really
looking forward to tonight.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
I know, you're right. I forgot
I didn't have my XERO gear.

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have
intervened, sorry.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Don't be. It's my
fault you didn't have it!

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
No, you're not at all to blame.

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
But there are a lot of people
gathered in one place

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
to watch the display.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
We definitely have to do
what we can to save them.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hold on. Do you
happen to know where

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
they're setting
off the fireworks?

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
Ah. Well yeah.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
Over there,
where they always do.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Got it.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:38.641 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait! Aren't you
gonna tell me what's up?

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] I'm pretty sure that's
where it's going to attack.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
They're fine. Their H-energy
was siphoned, so they fainted.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
Hey! Over there! Look!

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
So by simply launching
this lump of gunpowder

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
into the heavens,

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
I will inspire scores of humans
to suddenly pair up.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
And, when that happens,
the silly things

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
will start to feel all tingly.

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
Please. You don't
have to do this!

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
These people have been
looking forward to this night!

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
Can't you let 'em have it?!

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'll let them have it.

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
The foolish creatures swept away
by their fleeting passions.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
They deserve to get blown up
every bit as much

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
--as all this gunpowder!
--[STAFF 11A gasps]

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
[KISEICHUU 11A]
While they congregate together,

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
I'll take this chance
to get as many as possible

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
in one fell swoop!

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
--No, wait!
--I have to do something!

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center
If you go over there, she'll
wipe the floor with you again!

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
And did you forget?
HQ has barred us from helping!

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
[RETTO sighs] I haven't told
you the story yet, have I?

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
How I first started
hunting the Kiseichuu.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] In the beginning,
it was all about getting revenge

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
for the way they
traumatized you.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
That's why I agreed
to help my uncle.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
That's why I joined HXEROS.

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
But after working as a hero,
I realized something.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
When we fight...

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
...what we're really protecting
is people's relationships.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
If I can't keep romance
safe for others,

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
how could I ever
protect it for myself?

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA gasps]

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.032 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
I need you, Dark Kirara.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
You rang? It's so unusual
for you to summon me.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
Please help me. Can you raise
my H-energy right now?

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
Heh! Do you know who you're
talking to, of course!

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
Let me borrow
your body for a bit.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Hey, Ret, I want you
to look at me closely.

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Uh. Hang on, that was, uh--

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Hoshino?!

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
[KISEICHUU 11A]
Hmm? [laughs]

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
It's about time...

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
...to kick some ass!

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
[KISEICHUU 11A screams]

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
Look! It's starting!

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
So pretty!

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
[YUUNA] Aw. I hope Kirara
isn't missing this.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
Can you please not
stare at me like that?

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, sorry!

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
I was gonna give it back to you.

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
It's a good thing
I had it on me.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
[RETTO chuckles]

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] Hey, you two, sorry
to interrupt your love sesh!

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi. I didn't realize
you guys were here.

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
[SORA] Yeah. We ran into
each other earlier.

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
We were tracking down
the Kiseichuu's signal.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
And all ended up
at the same spot.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] But it looks like
you already exterminated her,

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
so thanks for that.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
Does... this mean...

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
...that you all were doing the
hero thing this whole time, too?

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA laughs] What?
Did you think we listen to HQ?

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center
We're not like you--
we actually like this job.

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:15.817 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA grunts]

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
We weren't just
gonna quit HXEROS

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
over something small like this.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
Even Hime was
hesitant in the beginning,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
but something's awakened
in her, and she loves it, too.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't put it like that!
She might get the wrong idea!

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:35.712 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
I gotta say.

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
I can't believe Retto's
uncle got pinched under

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
the new governor's laws.

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
Wait. It's that woman...

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
Are you all right, Chacha?

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:44.888 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
I can't quite explain it.

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:49.017 position:50% align:center
Something about
that human bothers me.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
Can you describe it
a little bit more?

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
I don't really know,
but she seems kind of

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.523 position:50% align:center
familiar to me somehow.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
Could it be a plot?

00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:01.279 position:50% align:center
A Kiseichuu in disguise got
herself elected as governor.

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
Then had my uncle arrested
and HXEROS disbanded.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:07.410 position:50% align:center
No way! Do-- Do you really
think that's what happened?

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
It's a very real possibility.

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:12.499 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] There's only
one way to know for sure.

00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:15.669 position:50% align:center
We're going to have to find her.

00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:51.723 position:50% align:center
