You're finished!

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center
Help! Retto!

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.685 position:50% align:center
Help with what?

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
And put on some clothes!

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:22.313 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
No time!

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
It's Kirara.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.067 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid she's been...

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
I'm sorry, you guys.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.508 position:50% align:center
I was there.
I should have seen it.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.137 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Hey, come on.
It's not your fault.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.848 position:50% align:center
I mean, none of us
thought the Kiseichuu

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.017 position:50% align:center
could pull something
like this off.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50% align:center
That's a great point.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.937 position:50% align:center
We're all just
worried about Hoshino.

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:29.315 position:50% align:center
Hard not to be. Right? Momoka?

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.193 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah! Absolutely.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.404 position:50% align:center
You sound weird. What's wrong?

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, nothing. Really.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:38.950 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hmm...?

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
I... just think we're screwed!

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.414 position:50% align:center
I mean, think about it.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
If we go after her right now,
do you really think

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.377 position:50% align:center
we'll be able to save her?

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.129 position:50% align:center
It could all be a trap.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
We just don't know.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.341 position:50% align:center
So, wouldn't it be
a good idea to build up

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.926 position:50% align:center
our H-energy before we go?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.720 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.847 position:50% align:center
But how? Way out here?

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Just leave that to me!

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
Wait for us here. Okay?

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.105 position:50% align:center
U-Uh...

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Wait, why?

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:19.157 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
Ahhh...? Are you serious?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
I can see you liking this.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
But I think you're
the only one, Momoka.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
Why the heck are the two of you
being such wusses about it?

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
After all, being a hero
means doing whatever you can

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
to help your friends, right?

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I mean,
what if the breeze...?

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.
You can count me in, Momoka.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
Finally! What've
you guys been doing?

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.145 position:50% align:center
We've, um...

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
These are for you. Here.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Pretty hot, right?

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Just knowing that you
might get a peek is gonna raise

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
our H-energy off the charts!

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
This is what
you might call a win-win deal.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe for you.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uhh...

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Whoa. What the...?

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
Does he know
about that time I had

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
an accidental discharge when
I was storing up H-energy

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
all by myself?

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA moaning]

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
[RETTO whimpers]

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA whimpers]

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME gasps]

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
Well, that sucks.
Guess it was for nothin', girls.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
Come on!
Forget it, let's just go!

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Also, if you guys
are ever in trouble...

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
...just let me know,
and I'll be your shield.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.492 position:50% align:center
That's so sweet!

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Retto.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
Trying to look cool again, huh?

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Okay. I know I said

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
I would be their shield.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
But in a situation
like this, that's a tall order!

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
This doesn't make
sense, aren't you a human?

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
Why are you
helping the Kiseichuu?

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
I don't get it!

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
You fool. Human?

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
I don't seem to remember saying
anything about being a human.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
It's called mimicry.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
We Kiseichuu can
change our forms at will,

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.676 position:50% align:center
to fit in with you Earthlings.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
Some of us even
have managed to slip into

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
human society to enact
our will from within.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
Poor thing.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
Finding out it's too late for
you to do anything about it.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
I have to go
report to the queen.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
Keep a close eye on this one.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
You know how the enemy can be.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
[KISEICHUU 5A]
Understood.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Okay, I have to escape somehow.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50% align:center
I wish I could get my
X-ERO gear to work.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
--Ah!
--[KIRARA] That's it.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Um, excuse me.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
It'd be bad news for
you guys if I built up

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
my H-energy, right?

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
Thing is... I'm afraid
I'm getting a little turned on

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
from being tied up like this.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
Or maybe I'm wrong
and that's what you want?

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
[moans]

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
[KISEICHUU 5A]
Ugh. This is why you humans

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
are such a terrible nuisance.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Ah!

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
[KISEICHUU 5A groans]

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
Sheesh! Well...
Serves you right!

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
Making me do that stupid act.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Oh!

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
According to our gear...
She should be near this spot.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
You girls okay?

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
--[GIRLS groaning]
--Yeah. More or less...

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
[moaning]

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.
Looks like no one's here.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.476 position:50% align:center
[sniffing]

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Human...?

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
What the heck do I do now?

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
It's a human!

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.277 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
Oh, nice--I had no idea
that you guys were so soft!

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA groans]

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Ah!
Oops. Please forgive me!

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] You're the first
of your kind I've seen

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
in the flesh, so I got excited.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Why is she acting
like this? Is she an alien?

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.925 position:50% align:center
I need to know
who and what you are.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
Are you with the Kiseichuu?

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
My name is Chacha.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.014 position:50% align:center
And I am the firstborn
of the Queen.

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
So, in other words,
I'm the Princess here!

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
Except.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
I'm also the shunned child born
once every thousand years.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
You see... I've been
locked up in here

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
since as far back
as I can remember.

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
So I wouldn't really say
I'm one of them.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.906 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
They keep you locked up?

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
But aren't you also a
Kiseichuu, just like the others?

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
there are things about me

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
that make them think
I'm too different.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
As you can see, I have
some obvious mutations.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure
that's why they locked me up.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
Because my physical makeup is
so different from my species.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Um... I trust that
you're a good female human,

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
so I'm going to
ask you for a favor.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
The name's Kirara.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
Would you possibly
consider setting me free

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
from this prison?

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
Because this planet sounds fun!

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
Even though the mating of the
dominant species is much more

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
complicated than
the other species.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
You still flourish.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's unheard of!

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
Oh, and then...

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
On top of everything else,

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
this country has such
amazing soap operas!

00:08:57.037 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
Ah, right.
You know a lot about us.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
You may already
be aware of this,

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
but my compatriots are
trying to wipe out humanity.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
I want to prevent that,
though, no matter what it takes.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
I'm not asking
you to try and forgive

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
my fellow Kiseichuu.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
I'm just asking
you to help me stop them.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
All right, then, I will.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
Maybe together, the two of us
can find a way out of here!

There's no other way.

Now I get it.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center

on your enemies.

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hmm...?

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
It's like
regular Valentines Day,

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
only during the Star Festival.

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
A girl shows a boy she
likes him by giving him

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
a big piece of candy!

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
Wow. No, I...

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
I didn't know that.
How interesting!

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
Not related,
but now that you mention food,

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
I am a little hungry!
[chuckles]

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
You dummy. Come out and say it.

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
Do you want me
to give you my candy?

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.850 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Yes! I want it!

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Oopsie! I must've
left it back at the house!

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Ah--

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
If I knew you'd
be this disappointed,

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have forgotten.

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's not like this
Valentines is a real thing.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
It doesn't bother me.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
There you go,
putting on a front again.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
Maybe if the rain stops
and I'm feeling generous...

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
...I wouldn't mind buying
you candy at the festival.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
[fireworks popping]

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Ah! The rain stopped!

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Somehow I knew.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
Everything would work out.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.102 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
That's right.

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.270 position:50% align:center
When I was young,
I had all these ideas

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
of what high school
would be like.

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
It wasn't this!

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
I was supposed to find
a boyfriend to go on dates with.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
And the two of us would
spend our days off together.

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
Cherishing every
minute we shared alone.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
But you ruined everything.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
If it weren't for the Kiseichuu.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
I might have been
able to tell him...

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
...how I really felt!

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA growls]

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
[GITAICHUU screams]

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
That was a huge
surge of H-energy!

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
It felt close.
Was it from Kirara?

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA panting]

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hoshino! Are you okay?

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
Heh. I really wore
myself out, huh?

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
I owe you. Thank you, Ret.

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] I know I've
caused a lot of trouble,

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
but can you do me a favor?

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:43.725 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh?

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Thatta girl. I knew
this place couldn't hold you.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
Now, I'm free, too.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
Because I've earned the right
to say it was worth being born.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA gasps]

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
[RETTO snarls]

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA gasps]

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
The heck's this thing?

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
Kirara! Are you all right?

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry and get out of here!

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
Where's Enjo?
We have to find him!

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
Your cellmate told
me everything, Chacha.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.614 position:50% align:center
Come with me.
We're leaving!

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA gasps]

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
Hey, Enjo!

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
Where are you?

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.381 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
Please, answer us!

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
This is all my fault. Come on.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
Think of something.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
Hey, relax.
I'm sure he escaped just fine.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
Trust me. Also, if you
hadn't gotten kidnapped,

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't have
found their nest!

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
So quit moping!

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
This was a huge success!

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.777 position:50% align:center
We managed to
kick Kiseichuu butt!

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Somebody... Help me!

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
--[KIRARA] That voice! It's him!
--[CHACHA] Shh. They'll hear.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center
I haven't finished
my examination yet!

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
[RETTO wails]

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.581 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Ooh! So this is what
a male human looks like.

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
They're definitely
more rigid down there

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
than the females.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
[RETTO whimpers]

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] So, uh... How do you
walk around with that thing?

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
It's not always like this!

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
A second Kirara?

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] It's like it's got
a mind of its own.

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
Everyone, calm down!

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's a Kiseichuu,
but she's on our side!

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:47.390 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Well, not on his side.

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
More like on top!

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center
A second ago,
I couldn't help but overhear

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
you talking about beating us.

00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
Just so you know,
destroying the nest

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:58.735 position:50% align:center
won't change anything until
you defeat my mother.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] But seeing
how there's five of you,

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
you might actually be
able to subdue her.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.786 position:50% align:center
What's that?
You want me to join you?

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:11.081 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose I could help
you re-train your H-energy.

00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:12.415 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Hold up.
Out of all the forms

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
you could've taken,
why'd you chose mine?

00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:51.639 position:50% align:center
