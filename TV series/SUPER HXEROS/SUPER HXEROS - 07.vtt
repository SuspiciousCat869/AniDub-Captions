Hey, doesn't
this count as peeping?

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
Hush. Just keep quiet and watch.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.235 position:50% align:center
Any second now.

[SHIKO] Looking up skirts first
thing in the morning, huh?

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
That's a real
nice hobby you've got there,

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
you little brats.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, we're sorry!

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
But, uh... What we
were actually doing was

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
picking up some change
that we dropped.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO sighs]
See, if you were honest.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.093 position:50% align:center
I was planning to
give you a free peek.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
What? Are you serious?

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
So what's the deal?

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.390 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna be phonies?

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
[BOYS gasp]

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center

Or good, honest boys?

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
Well, the truth is--

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:05.273 position:50% align:center
Just kidding.
Could you be any more gullible?

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
A girl's panties
are like a shooting star.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.154 position:50% align:center
You only glimpse them by chance,
and therein lies the value.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.114 position:50% align:center
Instead of looking
down all the time,

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:15.909 position:50% align:center
maybe raise your sights
a little higher, boys.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
Raise them higher.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
Right.

[TV ANNOUNCER 1A] In recent
days, companies and schools

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:11.399 position:50% align:center
in Saitama have been reporting
a sharp increase in absences.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
Those skipping
their duties claim their dreams

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.154 position:50% align:center
were so enjoyable,
they couldn't wake up.

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
Employers and administrators are
looking for a swift solution.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
So our teacher overslept?

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.169 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Not just
the teacher, either.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh? Uh... What the--?!

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Could it be...?

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] So. Do you mean, it was
the same at your school, Kirara?

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, yours, too?
It's happening everywhere.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
[SORA] Some are saying it's
great because they're having

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
the dreams they want.
It's like paradise.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.987 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME] Well, I've heard
stories of people not even

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
getting out of bed all day.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] I have suspicions
about the cause.

[GIRLS]
Huh?

Someone's able to show
humans the dreams they desire.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
Dimming their reality.

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
Which, in turn,
will have the effect

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
of weakening all humanity.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center

Genmuchuu, Genmuchuu!

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
Well, I've noticed something.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
Don't you think your species
tactics are kind of indirect?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
Oh yes, absolutely.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
See, in normal times,
our race would typically hope

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
for a peaceful invasion.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
But now, with the Queen missing,

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid the whole
organization is being

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
very poorly managed.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] Hm. I guess we'd better
do something about it, then.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
Let's stop them
as quickly as we can.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
But to do that...

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
We'll need to gather up
a whole lot of H-energy, right?

Ugh, just leave me alone!

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
Okay, well, according to
the map that my uncle sent me...

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.017 position:50% align:center
...it would appear
this is our target.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
It looks like a place
where a Kiseichuu would lurk.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.024 position:50% align:center

Kinda creepy if you ask me.

directly into our heads

Why don't we go ahead
and get down to the battle,

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center

[GENMUCHUU] There's an enemy
that exists within you.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
The greatest enemy.
Your own desire!

[droning, squealing continues]

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Hey. Ret!

Come on, knock it off!

we would call each other

by our first names, remember?

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
But... that was a while back.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
Seriously, how could you?

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
I mean, especially
considering we're dating.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.125 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
and if you get it right,
then I guess I'll forgive you.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
First, I want you
to say "kiss" ten times fast.

[RETTO]
Th-That's not a quiz!

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center

Okay, good!

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
Now, the quiz.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
Tell me this.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
What's the word that you
associate with "kiss"?

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
Think hard!

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry, I don't really
get how that's a quiz?

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] I want you to look
at me when you answer.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
Well. It's love, right?

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
Good try! Sorry, though!

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50% align:center
The correct answer is...

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
"Perch"! As in "sea perch
from the kisu family"!

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, are you
really blushing right now?

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.596 position:50% align:center
You didn't get
the wrong idea, did you?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
Please. How would I
have known the answer?

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
Okay. Question two.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
What am I going to do...

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
...that starts with K
and ends with S?

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.566 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
[RETTO sighs]
I really do love this girl.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:10.699 position:50% align:center
I really do.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] But which me?
That's the question.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh?

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
The me you're
going out with now?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Or is it the version
of me that they all call

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
the Iron Maiden?

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
[CHILD KIRARA] Or maybe the me
from when I was your first love?

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh?

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
[REGRESSED KIRARA]
Ooh! Or, wait!

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're more into
the repressed me?

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
[KIRARAS]
So? Tell me:

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
which me do you love the most?

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever you want.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.315 position:50% align:center
Mind and body, Ret.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
All you have to do
is say the word.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
So choose!

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.574 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
The one I love.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
That's easy.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
I love you all.

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
I do. I love every Hoshino.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
They're all part of you!

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50% align:center
I love you!

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
[CHILD KIRARA giggles]

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
The you before you changed.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] You love all of us?
That seems kind of stupid.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
And the "you" after.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
I dedicate the rest of my life
to loving all these Kiraras.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] If I'm dreaming.
Don't wake me up!

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Is this the place, Moena?

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
[MOENA]
For sure. I can sense it.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
The scent of a Kiseichuu.
Maybe two of them.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Ah, nice.

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Sheesh! I finally got through!

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
What're you...?

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
You need to get
yourself back to reality,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
so we can defeat Genmuchuu!

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]
No way! I refuse!

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna stay here with
the Hoshinos in this world!

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Is that really what you want?

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
This is just a world of
your delusions, Retto.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
You can't experience
anything more than what

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
you've already
imagined thus far.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
But, if you defeat Genmuchuu...

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.740 position:50% align:center
...I'll see to it
that you have experiences with

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
the real Kirara that you could
never even begin to imagine!

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
How's that sound?

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Will it be amazing
enough to make me abandon

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
this harem of Kiraras?

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.752 position:50% align:center
Oh, I can promise it will be.

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
All right, fine.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
Tell me how I can get back.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
First, you have to put this on,
and then, pinch your cheek.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Got it.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Ret...

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
Try to make me
happy over there, too.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
Then, this will all be worth it.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
[GENMUCHUU] Hmm. It appears
one of them is about to

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
wake up from their dream.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50% align:center
I'll use more hypno-sound waves.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] Excuse me,
but are you the one who's been

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
making all this racket?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
[GENMUCHUU]
Wha--? Humans?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.540 position:50% align:center
Why isn't my hypnosis
working on you two?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Oh. I mean, yeah,

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
I guess I did have
some kind of weird dream.

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
But it didn't really
do anything for me.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
No worries, though.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll be more
stimulating than some dream.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Retto! You're awake!

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.355 position:50% align:center
So it worked.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. We came
here to defeat the Kiseichuu.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
And then I passed out.

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
[boom]

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What the--?

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
Sounded like it was close by!

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
Wake up, Hoshino!

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
It's no use.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
The only way they're getting up
is by entering their dreams

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
or beating Genmuchuu.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
Damn! All right.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
It's you and me!

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
Uh... Wait.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
Who are you guys?

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
Hey. Look, Shiko.

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
There's the other Kiseichuu
we were looking for.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
They're mine.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
No! Ahh--!

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
What's your deal? You nuts?

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
I'm doing my job and
exterminating the enemy!

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.407 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Not this one.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.325 position:50% align:center
She's on our side!

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Huh. Now I get it.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
You're with the Saitama Branch
of HXEROS, right?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
--[RETTO grunts, groans]
--[CHACHA yells]

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
Hey, you! Let go of me now!

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
Is that seriously
the best you got?

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
You may think you're hot shit
just because you wiped out

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
a single Kiseichuu nest,
but who's the one on top?

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
The alien mutt's coming with us.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Later.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Not so fast!
I said she's on our side!

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
Oh? That should've knocked

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
the wind out of your sails.

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
Maybe the Saitama Branch
is more interesting

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
than I thought.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
We are right on the border
between our two cities.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
The question is,
who claims the Kiseichuu?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
What do you say we settle
this matter like true heroes

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
with a duel.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
I'm Shiko Murasame
with HxEROS, Tokyo Branch.

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
And the quiet one
over there's Moena Wakakusa.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
[MOENA]
It's a pleasure.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
The rules are simple.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
Whichever one of us can't
hold back their H-energy

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.519 position:50% align:center
and spews it first is the loser!

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
[GENMUCHUU] I'm Genmuchuu
and I've got you trapped

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
in a dream world.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
A showdown using H-Energy?

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Hey! Stop treating
this like it's a game!

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] It is a game
and the rules are clear.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
Whoever cracks
first is the loser.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
This is this your definition
of acting like a hero?

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
How modest.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
HxEROS do stuff like
this on a daily basis.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
Now, stop fighting.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
And start moving along with me!

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I can't push her off.

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
Is her XERO gear amplifying
her physical ability?

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
Now you're starting to get it.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Somehow,
I've gotta counterattack.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
It's no use!

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
I can't touch another girl.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
I won't betray Hoshino!

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
[MOENA] Did your master take a
vow of abstinence or something?

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA groans]

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.169 position:50% align:center
[MOENA]
It won't be long now.

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
Once's Shiko's switch is
flipped, she doesn't turn off.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
Kirara and the others
train Retto like this every day!

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
As if she could
break him this easily!

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.264 position:50% align:center
[MOENA]
Hmm...

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
Please. I can't take much more.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
Come on, now.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.480 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're
surrendering already.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
And here I was thinking you
might actually pose a challenge.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.113 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center

[KIRARA grunts]

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Hey. Retto.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow's your day off.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] What do you say
we put her to bed?

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
You know...

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
Then...

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
Yeah, like that'll happen.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center
Keep dreaming.

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA gasps]

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
[CHILD KIRARA] After everything
you put him through?

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:32.057 position:50% align:center
I'm the one Ret's
in love with, not you.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
No... Don't take him away!

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center
A dream? Uhh...

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
Everyone! Wake up! Right now!

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS groaning]

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] No fair. And I was
having a really good one.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
Too bad!

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
And the same goes for you,
Enjo, you freaking idiot!

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
Wait a second. Where is he?

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh...?

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
I'll give you props
for holding out this long.

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
But looks like you're
about ready to burst.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
[MOENA] Guess he can't
satisfy Shiko, either.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to
think no one can.

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Not good.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
At this rate, Retto
will lose, and I'll be...

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
Don't you quit on me!

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:01.980 position:50% align:center
I can't take it anymore!

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
You have to forgive me,
Shiko, but I was no match

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
for his raw sensual energy.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
So. Guess you're finally
taking this duel seriously.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] It's like he's turned
into a different person!

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
What if he's the one...

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
...who can make
me feel something?

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR 7A] Your body
is extremely sensitive.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
So much so, it's like
one big erogenous zone.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
So how do I get better?

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR 7A] This little device
is called XERO gear.

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
It converts people's H-energy.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
As long as you have it set
to the energy-guzzler mode

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
so it can quickly
release any you've

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
accumulated throughout the day,
this should provide relief

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
from your symptoms.

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
However,
there is one side effect:

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
Your body will end up
becoming extremely insensitive.

00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
Are you sure
you want to go through

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
with the treatment?

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
Because of this condition,
I've been afraid to reach out

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
and touch other people.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
I want to have physical
contact with those around me,

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
just like my peers.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
To feel someone else's warmth.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
For them to touch me back.

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
So what if it's difficult
to feel anything else?

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
Better than being closed
off from those I care about!

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.270 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Ever since that day.

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
I've been fighting against the
Kiseichuu as a member of HxEROS.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
Thanks to my XERO gear,

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
my hypersensitivity's
been cured.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
But there's nothing and
no one who's been able

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
to stimulate me ever since.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
That is...

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
Until today.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
[moaning]

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
It's coming back.

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
That burning sensation
washing over my body.

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
The throbbing in my chest.

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
How long has it been?

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
The H-energy.

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
Everything I've
accumulated up until now.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
I might as well,
let it all spill out!

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO sighs]

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. What just happened?

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
That was unexpected.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
You good?

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
I mean, who would've figured
both of us would lose.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Speak for yourself!

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
I didn't let out a drop!

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to be ashamed.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Fine! I'll admit, I lost!

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
But I didn't let
everything out! I think.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
[MOENA] I thought you
were cute when you felt it,

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.216 position:50% align:center
but it's nothing compared
to when you get all flustered.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] What are you
even talking about, dummy?

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
Hey! You! Wait a second!

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
Your name. What is it?

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
I'm Retto. Retto Enjo.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO whimpers]

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
Good work.
Now just get his number.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:56.571 position:50% align:center
[MOENA sniffs] Huh? I smell
another Kiseichuu nearby.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
[GENMUCHUU cackles] Should've
focused on defeating me!

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
Now you're out of H-energy and
just a normal, pathetic human!

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
I'm going to put
you to sleep for eternity!

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center

It's futile!

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
You really think
you can escape my grasp?

Yeah. What about you guys?

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
Who are these two?

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] I'm not sure but,
they said they're with

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
the Tokyo Branch of HxEROS.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] Hmm...
Whoa! Wait! You're Moena!

[MOENA]
It's Momocchi!

[SHIKO]
An old friend?

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
[MOENA] We used to go
to the same middle school.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.864 position:50% align:center
Then I got accepted into
a private academy

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
and had to move away.

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:25.618 position:50% align:center
From the looks of it,
you haven't changed one bit.

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
You keep your eyes up here!

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
So? What now?

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
Do you still intend on
stealing Chacha from us?

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
Just for the record, this is
far from being over with!

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
You hear me?

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
Mark my words,
very soon, I will have my prey!

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.677 position:50% align:center
[MOENA]
See you later!

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
Gotta be careful
with her running around, Chacha.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
--She's tough.
--[CHACHA] Seems like it.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
So. What happened
with you and those girls?

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
I wish I could remember,
but it's all kind of a blur.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
You don't have any
memories of going beast mode

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
and rocking their worlds?

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Thanks for mentioning it!

00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:04.032 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Mark my words, very soon.

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:06.159 position:50% align:center
I will have my prey!

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.122 position:50% align:center

about you, Retto Enjo.
