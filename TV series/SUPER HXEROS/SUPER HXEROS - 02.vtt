[KIRARA]
Are you ready?

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Wait a minute. You mean here?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] It takes erotic energy
to defeat the Kiseichuu, right?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
So we need to generate
as much as we can.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
But I don't want you
getting the wrong idea.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.242 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
What's about to happen...

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
...isn't for your sake.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
After all, this is
the only way to save humanity.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.376 position:50% align:center

Man... What a crazy dream.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
Ruff!

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:41.369 position:50% align:center
Oh, good morning,
Runba. Sleep well?

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
Whatcha got there?

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
[RUNBA]
Borf?

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.502 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh? Whose are these?

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Where're you hiding, Runba?

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Is that... Momozono?!

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50% align:center
You little thief! Give
me my panties back right now!

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Uh... Uh...

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:05.602 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
So... Then you were
the mastermind. Should've known.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
Runba took them! Not me!

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.655 position:50% align:center
If you're a real man, next time,
you'll steal them yourself!

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
That's what you're mad about?

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] Who knew we had
two dogs in this house?

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
So loud...

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
It's too early...

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Tenkuji?

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
Morning, Retto. What're
you doing sleeping in my room?

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
We've been over this before!

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
You were probably half asleep
and stumbled in here again.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
How many times do I
have to remind you,

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
your room's across from mine?

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center

[sighs]

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
I heard your
morning was eventful.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout that.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.033 position:50% align:center
You don't know the half of it.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
Like, seriously. You're the one
normal person here, Shirayuki.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
Come on, that isn't true.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center
They're good girls,
both of them.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
Come and get it!
Breakfast is served!

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
[RUNBA]
Hmm!

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
Ah! Of all the places...

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
[RUNBA howls]

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
Hey! Cut it out, Runba!

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
That's not your food bowl!

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.527 position:50% align:center

[coughs]

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
I... I'm sorry
you had to witness

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.039 position:50% align:center
such a shameful display.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50% align:center
Huh? Witness what?

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
I dunno what
you're talking about.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] This house serves
as the base of operations

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
for the Super HxEROS team.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] All of my teammates
and I live here.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
Except for one member.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.524 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] See? I knew
it was just a matter of time

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
before the right
candidate came along.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
At last... Super HxEROS
is ready to launch!

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Uh, few questions.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
Why exactly is it necessary
for us to live together

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
in one house?

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
[ANNO]
Emergency deployment,

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
which comes with
being a superhero.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
And it builds teamwork,
which helps defeat the bad guys.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
Even so--

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
Did you say you're
name's Piranha?

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
No, it's Kirara.
And could you not touch me?

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
[MIAHIME chuckles nervously]

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
So feisty. Let's be friends.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
We're in the same
boat, after all.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
You just met me.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
What makes you think
we're anything alike?

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
[ANNO]
She's right!

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
The five of you
share similar qualities,

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
so you should try and get along.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
What does that even mean?

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
What qualities are
you talking about?

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
Well... You're all
filthy with erotic energy!

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
[RETTO groans]

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
What do you know?

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna waste my time
listening to you judge me! Jerk!

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
Wait! You can't go!

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Weird. Was it something we said?

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
That could've gone better.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
She had the potential
to be a powerful ally.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] But I know if anyone can
change her mind it's you, Retto!

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.569 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not!

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
Did you see the way
that she reacted?

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
Then do it for me!

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:50.201 position:50% align:center
We need Piranha to be a part of
the team, whatever it takes!

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:51.995 position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Everyone knows superhero squads

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50% align:center
always come in groups of five!

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
That's your reasoning?

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] I realize finding
teammates is important.

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
But Hoshino?

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
[TARANCHU]
Taran!

[TARANCHU]
Taran! Taran! Taran!

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
What? Who are you?

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:22.776 position:50% align:center
Heh. Nice costume.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
[TARANCHU]
That skirt exposes too much leg.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 2A]
Mind your own biz, bug!

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
[TARANCHU]
I must regulate you!

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center

There!

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.584 position:50% align:center
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
A tasteful length!

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
But I hate long skirts!

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Your reign of terror ends here!

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center

[TARANCHU screams]

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
Thanks. If you
hadn't shown up, I'd be...

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where did he go?

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Something about
the thought of Hoshino fighting

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
the Kiseichuu makes me...

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.745 position:50% align:center
A simple "no"
would've been enough!

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
She's heartless!

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
[DATE]
I know, right?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
--Totally.
--Hey, you guys.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What happened?

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
The Iron Maiden strikes again.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
A guy just asked her out and,
well, it wasn't pretty.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Oh! Uh, hey, Enjo.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
Morning. So...

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
Funny thing, you caught
me right as I was leaving.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.403 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Really. Because it's
the beginning of the school day.

[KIRARA sobs]

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
[DATE] So what happened
between you two?

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
[DATE] As if.
Something's clearly going on.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
[TORIKOE]
Come on! Out with it!

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What she said yesterday...

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should give you a hand.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
Defeating these bug things.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh?

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
But... Um...

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
First off, you have
to promise me you won't tell

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
another living soul about
what happened here today.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Her promise.
Was there more to it?

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
Ah. So peaceful.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hoshino.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA grunts]

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
You got a second?

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
So, what the hell do you want?

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
I bet you went blabbing
about yesterday, huh?

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
No, of course not.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
That's why I waited until
I knew you'd be alone.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you threatening me?!

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
As if I'd do that...

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
Then why're you here?

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
I was told to try
and convince you to stay.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
But after thinking about it...

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
Making you fight the source of
your trauma, would be cruel.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Yeah. Exactly.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:25.166 position:50% align:center
But what about you?
What's your reasoning?

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
Why go through all the trouble
of fighting those monsters?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, I wonder.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
What would've happened if we
hadn't encountered one that day.

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
There's a possibility
our relationship

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.598 position:50% align:center
wouldn't have changed.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
And not just ours.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
I think about all of
the relationships

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
the Kiseichuu have ruined.

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
Whatever their goal is...

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
...I'll never forgive them
for stealing our emotions.

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
You're serious?

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] My uncle's just
disappointed about

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
not having you on the team.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
But leave it to me.
I'll smooth things over.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
That's all.
I'll leave you alone now.

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
What the heck?

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
Why's everyone convinced
I've got a dirty mind?

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
I mean, yeah, okay, when I was
younger I had certain urges,

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center
but that was years ago.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
[JIKOCHUU]
That's right. I'm Jikochuu!

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
Random fact time!

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.206 position:50% align:center
Did you know the human heart
beats three billion times

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
over the course
of a normal life?

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh...?

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Whadya say we feel ours?

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:57.592 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Come on! I wanna see
whose heart beats faster!

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.
Warning, though: I won't lose!

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
It's a bet! Okay, let's start by

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
both putting a hand
on each other's chests.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Ahh!
Wait! Are you kidding me?

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
That's totally crazy!

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
All right, fine. Kinda figured.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
Well, then... We could always
compare by listening.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
[RETTO whimpers]

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
[hearts thudding]

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
I can hear your heartbeat.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
It's getting faster, I think.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Huh? Wait...

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
My heart is beating
just as fast as his.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA giggles]
I guess we're tied, then!

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Uh... Yeah.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
But... I've changed since then.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
I'm not that same
naïve, fearless girl.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
[BOY 2B]
Look! A monster!

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
Monster?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
No. Please don't tell me

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
one of those bug things has
decided to show up at school.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
And not just ours.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
I think about all of
the relationships

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center
the Kiseichuu have ruined.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
How fascinating.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
So, this is what they call
a "school," huh?

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
What a delectable buffet
of young humans.

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
In fact...
Maybe I'll play for a while.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:50.580 position:50% align:center
Till the one who was rough with
my little sister shows up.

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
--[sighs]
--[JIKOCHUU] You!

Sorry to disappoint,
but you haven't escaped.

[BOY 2A gasps]

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
[JIKOCHUU] Hmm, it looks like
a broken heart has filled you

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
with negative energy.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
[BOY 2A grunts]

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
[JIKOCHUU] I can read you
like a book, and oh my,

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
the naughty and indecent
things you imagined

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center
doing with that girl.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA whimpers]

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.321 position:50% align:center
[JIKOCHUU] You put her
in a swimsuit, to start.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:25.281 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Oh, Master...

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Would you please
take me for a walk?

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
Woof!

we could go somewhere together.

Ugh! What right does
someone like you even have

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:55.770 position:50% align:center
to say that to me?

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.814 position:50% align:center
For starters, who are you again?

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
I'd never give contact
info to some rando I don't know.

--No. I loved her!

[JIKOCHUU]
You don't have to worry.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
[JIKOCHUU] Once I absorb
all that pent-up energy...

Where the heck is Enjo?

What is he doing?

Stop!

someone's energy?

Then I suggest that
you start with mine!

I can't help wondering, though.

If you're so scared
you're trembling,

why go through the trouble
of defying me?

But that's a thought
for another day.

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll do it.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
If you really need
me that badly,

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
then I'll join you.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh?

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] You know.
The Super HxEROS or whatever.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
But why now, though?

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
I thought about it.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
And I can never forgive the
Kiseichuu for what they've done!

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
One rule!

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
Use me to build up your energy
and you're dead, got it?

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
None of the other girls, either!

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
Sure. I'll do my best.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
If things get really bad, and it
becomes necessary to offer--

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:47.812 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:51.775 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA growls]

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
--[RETTO grunts]
--[KIRARA yells]

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what did I just say?

00:19:57.155 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Right, and I'm
gonna try to comply.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
I really am. But...

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
What were you about to tell me?

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Nope! Forget it!

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
I will not be saying it again!

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
Hey, so... That guy...

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
What were you two
talking about over there?

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Uh, nothing.

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:27.143 position:50% align:center
Never mind that,
okay? Let's get going.

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Where to?

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Your house.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
So, anyway.

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
I look forward to getting
to know all of you!

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
Yay! This is such great news!

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
I was getting a little worried.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
In the end, birds of
a feather flock together.

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
It makes me nervous
when you say that, Sora.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:48.998 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
That includes you, too, Maihime!

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
[MIAHIME]
Huh...?

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
First things first!

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
We girls will give you
the grand tour.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
This lonely loser
can wait in his room

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
till we're done!

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Wait, what?

00:20:57.674 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
[RETTO sighs]
Man, what a day.

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I still can't believe Hoshino

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
is joining the Super HxEROS.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Whoa. Then that means...

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
From now on, I'll be living
with the girl I love?

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
[alarm blares]

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 2A] Emergency alert!
Emergency alert!

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
A giant Kiseichuu has appeared
in the metropolitan area!

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
All members, please
mobilize immediately!

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What the--?

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:51.519 position:50% align:center
Why are you all naked?

00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
Oh, y'know.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.315 position:50% align:center
I figured, since we're gonna be
teammates and everything,

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:58.193 position:50% align:center
a group bath might
speed up the bonding process.

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:01.863 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hey, y'okay?

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:08.828 position:50% align:center
I knew it!
I absolutely hate it here!

00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:24.302 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA growls]

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.514 position:50% align:center
[RETTO chuckles]

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:51.639 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Super HxEROS!
Next time: "Butterfly Effect"!
