00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.850 position:50% align:center
[MAN 12A] Governor Iwazu. Thank
you for being with us today.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.810 position:50% align:center
We are always
honored to have you.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.228 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
It was my pleasure.

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
I'm always more than
happy to address

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
the topic of regulating speech.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
In that case, what would you
say to discussing it further?

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
Perhaps over dinner?

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA] I'm afraid
I've got a car waiting,

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
so, no, but thank
you for the offer.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
You have a wonderful evening.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
--Excuse me!
--[DRIVER 12A] Huh?!

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Follow that
car that just passed!

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.962 position:50% align:center
[DRIVER 12A]
Uh, okay.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:46.963 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA grunts]

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
C'mon, step on it, already!

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA, RETTO] Super HXEROS!
Episode 12: "HXEROS Showdown"!

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.310 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
So I was thinking,

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.896 position:50% align:center
is Chacha the only way we
have to tell whether or not

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
a human is a
camouflaged Kiseichuu?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.650 position:50% align:center
Yep! So, it's me
or nothin', pal.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
Mm! Ahm!

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:12.280 position:50% align:center
That being said, if she does
turn out to be a real Kiseichuu,

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.283 position:50% align:center
it might be dangerous to call
her out in broad daylight.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center
Let's be real:

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.371 position:50% align:center
Nobody would believe us in the
first place if we had no proof.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:20.413 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hmm...

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.707 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Well, if that's true...

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
...then we might as well
go see her directly.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hmm. Good idea.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.426 position:50% align:center
Is there something
wrong, Chacha?

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.303 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Just wondering.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:36.554 position:50% align:center
Do you think...

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
...I'm still useful
to the group?

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:43.728 position:50% align:center
Even though XEROS has disbanded,
it's like nothing has changed.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
Everyone's still taking care
of me and letting me

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.691 position:50% align:center
live with them and stuff.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.401 position:50% align:center
But I haven't been
able to do anything

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
to help you guys for real.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.904 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
That's not true.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:54.447 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Uh?

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.908 position:50% align:center
You may not realize it, but
you've always helping us out!

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
Besides... We wouldn't have
our awesome new suits

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.162 position:50% align:center
if it wasn't for you.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Good. I'm so glad
that I met all of you.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.798 position:50% align:center
[RETTO whimpers]
My entire savings...

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.217 position:50% align:center
And don't forget,
we'll have to get home, too.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.844 position:50% align:center
[RETTO screams]

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:18.013 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA yawns]
This is weird.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.765 position:50% align:center
Why does the governor live in
the middle of nowhere, anyway?

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.101 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Yeah, it is a little strange.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Okay, what's the plan?

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.855 position:50% align:center
If a bunch of high school
kids show up uninvited,

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.940 position:50% align:center
it'll be way too suspicious.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:30.775 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
Maybe ding-dong ditch?

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME] What're we gonna do
if she's actually a human?

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.863 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Listen, I've got it. I'll go.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.323 position:50% align:center
If I go alone, in disguise,

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:39.409 position:50% align:center
I can get close without
raising suspicion.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's dangerous!

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.163 position:50% align:center
She could very well
be the enemy!

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
There's no way. We can't
let you go alone, Chacha.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.584 position:50% align:center
I don't care!

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything I can
to be helpful to the team!

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:54.632 position:50% align:center
Back when I was alone,
you gave me a place to belong.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
If there's even a possibility of
going back to how things were,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.265 position:50% align:center
then, I feel like it's best to
stay here with you guys.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
So sweet of you...

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Besides,
if things get too weird,

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.520 position:50% align:center
I have all the faith
in the world

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
that you'll come to save me.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME gasps]
For sure!

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.403 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
It's a promise.

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Listen, Chacha,
what you have to do

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
is actually very simple: Just
get inside the governor's house

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
and look around for any signs
that she's a Kiseichuu.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.289 position:50% align:center
If there's nothing to see,
we'll be on our way.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.375 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
And if it turns out that she is?

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Get out as fast as you can.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
We'll come to the rescue.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Mm.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] It'll be okay.
I know I can do this.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
Uh... I'm here to
deliver a package?

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME] Do you think
she'll be all right?

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] As long as she
doesn't say something weird.

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center
--[MOGANA] Yes?
--[CHACHA] Here she is!

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
Can I help you?

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.400 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA gasps]

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.527 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Is this really the governor?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.279 position:50% align:center
Is it just me or does she
look like a total perv?

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
I just need you
to sign for this.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
Very well.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh? What happened to Chacha?

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
Did the governor do something?

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME gasps]

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Shirayuki stop!

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
Everyone, stay right where
you are and wait for me!

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Seriously?!

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
She's the one who said
this was too dangerous

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
in the first place!

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME whimpers]

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh? Where'd they go?

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
Are you really sure about this?

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
Trespassing?

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
I mean, the door was wide open.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
We're just looking for someone.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center
We won't get in trouble.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:46.411 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
Huh? Hmm. Ah! Chacha!

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
I'm overjoyed that
you've come back.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
Just look at you!

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
My sweet, beloved
little daughter!

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
And? I'm simply delighted
that you've brought me

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
such exquisite souvenirs!

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA] Now, why don't
we have a lovely dinner?

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Wait, what the hell is going on?

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
Um, did she just refer to
Chacha as her daughter,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
or did I hallucinate that?

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.607 position:50% align:center
She sure did.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
So, she's the queen?

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.571 position:50% align:center
I never dreamed that we
would be reunited so soon.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
Now...

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
...as for the rest of you...

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
I had this girl locked up for a
reason. How dare you free her?

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
All right! Step away, Chacha!

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
I can take her down right now!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
Cute.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
It's okay.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
I won't hurt your friends,
so don't worry.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
I'm just going to make sure
their stay is comfortable.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.436 position:50% align:center
Oh, and by the way.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
This room is made out of
H-energy-proof materials,

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
so you can try to escape,
but it'll be a complete

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
waste of your time.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
You'd end up accumulating
H-energy for nothing.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA sighs]
Great, it's locked.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
This one, too.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
You know...

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.378 position:50% align:center
If Chacha betrayed us, I won't
even know what to think anymore.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME] Don't! Stop that--
of course she didn't!

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
No, I'm sorry!
I don't seriously think that.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.010 position:50% align:center
I'm just talking.

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
No, I'm sorry for overreacting!

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about Chacha.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
It's almost like she's in
a trance or something.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I agree.

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
We have to find some way
to get out of here.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
You like?

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
This planet's food
isn't all that bad, is it?

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
At any rate, I imagine those
humans must be surprised.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
Surely they wouldn't have
anticipated that I could use

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
my power to control
all of the Kiseichuu.

I mean, why would they?

00:06:55.582 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, dear?
Aren't you going to eat?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
No. I don't want it.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
I see. You're right, of course.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
This isn't the kind of meal
that's meant for us anyway.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
But, my darling, you don't have
to worry about that now.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
I'll go and prepare a proper
H-energy buffet for us.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
Those humans will
make perfect entrees.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
Here's the thing.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
I've realized that the reason
we've had to keep moving

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
from planet to planet is
because we keep eradicating

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
those planet's inhabitants.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
But if we isolate lots of
humans who have extremely high

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.253 position:50% align:center
amounts of H-energy,
we can keep them like cattle

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
so they'll continue supplying us
with that H-energy forever.

[CHACHA]
No. You can't.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let you do that!

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
No good... She wasn't kidding.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
This place really
is H-energy proof.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Damn it.
On top of everything,

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
we're out of cell range here.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Does that mean
there's nothing we can do?

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.074 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] No, it doesn't.
There's still a way.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA, RETTO]
Huh?

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
The problem is...

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
...it's a method that's
forbidden to use

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
at Saitama Branch.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
We are all going to have to do
what it takes no matter what.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
Wha--? No way,
you don't mean...?

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50% align:center
You can't ask me
to do that! I won't!

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
What's wrong with you, Enjo?!

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
This is an emergency.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
So if there's a way
to get it done,

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
then we have to do it,
whatever it is!

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
So? Tell us all about it.
What's the new plan?

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Simple.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
All of the members
are gonna have to do it.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
With each other.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
What the what?! Are you
being serious right now?!

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
It's the only way to
break through the wall.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
We'll have to unleash
our unexplored power!

[KIRARA]
Stop her, Shirayuki!

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
Help me out, here!

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

--[KIRARA] Huh?!

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.870 position:50% align:center
There's no choice!

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
I can't believe that
Chacha would betray us.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
There just has to be
more to it than that!

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
Our only hope to save her
is to break out of here now!

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
An escape room with
an orgy solution.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
Totally using that in a story.

Not you, too, Sora?!

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
You said you'd be
up for anything!

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
What is your deal?

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center
I know, but still...

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Oh, man. What do I do?!

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
If we keep going at this rate,
we're all gonna fall

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
right into Enjo's clutches.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA (YOUNGER)]
Oh, gimme a break.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center
Even I agree that's
an aggravating way

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
for Rett to collect H-energy.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
How about...

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA whimpers]
Listen, everyone!

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
You should really only do this
kind of thing with someone

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
you already have in mind.
I think the se--

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50% align:center
I mean, H-energy will
be better that way, too.

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
Therefore...

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
I say we turn off all the lights
so we won't know who's who.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
We'll accumulate H-energy using
the power of our fantasies.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
That's my condition.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Quick question.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center

to do this thing!

What's happening?

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.998 position:50% align:center
Has it already begun?

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.504 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Judging by how
big these breasts are.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
Or, how big they're not.

was it so smooth?

Now I just need to
search for my pants.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.175 position:50% align:center

a little better if I squint?

not collecting any H-energy,

just sitting here so
I thought I'd give you

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
a helpful little example!

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center

There you go again.

in here, so no one

then I suppose I should

convince me otherwise.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
I am a member of HXEROS!

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
Oh? Well, that's unfortunate.

Hxe White!

Hxe Blue!

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center

We are HXEROS, forever!

[CHACHA gasps]

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
There you are! I'm so sorry!

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
I swear, I don't know
why this happened!

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
You have to believe me!

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.607 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!
It seems you're back to normal!

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be okay now.
We're with you.

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.028 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA sobs]

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA growls] After I went
to the trouble of choosing

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
a kind way to deal with you.

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose this
calls for punishment.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
You took the words
out of my mouth!

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center

[MOGANA grunts]

The time has come for you
to surrender, Mother!

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
How fascinating...

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
You were strong enough to break
out of the H-energy-resistant

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
room after all, huh?

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
I've let you run free
because of your power.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.359 position:50% align:center
I can't afford that any longer.
And therefore...

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
--[gasping]
--Oh gosh, what was that noise?

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
Oh, that?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, it's just
a biological weapon

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
that our ancestor created.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
When I give it too much energy,
it becomes seriously engorged.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
Well, what're you waiting for?!

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
Get them!

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Really?!

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
[moaning]

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
What the hell is this?!

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
Are you guys all right?!

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'll be fine!

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA] I can see its
appetite hasn't diminished.

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be
a catastrophe if it got loose?

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
Do what you can, little ones.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
You guys, go after her!

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
--[BOTH gasp]
--[RETTO] But--

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
[SORA] Don't worry--we can
handle this ourselves!

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
She's right, we still have
H-energy left over from before.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
All right, then!

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
I swear we'll come back for you!

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
Pulse Echo Cannon!

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
We're still your opponents,
not them, you got that?

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
Woah, I guess that didn't work.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
[SORA] Seriously? The gear
doesn't work on this monster?

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
No, I guess not!
It's siphoning our energy!

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
Know what's weird?
It feels like the sea cucumbers!

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
You guys...

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.144 position:50% align:center
Remember what that queen said?

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
The more energy it absorbs...

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
...the bigger it gets!

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] I'm totally helpless
against this on my own.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
But, if we work together...

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
Ha...! Hey!

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
We can't lose against
a lust monster!

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
What is this? Why am I so hot?

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] It feels
like unlimited H-energy

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:45.839 position:50% align:center
is coursing through my body!

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
Yeah.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
It feels amazing!

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Now it's time for
HXEROS Beast Mode!

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA sighs] I don't get it.
What just happened?

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
It's crazy. Even our
suits couldn't handle

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
all that H-energy.

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
We're counting on you!

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
Stay safe, sweet friends!

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm sorry about before.
I mean, what happened.

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
I mean, you know what I mean.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
You better be!

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
I think you made us fall between
those beds on purpose!

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
Look, I already apologized!

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
And we both felt something,
you know it's true!

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA groans] You know,
there's some things

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
that are better left
unsaid, dumbass!

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Right, sorry...

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Hmph!

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
This is a surprise.

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.850 position:50% align:center
I didn't peg you as someone
who would come for me

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
all on your own.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA gasps]

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
What did you do? Tell me.

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
You may be aware.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
My major ability is to control
the minds of all Kiseichuu.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
However, that also applies
to creatures I've given

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
my blood to.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
Okay? So what does that mean?

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Huh? Oh, no, I can't move!

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
Hoshino, are you okay?

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
Wha...?!

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Stop it, Dark Kirara!

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
What the heck are you thinking?!

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
I mean, what are you
making me do?

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is perfect.

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
You've destroyed
so many of my sisters

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.016 position:50% align:center
in this wretched process.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
It's only fair that I take
this fresh, powerful H-energy

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
coursing through you
and use it to lay new eggs!

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Can't... breathe...

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
Aw, it seems you can't resist.

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
But of course. That's only
human nature, isn't it?

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA]
What do you think?

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
Becoming my cattle wouldn't
be the worst thing, would it?

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What do I do?

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
How do I help her
go back to normal?

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
At this rate, we'll be...

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.088 position:50% align:center
No, think!

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
All this time
we've been together.

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
Hoshino's weakness is...

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.929 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
It's not working. At all.

00:18:58.013 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA gasps]

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] I can't feel any
H-energy this way.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
Listen, one of your best points

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
is that you always take how
beautiful you are for granted.

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Enjo, what are you saying?

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] On the one hand,
you're strong and determined,

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
and on the other,
you're soft and sensitive.

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
You joined HXEROS even
when you didn't want to.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
You know. You're cute
even when you're blushing.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
But the best part is
occasionally getting to

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
see you smile because I know
that's who you really are!

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center
And that's why, right now,
more than ever,

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
I'm in love with--

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
Seriously?!
Will you just shut up?!

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Good, you're back.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
I was right. This is how
you're supposed to be.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA grunts] That was kind of
a rough way to make your point.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
[RETTO chuckles]

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA gasps]

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.234 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
All right, it's time, Hoshino.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
Let's go defeat her.

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
You and me, together!

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA] How dare you
interfere with my meal.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
You pathetic,
insignificant livestock!

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
I'm going to finish
you both right here!

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
This feeling...

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.128 position:50% align:center
I remember it.

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
That first day we fought.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Yeah. Let's do this.

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yell]

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
[MOGANA] Remarkable! I've never
felt H-energy like this!

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
I'm in love!

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50% align:center
Their fused H-energy is
more delicious than anything

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
I've ever had before!
It's perfection!

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
This is the H-energy source
we've been searching for!

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Wait, so, that means
it's over, doesn't it?

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
Our war, I mean?

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:00.260 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Yeah. I'm sure it is.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
So, that promise you made me.
It still stands, right?

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Huh?

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] You said that if
we defeated the Kiseichuu,

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
you would answer my proposal.

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] That's when
I'll give you my answer.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
Ugh-- C'mon, dude!
At a time like this?!

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
A time like what, Hoshino?!

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
The reason I've been able
to make it this far is because

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
I've leaned on that
thought for strength!

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA whimpers] But!
What about all the Kiseichuu

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
out there in other places?!
We gotta defeat them all!

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well...
Guess I can keep waiting.

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
What are you
grinning about now?!

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
Oh, I was just thinking that
maybe it wouldn't have been

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
so bad if I'd gotten to see you
blush a little bit longer.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's it! I am
so done being a hero!

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:47.849 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.359 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] Yeah, for a while there,
I didn't know what would happen!

00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.445 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, all the
charges were dropped.

00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:26.072 position:50% align:center
And HXEROS
is back together again!

00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:27.574 position:50% align:center
I can't wait!

00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:30.702 position:50% align:center
Oh, and I'll obviously have
to improve those XERO suits.

00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:32.537 position:50% align:center
--Great!
--I'd like to help!

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.039 position:50% align:center
Aw, thank you so much.

00:23:34.122 --> 00:23:36.041 position:50% align:center
[ANNO]
Mm! [giggles]

00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:39.419 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Huh? What's the matter?

00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:41.463 position:50% align:center
Did someone use
all her H-energy?

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:44.090 position:50% align:center
--Huh?! Why would you say that?!
--[MOMOKA] I knew it!

00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:46.176 position:50% align:center
Momoka, stop!
Please leave her alone!

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:47.844 position:50% align:center
--There they go again.
--[laughs]

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:49.179 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Did it tickle?

00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:50.430 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Would you cut it
out you total pervert?

00:23:50.513 --> 00:23:52.015 position:50% align:center
--What is wrong with you?!
--[RETTO chuckles]
