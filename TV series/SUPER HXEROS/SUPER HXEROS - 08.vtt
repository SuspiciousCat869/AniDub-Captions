get something straight.

I was only acting like that to
see what you guys would do!

I'll always love you no matter
which one you are, Kirara!

the real me before, don't you?

bug the hell out of me!

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] I'm not sure
if that's what caused

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.019 position:50% align:center
the hallucinations
to start, but...

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:09.606 position:50% align:center

I don't know how or why.

But a younger version of myself
that used to only appear

following me around.

The worst part is, she insists
on giving running commentary.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
By the way.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
This whole
"Dark Kirara" thing.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
In my opinion, it sounds
a little too dramatic.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
Uh, can't you think of
anything cuter to call me?

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.388 position:50% align:center
You're a shadow from my past
I wish I could forget about.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center

Oh, this?

This style fits a mischievous
imp who causes trouble.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Yeah, well, it gives me
second-hand embarrassment!

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
Considering my appearance
is a manifestation

is all your fault.

for ignoring me.

I understand.

under a lot of stress lately.

acting kinda weird.

nothing outta the ordinary.

landed more dramatically!

you with an example?

collapsed into Ret's arms

she's not here.

worry about that.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center

Ya know, the repressed one.

I'm guessing you mean Hoshino.

And no. She and I
are not seeing each other.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
You had me all worried
there for a second!

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
I can show you my panties

how she rejected you!

call it that in Saitama?

We've done far more
embarrassing things

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:15.805 position:50% align:center
to each other.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Could you not?

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
In case you forgot,
Enjo's on our team!

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center
So stop trying to recruit him
to your branch!

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
Don't get worked up.

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
I know for a fact you're not his
girlfriend or anything.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
And based on the strait-laced
way you're dressed.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
I bet you're not
even his H-friend.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
H-friend?

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
The redhead is mine.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
He's the only one who
makes me feel anything

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
and I'm not passing that up.

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.624 position:50% align:center
What the hell does that mean?

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:44.959 position:50% align:center
Bye for now, Blondie.

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:51.716 position:50% align:center
[school bells chiming]

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
This is delicious.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA snarls]

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
From out of the shadows, an
unexpected rival has appeared.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
Getting a leg up on
the competition, huh?

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
--Shut up.
--Y'know...

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
Since you're
living in the same house,

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
you have an advantage over her.
Plus, an ace up your sleeve.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
What do you mean ace?

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:27.127 position:50% align:center
Steal his XERO gear then
take what you want from him.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
Now that I've got
this off of you,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
looks like someone's
completely at my mercy.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
How does it feel being
overpowered by

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.679 position:50% align:center
the strength of a real woman?

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps, whimpers]

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center
Stop fighting and
give in to your desires.

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
Because,
if you keep resisting me...

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
...I'll be forced to eat you up.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
[RETTO moans, sighs]

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
Please. Like I would
imagine something like that.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
Your blushing's giving you away.

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
Ret's taking a bath!

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect opportunity
to make your move!

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
The snack's right in
front of you, so take a bite.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
You're gonna let some total
strange steal Ret away from you.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Of course not.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
But no way am I
gonna force myself on him.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
I'll walk in and pretend
I thought it was empty.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
But that's as far as I go!

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
Welp.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll take a completely
unplanned leisurely bath!

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Stop struggling already
and lemme put it in my mouth!

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] I said it was okay
just that one time!

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.902 position:50% align:center
Hey! I thought
I heard voices in here--

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA whimpers]

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
Anyway, just what the hell
were you two doing?

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.034 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Get away from him, Kirara!

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.874 position:50% align:center
[RETTO roars]

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA yelps, gasps]

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.753 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?!

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
Enjo!

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.050 position:50% align:center
[moans]
Stop it!

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
No!

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggling]

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA growls]

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
I said enough!

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
No means no!

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.903 position:50% align:center
Did you girls hear
something just now?

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing it was Kirara
punching Ret after he

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50% align:center
peeked at her taking a bath.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
So the usual.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
No worries, then?

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA panting]
You just lost all my respect!

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
It's not what you think, Kirara!

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
What happened here
wasn't Retto's fault.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
That was "Beast Mode"?

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Yeah.

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
I don't have all the
details yet, but I guess,

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
when Chacha bites me,
I lose all reason and turn into

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
some sex-crazed demon.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.058 position:50% align:center
That must be what
happened with the girl

00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:49.310 position:50% align:center
from Tokyo Branch before.

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
Now she's convinced
I'm the best person

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
to supply her with H-energy.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
Which is more than
a little awkward.

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] So I guess that kinda
explains what happened with her.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I'm so sorry, Hoshino!

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
I don't remember what I did,
but I'm betting it was not okay!

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] All right, Kirara,
cut him some slack.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
You just walked in at
a really unfortunate time.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
It's forbidden!

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.838 position:50% align:center
This "Beast Mode"
is too dangerous.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:19.382 position:50% align:center
Losing all sense of
reason is not an option.

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Right! I agree!

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
See? I told you, Chacha!

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.679 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
I'm sorry.

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to draw out more
powerful H-energy, that's all.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
What a huge waste, right?

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
But being ravaged by a Ret who's
lost his senses is kinda lame.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
You're gross.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Did you say something?

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
Nope! Sure didn't!

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center
There, Chacha.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
You're nice and dry now.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gulps]

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:50.580 position:50% align:center
Quit gawking, you perv! [sobs]

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.083 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
H-Energy Drink!

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
Give the beast inside you
an erotic boost!

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Do you want power?

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Answer me. Do you want power?

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I guess.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
If you truly do want power,

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
then obey your
physiological responses.

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Is that all?

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
No, wait!

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
Stop!

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA groaning]

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
What's going on with you, Retto?

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
Your tossing and turning was
rougher than usual last night.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Stop crawling into my bed,

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center
or people will get
the wrong idea!

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
That's strange.

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
What's an "H-energy Drink"?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
Crap, I'm running late!

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
Is there anything to eat?

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
Wait, do you mind if
I just take that?

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
Nope, go ahead!

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Thanks.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
Hmm?

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA giggling]

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
Well, good morning.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
You're in a good mood.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA giggles] I am! Because
headquarters just sent us

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
a free sample!

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
It's called an H-energy Drink.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
And supposedly, it will totally
replenish your H-energy levels.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
Uh? What? Where is it?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
Yeah, Retto took it with him.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
What the hell?!

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
[school bells chiming]

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Man, I'm so thirsty.

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Want one?

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Murasame?

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
Uh, thanks.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center
Seeing you around a lot.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
Oh! I just happened to swing by
after a Kiseichuu extermination!

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.972 position:50% align:center
Why do I get the feeling
you don't have friends?

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Uh! Of course I do!

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
I mean, first, there're
the three members

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center
of the Tokyo Branch.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
And then, um...

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have asked.

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Shut up! I have more!

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
For one. I have an H-friend.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.405 position:50% align:center
What are you blushing about?

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
What is this stuff?

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
It tastes weird.

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
You say that after
swiping someone's drink?

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
Here, you can have some.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
It's fine! You can finish it!

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.754 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Jeez, just have some!

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] But that's
an indirect kiss, right?

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Well, what are you
two doing, sneaking around?

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.469 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi, Hoshino!

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
Dang. We were
getting to the good part.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
We were debating
whether this weirdo juice

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
tasted funny or not.

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
Sure, that's what you say,
but I bet you were actually

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
trying to do something gross.

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
No, I'm serious.

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
If you don't believe me,
have a swig.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.903 position:50% align:center
Fine. I'll do it
if it shuts you up.

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
What's the issue?
It's pretty good.

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
Yeah? You think?

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
That's cool.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO growls]

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hmm?

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
[hiccups]
Oh, yeah, by the way.

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center
I heard that you joined
HXEROS recently, right?

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
As a veteran,
I could teach you a few tricks

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
about H-energy if you like.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
[hiccups]
No, thanks. Not interested.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
I don't need your help
to be any better than you.

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
[hiccups] Interesting. Wanna put
your money where your mouth is?

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
[hiccups]
Thought you would never ask.

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] What the heck?
They're both acting so weird.

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap. Is it this?

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
This should be fun.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
A karaoke showdown.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO hiccups]
This sofa is so soft. [hiccups]

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:26.504 position:50% align:center
It's like the most comfortable
couch that was ever made!

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA hiccups]
Oh, man.

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
Did it get really hot in here,
or is it just me?

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
Well. I think I'm gonna
go grab something to drink.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
You want anything?

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
I'll have a soda!

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
Yeah, bring me iced tea!

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
Strong, please!

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
So what's the name of the game?

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe
this is what you want.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.401 position:50% align:center
Karaoke, my butt.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO hiccups] Oh, you saw
right through that one, did you?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
Since we're HxEROS...

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
...the decider is H-energy.

00:17:56.576 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
With this, we'll be able to tell
how much has been accumulated.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Whoever gives Retto the most
H-energy is the winner.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
How about that?

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
Sure! You're on!

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
a solid plan to me!

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah, do it,
big Kirara! [hiccups]

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
Drinks are served.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
Gah!

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
[hiccups]
Well, what do you think?

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] These days,
cosplay's being used as a way

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
to enhance karaoke.

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think I've heard that.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.199 position:50% align:center
[RETTO chuckles]

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
But enough with the karaoke!

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center
Am I right?

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
We should take advantage of the
private room and have some fun!

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
Oh, but I kinda wanted to sing.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you're
more interested in karaoke

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
than you are in me?

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
That's not what I meant!

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's
what you wanna do,

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:55.343 position:50% align:center
then we'll just
sing together, okay?

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
Come on. You should
lean in a little further.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
But we're so close already!

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
That's okay, 'cause if
we're too far apart,

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
then you won't
accumulate any H-energy.

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
I don't care
about that right now.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO hiccups]

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
One, two, and go!

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.950 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA growls]

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA growls]

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Ah...

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Hey, Enjo. Why don't
you try using this mic?

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hoshino!

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO growls]

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
Go on. Sing from right here.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?!

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
And, hey, if you wanna
accumulate even more

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
of the good stuff,
I can always put something else

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
between my legs!

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
No, don't you dare!

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.286 position:50% align:center
That was my idea!

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
[RETTO whimpering]

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hey. Wait a minute.

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
Is this because of
the H-energy Drink?

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I refuse to lose!

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:31.815 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:44.661 position:50% align:center
[alarm beeping]

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
Um. I can't remember
what I was doing?

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
Ow. My head really hurts.
And what am I wearing?

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you
responsible for this?

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
Don't ask me. I have no idea.

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
Damn. She's a tough rival, huh?

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
Ugh. What an awful experience.

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
--[KIRARA (YOUNGER) giggles]
--[KIRARA] You!

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.575 position:50% align:center
You knew what
was going on, didn't you?

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?
How could I?

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
I only know what you know,
so that doesn't make sense!

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
My knowledge comes straight
from your head and nowhere else.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
Oh. Guess that's true.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
Plus... It's not like
I'm your enemy or anything.

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
Can't we just get along?

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
No way, forget it!

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA (YOUNGER) whines]

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
Why did you suddenly appear to
me like this in the first place?

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] I thought I sealed
that part of me away

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
deep inside my mind.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
Did you just ask why?

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:58.318 position:50% align:center
I guess you must've
forgotten, then.

00:21:58.401 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Hmm?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
The big promise
you made that day.

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:05.033 position:50% align:center
What promise?

00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:07.035 position:50% align:center
You seriously blocked that out?

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:10.413 position:50% align:center
I've come here to get me
and Ret together, duh!

00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:11.998 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Huh...?

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:17.003 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA (YOUNGER) giggles]

00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:48.970 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Super HXEROS!
