Two Kiraras?

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.517 position:50% align:center
You're standing
right in front of me,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.060 position:50% align:center
yet I can hardly believe it.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA giggles]

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.732 position:50% align:center
But how do we know
you're an actual Kiseichuu?

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:26.735 position:50% align:center
Not just some secret twin
who's playing dress up?

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Go ahead and show him.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
Your wish is my command!

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] Uh. You certainly do
seem to be the real deal.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
Told ya!

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
I'm glad she's here,
but we should still be careful.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] Hmm. Then I'll run
some tests immediately.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.678 position:50% align:center
She'll have to be quarantined.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Wait!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Is there any way we could skip

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.767 position:50% align:center
the "holding her
in isolation" part?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center
--[BOTH] Uhh...
--[KIRARA] I thought... maybe...

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.189 position:50% align:center
...I could show her a bit of
what Earth is actually like.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
No big deal, right?

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid it's
not quite that simple.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
She may appear friendly,
but looks can be deceiving.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.448 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Well, there's something
else important you should know!

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.325 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] It just so happens
that her biological makeup

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.119 position:50% align:center
is completely different
than any other Kiseichuu!

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
[ANNO]
Oh?

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.664 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Which means if we
keep her in close proximity,

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
we may be able to build up
more H-energy than

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
we ever have before!

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.086 position:50% align:center
Sounds good to me!

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.253 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.214 position:50% align:center
[SORA]

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
Owie, that one was painful.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.723 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA screams] What the hell
is wrong with you?!

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:41.393 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] You know.
She kinda reminds me of Retto.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.645 position:50% align:center
Yeah? In what way?

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:44.896 position:50% align:center
[ANNO]
Hmm...

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] In that case,
it might be in our best interest

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.695 position:50% align:center
for her to stay under
your watch for now.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.988 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] You may take her home
with you for the night.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.116 position:50% align:center
--[CHACHA chuckles]
--[ANNO] But in return,

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.827 position:50% align:center
we'll be expecting your
full cooperation, Chacha.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.869 position:50% align:center
Give us all you've got.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.621 position:50% align:center
You can count on me!

[TORIKOE] Episode Six:
"New Roommate?"

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
You awake?

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
Finally...

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
The two of us are all alone.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Anyway, we'd better get up.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Easy, tiger.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
Looks like you can't keep
your hands to yourself.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Well. If that's
how it's gonna be...

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
...I guess I'll let you
have some fun.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
But only 'cause it's you.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Wait. Slow down!

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.591 position:50% align:center
Where do you think you're--?

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Time out!
I can't do this anymore!

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Did I do something wrong?

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
You were into it a second ago.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
No way. Think again!

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Uh?

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA squeals] I'm pretty sure
I told you not to mimic anyone

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
who lives here!

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.527 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Everybody's
off limits except for Runba!

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Oh, right. Sorry 'bout that.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
Besides, didn't we already beat
the Kiseichuu back there?

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
I don't see the point
in hoarding up H-energy.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
It's like I told you.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
Until we defeat my mother,
my sisters'll keep on doing

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
their whole "destroy
all mankind" thing.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
And like you said,
you need me, right?

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50% align:center
You were pretty passionate
about that. Hmm?

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Well, yeah. I suppose so.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Aw, sheesh. That girl
is way too shy for her own good.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
I just want
me and my abilities

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50% align:center
to be useful to them is all.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
Hey, Chacha.
Did you sleep okay?

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Oh, yeah. It's him.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
The male human
who rescued me yesterday!

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Okidokies!

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
Then it's high time I return the
favor for this brave wonder boy!

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Your name's Retto, huh?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
Tell me. Where does
your H-energy come from?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
Uh. To be honest with you,

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50% align:center
I never really thought
about it that much.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
I sorta notice it when it
starts building up, and, uh...

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Hmm... I see.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
Looks like I'll have to help you
find out the source.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Whoa.

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
What the heck happened?

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
I fused our senses, duh!

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
Kirara doesn't like it
when I mimic you,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
so I figured this was
the next best thing!

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I can't move.

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
I can't do anything!

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
I had no choice.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
As soon as you humans feel
embarrassed about something,

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.084 position:50% align:center
I've noticed you get super
awkward and evasive.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
This obviously calls
for a more direct approach,

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:19.963 position:50% align:center
so here I go!

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
[RETTO yells]

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] It begins.
I'll search this room first.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
[RETTO groans]

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Another female!
What's this one called?

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Maihime Shirayuki.

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
She's definitely the quietest
and most mature person

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center
in this house. Like, by far.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
[yells]
You're that monster!

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.655 position:50% align:center
Wh-What do you want?

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
She threw her guard up so fast!

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
Talk about defensive.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
Aww! C'mere, cutie!

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Wh-What's with the goo-goo eyes?

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
this side of her before!

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME] What's that? You came
to play with little ol' me?

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] I'm in limbo, but I
can still sense everything.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
So soft.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
It's like she's holding
me in her bosom!

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Oh no, I'm in danger.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
All this petting is gonna
make me start feeling funny!

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Huh? So what you're saying is,

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
you still need me
to kick it up a notch?

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center
What, the--? Ah...
You're frisky just like Runba.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
You've been staring
at me pretty intensely.

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
I'm becoming self-conscious.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
Wait a doggone minute!

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
What are you about
to do with our body?

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
No, don't!

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME moans]

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
What was that?

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
It was different from Runba,
that's for sure.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
What Hoshino said was true.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
Chacha's special ability.

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
It's authentically arousing!

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME panting]

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Oopsie, I messed up.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
I was trying to gauge
Retto's energy limits.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
But somehow ended up
pushing Princess Pooch-lover

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
over the edge instead.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] No way. I could feel
my tongue touching her ni--

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
Her ni--!

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
Human beings
certainly are strange

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
and fascinating creatures.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
an animal that can get turned on

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
from doing random
activities that have

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center
nothing to do with reproduction.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.465 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Fascinating.
On to the next room!

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA] Need something?
You kinda caught me

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.179 position:50% align:center
in the middle of doing
my beauty stretches.

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I can help
with those if you want!

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
No doubt you've got another type

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
of stretching in mind.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
Well, you already barged in,

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
so the least you
can do is spot me.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
However. It's gotta be under
one condition, ya hear?

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Huh?

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Is this okay?

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
It's perfect!

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted to
know how stacked I'd look

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
with a supremely
bodacious figure!

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
You don't know
what this means to me!

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Yikes, does she have it rough.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] There we go.
Nice and relaxing.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Not gonna lie.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
It's odd to be
massaging a girl while

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
I'm also in a woman's body.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.
She's so vulnerable.

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA moaning]

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Gosh it's hot.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure why,
but I'm starting to burn up.

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:24.147 position:50% align:center
That's disturbing.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
Why is she acting
like she's possessed?

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
Don't ask me, I
haven't even done anything yet.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Maybe it's 'cause
this stuff rubbed off on her!

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Your sweat has
the same weird effect?

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.659 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
On second thought.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:39.913 position:50% align:center
I found a better
technique we can try.

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
Will you do these massages, too?

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
Pressure points
to up my cup size?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Oh...

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Right there!

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sora, whatcha
doin' there? Let's play!

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Aww! Could you
at least knock first?

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:05.522 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Hmm? Why, are you
trying to keep secrets in here?

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
I don't know what you mean.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Come on, you're totally
covering up whatever that is.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
[SORA] I don't appreciate
the accusation.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop intruding!

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
You're making her
feel uncomfortable!

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Ah...

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
No, look away!

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Maihime, Momoka, and Sora.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
But the last and most
important aura I need

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
to inspect is Kirara's.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Fine, I give up!

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.473 position:50% align:center
I'm going to tell
you everything now.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
You've won already.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
You can stop snooping around
and traumatizing the girls.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
I was playing the fool
when you asked me

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
what fueled my H-energy.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
Honestly. It's the way
I feel about Hoshi--

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Oh, hey! I knew I'd find you!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
in here anyway?

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Not much. I'm taking a bath.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
You know what those are from
our TV shows, don't you?

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
Oh, so that's
what that thing is!

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] Do you want
to take one together?

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Wha--?!

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA sighs]
This is incredible.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
I've wanted to try it
for the longest time!

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
Listen, if you wanna
use your old form that's fine.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
But you can't let anyone
outside of this house see you.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.810 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Chacha's body or not,
I can't believe I'm actually

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
sitting here taking
a bath with Hoshino!

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
Wait, Chacha, what are
you doing get out of the bath?!

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why, something wrong?

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
We can't let your
sweat touch anyone, remember?

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
You have to get
out of there now!

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
I have to go.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
I feel kind of...

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hoshino!

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
Okay, here's your chance.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh?

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA] Well. You're in love
with her, aren't you?

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Oh. What makes you say that?

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
If you pick up where
I left off this morning,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
then I bet you'll both
accumulate enough H-energy

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
to last you a while.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
Kill two birds with one stone.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA gasps, moans]

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Wait. What're you gonna do?

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
Stop! I can't!

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Huh? Ret? Is that you?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
No! I refuse to do it this way!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I want to...

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
Of course I do, but
only if it happens honestly

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
between the two of us!

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
Because my feelings
for her are genuine.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
Not just a way to
collect H-energy!

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
Crap, I'm back!

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.030 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
A fascinating human.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.573 position:50% align:center
And impressive!

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.451 position:50% align:center
He must have firm resolve and
powerful H-energy to be able

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
to forcibly shut
down my mimicry!

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA snarls]

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.415 position:50% align:center
[Now I get it.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
Looks like you and Chacha
are in cahoots, huh?

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:14.544 position:50% align:center
No, please listen!

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
I swear, I can explain!

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
Wait, what are you doing?

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
This?

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.382 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right!

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
Thanks to what
happened yesterday,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
I can finally wield
this properly.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
So, you might
wanna prepare yourselves.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
[BOTH whimpering]

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
[RETTO screams]

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
[KAIKOCHUU]
Kaikou number one.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
Kaikochuu.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
[KAIKOCHUU]
It's now been one full week

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
since the Queen went missing.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
[KAIKOCHUU] But...
Our objective remains the same

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
regardless of whether the
Queen is here with us or not!

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
[KAIKOCHUU] And that is
the decline of the human race.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
You just watch, Your Majesty.

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
[KAIKOCHUU] As we maintain
our diligence and focus...

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:05.261 position:50% align:center
...until that glorious
day when you return to us.

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
I don't have
a problem with silkworm moths...

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
...but you sure
bug the hell out of me!

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
What the heck?

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50% align:center
[KAIKOCHUU] I would suggest
you not forget this, HxEros.

00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
We still have many
other comrades who have

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
successfully infiltrated
human society.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA gasps]

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
You're too slow!

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Sorry! Trying!

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.549 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you okay?

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But what is all
this sticky stuff though?

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
I'm not super sure,
but I bet it's something yucky.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
Uh? Are you feeling all right?

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Regression?

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
[ANNO]
Yes, infantile regression.

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
It's a state that occurs when
outside stress causes a person

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.903 position:50% align:center
to mentally revert to childhood.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
It would appear that
this alien is responsible

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:10.618 position:50% align:center
for the recent rash of
infantile regression cases.

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] But... How can
we change her back?

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] Well, other patients
who were afflicted

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.958 position:50% align:center
have already recovered.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
She should be back to her old
self in less than 24 hours.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.172 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Thank goodness.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Maybe she shouldn't
go to school tomorrow.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
What?

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
Come on, no fair!
I don't wanna miss any class!

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
[CHACHA]
Really? Why not?

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
I have a perfect
attendance record,

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center
for one thing.
More than that, though.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
I like it when Ret gets
all red in the face and squirmy.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.234 position:50% align:center
He's so fun to watch.

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]
That's right, I forgot!

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
This is exactly how
Hoshino used to be!

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:50.909 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
And once she gets started,

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
there's nothing
I can do to stop her.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
What's up, Retto?!

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
Wow, look at you,
running so fast.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize how much
you missed us, pretty boy.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Can't stop to talk!
See you guys later!

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
The heck's
going on with him today?

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
There's still plenty of time
left before the bell rings.

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center
Weird.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center

I thought we were gonna
walk to school together!

No, I told you not to follow me!

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
Hold on.
Was that Hoshino just now?

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:28.780 position:50% align:center
No way. That just
couldn't have been her.

Damn it!

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
What the hell happened
between Retto and Hoshino?

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
Think, Date.

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
We all went to the same
elementary school, right?

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I guess we did, why?

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
What does that have
to do with any of this?

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
There's something
about the way they're acting.

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
It reminds me of the way
they were back then.

00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
Aw, man! Just a little more,
and I could see...

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] What are you
looking at, you perv?!

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
And you, Kirara.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center

and close your legs!

the locker room!

What the heck are
these humans, anyway?

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
All right everyone,
I want you to partner up

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
and start stretching!

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Oh, man, I have
a bad feeling about this.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ret! Be my stretch buddy!

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I knew it!

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.140 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Listen, we don't
need to be this close!

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Come on! Stretch!

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
This sensation.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
I've felt it before.

Hmm? Wearing what?

[RETTO]
Sorry, Miss!

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
Hoshino's skinned her knee,
so I'm gonna take her

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
to the infirmary!

Hoshino.

Can, you tell me what happened
to your underwear?

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
Underwear? I've got panties on.

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:08.421 position:50% align:center

Not that! The top part!

00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
With boobies like these, I guess
I should wear something.

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center
Well, for now, just improvise

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
with these bandages, okay?
Please, it's embarrassing.

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA chuckles]
I don't get it.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Why should you feel that way
when my shirt is the one

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
that's see-through, silly?

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
I mean, you've gotta be
embarrassed too, right?

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Nuh-uh. So why are you?

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Is it 'coz you don't
want anyone else to see

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
and want to keep my
boobies to yourself?

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.076 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
That's not it.

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
Well, if you're
not gonna tell me the truth,

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
then I'm just gonna go
back to class like this.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Fine, I'll tell you,
just don't go anywhere!

I don't really have
a good explanation for this.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
But I just can't stand
the thought of other boys

Now, please wrap yourself
up in these bandages.

I'll let you do it, too.

let me do whatever I want?

state, she might really let me.

No! What am I thinking?

get something straight.

to see what you guys would do!

I've certainly noticed
that you humans don't like
