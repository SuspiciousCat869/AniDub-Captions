00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
Nice. Why all
of a sudden, though?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.896 position:50% align:center
[ANNO]
Good question.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
For some reason or other--
and believe me,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
your guess is as good as mine--

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
headquarters is rewarding
your hard work with

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
a fancy-schmancy
overnight beach trip.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.825 position:50% align:center
Hold on. While we're
gone, they might...

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
...kidnap Chacha!

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
Nah. Chacha has been a boon

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
to the Saitama Branch,
so no worries there.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
I think she'll be just fine.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
Oh, good.

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
In fact, since Chacha
and Runba are guarding

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
the fort right now, you all
should take this opportunity

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
to let your hair down.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.940 position:50% align:center

[ANNO] Well, I'll be back
to pick you up tomorrow.

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
Try to have fun until then.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
I'll see ya later.

Ohh... [giggles]

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
We're here!

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.231 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
there's a beach like this

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
so close to the city!

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
Hadakana Beach, huh?

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of it.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
But I guess it's a pretty
popular tourist spot.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
Interesting. According to this,

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
Hadakana is actually the
country's first nude beach.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
Wait. The country's first what?

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
But the weirdest thing is,

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
there's nobody else here
as far as I can see.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Nice!

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
It's like our own
private beach, then!

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
Yes! First one in
gets dinner on the house!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
And they don't
even have to share!

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait!

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
What? You guys
are cheating. How rude!

Don't worry,
I can get our towels laid out.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
Why don't you go ahead
and get in the water?

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Thanks, Maihime!

Oh! That's right.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
I should put sunblock
on before I forget!

Ah!

[MOMOKA giggles, laughs]
When you come to the beach,

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
you have to taste the salt
at least once or twice!

It could be a... sea cucumber.

But I've never
seen this kind before.

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
How can you stand to
touch something so grotesque?

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
[SORA] It's not poisonous
or harmful. Relax.

I'm sorry,
but how is this harmless?

must be an unusual one.

can't go back in that water!

a shame, coming here without

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center

It's been so long
since I've had guests.

longer than it used to.

No!

We were expecting to hang
out at the beach a lot longer,

to come back early.

Our apologies for arriving
ahead of schedule.

all of you went out to
the beach by yourselves.

I'm sure you were
met with a nasty surprise.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center

was more than nasty.

I'm not sure, but I assume

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.421 position:50% align:center
you're referring to the

it's just what we've
been calling them.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center

of cucumber suddenly appeared

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
in droves over the summer.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
I had them exterminated,

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
but they kept coming back.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
People have stopped
going to the beach,

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
which is killing my business.

I hate to say this
because I know

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
it's frustrating, but I don't
recommend going back

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
in the water for the rest
of your visit here.

treat the area today.

be weird or anything,

I shake your hand?

before doing it, huh?

I don't know.

Could be just
a weird coincidence.

I'm not sure about that.

It's possible.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
So, hey.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
Did Retto Enjo not
come with you or what?

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center
[MOENA]
Huh.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
One of our members
is missing, too.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
[TOMA] Oh, thank goodness,
there you are!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.281 position:50% align:center
[MOENA gasps]

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Wait, hold on a sec.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
You two were off
somewhere together?

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
[YONA]
Yoo-hoo, Enjo.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
What are you guys doing here?

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
HQ send you, too?

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
You haven't explained
the sitch to him yet?

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
I've heard all
about you, Retto Enjo.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
My name's Yona Ichogi.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
Unofficial coordinator
of the Tokyo Branch.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
And this our sweet
resident femme boy.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:58.682 position:50% align:center
Toma Taiga.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
[YONA] I heard these two
caused you some trouble

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.854 position:50% align:center
when they went off
on their own. Sorry.

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
It's no big deal.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] Well, since it looks
like we're all here now,

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
let's get going,
Saitama Branch members.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
[MOENA sniffing]

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
Whaddya think, Moena?

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
[MOENA] Hmm. Hard to tell with
the smell of the seawater,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
but I don't think there
are any Kiseichuu nearby.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
According to some
of these local reports,

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
several people actually sighted
Kiseichuu-like creatures

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
while they were trying to
exterminate the sea cucumbers.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] Then all we can do now
is wipe these suckers out

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
till the Kiseichuu appear.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Kiseichuu here?

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
The heck is going on?

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
Hard to say,

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
but going by their
investigation,

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
aliens are here,
hiding out on this beach.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
They use those sea cucumbers
to drive people away.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
As usual, they go with
the most complicated plan.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
After listening
to that poor innkeeper,

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
we can't just do
nothing, you know?

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
I think we should help out, too.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
So. Do you girls know
how we can kill these things?

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
[giggling]

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
[MOENA chuckles]

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Gross! What are you doing?

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
What you wanted?

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
Exterminating.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
The annoying thing about
these is the way they squirt,

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
but if they lose a
certain amount of fluid,

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
they become flaccid
and can't move anymore.

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.107 position:50% align:center
The plan is to
do this till the Kiseichuu

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
get mad and show up.
Then we exterminate them.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
So, are you thinkin'
you'll help us out or what?

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
Well, I didn't know it
would mean we'd be doing that!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
Do I have to help, too?

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:46.623 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
Sorry. I'll try to be gentle.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.502 position:50% align:center
'Kay, gonna bite the bullet.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
Hey. What are you thinking?

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking we should probably
take them out to dinner

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center
or something first.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Weenie.

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're with HxEROS?

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
I'll tell ya right now,

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.766 position:50% align:center
half-assed members
will be punished!

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
Uh, maybe we should do
this somewhere else, instead.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
Right behind ya.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
[NAMACHUU]
Nama.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
[NAMACHUU]
Never mind the namaste.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.200 position:50% align:center
I'm Namachuu.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
[sighs] This gender ratio's
a little outta balance, huh?

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you decided
to come along, Toma.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
[TOMA] Guess our teams are
mostly female 'cause they feel

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
pleasure more intensely than us.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
I hope we'll be okay
this far apart from them.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
I mean, what would happen if
a Kiseichuu suddenly appeared?

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
It was unintentional,
but earlier on...

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
...I built up enough H-energy
to fight at least one.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
Then the rumors
about you are true.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.232 position:50% align:center
I was wondering if
I could ask a favor.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.526 position:50% align:center
I want you to
become my coach, Enjo!

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gulps]

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
[TOMA] Murasame and
Wakakusa mostly go on

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
missions by themselves.
I feel like it's my fault.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
Y'see, my H-energy is
a little different from theirs.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.040 position:50% align:center
I can't seem to collect any,
so I just end up

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
getting in the way.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.710 position:50% align:center
I used to believe
I'd always be a burden

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
on my teammates. But then--

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center
I heard about this incredible
HERO from Saitama

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
who can feel H-energy
no matter the situation!

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
And ever since then,
you have been my idol!

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.350 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I guess that's a compliment.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
Not to sound desperate,
but I was hoping you could share

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
the trick to building
up H-energy!

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center
Trick? I wish there was one.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
The thing is, Toma, it's not
like I'm trying to collect it.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I figured.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry if I weirded you out.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
Nah. I completely
understand wanting to do

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
whatever it takes
to protect your team.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
[TOMA gasps]

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] And, since we're both
members of HxEROS,

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
I'll find a way to help you.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
Before that,
just between us guys.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
Tell me what helps you
build up your H-energy.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
What? But talkin' bout that
sorta thing's embarrassing.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
How bad can it be?

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
When it comes to mine, I've got
stories you wouldn't believe.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, the truth is--

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS screaming]

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
Ah! It sounds like...

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
...the girls are in trouble!

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS moaning]

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
They're covered in cucumbers!

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
[NAMACHUU laughs]

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
[TOMA]
A Kiseichuu?

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
[NAMACHUU] Don't tell me you
didn't see this coming, humans.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
If you wish to molest my pets,

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
expect them to pay
you back in kind.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
[NAMACHUU] The more sensitive
the spot they attach to,

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
the more H-energy they drain.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center
[moaning]

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
[NAMACHUU] I wonder
how long it'll take before

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
you're sucked completely dry.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
[RETTO growls]

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
I'm going to wring out
your H-energy like

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
a wet sponge, the same way
I did with the other guests.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] Damn it.
I'm too weak to fight back.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
Kirara. Surely,
this isn't enough to drain

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
your endless
reservoirs of H-energy!

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
Even I have my limits,

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
and with these slimy
grubs all over me,

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
I can't feel a thing!

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
Toma. Come here a sec.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
Ah. What's up?

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
The plan's for me to go
out and attack the Kiseichuu,

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
while you tear those
sea-cucumbers off the girls.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
Right. I've got it.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:18.835 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Strange.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center
That scene should've
charged me up,

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
but I'm not detecting
any H-energy.

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
Uh, Coach... Watch your back!

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.510 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap!

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
It appears my little
suckers have found

00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
more humans hiding nearby.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.266 position:50% align:center
You have no right to touch him!

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
You're not really hurt, are you?

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.394 position:50% align:center
I think I'll live.

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
The thing is, they sapped most
of the energy I had built up.

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.610 position:50% align:center
I won't be able to knock
her out with one punch now.

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
Step up, Toma.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
You have to save everyone!

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
Wait, me?

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
But my training's
not finished yet!

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
It's either that,
or we help each other

collect H-energy.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
Which is plausible.

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
So. Option A, then.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Also, we didn't get
to finish our conversation.

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
I wanted to say, whatever
form your H-energy takes.

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
I'll help you build it.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center
We're on different teams,

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
but we're still
colleagues, aren't we?

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
You bet, Coach.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
[TOMA]
He's right.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
I can't keep running forever.

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
You humans are
braver than I thought,

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
coming out of
hiding on your own.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
It's go time.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
Hope whatever you've
got up your sleeve is good.

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
Remember what
you asked me, Coach?

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
What it takes for me
to build up my H-Energy?

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but you never
told me how you were

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
planning on accumulating it.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
It's this.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
[TOMA] You wanted to know
what it takes.

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
[moaning]

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
[TOMA]
I like to watch.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
My H-energy comes from
an onlooker's appreciation!

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
Watch where you're
putting your hands!

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Toma was the one who pushed me!

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
[TOMA]
Coach has such perfect form.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
The way he landed
dead center,

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.441 position:50% align:center
right in the middle
of their bodies.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:06.860 position:50% align:center
[TOMA]
I thought this would help,

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
but it's more stimulating
than I could've imagined!

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
Something is swelling up
deep within me.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna burst!

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
What? That beam!

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me that...

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
...you're all... from HxEROS?

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.421 position:50% align:center
Just... my luck...

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] I never thought
I'd see the day when Toma

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
would defeat a Kiseichuu.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
I have to say, you did good,
Saitama Branch.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot for helping us
out there today, really.

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
[YONA] I'd like to do something
to show our gratitude.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
[MOENA] You're such
a generous person, Yona.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
[YONA]
I know!

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
Why don't you come
visit us tomorrow in Tokyo?

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
[YONA] And if you'd like, we
could give a tour of the city.

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.086 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] What exactly
are you planning without

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
the consent of the entire team?

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
Not to worry.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
participate, Murasame.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO] I wouldn't mind
if Retto showed up.

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
I never said I didn't want to!

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
[MOENA]
Really? That's unexpected.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
--Hey look.
--Huh?

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
The sunset.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Talk about a stressful day.

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
But when I think how
we protected this view,

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
it all seems worthwhile.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
[TOMA]
You feeling okay, Coach?

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
No cuts or bruises?

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
Nothing that won't heal.

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
I never got a chance
to thank you for today.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
You ended up helping me
way more than you realize.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.346 position:50% align:center
You're the one who saved us.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
[TOMA] I'm a little
envious of your body.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
You must work out a lot
to keep it in this shape.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Well, I do some weight training.

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Don't take this the wrong way,

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
but it wouldn't hurt to add
a little muscle to your frame.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.614 position:50% align:center
Just curious, but you're
not keeping something else

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
a secret from me, right?

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
No, not exactly.

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
All right, if you say so.

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
Heh! How awkward. Sorry.

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
Hope I didn't make you
uncomfortable,

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
I get self-conscious
of my oversized nipples.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
What? Of course not.
It's no big deal.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50% align:center
Okay, thanks.

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]

[SEA CUCUMBER 9A groans]

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
I thought I felt
something weird rubbing

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center
against my inner thigh.

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
It looks like I had a stowaway
that went unnoticed.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
[TOMA]
So you mean that felt normal?

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gasps]
They are huge.

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Give me a break.
There's too much showing.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
If I don't cover him up,
I won't be able to look away.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
Morning, boys!

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
Are you two awake
or sleeping in?

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
If they weren't up yet,
your shouting

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
definitely helped the situation.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hmm?

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I didn't notice
you were sexually frustrated!

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
It'll never happen again!

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Hello?

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
Why would you settle
for his little buds

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center
when you could have all this?

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:43.159 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
You're both wrong!

Is it morning already, Coach?

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
[INN KEEPER 9A] We can't thank
you enough for what you did!

When my husband saw how the
beach was free of sea cucumbers,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center

You saved our
business from ruin!

And so, to show you
how grateful we are,

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center

The Tokyo Branch is gonna show
us around their home turf.

Cool, huh?

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.660 position:50% align:center
I wonder what sort
of places they have in mind.

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
Yeah, about that.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd get
all of your opinions

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
before making a decision.

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
I can't speak
for everyone else,

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
but I'd like to go
somewhere soothing.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.338 position:50% align:center
Personally, I wanna check out

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
the latest available
HxERO merch.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
Well, um...

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
I'm fine with going anywhere
that's serving gourmet food.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
That's just me.

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
Can we even visit
all those spots in one day?

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
If that's the case...

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
[whispering]

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.353 position:50% align:center
Brilliant idea.

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
That might work out perfectly.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hmm?

00:21:56.816 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] I see. With the girls
from Tokyo Branch?

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] I was just about
to leave to pick you up.

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:06.076 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:09.829 position:50% align:center
You have a good time,
but keep your eyes open.

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:12.624 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I should probably
do the opposite

00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
and give mine a quick rest.
