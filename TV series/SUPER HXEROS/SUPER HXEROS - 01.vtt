Hey, Retto, I know you two were

a chance with her now.

What happened to her?
She changed at some point.

the boys when we were little.

One day, Hoshino changed.

[RETTO] She used to be
much more outgoing.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
sometimes, she'd tease
me and I'd blush.

mean it like that.

Ha, ha, ha!

In the end, if you
steal human desire,

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:51.489 position:50% align:center

a sad, empty shell of a person!

Oh? What do we have here?

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
Looks like a straggler.

[RETTO growls]

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.794 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] It's one of them.
Exactly like that day!

Tell me, how many
humans have you robbed

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center

[RETTO] From now on,

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
[CORONA] Humans really do say
the most amusing things.

Maybe I'll absorb
your energy, too!

[RETTO grunts]

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
[CORONA] Mm, the rich,
full-bodied energy of puberty

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
is my absolute favorite!

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:33.448 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
But don't be hasty.

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
Why not try this instead?

[RETTO]
Hoshino's changed forever.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
And it's all...

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
...'cause of you!

It can't be!

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
How could a mere human
do this to me?

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
Impossible!

[RETTO] Haven't you come up
with a fix yet?

Every time
I beat a Kiseichuu,

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.045 position:50% align:center

[sighs] It's a pain having
to walk around with

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
a spare set wherever I go.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] I'm afraid that
can't be helped, Retto.

The X-ERO gear can only
enhance your strength,

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
not that of your clothes.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get that.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
But just imagine
you're me for a second,

[ANNO]
Hmm... I mean...

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
If you think about it, is it
really all that embarrassing?

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.193 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Guess it could be worse.

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
At least I'm not
dressed like you.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center

Awesome. Thanks.

By the way, whatever happened to
finding us another member?

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] I'm still searching for
candidates, but it's not easy.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
The problem is I haven't
had any luck finding someone

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
with your potential.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
It's been so long.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
At this point, why not just
take on the role yourself?

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
[ANNO] Impossible.
We've been over this before.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center
The X-ERO gear converts
the user's erotic energy.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
And turns it into raw power.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center

going through an emotional time

in your lives,
amplifying its effectiveness.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
But an old man like myself?

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
Besides.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
Even shorthanded, I know
you'll make the Kiseichuu pay

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.088 position:50% align:center
for what they've done.

[RETTO gasps]

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
The whole reason
I agreed to do this...

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.888 position:50% align:center
...was for her.

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
Even if the old Hoshino is gone

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center
and nothing I do
will bring her back,

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
I decided.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Never again.

Never will I let anyone else go
through what she experienced!

Even if she rejects me now,

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
it doesn't change the fact
that she was my first love.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center

Let's see you try
to escape me now!

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
No! How has she
grown so enormous?!

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center

She's drunk on energy.

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
Hey! What's she
planning on doing?

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
I'll explain everything
to you, I swear!

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
[CORONA laughs]

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
But for now...

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
Let's kick her ass. Together!

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center

Mm!

We did it, Hoshino! We beat her!

[KIRARA] Well? What're we
supposed to do now?

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] I'm... sorry
I dragged you into this.

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
Then again, I couldn't
have done it without you.

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Do you mean...

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
...he's been fighting
this whole time...

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
...and I didn't even realize it?

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Ever since that day,

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
when the monster attacked us.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What happened?

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
It looked like they
did something to you.

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Y-Yeah. I... I'm fine.

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
Just a little surprised is all.

[KISEICHUU X]
But that's impossible!

00:18:57.137 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
I absorbed her energy, and she
isn't affected in the slightest?

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:05.228 position:50% align:center
How can one human
be so perverted?

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.479 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
[KISEICHUU X] Her levels
are more than ten times

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
the average person! A dozen!

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
No, even higher!

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
What on earth is
going through your head

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
to generate that
much erotic energy?

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:20.535 position:50% align:center
To the point I couldn't
absorb everything!

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
This tiny human...

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
...is horny as hell!

Was that the truth?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
She doesn't know
anything about me!

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] After that day,
I locked up my heart--

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
sealed it away.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
And began rejecting boys.

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
But now...

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
If things could go back
to the way they were.

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
Look. Retto.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
I was thinking...

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should give you a hand.

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
Defeating these bug things.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
But... First off...

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
You have to promise me you
won't tell another living soul

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
about what happened here today.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
I won't.
But did you even notice?

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
You just called me Retto.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Never mind. Forget what I said.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
I can't. I could've sworn you--

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
I said "Enjo"! Enjo! Enjo!

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
Because there's no possible way

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
I would refer to you
by any other name, ever!

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
Do you understand?!

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
'Kay? You obviously misheard!

I-I guess so.

[MOMOKA] What's the big idea
flirting in public

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
while wearing
your birthday suit?!

[MOMOKA]
Jeez.

We heard a giant Kiseichuu
was on the loose!

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
We came to take it
down, but we found you.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
Huh...? Is she our Yellow?

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Well... From what I'm seeing...

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
She's got the body type for it.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME] Really. Is that
any way to talk, Momoka?

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
You just met!

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
Wait. Just who are these people?

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Here.

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
You're gonna want
to put that on

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
before a crowd starts to form.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.486 position:50% align:center
O-Oh. Thank you.

You'll be needing this, too.

Weren't the rules
explained to you?

Once you join X-Eros,

under one roof.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
Enjo lives with three girls?
