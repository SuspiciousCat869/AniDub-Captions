this is definitely a stop

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
After a while,
I grew tired of that lifestyle.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
and was invited to be
a part of X-EROS.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
But even after I joined, the
other members had sex appeal,

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
while I became the coordinator.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.644 position:50% align:center
[MOENA, SHIKO]
Sex appeal!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center
[YONA]
My H-energy is increasing!

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
I feel so immoral!

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
[YONA sighs]

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
I heard some kind of noise.
Did the game glitch?

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Ah?! Ichogi?

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:39.746 position:50% align:center
[YONA grunts]
What?

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
Um. Look, I can explain.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
But first, promise
you'll keep this a secret.

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you, please.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Keep what a secret?!

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50% align:center
Look. I think you're nice,
but I already like another girl.

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
So next time, I'd rather you
didn't joke around like this.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
Turns out you may've gotten
the wrong idea, Enjo.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
It's not like I have
feelings for you.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
I thought this was a routine
thing you and the other members

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
of Saitama Branch did.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:10.860 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid not.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
She tricked me?

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
Murasame swore all HXEROS teams
collected H-energy this way

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
and there wasn't
anything wrong with it!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Yeah, I bet she did!

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
Can you forgive me?

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
I should've check
with you beforehand!

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center
Clearly, it was a simple
misunderstanding.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
[YONA] Honestly. Saitama Branch
is really something else.

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
You're all serious.
And also so pure.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
Even without engaging
in certain activities,

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
your Kiseichuu-slaying skills
are top-notch.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
When you look at our branch,

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
you must see us as
a bunch of weirdos.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
I don't think you're weird.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] HEROs
fight to save the planet

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
and don't care
what others think.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Enjo.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
Hearing you say that makes me
feel like I won't let this

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
embarrass me. Too much!

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
That other girl's lucky
I don't have feelings for you,

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
or I'd give her
some competition.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Uh.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
We're off. But thanks for today.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
And thank you for
letting us show you around!

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
Sorry, guys.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.091 position:50% align:center
I gotta hit the restroom real
quick, so go on ahead.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME]
Don't be long.

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
But if you are,
we're leaving you.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
All right!

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What's she talking about?

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
I've got an internal compass.

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
[RETTO grunts]

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
And, yeah.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
I'm lost.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.861 position:50% align:center
Are we all this
bad with directions?

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Enjo?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh? Momozono's not with you?

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
There were so many people,
we got separated.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same here.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
--Should... we...
--So, uh,

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.795 position:50% align:center
--head on home, then?
--wanna catch the next train?

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.881 position:50% align:center
[SORA]
Bam! Happochuu!

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
[MAIHIME gasps]

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
[YONA] That other girl's lucky
I don't have feelings for you,

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
or I'd give her
some competition.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
[SHIKO]
Next time I see him,

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna bring
him to his knees.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA, RETTO] I think I'd
better say something.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Oh, right.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.234 position:50% align:center
I meant to tell you,
we went to this owl café?

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
And one of the owls
reminded me of you.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center
I took a pic if you wanna see.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Aw, that's cute!

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
But I think I might like the one
next to it even better.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
[RETTO gulps]

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
Huh. Y'know. This one kind
of feels familiar to me.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
Huh! Anyway!

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
Where did you guys
end up going today?

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center
Oh, right!

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
To be honest, it was nowhere
especially interesting.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] You must've liked it
enough to buy something, though.

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
Nope! This is something a member
of Tokyo branch left behind!

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 10A]
This train is about to depart.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 10A]
Please stand by.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh! I think
we'd better get off here!

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
C'mon, get up!

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.231 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
I'm so sorry!

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold that door!

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
Phew. That was close.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] I'm glad you realized
it was our stop.

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
Ah. Hold on.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
What happened to your hair clip?

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
Huh? Man, it must've fallen off

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
when I bumped into
that guy on the train.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
Guess it's gone now.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
Well. Not yet-- I'll ask
if we can look for it

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
when the train reaches
the end of the line.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
It's cool, you really
don't have to do that.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I could buy
another one just like it.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Now that I think of it.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
How long have
I had that hair clip?

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
I wear it almost every day, but
I can't remember where I got it.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
I have this strange feeling that
is used to be important to me.

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
[RETTO sighs]
Finally found it.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA, RETTO]
Thanks for letting us look!

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad that
it was still there.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you must've been
pretty disappointed to lose

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
a present from your boyfriend.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
No! You've got
the wrong idea, sir!

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Sorry, not my business.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
Listen, it's late. Why don't
we call your parents, okay?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
No, thanks.
I think we'll be fine.

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
Huh. Listen at times like these,
the man's gotta take the lead,

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
you know what I mean?

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Well...

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center
There's no trains till morning.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
Do you think we could ask your
uncle to pick us up instead?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
That works.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.884 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Hey. Can I ask you something?

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
It's about this hair clip.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to
know anything about it?

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.348 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh...?

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] See... My memories
around the time we were attacked

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
by that Kiseichuu are fuzzy, so
I can't remember when or where

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
I got this.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
If you're hiding something
about it, please, tell me.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
It's... I mean,
it's no big thing, really.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.197 position:50% align:center
Besides, if you can't
even remember it,

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
isn't it possible that it's a
memory you'd rather not have?

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Hold on.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
Maybe Dark Kirara would
know something about it.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
Although, I'd rather not
ask her if I can help it.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Listen.

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
Please, just tell me?

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:27.218 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.
But you can't tell anyone else.

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
Especially Momozono.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Mm-hmm.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing to talk about
after so long, but actually,

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
I gave you that hair clip.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
Huh? Seriously?
Wait, I'm confused.

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:48.573 position:50% align:center
How does that connect to
the Kiseichuu, then?

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.908 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
But if I had to guess,
it's because it was

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
a proposal present
from me to you.

00:15:57.624 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Good morning, Ret!

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:02.754 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Hey, Hoshino!

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:05.340 position:50% align:center
It was pretty hot
last night, wasn't it?

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
Look, I didn't wear much
when I went to bed,

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
so I got a gross mosquito bite.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
What?! Don't show me your
chest on the way to school!

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA giggles] So,
it's fine as long as we're not

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
on the way to school, then?

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:19.354 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
Would after school
be better for you?

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
Hilarious.

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] Sheesh,
why does she always have to

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.236 position:50% align:center
tease me and stuff?

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
And on top of that, she's
totally selfish and annoying!

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Hmm.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
But the thing is...

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
That's the Hoshino I loved.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Today is her birthday.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
The day I'm finally gonna
step up and take the initiative!

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
See you later.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Ah.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
What's going on, Retto?

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
You said you wanted
to meet me here?

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
This letter is...

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Are you... serious?

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah.

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
[RETTO chuckles]
She fell for it!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
It looks like I wrote "Marry
me," but if you pay attention,

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
the characters actually
say "Battle me"!

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center
Wow. I didn't know that was
how you thought about me!

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
What do you mean?

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
I wrote "battle"!

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
Why, what did you
think it said, huh? Huh?

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] This was the perfect
way to get back at Hoshino!

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
It's guaranteed to take
her down a notch or two!

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
Go ahead. Dish it back.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
I'm ready for you
this time, Hoshino!

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's what
you really want, Ret...

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
Although... I think we might
be on the youngish side

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
to be talking about marriage.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
But, still.

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh? What's with this mood?

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
I did not see this coming.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:55.075 position:50% align:center
K-Knowing her, though, there's
probably a lot more to it.

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:57.744 position:50% align:center
I bet she's plotting something!

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
Here! This is for you.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
I mean, it is
your birthday, right?

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
Happy birthday.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
Put it on once you have
an answer to my letter.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
[RETTO] We've taken this so far,
she's gotta have a comeback!

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
Come on, show me your
true colors, Hoshino!

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA giggles]
Thank you. I'll cherish it.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
[RETTO squeals]
Yep, you win.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
I lose.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA giggles]

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Oh, that's right.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
So. You a little disappointed?

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Shut up.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
You seriously considered
that to be a real proposal?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
I mean... It's because of
the way you reacted to it.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
Not long after our encounter
with the Kiseichuu,

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
I saw you were wearing it.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
So I asked if you wanted
to walk home together.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
Ew! Save your jokes until
you can write better ones.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What? Brutal!

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
At the time, I couldn't figure
out why you suddenly hated me.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
But now, I know you just forgot.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] It's hard to believe my
memory disappeared along with

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
that first Kiseichuu
we defeated.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
I don't remember.
Did I buy this clip?

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. It's cute,
so I'm wearing it.

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Wait a minute.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:26.207 position:50% align:center
If this is true,
doesn't that mean...

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
Enjo and I have actually
been engaged to each other

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
this whole time?

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:33.381 position:50% align:center
Even that time in the bath?!
And that time in the park?!

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
I'm so embarrassed, I could die!

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
Calm down! He's
seen you in way more

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
embarrassing positions
than this.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
I don't get it, why didn't you
tell me about this earlier?

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
You should've reminded me what
wearing the hair clip meant.

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
You're more careless
than I thought.

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
Ah! Hold on.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
Are we having
a conversation right now?

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
That's crazy.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
--[rustling]
--[BOTH gasp]

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. What was that?

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's a Kiseichuu?

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
My guess is it's probably a cat.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Wait--is there a cat version?

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
What? Not aliens! An actual cat!

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center

--[RACCOON 10A chirps]
--[RETTO] A raccoon?

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
But what's it doing
out here, though?

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
So it's a normal racoon?

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
--[RACCOON 10A chirps]
--[KIRARA] Aw! Hehe! How cute!

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
Just look at him, he seems tame.

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Careful! Don't get too close!

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
[RACCOON 10A chrips]

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA groans]
Bye, Mr. Raccoon.

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Uh! Uh...

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA shrieks]

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
Uh... Don't worry,
I didn't see anything.

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
This is not what you think!

00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
Like I said before,
Murasame left this behind.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
I'm just holding onto it for her
so I can give it back to her

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
next time, I promise!

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
But, wouldn't it have made
a little more sense to give it

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
to Wakakusa instead?

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA]
Yeah. Yeah, it would've.

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
Look, there's nothing wrong
with it. If anything,

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
this shows that you've
finally discovered

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
your HERO sensibilities.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
Would you stop jumping
to conclusions?!

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:20.405 position:50% align:center
Ow! C'mon, I was just kidding!

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
Don't take it that
seriously, or else--

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:26.536 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA gasps]

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Yeah, I tried to warn you.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50% align:center
Here. Use my jacket.

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
It should cover you.

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:51.561 position:50% align:center
Okay she's leaving.

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.856 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Sorry for that!

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.692 position:50% align:center
Nah. Your instinct saved us.

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.322 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] I don't care if
it was on impulse or not,

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
I still can't
believe I did that!

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:07.369 position:50% align:center
I guess I went into fight or
flight after Retto reminded me

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
of those old memories.

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
I locked myself away
after being attacked by

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
that Kiseichuu years ago.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.752 position:50% align:center
Distancing myself
from both boys

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:18.296 position:50% align:center
and that embarrassing
side of me.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.256 position:50% align:center
Now I'm back where I started.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.052 position:50% align:center
But it's time I face my past
and the Kiseichuu head on.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.514 position:50% align:center
--[KIRARA] Hey, Enjo?
--What?

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.766 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA] I guess I never
gave you a proper answer to

00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:32.102 position:50% align:center
the question in
your letter, did I?

00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:33.436 position:50% align:center
Oh! No worries.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.814 position:50% align:center
That was just a youthful
indiscretion, y'know?

00:22:35.897 --> 00:22:37.190 position:50% align:center
There's no need.

00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:38.525 position:50% align:center
But that's not fair!

00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:40.610 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to
respond then if someone else

00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:42.278 position:50% align:center
confesses their love to me?

00:22:42.362 --> 00:22:44.364 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay.

00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:47.158 position:50% align:center
So listen up. If we
manage to exterminate

00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:50.286 position:50% align:center
every single one
of those Kiseichuu.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.957 position:50% align:center
And our relationship is able to
go back to how it used to be.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.334 position:50% align:center
That's when I'll
give you my answer.

00:22:57.836 --> 00:23:01.047 position:50% align:center
But. If you fall for
another girl before then,

00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:03.216 position:50% align:center
I'll never forgive you.

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.593 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Huh? Wh-What is this?

00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:07.387 position:50% align:center
I-Is she actually saying...

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.763 position:50% align:center
She wants...

00:23:08.847 --> 00:23:12.934 position:50% align:center
Hold on. I've gotta calm down.
Is it even possible?

00:23:13.018 --> 00:23:14.352 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
Right! Cool!

00:23:14.436 --> 00:23:17.188 position:50% align:center
Uh, but for now, I think I'll go
ahead and call my uncle!

00:23:17.272 --> 00:23:18.523 position:50% align:center
[KIRARA groans]

[OPERATOR 10A] The call
you are attempting to make

Well, sounds like he must've
forgotten to charge his phone.

00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:26.865 position:50% align:center
Great! So what do we do, now?

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.080 position:50% align:center
[RETTO]
We have no choice...

00:23:34.164 --> 00:23:36.374 position:50% align:center
Listen at times like these,
the man's gotta take the lead,

00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:37.709 position:50% align:center
you know what I mean?

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:44.007 position:50% align:center
Why don't we take
a taxi home together?
