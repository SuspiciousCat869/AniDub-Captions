1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,500
Here we go...

2
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,500
stay quick and focused.

3
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,083
The same to you.

4
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,458
No...

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,250
How could...

6
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,833
how could such
weak creatures...

7
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,458
do...

8
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,000
this?

9
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:31,958
I got him...

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,083
I can't believe I did it.

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,333
We won...

12
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,875
But we paid
a great price for it.

13
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,041
They've killed
the Awakened Being!

14
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,583
Are you sure?

15
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,791
Yes.

16
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,416
I thought that's
what you wanted.

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,666
Of course...

18
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,708
I was just taken by surprise...

19
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:31,125
You see, that creature was a
very powerful Awakened Being...

20
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,416
I didn't think they would be
able to kill him so quickly.

21
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
That's good isn't it?

22
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,250
They accomplished their mission.

23
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,500
Yes...

24
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,416
did they all survive?

25
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,583
I sense three...

26
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,916
if the forth made it
she's very weak...

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,208
too weak for me to read anyway.

28
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,541
They only lost one,
that's impressive...

29
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:58,458
Well, keep an eye
on them for a bit longer.

30
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,541
They killed him.

31
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,791
Is it really that
important to know

32
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,458
what they looked
like afterwards?

33
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:07,250
Think of it as an old man
concerned for his children.

34
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,166
Alright then.

35
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,250
How is she?

36
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,375
Not well I'm afraid...

37
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,208
she used so much of her Yoma
power to regenerate her arm

38
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,541
that she can't treat
her other injuries...

39
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,875
the rest of her wounds will
just have to heal on their own.

40
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,208
Damn it...

41
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,750
And what about you,
are you okay...? I mean...

42
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,791
you were taking
the most damage.

43
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,041
She was struck the most but
was quick enough to avoid

44
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,000
being hit in vital areas.

45
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,125
This allowed her to limit
her injuries to places

46
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,833
that heal quickly.

47
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,083
But how--?

48
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,250
How could you control
something like that

49
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,000
in the middle of a fight?

50
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,458
I've been meaning to ask you
something for a while now.

51
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,750
Ask us what?

52
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,666
I know this might
be hard to answer...

53
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,958
But have you ever reached the
point where you almost awakened?

54
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,708
I understand if you're
hesitant to tell anyone...

55
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,916
however I need you to be
as honest as you possibly can.

56
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,625
Okay, yes, I have.

57
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,083
When I found myself losing a
fight I accidentally unleashed

58
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,291
my Yoma powers, and I
guess I misjudged myself.

59
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,083
But awakening
is not only painful...

60
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,500
it can also be
quite pleasurable...

61
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,875
The ecstasy is so great
most can't resist.

62
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,125
Right...

63
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:44,208
I felt it and I can't
believe I made it back.

64
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,208
Okay, I've done it too.

65
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,916
I went too far and
misjudged my limit...

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,750
turns out I was
just like the men...

67
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,750
felt like I couldn't resist,
no matter how hard I tried.

68
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,416
But you did resist it.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,625
Somehow I managed
to snap myself out of it...

70
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,583
Deneve has been
through it as well.

71
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,875
But in her case...

72
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,583
she chose to test
the limits of her powers.

73
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,916
Have you known Deneve
for a long time?

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,875
Oh yeah...

75
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,666
We were both
in the same class.

76
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,916
And tell me...

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,750
Have either of you had
a reputation for being

78
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,541
trouble makers with civilians or
those who employ your services?

79
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,166
Well, you've seen my temper
in action, haven't you?

80
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,541
I might've been in a couple...

81
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,166
unnecessary fights.

82
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,583
And Deneve?

83
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,166
Miss Perfect?

84
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,375
She's way too professional to
cause that kind of trouble...

85
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,541
although she's had quite a few
run ins with fellow warriors.

86
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,083
That's what I thought...

87
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,458
and I've noticed our lowest
ranking member has somewhat

88
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,791
of a difficult time following
the orders she's given.

89
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,291
Do you see the pattern?

90
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,291
All of us here are trouble
makers who have nearly awakened.

91
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,125
Right...

92
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,500
So what are you getting at?

93
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,208
It just seems a bit
too coincidental to me...

94
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,625
I mean, a bunch of miscreants
get the wrong information

95
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:59,166
and end up having to fight a
male Awakened Being together?

96
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,583
Wait, what are you saying...?

97
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,583
The organization is out
to get us or something?

98
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,541
I'm only theorizing, Helen.

99
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,416
What about you?

100
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,041
I can't see you giving in...

101
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,916
and I have an even
harder time thinking of you

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,291
as a trouble maker.

103
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,416
Very few people know this...

104
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,541
but I did almost awaken.

105
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,666
I nearly lost myself
over that edge.

106
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,541
Are you serious?

107
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,333
It happened on my third hunt
pursuing an Awakened Being...

108
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,750
I killed it but unfortunately
the monster turned out

109
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,583
to be an old friend of mine.

110
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,250
No...!

111
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,458
It can't be!

112
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,958
Hilda!

113
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,875
My god, wasn't she in
your class, Miria...?

114
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,958
Why didn't the organization
tell you she was the one

115
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,750
you were sent to kill?

116
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,750
Hilda...

117
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,500
Why...?

118
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,708
Why didn't you just
call out to me...?!

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,083
Damn it...

120
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,250
I never would have
let it come to this...

121
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,250
Why couldn't you just tell me
you were in trouble?

122
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,500
Hilda.

123
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,500
I wouldn't think
too much about it...

124
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,333
She lost her humanity
a long time ago...

125
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,583
all that was left
was a monster

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,083
Oh no...!

127
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,375
She's losing control
of her Yoki aura...!

128
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,541
Miria!

129
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,625
Well now...

130
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,333
looks like Phantom Miria
is awakening.

131
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,375
It's you!

132
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,083
I hear that when
she's fighting on a team

133
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,291
she's even better
than number one...

134
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, how I'd love
to get a crack at her.

135
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,333
Come on, dear...

136
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,375
Don't you think you're taking a
little too much time with this?

137
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,583
But you're here now
so you obviously managed

138
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,625
to control yourself.

139
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,541
I knew that I'd gone
beyond my limit but I

140
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,291
fought with all I had
to maintain control...

141
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,875
Mainly I was too proud
to give in to her taunting

142
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,000
and I couldn't let her win.

143
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,458
Wait who?

144
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,125
Never mind...

145
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,083
it doesn't matter...

146
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,250
What is important is that
was the moment I decided

147
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,916
I was going to have my revenge
against the organization.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,958
What?

149
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,583
They turn us
into these creatures,

150
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,541
then dispose of us
as if we were garbage.

151
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,833
Well, that was the last straw.

152
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,083
I couldn't go along
with it any more.

153
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,500
But how could you
possibly expect to get

154
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,041
any kind of vengeance?

155
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,041
I'm constantly searching
for ways to exploit

156
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,791
the cracks in
their foundation...

157
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,041
while maintaining
my loyal image.

158
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,833
And have you found
anything on them yet?

159
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,666
Unfortunately I haven't...

160
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,250
but I figure I must be getting
close to something now.

161
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,666
Makes sense...

162
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,083
and now that you've
become a nuisance

163
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,208
they want to get rid of you.

164
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,458
As I said before
this is only a theory.

165
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,791
I really don't know
anything for certain.

166
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,083
Okay now let me
ask you something...

167
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,791
because we got so close...

168
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,750
because we were almost
awakened could it have

169
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,875
changed something in us?

170
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,041
You wouldn't be asking that
if you didn't already have

171
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,958
some idea about
the truth, would you?

172
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,458
How could you doubt it?

173
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,166
Look at your Yoki aura...

174
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,166
It's obviously changed
since before you came

175
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,875
close to awakening...

176
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,416
For one thing you're limitations
are no longer certain...

177
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,541
And I'm willing to bet
you're sometimes overcome

178
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,208
by intense hunger...

179
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,083
am I correct?

180
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,458
Isn't it obvious by now...?

181
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,458
We are already Awakened Beings.

182
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,416
What?

183
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,333
What are you saying...?

184
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,416
That we've already turned?

185
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,041
Something wrong?

186
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,750
Their auras are disturbed...

187
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,208
I'm not sure but I believe the
one with the strongest aura

188
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,791
said something
to upset the others.

189
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,750
And now she's arguing
with the one whose aura

190
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,333
is in the middle...

191
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,750
the one with the
weakest aura doesn't seem

192
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,166
to be bothered at all.

193
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,458
Wait.

194
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,625
Hmm?

195
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,875
No she's just as disturbed
as the others...

196
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,625
but she's trying her best
not to let them know it.

197
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,875
Oh, I see.

198
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,125
Something happened in
her past that caused her

199
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,166
to shut down emotionally.

200
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,375
Amazing...

201
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:08,250
I had no idea she could read so
much detail from this distance.

202
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, this has gone too far...!

203
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,250
I know myself,
and I'm not a monster!

204
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,375
I don't know about you but I
am nothing like that creature

205
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,375
and I certainly don't have
a desire to eat human flesh!

206
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,291
I have nothing in common
with that thing, you hear me?

207
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,125
Well, let me put it
another way...

208
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,750
I don't think we're
completely awakened

209
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,375
but somewhere in between...

210
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,125
I think that what we are
is half Awakened Beings.

211
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:30,916
Is...

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,708
that possible?

213
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,375
Most reach the breaking point
and awaken suddenly...

214
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,833
but somehow we got
stuck in the middle...

215
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,458
Or it's possible that
we're still awakening

216
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,416
but doing it very slowly.

217
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:41,958
But that...

218
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,750
can't be right.

219
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,083
Isn't it true that your
ability to stretch your arms

220
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,750
was much harder before you
nearly awakened, and doesn't it

221
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,625
require far less
effort from you now?

222
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,458
And think about
Deneve's healing powers...

223
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,625
Any other healer would
be pushing their limits

224
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,583
if they attempted
what Deneve does.

225
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,458
We have been going
past our limitations

226
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,500
and immediately
snapping back...

227
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,666
That was impossible before.

228
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,083
It makes sense.

229
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,250
And it matches up with
what I've been going through.

230
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,541
You're awake!

231
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,083
So...

232
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,250
let's assume for the moment
that we are half awakened...

233
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,166
What's that supposed to mean
and do we have a choice

234
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,750
in the matter?

235
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,041
Are we supposed to sit around
waiting to become some hideous

236
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,458
monster and not do
anything about it?

237
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,041
I wish I knew what to tell
you but I don't know

238
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,083
what will happen next...

239
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,041
The fact of the matter
is we have no idea

240
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,583
when or how we'll turn.

241
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,958
And that, as you can imagine,

242
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,541
puts us in a very
dangerous position.

243
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,291
Alright then, fine...

244
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,250
I guess there's...

245
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,791
nothing to lose...

246
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,416
Deneve!

247
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,291
What are you trying to do?!

248
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,958
Deneve! Stop it!

249
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,166
Shut up and listen to me...!

250
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,416
I don't have any choice!

251
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,458
If I try to regenerate
within the normal limits

252
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm going to die...!

253
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,750
So I'm going to try and push my
Yoki aura as far as possible

254
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,416
and hopefully I can
heal everything now!

255
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,041
But this is too risky, Deneve!

256
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,208
What if you go
too far and awaken?

257
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,583
If what Miria is saying
is correct then we've gone

258
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,041
past our limit
a long time ago...

259
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,875
And I'm guessing that it
even if we push our power

260
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,791
to the point of awakening we
should be able to revert back!

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,541
But remember, if I do
become an Awakened Being...

262
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,208
you have to kill me
as quickly as you can!

263
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,791
No!

264
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,291
Deneve!

265
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:46,791
Helen!

266
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,583
Clare!

267
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,458
I promise you, my friend...

268
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,666
I'll make sure
you don't suffer.

269
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,041
Don't worry...

270
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,125
we won't let you down, Deneve.

271
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,500
I sense that one has awakened.

272
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,000
What's that?

273
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,875
And for some strange reason
she did it voluntarily...

274
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,500
Why would she do that?

275
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,583
Likely the injuries she
suffered were so great

276
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,125
they caused her
to misjudge her limit...

277
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,208
So sad.

278
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,625
And you're fine with that...?

279
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,416
I thought you said you looked
on them as an old man

280
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,125
to his children.

281
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,250
I certainly don't remember
committing myself

282
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,791
to raise any monsters.

283
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,875
How bout that...?

284
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,333
Looks like it worked, huh?

285
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,666
Thank god!

286
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,166
Happy now...?

287
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,583
That was reckless.

288
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,833
How are your wounds doing...

289
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,958
have they healed?

290
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,166
Yeah...

291
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,916
they're all closed up
and back to normal.

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,250
You know that may not
happen next time...

293
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,333
if you want to continue
as a human it would be best

294
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,250
not to take any
unnecessary chances.

295
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,583
I realize that...

296
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,250
Trust me, the last
thing I want to do is

297
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,375
walk that razors edge again.

298
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,166
Clare, what is it?

299
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,541
I have the strangest feeling
we're being watched.

300
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,541
Not likely...

301
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,375
I already probed this area...

302
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,500
And we are the only people
in this entire mountain range.

303
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,666
As for anyone
beyond these mountains...

304
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,666
they'd have a difficult time
detecting us from that distance.

305
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,958
Imagining things, I guess.

306
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,416
Hmmm...

307
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,708
That's interesting.

308
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,500
One of them can detect me
from this far away.

309
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,625
Something very odd
is going on there...

310
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:10,708
the one that I thought was
awakened has now stabilized.

311
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,916
What is it...?

312
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,250
Something I need to know about?

313
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,083
No...

314
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,416
looks like I made a mistake.

315
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,250
There wasn't an awakening...

316
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,708
It seems
all four of them are fine.

317
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,833
A mistake...?

318
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,166
Rather unusual
for you isn't it?

319
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,666
With this kind of distance
it is difficult even for me

320
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,208
to always get
precise information...

321
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,916
maybe you should
consider that the next time

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,666
your parental instincts
overcome you.

323
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,416
Enough...

324
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,666
let's go...

325
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,958
you would do well
to remember their auras...

326
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,125
Mark my words.

327
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,875
It may not be too long
before you'll have

328
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,750
to cross swords with them.

329
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,291
Hm.

330
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,166
I think I'd do just as well
to be on the look out for you,

331
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,416
old man.

332
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,750
I think it best
if we separate now...

333
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,208
Continue on
as if nothing happened.

334
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,625
We finished our assignment.

335
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,291
The Awakened Being was killed...

336
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,833
And that is all
any of us know...

337
00:16:58,916 --> 00:16:59,916
got it?

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,375
Yes, I believe so...

339
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,291
Do everything we can
to keep the organization

340
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,125
from discovering our mistrust.

341
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,541
Exactly...

342
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,375
From here on, do only what
you're told and stay away

343
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,250
from suspicious activity.

344
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,166
We need to change this image
of us as troublemakers.

345
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,125
Ah- do we really have to?

346
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,458
I'm afraid that we're going to
need to proceed with caution

347
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,041
from now on...

348
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,958
if we do that we should be able
to avoid detection for a while.

349
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,000
You sure?

350
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,041
Don't worry.

351
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,166
Everything will be fine...

352
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,791
Besides, you're much
more powerful now

353
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:28,958
that you've all awakened.

354
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,458
If I had to
rank your abilities,

355
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,208
I'd say each of you is easily
within the single digits.

356
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,083
What do you think,
is that true?

357
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,750
I don't feel that strong.

358
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,791
Believe me
you are that strong...

359
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,916
it's unlikely you'll have
to fight one of our ranks

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,833
but if so know that the odds
will be in your favor...

361
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:48,625
That is unless you happen to run
into a number five or greater.

362
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,666
If you're faced
with one of those...

363
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,500
You'd be a fool to even
attempt to fight them.

364
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,458
So in other words you're
saying we should steer clear

365
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,541
of anyone ranked in the single
digits, is that about right?

366
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,250
There's more to it than that...

367
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,708
It's not just any high rank.

368
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,458
Where you're concerned,
there's a huge difference

369
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,375
in your chance of survival
fighting a five versus a six

370
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,750
That bad?

371
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,083
These are the emblems
of the top five.

372
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,583
Don't forget them...

373
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,625
From the right.

374
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,958
Number one, Alicia...

375
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,041
Number two, Beth...

376
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,541
Number three, Galatea...

377
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,416
And number four...

378
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,125
Why did you stop?

379
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,708
What's wrong with number four?

380
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,291
Life is meaningless to her.

381
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,916
So she wouldn't think twice
about killing one of her own...

382
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,125
she also has an unusual
obsession with hunting

383
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,875
Awakened Beings.

384
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,041
Unfortunate...

385
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,500
So you think the best
thing for us to do

386
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,375
is keep our distance from her?

387
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,916
That's right...

388
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,208
avoid her as much as you can
without drawing attention ...

389
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,750
She's ruthless and loves to
fight, but more than anything

390
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,625
she loves the sight of blood.

391
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,000
Her name's Ophelia...

392
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,583
and this is her emblem.

393
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,958
Finally number five...

394
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,666
Rafaela.

395
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,958
So what will you be doing
during all of this?

396
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,666
I'll keep on looking
for information

397
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,750
within the organization...

398
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,333
Don't worry.

399
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,125
I'll let you know as soon as I
can if I come across anything.

400
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,666
And you're gonna be
doing this by yourself?

401
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,291
It's too risky
to stick together.

402
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,000
We might draw
too much attention...

403
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,291
Besides we don't really know
that the organization is

404
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:42,291
trying to get rid of us at this
point- it's just speculation.

405
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,291
Try not to think that
everyone in the organization

406
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,416
is against you.

407
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,625
Now is not the time
to get paranoid.

408
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,708
But that doesn't mean you
should let your guard down.

409
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,500
Stay on your toes and always
keep your wits about you.

410
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:11,916
We'll meet again...

411
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So please...

412
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,666
Try to survive.

413
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,833
You said that eventually I'm
going to have to face them...

414
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,333
I wonder which of them
will still be alive to face.

415
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,625
They're walking
a very dangerous path.

416
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,500
Can't you see
this is hopeless...?

417
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,166
Look son, I've never
seen a Claymore

418
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,291
go up the mountains
and come back alive.

419
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,666
She'll be back alright...

420
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,833
Clare always
keeps her promises.

421
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,833
She will be back!

422
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,291
It's Clare.

423
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,458
You're back!

424
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,000
I will make it...

425
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,208
I will survive.

426
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,500
Clare!

427
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,666
A blood-soaked warrior...

428
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,208
on a blood ridden path.

429
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,041
The time foretold.

430
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,083
Next time...

431
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,208
The Endless Gravestones Part 1.
