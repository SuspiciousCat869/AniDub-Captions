1
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,291
She's approaching her limit.

2
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,125
That's enough for one day.

3
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,708
You should wash up
and get a little rest.

4
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,666
No...

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,291
Not yet...

6
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm not tired...

7
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,666
I can keep going.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,291
You're finished for today.

9
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,666
Don't strain yourself...

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,000
You haven't properly
recovered from your injuries.

11
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,083
You must never
force your training...

12
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,041
In learning this technique,
rest and practice are

13
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,625
equally important.

14
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,875
She's becoming more aware
of her limits.

15
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,208
Her determination is clear.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,041
Still--

17
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,625
A lake surrounded
by mountains...

18
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,083
The perfect place for someone
who doesn't want to be found.

19
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,625
Ah.

20
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,791
A good fit.

21
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,541
It seems we're
very close in size.

22
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,458
This is...

23
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,458
yours from back then isn't it?

24
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,416
Yes that's right.

25
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,666
It's missing a sleeve,
but still...

26
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,000
It's in far better
condition than yours...

27
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,583
Consider it a gift...

28
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, sit.

29
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,250
Eat.

30
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,541
I know you're not hungry...

31
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,500
Even so, you need to
replenish your strength.

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,708
You haven't changed at all.

33
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,208
You look the same
as you did then.

34
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,041
That shouldn't surprise you...

35
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,083
Because of our
Yoma blood we grow

36
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,416
but never age as humans do...

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,041
Unless we die in battle...

38
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,083
or turn into Yoma,
our bodies never change.

39
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,041
If Teresa were alive today she
would look just as she did

40
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,083
on the day that she died.

41
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,583
You feel responsible
for her death, do you not?

42
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,208
And you're not entirely wrong.

43
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,708
In the time that
you traveled together,

44
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,708
Teresa's skills as a warrior
naturally weakened...

45
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,416
She allowed her mind to
stray from her purpose...

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Her death was the result.

47
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,833
However...

48
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,291
I think she found
a brief form of happiness.

49
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,375
In the short amount of time
she spent with you...

50
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,500
she was able to see herself,
from a different perspective.

51
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,458
All she had ever known
was the fear and respect

52
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,916
that she commanded
from the rest of us...

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,500
But that little girl
adored her...

54
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,916
She began to accept that.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,666
The time she spent with you
must have been peaceful...

56
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,833
I doubt she would have
changed her final days.

57
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,666
The lives we lead
are lonely ones, Clare...

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,333
You reminded her of what it
felt like to be human.

59
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,333
Teresa died protecting
the only person who loved her

60
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:03,041
and the only one
she loved in return.

61
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,833
You gave her a better
death than she expected.

62
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,500
Good...

63
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,333
You're beginning to get a better
sense of your limitations...

64
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,875
Don't ever lose sight
of your boundaries.

65
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,625
How close...?

66
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,958
How close am I to
mastering the Quick Sword?

67
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,250
How long until
I match your skill?

68
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,791
The Quick Sword
requires incredible control...

69
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,666
and great mental fortitude.

70
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,833
You must be able to
maintain composure under

71
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,375
the most grueling
circumstances...

72
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,750
I thought the technique
would suit you well.

73
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,416
I was mistaken...

74
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,750
There's a constant fire
inside of your heart.

75
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,708
A passion you're
not able to control.

76
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,166
You will never learn
the Quick Sword.

77
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,500
You cannot master it...

78
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,583
It is beyond your capability...

79
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,666
You're strong, but your mind is
easily influenced by Yoma power.

80
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,208
Train all you want...

81
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,291
You'll never
last over a minute.

82
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:40,958
Your speed and force will never
reach one tenth of my own.

83
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,666
In short, it would
be pointless for us

84
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,916
to continue
with your training...

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You can try all you like,
but it won't change the fact

86
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,083
that you lack the
necessary will power...

87
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,583
You've accomplished
all that you can.

88
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,166
Stand up.

89
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:06,916
Why...?

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,583
What did you do?

91
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,958
Your wound had
already completely healed.

92
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,041
I merely took the liberty
of creating a new one.

93
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:21,750
Oh God.

94
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,291
Ilena!

95
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,500
A parting gift.

96
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,458
You stand no chance without it.

97
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:27,958
What?

98
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,500
What are you saying?

99
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,500
Hurry!

100
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,583
Reattach it before
it's too late!

101
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:36,166
That arm is your one and
only path to the Quick Sword.

102
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,875
Without it, you have no way
of killing Priscilla.

103
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,666
No.

104
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,375
This is madness!

105
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,541
I'm no longer a warrior so you
have more need for it than I.

106
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,416
May it bring you better luck.

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,625
It has been a very long time
since I've needed it.

108
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,666
But--

109
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,041
Accept it...

110
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,333
It's the only way
you can survive.

111
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,458
And the only way
Teresa can be avenged.

112
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,083
Teresa...

113
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,458
When I'm finished,
I will return this to you.

114
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,041
That means we both
have to stay alive.

115
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,416
Well I won't hold
my breath but I'll be here.

116
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,875
Don't worry...

117
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,916
I've survived this long.

118
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,291
Goodbye...

119
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,791
Clare.

120
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,583
I sensed the
presence of another.

121
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,291
Has she gone?

122
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,291
Yes...

123
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,166
She left here
several hours ago.

124
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,791
Ah.

125
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,125
Well, no matter...

126
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,916
It was you I came here
for in the first place.

127
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,916
For many years now,
you have kept your Yoki aura

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,625
completely undetectable...

129
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,375
Until now.

130
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,666
Using the Quick Sword
was a mistake...

131
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,041
Such a powerful display
of Yoki left little doubt

132
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,833
about your location...

133
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,208
You were easy to find.

134
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,666
If you've come to kill me, may
I at least ask for your name?

135
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,208
My name's Rafaela...

136
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,833
I'm ranked Number Five
in the Organization.

137
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,833
And how did you earn that scar?

138
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,125
Is it from before you
became a warrior, or after?

139
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,291
It should make no
difference to you now...

140
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,333
You don't have more than
a few moments left to live.

141
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,666
Deserter Ilena...

142
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,083
For your crimes against
the Organization your life

143
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,958
is forfeit.

144
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,833
I was warned to watch out
for your remaining arm...

145
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,583
But I see you have none...

146
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,833
I guess it's not
your lucky day.

147
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:04,875
True...

148
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,583
Even with both arms,
I'm no match...

149
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,541
Not against the
new Number Five...

150
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,625
But why...?

151
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,083
With the amount
of power you possess,

152
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,416
what's holding you back
from advancement?

153
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,625
Another pointless question

154
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,041
--for one who is about
to lose her head.

155
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,125
What just happened?

156
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,291
My right arm...

157
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,625
Ilena...

158
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:34,666
What...?

159
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,916
What was that?

160
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,583
Something big...

161
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,500
and it sounds like
it's pretty close.

162
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,000
My, what a coincidence!

163
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,416
Fancy that...

164
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,208
Two old friends
meeting way out here.

165
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,291
Oh...!

166
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,666
I do love your new arm...

167
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,375
Wherever did you get it?

168
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,875
Ophelia!

169
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,125
Now that hurts...

170
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,541
After all we've been through,
aren't you even a little happy

171
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,666
to see me?

172
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,916
Come on...

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,083
I thought we were
like sisters...

174
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,333
Didn't you?

175
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,291
My god...

176
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,708
An Awakened Being?!

177
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,500
What? Do you see one...?

178
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,416
Where is it?

179
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,083
I didn't catch its scent.

180
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,708
Oh, I see, you're
just playing games...

181
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,458
like I can't sense
an Awakened Being.

182
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,083
But never mind all that...

183
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,041
You wouldn't happen to have
anything on you I could eat,

184
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:30,875
would you...?

185
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,875
I'm unbelievably hungry.

186
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,041
Perhaps you can
spare a little meat...?

187
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,791
A taste of viscera
would be nice...

188
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,000
What do you say...?

189
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,416
Not human flesh, of course.

190
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,750
Heavens, no!

191
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,041
I wouldn't want that...

192
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,000
It's not as if
I'm an Awakened Being.

193
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,291
Just in the mood
for something bloody.

194
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,000
No, nothing human...

195
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,708
But something close
does sound divine.

196
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,291
Come to think of it...

197
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:58,000
The flesh of a half-human such
as yourself would be delicious.

198
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,791
Something is different...

199
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,583
I believe you've
improved since we last met.

200
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,333
Come on...

201
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,083
What's a little bite of innards
between such good friends?

202
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,833
What have you been
doing since I saw you last?

203
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,916
You're not nearly
as slow as I remember.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,583
It's like you're
a different person.

205
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,833
Tell me where you've been!

206
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:24,916
Fine...

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,791
Every woman's entitled
to her secrets.

208
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,166
That's strange...

209
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,083
it doesn't taste
very good at all.

210
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,583
How unusual...

211
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,750
I wonder if her innards
would taste any better.

212
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,916
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,625
I hate to be
such a picky eater,

214
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,208
but it's quite
a specific craving.

215
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,958
Ever had one of those?

216
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,458
Something tells me I'd prefer
to eat your guts fresh out

217
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,250
of your squirming body...

218
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,666
But I'm sure I'll still
enjoy them once you're dead.

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,041
I would imagine it must
be pretty embarrassing

220
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,250
for a warrior like yourself
to drown to death

221
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,666
it's almost comical...

222
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,958
Well, maybe not
so comical to you

223
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,666
What's this...?!

224
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,666
No!

225
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,125
What's going on here...?

226
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,333
Can that be me...?

227
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,125
But how...?

228
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,541
I'm--

229
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,416
Just who the hell is that?

230
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,833
No...!

231
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,458
This can't be happening...!

232
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,291
I don't deserve this...!

233
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,458
I can't...

234
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,791
I can't have awakened!

235
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,333
It's not possible...!

236
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,708
Ahhh!

237
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,833
Why...?

238
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,791
What did I do
to deserve this...?

239
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,250
All I ever wanted to do
was avenge my big brother!

240
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,083
How could I turn
into this monster?

241
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,583
I've always been so careful!

242
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,875
None of this would
have happened if

243
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,375
it weren't for that
one-horned bitch!

244
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,958
It's all her fault.

245
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,583
My arm...

246
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,625
Bitch...

247
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,916
What the hell
did you do that for?

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,750
What have I ever
done to you...?

249
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,208
Why did you do that...?

250
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,333
Tell me!

251
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,333
It's all your fault!

252
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,583
You did this...!

253
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,791
You and that bitch
with the invisible sword!

254
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,708
If you hadn't been around,
my brother would be

255
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,541
alive right now...!

256
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,333
And I never would have
ended up like this...!

257
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,708
I'll rip you apart
for what you've done!

258
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,041
Damn you...

259
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,166
Who the hell
do you think you are?

260
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,666
My name is Clare...

261
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,208
Ranked number 47
in the Organization.

262
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,583
Created with Teresa's flesh
and blood and the vare

263
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,958
of Ilena's right arm...

264
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,083
It is my mission to take
the head of Priscilla,

265
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,958
the one-horned Awakened Being.

266
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,291
And if I must...

267
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,208
I'll tear out your heart to make
sure that I accomplish my goal.

268
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,916
Damn you bitch!

269
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,375
Did I misjudge my
boundaries...?

270
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,791
No...

271
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,583
It's because I'm not
used to Ilena's arm.

272
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,333
I see.

273
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,041
Well that explains
your new limb, doesn't it?

274
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,041
I knew I'd seen it somewhere.

275
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,500
Ilena's arm...

276
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,708
Did you kill her for it
or did she just give you

277
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,083
the damn thing?

278
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,000
That's how you were able
to improve so quickly.

279
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:18,333
Are you completely unleashing
your Yoki aura into your arm?

280
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,416
Then I guess all you have to do
is keep a grip on your sword...

281
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,666
And try not to awaken,
of course...

282
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,291
Does that just about cover it?

283
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,708
So dangerous...

284
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,041
Isn't it...?

285
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,000
Just look at you!

286
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,416
You can't even stop shaking,

287
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,208
how can you ever hope
to control that arm?

288
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,875
There...

289
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,458
Everything that remains of my
humanity, is now right here.

290
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,333
In other words, this is where
I'm the most vulnerable.

291
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,000
Now how about we
play a little game...?

292
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,666
Doesn't that sound like fun?

293
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,375
All you have to do is
chop your way through

294
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,208
my entire body
until you get down here.

295
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:17,458
If you reach me before the Yoki
aura takes control, you win...

296
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,458
But if you awaken, I do...

297
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,958
And you weren't
strong enough to fight

298
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,583
the one-horned monster, anyway.

299
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,833
Understand...?

300
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,833
Are we clear on the rules?

301
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,500
In the event that I lose...

302
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,916
as per your request, I'll even
allow you to tear my heart out.

303
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,875
How foolish...

304
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,833
She could have come
straight for my weak spot

305
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,666
instead of playing along.

306
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,041
Why is she pushing herself?

307
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,708
She's already
come close to awakening.

308
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,250
Doesn't she have
any consideration

309
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,166
for who she'll leave
behind if she fails...?

310
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,291
Wait.

311
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,416
What made me think that?

312
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,333
Hurry, sis...!

313
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,625
It's your only chance!

314
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,666
I'll distract it,
just get away!

315
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,166
Run!

316
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,875
Please, sis!

317
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,333
We don't have much time.

318
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,208
Oh...

319
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,750
I remember...

320
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,250
Brother...

321
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,791
He tried to protect me from
her by sacrificing himself.

322
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,750
Attacking a powerful
enemy alone...

323
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,333
knowing there's
no hope for victory.

324
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,875
It's so...

325
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,291
pointless.

326
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,875
So, seems you aren't
strong enough...

327
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,333
You barely made it half way.

328
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,458
Damn it...

329
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,458
You bitch...

330
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,500
Why...

331
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,708
Why did ...

332
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,208
My arm...

333
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,416
It won't--

334
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,666
My arm won't...

335
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,458
move!

336
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,416
Are you just giving up now...?!

337
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,666
What if you die?

338
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,125
Have you thought about
what happens to everyone

339
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,833
who depends on you if
I kill you right here?

340
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,375
Oh, what the hell...

341
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,333
If you want it,
come and get it.

342
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,541
Ah...

343
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,125
Maybe that was a mistake.

344
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,000
That was quite impressive...

345
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,166
I was wrong about you.

346
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,875
You played by
the rules and won...

347
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,541
though you still
may not be a match

348
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,541
for the one-horned demon...

349
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,458
It's truly infuriating...

350
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,041
I despise people like you
who put their own lives

351
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,125
in jeopardy for some
glorious, hopeless cause.

352
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,375
Now aren't you going
to tear my heart out...?

353
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,750
That is the honor you were
fighting me for, is it not?

354
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,416
No...

355
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,791
it's not.

356
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,708
You're fighting in my place,
so if you lose...

357
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,416
you won't- be forgiven.

358
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,000
That's why Brother was smiling.

359
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,083
Because he knew...

360
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,625
that by dying he'd
been able to protect me.

361
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,041
all this time
I thought he was weak...

362
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,583
I was wrong.

363
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,583
I'm sorry...

364
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,208
I'm coming to join you...

365
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,416
so we can play again...

366
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,333
Brother...

367
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,125
Wandering thoughts...

368
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,916
A wandering warrior...

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,166
The appearance of
a menacing threat.

370
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,291
Next time...

371
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,208
"The Witch's Maw, Part 1"
