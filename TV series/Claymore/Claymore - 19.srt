1
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,333
Speaking of-

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,583
I've come here with an
interesting new assignment.

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,583
Multiple Awakened Beings
have gathered in the north.

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,708
Several warriors,
including Number Seven,

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,750
have fallen in our
attempt to destroy them.

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:25,875
You're next assignment is to do
what the others could not...

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,791
Oh, one more thing.

8
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,375
Do you remember the young boy
you were traveling with...?

9
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,625
Our resources tell us he's
begun moving north as well.

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,833
I count twenty-four warriors
here, so we'll split everyone

11
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,000
into five separate units,
each with four or five

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,708
members per unit.

13
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,541
Some of you may have fought
Awakened Beings before now...

14
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,916
The strategy is simple,
but has proven very effective

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,458
for us in the past...

16
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,416
Each team will focus its efforts
on a single Awakened Being.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,416
Don't leave your team or
your target for any reason.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,416
There are twenty-four people.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,875
What do you think the odds are
we'll actually accomplish

20
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,583
our goal?

21
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,083
This operation...

22
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,583
has absolutely
no chance of success.

23
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,208
Evening, everyone...

24
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,500
Anyone want to show
a stranger around?

25
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,000
That was pretty good...

26
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,458
I'm actually
starting to have fun!

27
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,000
It's times like this...

28
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,833
that remind me why I became
a monster in the first place!

29
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,375
Here he comes!

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,666
Everyone out of the way!

31
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,125
If you can't dodge an attack,
get out of the way!

32
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,375
Move it!

33
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,958
Out of ten fighters
we've only got six left.

34
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,250
What do you think, Miss Flora?

35
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,750
Is that enough
to handle the job?

36
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,291
Not even close Miss Undine,
but it will have to suffice.

37
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,541
Dammit!

38
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,208
Get back here!

39
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,250
Wait!

40
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,583
What do you think
you're doing?

41
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,583
Stop! We attack as a unit!

42
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,583
You brainless things are
such a pain in the ass.

43
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,916
Do me a favor; take your own
head so I don't have to.

44
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,375
Good.

45
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,333
Undine!

46
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:43,708
Like I thought.

47
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,458
All bark and no bite.

48
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,625
If all you wanted me to
do was nick my own face,

49
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,958
you could have just asked.

50
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,208
I'd have been glad
to save you the trouble. Really.

51
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,375
Impossible!

52
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,750
No one is strong enough
to resist me!

53
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,458
Think again!

54
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,500
Just stay right there
while I decide how

55
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,875
I'm going to kill you.

56
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,875
He's in complete control
of her Yoki aura!

57
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,458
Sorry, but if it's
all the same to you,

58
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,708
I think I'd rather stand.

59
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,583
Not bad.

60
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,375
Everyone get
ready to move in!

61
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,625
No!

62
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,708
Stay where you are...

63
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,125
She hasn't fully
regained her control.

64
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,416
Let go!

65
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,000
Undine, no!

66
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,583
Don't come any closer!

67
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,583
I can handle this little
bastard all by myself.

68
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:17,916
Injured fighters!

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,125
Back!

70
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,000
Worthless son of a bitch!

71
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,833
Tough talk for someone who only
has a few seconds left to live.

72
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,250
We have to do something!

73
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,125
No...!

74
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,750
I said I can handle this...!

75
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,625
You'll only get in the way!

76
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,625
You fools, you're asking for it!

77
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,333
Knock it off!

78
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,583
Sorry, Captain,
it's nothing personal.

79
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,791
The two of them working together
can't even break his hide!

80
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,583
Eight...

81
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,875
Nine.

82
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,625
Hurry, Jean!

83
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,000
We need you!

84
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,750
I'm trying...

85
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,625
Almost there.

86
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,291
You don't really
think you can win?

87
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,166
Enough is enough...!

88
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,958
It's time you
learned your place.

89
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,083
Seventeen...

90
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,208
Three more to go.

91
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,458
Let's see-.

92
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,583
What am I going to do
with the two of you?

93
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,166
Are you sure
you want to do that?

94
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,916
It's one thing to call on
your Yoma power...

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,500
But at that rate,
you'll awaken in no time.

96
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,750
And trust me,
there's no turning back.

97
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,125
No!

98
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,166
They've gone too far!

99
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,750
He's right!

100
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,416
I hate to say 'I told you so.'

101
00:07:59,416 --> 00:07:59,958
That's...

102
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,958
Twenty!

103
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,791
We're almost there now.

104
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,958
What a pathetic bunch you are.

105
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,166
Ten of the Organization's
best and you can't even land

106
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,833
a scratch on me.

107
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,416
Or maybe I simply don't
know my own power.

108
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,375
Struggling will
get you nowhere.

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,875
Twenty-one.

110
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,500
And just in time.

111
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,875
You're going to have
to do better than that.

112
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,500
How's that...? Good enough?

113
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,375
It's about time.

114
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,416
Hold on...

115
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
What are you doing?!

116
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,625
Miss Veronica...

117
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,500
Have you noticed how
thankless this all is...?

118
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,666
We act as bait...

119
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,375
We risk our lives...

120
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,875
Sustain injuries
from head to toe.

121
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,500
You have a good point there...

122
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,125
But as defenders, it's the
job we're best suited for.

123
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,250
It can't be helped...

124
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,041
But it has it's moments.

125
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,625
We get to finish
this bastard off!

126
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,375
Wait!

127
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,708
You can't!

128
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,916
You've awakened...

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,666
Surprise, surprise.

130
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,333
I don't understand.

131
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,916
You both have
surpassed your limits!

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,416
What is this?

133
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,458
But I saw them...

134
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,500
But how...?

135
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,500
You can't turn back
after awakening!

136
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,166
Either you're mistaken...

137
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,250
Or you've been
imagining things.

138
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,416
Now...

139
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,708
What do you say
we put an end to this?

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,875
Dammit!

141
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,208
Knock it off!

142
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,125
Stop...!

143
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,541
Just give it up!

144
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,083
Deneve no!

145
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,375
A noble effort.

146
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,375
But you're badly outmatched.

147
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,750
If you wanted to stop me, you
should have cut off my head

148
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,416
when you had the chance.

149
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,333
One blow isn't enough.

150
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,750
He's too hard.

151
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,291
Have your injuries
sapped your strength,

152
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,666
or were you just too
weak to begin with...?

153
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,708
Go on, tell me.

154
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,541
I promise not to judge you.

155
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,250
Unlike my esteemed
present company,

156
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,375
I'm not enamored
with my own muscles...

157
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,083
I prefer technique.

158
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,333
No...!

159
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,750
You can't do this!

160
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,750
They did it!

161
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,916
That's it...

162
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,500
You asked for it!

163
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,041
Stay back!

164
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,250
All of you...!

165
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,500
He still has the ability
to control our Yoki!

166
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,833
If you're sending me to hell...

167
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,875
then I'm taking you two
weaklings along for the ride.

168
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,416
And since you're both already
in the beheading mood...

169
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,458
Are they going to be okay?

170
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,166
They'll be fine...

171
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,833
But that was a close call.

172
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,166
Damn...

173
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,083
See, this is why I'm always
saying the weak ones

174
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,125
only hold us back...

175
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,166
Well, look who
actually pulled it off.

176
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,291
Our team finished up
a little early.

177
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,916
We thought we might swing by
and lend you guys a hand.

178
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,916
But it looks like
there's no need.

179
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,791
It's good to see I'm not
the only one too slow

180
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,166
to escape injury.

181
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,958
Where is Miria...?

182
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,041
If she was left to fight
with only her own team,

183
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,666
we have to find
her and help out!

184
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,041
What are you worrying about?

185
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,375
Stop.

186
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,916
She's a big girl;
she can take care of herself.

187
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,291
She's...

188
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,791
not bad...

189
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,500
All right!

190
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,666
And not even a scratch!

191
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,083
I know you've gotten stronger
as a result of things

192
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,125
you've experienced
in the field...

193
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,416
But Miria's seen more
than you or I ever will.

194
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,291
It might be difficult for you
to understand, but...

195
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,500
Miria's situation is
far more complicated

196
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,708
than any other
fighter out here.

197
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,166
It seems both units were able
to slay their target.

198
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,791
And with minimal damage.

199
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,500
As for our team, Uma lost
her left arm in combat...

200
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,041
Luckily she's a defender, so
I'm confident she'll be able

201
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,500
to regenerate it
once she's rested.

202
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,166
Unfortunately, until Uma
is able to regenerate,

203
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,333
we're left one fighter short...

204
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,250
Similar injuries should
be reported to me

205
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,458
so the teams can
be restructured.

206
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,166
I don't like this.

207
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,666
So, what?

208
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,041
In this game, we're all the
pawns and you're the queen,

209
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,458
does that about cover it...?

210
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,666
Maybe your majesty
wouldn't mind explaining:

211
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,916
What were you really
hoping to accomplish?

212
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,375
You put experienced fighters
on the same field as those

213
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,875
who've never even seen an
Awakened Being before.

214
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,916
And what do you know,
they couldn't cut it.

215
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,625
In fact, all they did
was get in the way.

216
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,541
Most of this bloodshed
could have been avoided

217
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,583
if the rookies were assigned
to back up the veterans

218
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,958
from the get-go...

219
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:42,875
Well...?

220
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,375
Wouldn't you agree, my Queen?

221
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,416
Think long and hard
before you respond,

222
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,750
because your answer may lose
you your strongest fighter.

223
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,541
Does anyone know
how many of us fell in battle?

224
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,708
Most of us took a hit or two,
but we all survived...

225
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,250
Just shy of a miracle,
if you think about it.

226
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,875
So what you're saying is-

227
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,583
As a result of today's action,

228
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,875
all of us have now experienced
fighting an Awakened Being.

229
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,833
Miria's true intention in
organizing today's assignments

230
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,958
was to put every last fighter on
equal footing in the field...

231
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,833
which raised the
potential of each unit...

232
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,166
Unless I'm mistaken.

233
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,208
Whatever the case...

234
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,000
Any number of us could have
been killed in that battle...

235
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:39,625
And I'd prefer not to die
for a training exercise.

236
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,875
Thank you all
for your efforts today...

237
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,041
Try to get
whatever rest you can...

238
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,208
It only gets harder from here.

239
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,333
Are you sure about this?

240
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,666
Someone's bound to
realize sooner or later.

241
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,833
With the forces we have now...

242
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,291
We have no chance of
making it out alive.

243
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,791
Our situation is dire, but we
can't do much to change it...

244
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,541
We're stuck fighting
with our backs to the wall.

245
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,125
Our only option is
to get stronger...

246
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,250
If we want to win this,
it's up to us to improve...

247
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,791
If we don't, every
fighter here will die.

248
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,041
It's the only
chance we have left.

249
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,625
Our only- chance.

250
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,083
Raki...

251
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,083
Be careful.

252
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:11,916
Thank god...

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,291
This isn't Clare's sword...

254
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,125
Oh, thank god.

255
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,666
This is a ghost town.

256
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,500
Is it possible that
everyone who lived here

257
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,750
was wiped out by monsters?

258
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,791
What could have happened here?

259
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,875
Are you okay...?

260
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,208
Are you hurt?

261
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:30,916
Sorry!

262
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,166
I just- I didn't mean to-!

263
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,458
I'm...

264
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,958
sorry.

265
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,041
What're you doing...?

266
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,708
I'm sorry.
Just hold on a second...

267
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,625
--Hold on.
--Hey!

268
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,291
I was wondering
where you'd run off to...

269
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,250
Is something wrong?

270
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,208
This boy, he smells good.

271
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,250
I haven't seen you get
that attached to someone

272
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,500
in a long time...

273
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,500
You're not...

274
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,500
from around here, are you?

275
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,875
No...

276
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,125
I've traveled a long way
from my home in the south...

277
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,833
There's someone that
I've been trying to find...

278
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,833
I heard a rumor that someone
matching her description

279
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,458
was seen around here,
so I came to look.

280
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,166
Ah, a southerner...?

281
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,166
Well, that explains the smell...

282
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,000
My friend here can
probably still smell

283
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,541
the warmth of
the south on you...

284
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,708
Someday...

285
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,541
I hope I can show her
the south myself.

286
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,583
Well...

287
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,375
I haven't seen
anyone here but you.

288
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,916
Was this town
destroyed by monsters too?

289
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,458
I wouldn't worry
much about it.

290
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,125
You're the closest
thing to a monster

291
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,166
we've seen since we arrived.

292
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,500
You're not used to the cold.

293
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,708
You must be freezing...

294
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,041
We should look for shelter...

295
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,000
Would you care to join us?

296
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,375
It's rare my companion gets
attached to someone like this...

297
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,833
Would you do me a favor and
keep her company for a while?

298
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:57,541
Uh...

299
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,416
I guess so...

300
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,833
All right.

301
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,083
Come along then.

302
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,833
Priscilla.

303
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,750
The sun that never sinks.

304
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,541
The hope that does.

305
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,208
The distant dawn.

306
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:56,333
Next time: The Carnage
in the North, Part Three.
