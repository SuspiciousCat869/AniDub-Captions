1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,916
You see we use "Voracious
Eater" as a code word...

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,250
Publicly it's much
easier to explain what

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,125
those creatures are by
referring to them as such.

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,291
What we're actually
talking about here are

5
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,166
"Awakened Beings."

6
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,250
Miria!

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,750
Dammit.

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,500
The organization gave us
wrong information...!

9
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,958
We're supposed to be facing just
a normal Voracious Eater...

10
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,916
But a creature like this...!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,041
Do they really expect the
four of us to take on

12
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,250
something of this magnitude?

13
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,458
What is it?

14
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,333
No...

15
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,083
You've gotta be kidding me...

16
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,833
A male Awakened Being?!

17
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,541
Ah, I see you made it Galatea.

18
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,666
You must have summoned me
for a reason Ermita.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,041
What is it?

20
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,375
Near that mountain.

21
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,291
I'm sure you can
sense the Yoma's Yoki

22
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,333
without any difficulty.

23
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,000
But how...?

24
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,916
How could there possibly be
a male Awakened Being?

25
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,125
Here it comes...

26
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,208
Watch yourselves!

27
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,791
Deneve!

28
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,583
That tasted foul.

29
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,458
Helen!

30
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,833
Above you!

31
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,166
He's too fast...!

32
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,458
Get out now!

33
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,291
Behind you!

34
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,291
Just step back forty-seven!

35
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,875
Clare is down!

36
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:40,583
Damn...!

37
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,916
Stupid idiot...!

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,875
She has no skills but
decides to butt in anyway!

39
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,958
That's too many arms...

40
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,958
It's really quite disgusting...

41
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,250
But don't worry, I'll
take care of it for you.

42
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,625
Damn!

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,083
You're still alive!

44
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,458
I hope your
rotten flesh is burning...

45
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,333
I thought she was dead...

46
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,083
Her rate of regeneration
is unbelievable!

47
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,416
I can't believe her entire arm
has almost regrown...

48
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,041
Helen's ability to
lengthen her arms

49
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,125
is a very advanced
technique...!

50
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,041
And now, looking at
the design of her armor...

51
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,916
I'm willing to bet her legs
have the same attributes.

52
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,833
Both of their abilities would
normally push a warrior

53
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,000
to the limit of
their Yoki powers...

54
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,791
But these two do it as if
its second nature to them.

55
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,416
I hope its enough to
help defeat this creature...

56
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,958
Oh great,
so you're still here...?

57
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,333
Do us all a favor and
run while you're still alive.

58
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,875
There's no place for you
in this fight.

59
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,000
We're gonna have
to take his head.

60
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,250
We could hack
at his arms all day

61
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,250
and it wouldn't
make any difference.

62
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:18,791
Tell me...

63
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,833
what are you sensing?

64
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,625
I'm picking up Yoki auras.

65
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,458
One is powerful.

66
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,583
Two are average.

67
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,083
Another is very small
and insignificant...

68
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,833
and the last one
remaining is enormous,

69
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,958
easily surpassing the others.

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,708
That's our Awakened Being.

71
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,000
Awakened Being?

72
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:42,041
Actually, it is a male
awakened being, Galetea.

73
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,875
Did you say a male?

74
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,916
How can we be dealing with
a male Awakened Being...?

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,916
I thought they could
only be female fighters who

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,208
happened to pass
their Yoki limit.

77
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,916
The Organization is to blame
for these monsters.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,041
In the beginning
they made male warriors ...

79
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,791
I've never heard that...

80
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,125
Claymores...

81
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,208
Yes.

82
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,208
When they first
began making warriors

83
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,958
they were both
male and female...

84
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,250
but over time the males proved
to be complete failures.

85
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,166
That is incorrect.

86
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,625
Our warriors were
not failures at all.

87
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,041
In fact, quite the opposite.

88
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,625
The males were very
valuable assets to us.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When it came to fighting
they were unmatched.

90
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,958
But fighting
wasn't the problem.

91
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,041
The real issue was that
every last one of the males

92
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,958
reached their limit
far too quickly.

93
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:49,041
You see, awakening is very
similar to sexual pleasure.

94
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,416
The more the males
released their Yoki...

95
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,458
The harder it became
for them to suppress

96
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,958
the overwhelming
urge to awaken.

97
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,875
Unfortunately...

98
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:10,166
there was no choice but to stop
the production of male warriors.

99
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,333
Let me guess.

100
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,625
After that there was
nothing left for the

101
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,250
male awakened beings to
do but to walk the earth

102
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,916
as Voracious Eaters.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,625
Precisely.

104
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,041
And since the male warriors
were bound to awaken

105
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,291
they only produced
females after that...

106
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,208
I can't believe that none
of you have ever been briefed

107
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,083
on this information.

108
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,916
Not bad but there's one
part of the story that you

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,750
neglected to cover.

110
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,458
I left something out?

111
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,041
Indeed...

112
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,791
And frankly I'm surprised you
haven't figured it out yet...

113
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,458
being as clever as you are.

114
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,333
You still haven't figured
out why you specifically

115
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,583
were sent to hunt me down.

116
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,625
Were we all chosen
for a reason?

117
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,500
Seems like there's
something bothering you.

118
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,041
You bastard.

119
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,416
Is something wrong?

120
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,875
I feel a sense of uneasiness
and surprise in the aura's.

121
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,333
Perhaps we should move closer;
it's hard for me to judge

122
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,916
the situation clearly
from this distance.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,166
We can't.

124
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,250
If we move any closer
then they'll know we've

125
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,750
been watching them.

126
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,500
You're the only one
I know of who can sense

127
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,291
Yoki from this distance...

128
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,666
that of course is the
reason you were summoned.

129
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,041
It doesn't seem right somehow.

130
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,958
Alright then...

131
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,083
I believe that now
is as good a time as any.

132
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,375
I think you need a taste...

133
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,625
of the pain true despair
can bring you.

134
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,875
All of you stay back!

135
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,291
Enough!

136
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,708
Bastard!

137
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,250
True despair, as promised...

138
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,791
well, what do you think?

139
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,416
Damn you...

140
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,000
this must stop...

141
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,041
it has to...

142
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,125
You know it's really too bad...

143
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:49,625
I'm sure that you are one of
the very best claymores.

144
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,458
You are perceptive...

145
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,875
clever...

146
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,208
but a good warrior
needs more than strength.

147
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:01,500
In order to thrive you must be
intelligent and resourceful.

148
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,333
But then again a warrior
can be too clever...

149
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,833
and if you're not careful
it can also get you killed.

150
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,166
What are you...?
When were you a Claymore?

151
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,791
I am exactly
what you said I was...

152
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,541
I am a monster formed from
a male Claymore years ago...

153
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,541
That's all.

154
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,541
Nothing more, nothing less.

155
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,625
I killed all the warriors
who were delivered to me...

156
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,083
Of course, not without a fight.

157
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,833
I simply do what I must
in order to survive...

158
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,291
I will do what
I must as well...

159
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,458
Excuse me.

160
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,916
Here's your meal.

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,333
Please enjoy...

162
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,791
So tell me...

163
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,583
what happened...

164
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,333
to that friend of yours?

165
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,791
Uh...

166
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,166
Well Clare, she had to do
some job up on the mountain.

167
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,833
Up on the mountain...?

168
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,708
I'm sorry son...

169
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,833
there was a group of
Claymores that had to do

170
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,041
something up there
a little while ago...

171
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,625
But unfortunately,
they never came back down.

172
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,791
And no one has heard
any word about them since.

173
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,333
Oh uh...

174
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,208
but I'm sure she's okay...

175
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,166
please make yourself at home.

176
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,666
Clare.

177
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,541
Her stomach is
beginning to regenerate.

178
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,250
The wound is very deep ...

179
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,541
Her chances of survival
are uncertain at this point.

180
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,416
Looks like I'm on my own.

181
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,041
Is this really the time
to be concerning yourself

182
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,916
with their safety...?

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,750
It seems to me that it would
be much more practical...

184
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,666
to give me a little
bit of a fight before

185
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,833
I rip you limb from limb.

186
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,583
She's alive.

187
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,666
I will end your existence!

188
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,041
An illusion?

189
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,583
Her back is badly damaged...

190
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,666
Her chance
of survival is minimal...

191
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,208
In this condition...

192
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,791
she's not going to be
much help in this battle.

193
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,125
Now I get it.

194
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,541
Very good.

195
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,250
You can only do it
for a moment.

196
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,291
But you're capable
of incredible speed.

197
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,583
I'm willing to bet that you're
one of the fastest warriors

198
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,166
in the organization,
very impressive Claymore.

199
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,416
Seems you've certainly earned
your single digit ranking.

200
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,541
To the naked eye the
effect looks like a ghost...

201
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,000
which must be why
they gave you that name...

202
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,750
I believe it was Phantom Miria?

203
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,083
It is a great technique...

204
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,791
the question is how long will
work against me, Claymore?

205
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,708
Let's find out together.

206
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh my, are you mad?

207
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,708
Charging into your
honorable death!

208
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,250
How heroic!

209
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,083
Die you bitch!

210
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,041
Damn her...

211
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,541
she's good.

212
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,041
I don't get it...

213
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,625
if she could do that all along
why did she wait until now

214
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,166
to pull it out?

215
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,291
More than likely,
her strategy was to wait

216
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,125
and save that move as
a finishing blow on him.

217
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,208
However...

218
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,958
she didn't intend
to use it so soon.

219
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,916
Huh?

220
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,791
You see producing that much Yoki
aura all at once is amazing...

221
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,041
But a technique like that
is bound to take a great toll

222
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,458
on her both
physically and mentally.

223
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,666
If I were her, I would limit
myself as to how many times

224
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,375
I used the technique...

225
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,583
maybe ten times...

226
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,833
or twenty...

227
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,291
but that's the maximum
amount for any battle.

228
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,583
Unfortunately in this current
one she's used it over

229
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,125
thirty times now...

230
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,791
I would be surprised if
she didn't awaken very soon...

231
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,750
Oh what the hell
would you know anyway...?

232
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm not going to sit
here and listen to the

233
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,833
lowest ranked warrior!

234
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,291
I got you...

235
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,875
Miria!

236
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,708
It was impressive
how long you lasted...

237
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,833
but in the end
it was a wasted effort...

238
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,541
all I had to do was wait
for you to reach your limit...

239
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,083
and then move in
for the kill.

240
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,583
Now then...

241
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,583
I have the joy of
deciding how I'm going

242
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,458
to torture you to death.

243
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,750
Damn it!

244
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,958
It's no use!

245
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,166
I can't...

246
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,375
I can't make my body move!

247
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,083
This is it...

248
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,833
I now know what he meant...

249
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,833
He promised that he was going to
give us true despair and he has!

250
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,291
Pull it together.

251
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,041
Despair will get us killed...

252
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,958
This battle has
gone on long enough...

253
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,291
This Awakened Being
is powerful...

254
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,458
but, it will not
leave here alive.

255
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,833
Wait...

256
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:27,791
you're still hurt...

257
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,291
you can't...

258
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:34,708
But...

259
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,250
impossible...

260
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,041
how can you still be standing
after all of your injuries?

261
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,375
I wondered what that noise was.

262
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,833
It looks like the weakest one
still wants to play with me.

263
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,416
What happened?

264
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:03,833
What...?

265
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,208
No!

266
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,666
What's going on...?

267
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,958
She's avoiding
all of his attacks!

268
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,875
How is she doing that?

269
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,166
Stay calm.

270
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,708
Hold back your Yoki aura
as much as you can

271
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,500
Be aware of its flow
and it's limits ...

272
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:29,708
focusing on it will allow you
the greatest perception.

273
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,916
That's it.

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,375
Keep your eye on the aura.

275
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,333
Just stay calm
and focused and you can

276
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:39,041
easily predict his next move.

277
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,708
And here it comes!

278
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,291
She's dodging...

279
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,416
but she's doing it before
he can even make his move.

280
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,666
It's like she knows
what he's going to do!

281
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,250
That's it!

282
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,083
I didn't realize it before!

283
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,916
When we were fighting
she wasn't looking at me

284
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,541
she was watching my aura!

285
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,291
Even in that friendly
fight while we were

286
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,875
both holding back...

287
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,916
she was still looking
for whatever Yoki flow

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,625
I was maintaining.

289
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,541
No!

290
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,500
Come on die...!

291
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,791
Die damn you!

292
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,000
when she's facing an opponent
who's more powerful than her...

293
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,500
it becomes much easier
to follow their aura!

294
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,500
And versus this
Awakened Being...

295
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,291
who has no trouble releasing the
full might of his abilities,

296
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,625
she is the ideal fighter!

297
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,000
It can't be...

298
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,666
Is it possible?

299
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,875
Did she develop this skill
for the sole purpose

300
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,333
of defeating Awakened Beings?

301
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,958
What is it?

302
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,458
Something's changed...

303
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,583
interesting.

304
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,666
Is that so?

305
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,416
I don't understand why...

306
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,750
But it's impossible to
gauge how powerful you are.

307
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,791
That's because she moves based
on the aura she's tracking...

308
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,791
the problem is she can't see it
as well when she attacks.

309
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,541
She should practice
switching between modes.

310
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,958
Either that or learn
to read auras while attacking.

311
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,583
Otherwise no matter how
great the technique may be

312
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,583
it's useless on
the battlefield.

313
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,041
Miria!

314
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,250
You're doing well...

315
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,041
but you would benefit
from much more training.

316
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,291
Yes, that is obvious...

317
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,250
painfully obvious.

318
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,125
Wait...

319
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,458
wait a minute...

320
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,000
Let's be reasonable.

321
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,125
I'll tell you anything
you want to know, I swear it.

322
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,333
Careful, he's preparing
for an attack.

323
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,458
I know that.

324
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,541
I am in the single
digits after all.

325
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,541
It's sad.

326
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,166
There are a lot of questions
that I would like to ask you,

327
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,666
but I doubt that you
would tell me the truth.

328
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,916
Here we go...

329
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,250
stay quick and focused.

330
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,041
The same to you.

331
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,500
Damn it...!

332
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,583
This can't happen!

333
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,958
I will not be
destroyed by you!

334
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,791
Impossible.

335
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,458
You're nothing!

336
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,416
The end of one battle...

337
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,666
The beginning of another...

338
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,500
and the fighter's oath...

339
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:55,000
Next time "Those Who
Rend Asunder Part III"
