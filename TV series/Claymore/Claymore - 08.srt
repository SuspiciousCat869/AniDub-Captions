1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:14,916
I understand...

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,583
I will bring her down...

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,583
Traitors must be
stopped at all costs!

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,958
My apologies, Teresa...

5
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:26,041
If I had my choice,
I alone would destroy you...

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,666
But you have brought this on...

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,750
Yourself!

8
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,291
Here we go.

9
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,916
Teresa!

10
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,166
Damn!

11
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,458
Ilena!

12
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,000
Ilena...!

13
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:43,958
Ilena!

14
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,333
Are you all right...?!

15
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,666
Ilena?!

16
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,333
Don't mind me...

17
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,791
Go!

18
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,833
But I...

19
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,333
I told you...

20
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,666
We were sent here
to do a job...

21
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,041
so do it!

22
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,333
Forget about me...

23
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:05,083
Just do everything in your
power to take Teresa's head!

24
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,250
Right!

25
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,041
Damn it...

26
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,791
With the four of us...

27
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,541
I thought that maybe
we could somehow...

28
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,125
close in on Teresa, but...

29
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,375
Is that it...?

30
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,541
Was that my error...?

31
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,166
Have I been underestimating
Teresa the whole time?

32
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,916
Extraordinary...

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,291
She hasn't even begun
to access her Yoki powers...

34
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,916
What now?

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,291
Clare...

36
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,625
Go back to the inn and
gather up our belongings...

37
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,041
We can't allow ourselves to be a
further burden on this town...

38
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,458
We're leaving.

39
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
Now then...

40
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,750
No...!

41
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,625
She can sense it...!

42
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,125
Priscilla's true potential...

43
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:30,833
She sees someone who
could surpass even her!

44
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,416
And she intends to make sure
that it never happens,

45
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
right here and now.

46
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,041
Teresa of the Faint Smile
is to be feared...

47
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,500
No matter how many times
she has to fight us,

48
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,458
we pose no threat to her...

49
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,541
So she hurt us just enough
to immobilize us...

50
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,333
But Priscilla, who should
still be on her feet...

51
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,250
is frozen with
terror in the face

52
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,333
of Teresa's
overwhelming strength!

53
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,958
I'm...

54
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm scared...!

55
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,625
I'm so scared...

56
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,416
I don't want to die...

57
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,625
I don't want to die!

58
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,208
Please, somebody...

59
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,041
Come save me...!

60
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,291
Daddy...?

61
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,291
Daddy, please...!

62
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,416
Save me!

63
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,958
I swear I must be going soft...

64
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,166
That face will just
keep haunting my conscience.

65
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,583
Teresa!

66
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,666
Got it all...!

67
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,000
Even this 'thing' that
you wear around your waist.

68
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,458
You actually bothered
to bring that too...?

69
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,375
Must've been heavy, huh?

70
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,000
Huh-uh.

71
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,208
You can come attack me
all you want...

72
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,708
I'll defeat you
at each encounter...

73
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,166
Farewell...

74
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,208
Sorry for the mess.

75
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,416
Inconceivable...!

76
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,291
Teresa showing mercy
to an enemy...?

77
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,666
The old Teresa would not have
hesitated to behead her!

78
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,125
However...

79
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,625
at least now,
we still have hope.

80
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,583
Stop crying...!

81
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,791
The fight isn't over yet...!

82
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,250
Now get up!

83
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,541
Unfor--...

84
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,791
Unforgi--...

85
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,875
Unforgivable!

86
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,250
Unforgivable...

87
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,916
Unforgivable.

88
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,875
Unforgivable...

89
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,500
Unforgivable...

90
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,333
Unforgivable...

91
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,416
Unforgivable!

92
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,833
Priscilla...

93
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,458
Teresa's a murderer...!

94
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,166
She's a villain...!

95
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,166
She violated the
Organization's rules!

96
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,750
Stop this...!

97
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,583
It's beyond your control, you
cannot defeat Teresa like this!

98
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,333
Don't go!

99
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,541
Damn brat...!

100
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,666
There's no way
she'll be able to stop her!

101
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,958
Careless...!

102
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,791
I was so mesmerized
by her latent abilities...

103
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,583
that I forgot she
is still just a child!

104
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:42,958
You all right...?

105
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,541
Noel?

106
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,541
Sophia?

107
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,666
--Yeah.
--Yes!

108
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,500
Good...

109
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,583
Let's move...

110
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,625
She has no idea
what her limits are yet!

111
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,541
Don't do it.

112
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,291
With the state you're in now,
we can fight again and again,

113
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,000
and you will never win.

114
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,666
Priscilla, let it go...

115
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,333
If you unleash too much power
without proper training

116
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,083
you will not turn back.

117
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,833
When we mixed-breeds release ten
percent of our Yoki powers,

118
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,083
the color of our eyes change...

119
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,875
At thirty, it shows
on our faces...

120
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,250
At fifty, our physiques change.

121
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,833
Once you pass eighty
percent, you have no hope

122
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,375
of ever changing
back to normal...

123
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,166
As it stands right now...

124
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,125
You should already
be well over seventy.

125
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,125
Shut up!

126
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,791
You are a murderer...!

127
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,791
A filthy murderer!

128
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,625
The limits to which you
can use your power...

129
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,791
are something you have to learn
gradually from fight to fight.

130
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,875
You however...

131
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,083
lack that level
of experience entirely.

132
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,291
Shut your mouth!

133
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,625
Her Yoki aura is massive...

134
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,833
I can't even read
the energy flow.

135
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,625
Watch out!

136
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,208
You're bleeding!

137
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,375
How dare you
kill my father...?!

138
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,541
how dare you...

139
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,333
Unforgivable...

140
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,541
just die...

141
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,541
you, hear me?! I'll
kill you. I'll kill you!

142
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,833
Her self-awareness
is fading quickly...

143
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,291
Fine then...

144
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,958
I've run out of options...

145
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,375
Just this once...

146
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,750
I'll put a bit
of effort into it.

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,583
Damn...

148
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,208
unbelievable...

149
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,833
The Yoki auras
I'm sensing are insane!

150
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,125
I agree.

151
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,333
It's basically just
two monsters over there...

152
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,625
What could we
possibly do against them?

153
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,375
Both auras are greater than
anything I have ever seen...

154
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,208
But...

155
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,833
What?

156
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,833
It's clear one of them
far exceeds the other...

157
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,375
But which one?

158
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,541
What--...?

159
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,041
What the--...?

160
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,416
Is...

161
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,625
Is that Priscilla?!

162
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:29,833
Ilena...

163
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:30,791
Is she...?

164
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,791
Not yet...

165
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,958
She hasn't
exceeded her limit...

166
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,708
If we stop her now, she should
be able revert to human form.

167
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,708
If we're able to stop her...

168
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,500
How does one even
begin to battle against

169
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,500
such a fantastic,
unbridled power like that?

170
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,041
Amazing...!

171
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,583
Teresa's able to fend off
her furious rage...

172
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,166
Better yet, she's winning!

173
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,041
And using only enough Yoki
power to change her eye color!

174
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,083
Could this be the true
strength of Teresa's power?

175
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,375
Teresa...

176
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,791
While you can
still heed my words...

177
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,833
You're reaching your limit...

178
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,041
Suppress your Yoma side
and revert to human form.

179
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,416
Now focus, you've got to...

180
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,541
You are fast approaching
the point of no return.

181
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,041
My daddy...

182
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,166
Give me back my daddy.

183
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Daddy was always
so kind to me...

184
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,541
I loved him so much...

185
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,500
And he ate them.

186
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,666
He made me watch it...

187
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,583
He ate their innards...

188
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,041
right in front of me!

189
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,416
No!

190
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,250
That's when I had
to kill my daddy...

191
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,833
While he was
eating my big sister...

192
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,041
I chopped off his head!

193
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,083
He made me do it!

194
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,166
She's past her limit...

195
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,041
That's it.

196
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,208
I can't go back...

197
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,500
Help me please...

198
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,208
You have to...

199
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,125
I don't...

200
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,291
I don't want
to live like this!

201
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,708
Too late...

202
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,666
The Yoma side is
all that's left of her.

203
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,750
Please...

204
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,541
I'm sorry...

205
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:51,250
It is no longer within
my power to help you.

206
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,333
About the best
I can give you...

207
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,333
is a swift beheading before
you are completely taken over

208
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,583
by your Yoma side.

209
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,625
Then please...

210
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,458
Take my head...

211
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,000
Kill me...

212
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,041
While my heart...

213
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,750
is still human...

214
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,166
So be it...

215
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,416
I will be sure
you do not suffer.

216
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,708
Te-re...

217
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,333
sa...?

218
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,333
What in the hell is that thing?

219
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,958
That "thing"...

220
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,750
transcends Yoma...

221
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,875
It's a species completely
separate from the human race.

222
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,000
Awakened Being!

223
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,041
Is that it...?

224
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:38,916
All that fuss--there was no
reason for me to hold back.

225
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,458
And I never realized...

226
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,583
it would feel this good.

227
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,291
She's a monster...

228
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,916
Innards...

229
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,916
Time to eat...

230
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,041
I want to tear open
the stomach...

231
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,833
bury my face in the warmth
of wet, bloody entrails...

232
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,708
Savor every piece of viscera...

233
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:26,000
Down to the last
tiny bits of flesh.

234
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,333
No...

235
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,375
Poor Ilena...

236
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,375
What's the matter...?

237
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,291
It seems your arm
has gone missing.

238
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh look...

239
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,083
Here it is...

240
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,916
I suppose you
can have it back...

241
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,666
But do try to hold on to your
belongings in the future.

242
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,125
Noel!

243
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,583
Sophia!

244
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,958
I see...

245
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,916
So all of you here
intend to kill me.

246
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,583
I think you will...

247
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,958
fail.

248
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,750
After all of that activity...

249
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,791
I've worked up
quite an appetite...

250
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,333
Well, then...

251
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,291
Shall we move on?

252
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,500
Time passed...

253
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,833
wounds healed...

254
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,958
The girl took up the sword.

255
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:55,083
Next time, "Those Who
Rend Asunder Part I."
