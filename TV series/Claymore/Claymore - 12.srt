1
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:42,875
Someday I'll be strong
enough to help people, too.

2
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,750
Just like Clare...

3
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,750
You took down those
three Yoma quite easily...

4
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,000
excellent.

5
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,333
Well, they really
weren't that difficult.

6
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,833
Amazing work...

7
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,166
I've noticed that
you've been getting

8
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,750
into less trouble lately,

9
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,416
and I believe your manners have
improved immensely, as well...

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,958
Something happen to you?

11
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,500
It was during the hunt
for the Awakened Being...

12
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,375
I realized what my
limitations were and was

13
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,416
humbled by the experience.

14
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,500
I have another mission,
if it's not too soon.

15
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,875
I need you to go to the
northern city Gonahl

16
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,833
and hunt down an
Awakened Being there.

17
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:25,958
Another one?

18
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,875
Unfortunately
it's not Priscilla...

19
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,791
however this one was once
ranked in the single digits,

20
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,541
and is far more powerful than
the male Awakened Being

21
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,041
you were up against.

22
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:40,166
So you better stay focused
if you want to continue living.

23
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:40,750
Don't worry.

24
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,375
I won't die...

25
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,458
you can trust me on that.

26
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,625
Isn't that encouraging...

27
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,250
I'm counting on it.

28
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,291
At the rate we're going
we'll be in Gonahl by tomorrow.

29
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,000
I want you to stay here, Raki.

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,083
No way!

31
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,750
I wanna go with you!

32
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,916
It's dangerous...

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,750
I'd prefer that you stay.

34
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,416
--Yeah, but Clare I---
--You'll stay until I get back.

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,125
Alright?

36
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,708
Another warrior is nearby.

37
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,625
I'm sensing something else...

38
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,583
very strange ...

39
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,208
I feel as if every cell in my
being is trying to warn me...

40
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,708
what could it be?

41
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,125
Ah...

42
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,625
Good afternoon.

43
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,458
Are we the first ones?

44
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,833
I was sure the rest
would be here by now.

45
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,000
Actually...

46
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,958
I think we're it.

47
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,291
You mean that...

48
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,125
the two of us
will take it on alone?

49
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,666
You got it...

50
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,958
but the truth is I could have
handled this one by myself.

51
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,958
So I guess you're just a bonus.

52
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,000
She's in the single digits...

53
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,541
but is she one of the top five.

54
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,833
Her emblem...

55
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,250
I'll know for
certain when I see it.

56
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't be offended...

57
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:36,291
but you smell very similar
to an Awakened Being, to me.

58
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,458
Hold on...

59
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,666
I just want to
smell you a bit longer...

60
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,500
you see...

61
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,208
I kind of like it.

62
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,625
Too tight...?

63
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,333
Sorry about that.

64
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,750
Just stay still now...

65
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,666
Course, I'm not really giving
you a choice in the matter,

66
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,000
am I?

67
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,375
Now that tastes strange.

68
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,833
It's odd but it also tastes...

69
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,500
familiar...

70
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,750
you seem to be one of us...

71
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,291
but are you?

72
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,208
Let Clare go!

73
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,458
Now!

74
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:21,625
Raki!

75
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,750
Stay back, Clare!

76
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,500
I won't let her hurt you,
I promise...

77
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,458
You want her, come get her.

78
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,500
And who is this child...?

79
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,458
One thing's for sure.

80
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,541
He's a brave little human.

81
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,166
Ah, look...

82
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,041
beautiful, isn't it...?

83
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,333
You only see
this exquisite color

84
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,791
when a body is split open...

85
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,458
more lovely than roses,
don't you think?

86
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,791
And how I'll make
that little boy bloom...

87
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,250
oh yes!

88
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,750
She's...

89
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,291
Number four...

90
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,750
Ophelia.

91
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,166
My, my...

92
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,125
Was that fear in your eyes
when you saw my emblem...?

93
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,500
I guess someone's
been talking about me...

94
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,583
you'll have to tell me who.

95
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,333
I really should thank them...

96
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,583
but first...

97
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,291
Let's try something.

98
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:24,958
Damn!

99
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:25,833
Well good...

100
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,000
you're faster than I expected.

101
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,958
Why are you doing this...?

102
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,458
Have you forgotten the law...?

103
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,333
If you kill a human
then you have to die...

104
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,416
So what...?
Are you wanting death?

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,166
Oh come on now, Clare...

106
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,500
You only die
if you turn yourself in...

107
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,708
Sure they'd chop off your
head if you reported it

108
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,041
but who would do that?

109
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,250
How can you say that?

110
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,708
Of course sometimes
there are loose ends...

111
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,125
like witnesses...

112
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,833
but you can get rid
of those easy enough.

113
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,625
Here's an idea, huh,
let's play a little game!

114
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,875
Now pay attention
while I explain the rules...

115
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,166
So...

116
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,083
The game starts with
me taking on the child...

117
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,333
Of course I won't be doing it
at full strength just yet.

118
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,750
First I'll lower myself
to match him...

119
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,666
And with every passing
minute I'll let myself

120
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,458
get just a notch stronger...

121
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,250
increasing my speed and agility
a little bit at a time.

122
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,291
At a rough guess...

123
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,750
I'd say...

124
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,333
in about ten minutes I'll
have his head in my hands...

125
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,166
all you have to do
is attach your legs

126
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,916
and rescue him in time.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,250
So it's pretty simple.

128
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,541
If you take too long he
dies, but if you rush

129
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,541
getting your legs attached
and they don't work

130
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,875
you can't help him...

131
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:50,875
Admit it.

132
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,791
That sounds
like fun doesn't it?

133
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,416
Damn you...

134
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,750
Let's start!

135
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:58,875
Ready?

136
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,750
Go!

137
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,083
This should work if I just
alternate my Yoki aura

138
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,583
between healing
and regenerating.

139
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,458
I'm impressed!

140
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,416
You're actually
better than I thought.

141
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,333
Still room for
improvement though.

142
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,125
Oops, it's been one minute...

143
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,666
Better level up...

144
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,458
That is not the
proper way to hold

145
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,250
a double edged sword, boy...

146
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,916
you should pay attention.

147
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,250
Damn it.

148
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,041
Well, that's not
going to work is it...?

149
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,375
What did I tell you?

150
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,875
If you rush it
they won't stay together

151
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,541
and you'll be of no help.

152
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,333
And does he need help.

153
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,541
But of course if you do
manage to reattach them...

154
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,541
Well...

155
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,291
They won't be
a hundred percent.

156
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,541
Stay calm...

157
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,291
and focus.

158
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,083
Aren't you an
obedient little girl...?

159
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,708
You're doing exactly
what you're told to do.

160
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,000
One!

161
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,000
Two!

162
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,583
Three!

163
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,041
This is so much fun!

164
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,875
I love fighting this child!

165
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,708
Oh, just look at him!

166
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,750
He's trying so hard
not to distract you

167
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,750
that he's not
making a sound...!

168
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,750
No matter what I do
he won't scream

169
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,125
even though he's in
terrible pain...!

170
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,458
Yes...

171
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,708
even though he's soaked
in blood and wants to cry!

172
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,125
Shut your mouth!

173
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,833
You're just saying that
to try and distract her...

174
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,500
Come on. Those attacks
of yours are so weak.

175
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,583
You've barely scratched me.

176
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,041
I've never seen
anything so heroic!

177
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,541
You two are amazing...!

178
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,833
Just fantastic...!

179
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,625
I mean it!

180
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,750
Who do I kill first?

181
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,916
Such a difficult decision.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,208
I don't know whose grieving
will be the most fun to watch!

183
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,958
Well what do we have here?

184
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:26,583
No...!

185
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,375
Get out of here!

186
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,333
Why would I do that?

187
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,041
Aw...

188
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,458
she's here already...

189
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,708
It's too bad really
because I was so enjoying

190
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,500
playing our little game.

191
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,458
I can't believe my luck.

192
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,458
Two Claymores and a human.

193
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,125
The boy smells intoxicating...

194
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,500
it's so delicious...

195
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,583
Can't help myself.

196
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,375
I'll have to eat him first...

197
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,166
hope you understand.

198
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,166
It's the Awakened Being!

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,916
Yes, it does look ferocious...

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,625
I hope we can manage.

201
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,458
Come to think of it...

202
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,791
All I really needed was
this young boy over here...

203
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,000
So you two...

204
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,000
Are just in the way.

205
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,708
Oh...

206
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,541
I thought I had destroyed
everyone but the boy.

207
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,500
Yet here you both are.

208
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,500
I must admit...

209
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,416
you are very strong.

210
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,208
They're not healed yet.

211
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,083
Work on your legs!

212
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,166
I'll take care of him...!

213
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,583
You must hurry
we don't have much time!

214
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,166
I know you can do it!

215
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,708
I'm sure you've noticed that's
not an ordinary Awakened Being!

216
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,791
Our only chance is to join
forces if we hope to have

217
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,791
the smallest prayer of
defeating it, now hurry!

218
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,333
I'm...

219
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,625
just kidding.

220
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,166
Clare...

221
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,333
Help!

222
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,416
Rak--

223
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,250
Bitch!

224
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,791
Oops! I guess my hand slipped...

225
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,333
how can you ever
forgive me for this?

226
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,291
Put me down!

227
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:31,833
Damn it!

228
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,041
Let go of me...!

229
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,291
I said put me down!

230
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,833
Now!

231
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,583
You're so weak you don't stand
a chance of breaking free...

232
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,666
So why even try.

233
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,958
It's a waste of time.

234
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,250
Good thing I got rid
of the kid 'cause

235
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,791
I'll need both
hands for this...

236
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,041
This Awakened Being is terribly
powerful, isn't it, Clare?

237
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,291
There's no one left
to help you now...

238
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,750
sorry.

239
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:01,791
This can't be it...

240
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,250
This can't be the end...

241
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,708
Come now...

242
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,375
Don't you see - you could
push your power to its limit

243
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,541
and still not come close to me.

244
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,375
So...

245
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,916
it's pointless to struggle.

246
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,916
No...!

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm not dying today!

248
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,291
Your problem is you don't
know when to give up...

249
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,875
admit it, the human's
as good as dead.

250
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,541
No matter how much Yoma
power you unleash...

251
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,208
You're never going to save him.

252
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,583
The sooner you
accept that, the better.

253
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,666
I'm not going
to give up now...

254
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,125
I have to survive...

255
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,458
so...

256
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,416
I can protect her!

257
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,333
I should have known...

258
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,208
I'm so useless.

259
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,458
Raki!

260
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,833
No!

261
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,791
It's unbelievable!

262
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,000
You would sacrifice everything
to become an Awakened Being

263
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,333
just to save a human...!

264
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,333
For what purpose?

265
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,500
What a foolish cause!

266
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,750
No.

267
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,958
No, my dear!

268
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,958
I definitely saw you
surpass your limit...!

269
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,958
You must be cheating somehow!

270
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,083
And you managed
to attach your legs!

271
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:25,791
But how?

272
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,125
This makes no sense!

273
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,125
I was under the impression
that if you overextended

274
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,458
your ability there wasn't...!

275
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,833
Wait...

276
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,625
Could it be true...?

277
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,333
You were actually
awakened the whole time!

278
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,208
Oh this is marvelous!

279
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,291
I can not believe this...!

280
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,333
I mean, how often do I get
the chance to kill two

281
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,708
Awakened Beings
in one afternoon?

282
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,000
Raki...

283
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,583
I want you to hang on to me.

284
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,916
Huh?

285
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,791
I need you to hold tight
so that you don't fall...

286
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,250
I'm going to run now ...

287
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,875
You can't let go.

288
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,500
Do it now!

289
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,166
Hold tighter than that.

290
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,541
I'm counting on you...

291
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,958
don't fall off okay?

292
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,541
Come now...

293
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,416
This is foolish.

294
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,208
You can't escape from me.

295
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,125
I think I'll save
the boy for later...

296
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,291
I want to kill you first.

297
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,791
I do hate arrogance.

298
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,666
Arrogance?

299
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,458
And what do you mean by that?

300
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,041
You thought you could
destroy me so easily...

301
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,250
Even said you could take on
two Awakened Beings...

302
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,166
so tell me, do you still
believe you can kill me?

303
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,833
What I believe
is unimportant...

304
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,416
It only matters if
I'm correct, doesn't it?

305
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,416
I need to get as far as I can!

306
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,250
Every step counts!

307
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,833
Well, well, well...

308
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:25,583
I guess we found out who
the cocky one really is.

309
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,375
Would you like
to beg for your life?

310
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,875
I'm begging you...

311
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,291
stop talking!

312
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,541
Your breath's disgusting!

313
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,541
Now, now, Claymore...

314
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,583
There's no need to forget
your manners, is there?

315
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,083
And now...

316
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,250
for the rest of the party...

317
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,750
Oh dear...

318
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,250
You would think they would
have gotten further than that.

319
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,041
Perhaps my dead friend
here was correct.

320
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,666
She is hopeless.

321
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,000
What happened...?

322
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,541
Impossible...

323
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,208
Your neck...

324
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,541
I broke it.

325
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,916
Oh please.

326
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,291
It would take more than that
to stop someone like me.

327
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,958
If you really wanted to kill me
then you should have cut off

328
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,208
my head like I did yours.

329
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,041
You know...

330
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,375
you're the monster here.

331
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,500
Clare...

332
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,708
So...

333
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,875
the battle is already over.

334
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,083
What now?

335
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,208
We'll go our
separate ways for awhile.

336
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,750
I don't want you
to worry about it...

337
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,041
she'll only be looking for me.

338
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,291
I'm the one she wants.

339
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,916
Now, go.

340
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,291
Raki...

341
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,583
I won't!

342
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,458
I'm not gonna
leave you, you hear me??

343
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,958
You do what I tell you...

344
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,166
Don't you see?

345
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,791
She can track my aura
and hunt me down...

346
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,250
Please go!

347
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,000
I can't...

348
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:25,625
no...

349
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,250
Let me come!

350
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,916
Please, I only want
to be where you are!

351
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,833
Look, I know I can't really
be of any use to you...

352
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,958
But that doesn't change the fact
that I want to be with you...

353
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,625
I don't care when
I die just so long as

354
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,375
we're together until then!

355
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,500
Don't ever say you
don't care when you die.

356
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,708
Because I promise...

357
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,833
I'll be trying
my hardest to survive...

358
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:22,208
and come back to you.

359
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,041
You hear?

360
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,750
You will live...

361
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,875
because I won't fail you...

362
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,166
I will find you, Raki.

363
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,041
Promise...?

364
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,166
Promise.

365
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,458
Alright then...

366
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,416
Clare...

367
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,041
I'll go...

368
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,833
And I will survive.

369
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,166
So that...

370
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,041
Someday...

371
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,916
I can protect you...

372
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,750
Good-bye Clare.

373
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,791
Dear God of Robona...

374
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,791
please hear my prayer...

375
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,458
may your blessings
fall on that boy...

376
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,916
Give him your
strength and your mercy...

377
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,500
Until the time comes...

378
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,750
when we're together again.

379
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,041
Ah good...

380
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,125
the stiffness
in my neck is almost gone.

381
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,375
Now that that's all taken
care of I can begin my hunt

382
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,041
for the other one.

383
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,708
Composure is lost
to the ripples...

384
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,583
and for them
tomorrow is shattered...

385
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,375
From the past comes a fighter...

386
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,458
Next time The Endless
Gravestones Part II
