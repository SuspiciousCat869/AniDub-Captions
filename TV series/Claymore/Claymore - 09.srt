1
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,250
Since the first time we met...

2
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,291
I knew nothing but
suffering from her eyes.

3
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,500
Eyes that could
endure no more...

4
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:27,083
That screamed for an end
to the anguish and pain.

5
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:41,916
Good lord!

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,416
What's that?

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,000
What is she doing?

8
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,708
Teresa always had
that look in her eyes...

9
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,791
The same look
that was in mine.

10
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,958
Please do it!

11
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,833
It's Teresa
flesh and blood...!

12
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,375
Help me- put it
inside me now!

13
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,291
Wait...!

14
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,666
Hey come back...!

15
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,333
There's no reason to
leave in such a hurry...!

16
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,541
Come on!

17
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,000
You're Claymores!

18
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,041
And you must be from Torilo...

19
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,541
So tell me girl
how bad is it in town?

20
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,708
I don't know...

21
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:38,958
Claire...

22
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,125
these friends of yours?

23
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:40,958
Interesting.

24
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,041
There were five of them.

25
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,125
It seems that you
fought and killed

26
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,500
four of the
creatures by yourself.

27
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,375
The fifth one escaped and
would have killed a woman

28
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,291
right outside of town
had we not saved her...

29
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,875
So perhaps you'd care to explain
to us what happened here?

30
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,791
I knew you three were
coming from that direction

31
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,375
and could take him...

32
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,791
that is as long as you didn't
take your time getting here.

33
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,791
The organization said
there was a chance that

34
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,000
these were Voracious Eaters
and we were instructed

35
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,166
to wait for them to
gather in the same place.

36
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,583
Then the four of us were
to do the job together...

37
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,541
We were just following orders.

38
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,500
Well, unfortunately
they were just normal Yoma.

39
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,791
I think you mean "fortunately."
If they were Voracious Eaters

40
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,041
then you'd be the one lying
in the street right now

41
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,375
instead of them.

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,041
Or was this an attempt
at foolish bravery?

43
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,458
Not really.

44
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,666
I arrived here early and
realized they were regular Yoma.

45
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,500
I then decided to proceed
and confront them head on.

46
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,291
Interesting...

47
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,750
I'm going to inform
the Organization

48
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,000
about your disobedience.

49
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,708
Wait...

50
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,416
you mean you thought
they were Voracious Eaters?

51
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
You told me that
they were just normal Yoma.

52
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,666
I did.

53
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,875
Taking them on all
by yourself is crazy!

54
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,500
Clare, you really
shouldn't be so reckless!

55
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,666
Alright Raki...

56
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll keep that
in mind for the future.

57
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,041
Well...

58
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,500
I can see that you're
just as careless as ever.

59
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,250
What would you have done if they
really were Voracious Eaters?

60
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,791
Oh, what am I talking about?

61
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,541
You were hoping
that was the case.

62
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,250
Am I correct?

63
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,291
I have to admit
I do admire your courage.

64
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,333
But you have no idea
what you're up against

65
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,958
when it comes to
Voracious Eaters.

66
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:23,958
That's not true.

67
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,416
I fought one in the cathedral.

68
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,625
Actually that was
just a normal one...

69
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,500
It did need to eat more than
usual to maintain its size,

70
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,583
but it was really
just an underling.

71
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,208
You see we use "Voracious
Eater" as a code word...

72
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,958
Publicly, it's much easier to
explain what those creatures

73
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,250
are by referring
to them as such.

74
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,333
What we're actually
talking about here

75
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,583
are "Awakened Beings."

76
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,625
They are born from the
failures of our own ranks...

77
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,041
Of course as far as the public
is concerned they're just

78
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,375
Yoma who have lived
a very long time.

79
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,833
If you were ever to face
a true voracious eater,

80
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,291
an awakened being,
then remember this...

81
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,666
It is quite certain you'd be
dead in a matter of seconds.

82
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,458
Your lack of faith in my
skills is unfortunate...

83
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,041
Good bye.

84
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,291
It's Priscilla.

85
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,291
You want to take Priscilla's
head, am I right about that?

86
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,791
Well, you'd best
forget that notion.

87
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,583
Because even amongst
awakened beings

88
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,625
she's in the
top of her class...

89
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,583
And her awakening unleashed
all of her latent power.

90
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,208
But of course she
only did so in order

91
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,916
that she could defeat Teresa.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,583
Otherwise there might have
been another outcome.

93
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,708
When it comes to awakened
beings our policy has

94
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,500
always been to treat them
just like any other Yoma...

95
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,708
We are to simply leave
them alone unless ordered

96
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,208
to take them down
as part of a contract.

97
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,791
So what if a job comes in
where we're supposed to

98
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,375
take down Priscilla?

99
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,333
If that were to happen then our
Organization's total strength

100
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,833
would be brought
down upon her...

101
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,166
but only our leader
can decide that.

102
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,416
Don't worry...

103
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,291
our top warriors
are quite capable.

104
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,583
I'm confident
they could bring her down.

105
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,000
Of course every era does
have its heroes you know...

106
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,625
unfortunately,
no matter what you think,

107
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,958
you aren't one of them.

108
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,208
Very well...

109
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,416
I'll add your name to a
team that's been assigned

110
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,333
to an awakened being.

111
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,625
It's a job in the
mountains west of here.

112
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,916
Apparently it's the
result of a warrior who

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,875
missed their chance to die...

114
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,000
I believe it will be a
good opportunity for you

115
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,375
to see just how competent
you really are.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,625
Teresa.

117
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,750
So you're supposed to be
meeting in this town?

118
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,000
That's right.

119
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,750
She's really going to fight
a Voracious Eater this time.

120
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,375
You coming, Raki?

121
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:32,958
Uh...

122
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,500
sorry!

123
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,791
Clare's a great warrior...

124
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,250
she'll be fine.

125
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,833
Follow me.

126
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,875
You're the last one to arrive.

127
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,708
The rest are already here.

128
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,208
I see you brought
the brat with you.

129
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,125
Well, I'm sure
he's not your kid.

130
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,916
What did you do pick up
a stray on your way over...?

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,750
Please don't tell me this
little boy is going to be

132
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,458
fighting with us!

133
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,500
No I'm going to
leave him in town...

134
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,000
We'll look for an inn
after this meeting.

135
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,291
I get it now.

136
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,291
He's a little toy
you carry around with you...

137
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,583
Well goodness.

138
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,916
I guess if you're that pissed
off I must have gotten close

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,625
to the truth, huh?

140
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,750
You know for such a late comer
you have quite an attitude...

141
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,125
but I guess we're
all a bit on edge

142
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,541
because we had to
wait an entire week.

143
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll leave this
argument to you Miria.

144
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,041
That's perfect...

145
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,833
just leave us like this.

146
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,791
Helen and Deneve.

147
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,500
Put them away- right now.

148
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,791
Unbelievable...

149
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,708
First you brazenly
disregarded orders

150
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,458
and now you arrive late
delaying our mission...

151
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,583
You lack much
needed discipline...

152
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,583
However...

153
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,125
we need to get started...

154
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,541
The Voracious Eater we'll be
hunting is on Mount Pablo

155
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,000
just south of here...

156
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,833
We'll be heading out
tomorrow morning...

157
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,000
For now I would like everyone
to introduce themselves

158
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,208
and tells us your rank...

159
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,791
It would also be helpful
to know about any experience

160
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,708
you've had with
Voracious Eaters.

161
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,791
I am known as Miria...

162
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,750
I will be your commanding
officer on this hunt...

163
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,791
I have a ranking of six...

164
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,500
This mission will be my seventh
hunt for a Voracious Eater.

165
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,875
The name is Helen,
my ranking is twenty-two,

166
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,416
and I don't have any experience
hunting these creatures.

167
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,750
My name is Deneve,
my ranking is fifteen,

168
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,375
and I've been on two
other hunting journeys.

169
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,000
So they all have rankings...

170
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,958
I wonder what Clare's is.

171
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,416
My name's Clare...

172
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,291
I have never encountered
a Voracious Eater...

173
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,333
I am 47th...

174
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,875
within the organization.

175
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,791
Huh?

176
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,041
Oh my god!

177
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,250
Did you hear that Deneve?

178
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,708
This one said she was
only a forty-seven!

179
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,916
What were they thinking sending
a rookie on this mission?

180
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:23,833
Shut up!

181
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,833
What's so damn funny?

182
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,041
Don't you dare laugh at Clare!

183
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,750
She's killed
hundreds of Yoma!

184
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,291
Oh, well I guess she didn't
tell you, did she brat...?

185
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,291
See...

186
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,333
I'd pay attention
if I were you...

187
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,875
The way it works with us is
that we're each assigned

188
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,250
a different territory
within this continent...

189
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,708
Sometimes we get killed and
occasionally will gain new

190
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,041
members but for the most part
our rankings stay the same.

191
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,958
This continent has forty-seven
territories and we are assigned

192
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,750
a number based on
our strengths...

193
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,583
If our number says
how strong we are

194
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,833
and she is forty-seventh
then that means...

195
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,416
That's right.

196
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
Out of all of us, your friend
here is the weakest one of all,

197
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,458
hence her ranking
at the bottom.

198
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,375
Oh no.

199
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,708
She's the weakest
of the Claymores.

200
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
I'll leave these
with you for now...

201
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,291
You can spend it on whatever
you like while I'm gone.

202
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,125
So how long do you think you'll
be hunting Voracious Eaters?

203
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,083
All things considered
we'll probably be done

204
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,708
in one week's time.

205
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,416
Well in that case I'll just
take these three, k...?

206
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,791
this should be all I
need for a week right?

207
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,375
So you'll be back soon...?

208
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,916
in one week?

209
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,875
That's correct...

210
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,416
You need to
stop worrying so much.

211
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,791
I will be just fine...

212
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,375
and when I tell you
something I need you

213
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,500
to trust me, understood?

214
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,625
What a surprise.

215
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,750
You kept us waiting again.

216
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,041
Let's move.

217
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,041
You've been awfully
quiet today, Clare...

218
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,416
What's the matter?

219
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,125
Are you having trouble
functioning without your boy

220
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,625
to keep you warm?

221
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,083
Let it go.

222
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,791
You would be
wasting your time...

223
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,166
Besides we're all aware that
you're surprisingly weaker

224
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,416
than the rest of us...

225
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
save it.

226
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,666
Smart advice...

227
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,791
Helen and Deneve, stop.

228
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,541
I won't tell you again...

229
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,958
Our success on this
mission depends on

230
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,416
how well we work as a team.

231
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,833
Each member is
crucial to our survival.

232
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,625
Oh come on are you kidding me?

233
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,500
She's got the lowest ranking...

234
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,833
the absolute lowest,
it's embarrassing!

235
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,416
Exactly.

236
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,291
It's rare for a warrior even in
the thirties to be assigned

237
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,916
to go after a Voracious Eater.

238
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,625
Luckily, we've got
a 47 with us...

239
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,000
I mean what the hell was
the Organization thinking?

240
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,916
Our superiors decided...

241
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,208
it's not our place to question
them and we won't start now.

242
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,291
Yes ma'am...

243
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,208
I just hope she
doesn't get in the way.

244
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,375
We'll set up our camp
here for tonight...

245
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,833
we should be well within range
of our target by tomorrow.

246
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,875
Okay.

247
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,833
Anyone else dying
for some dinner...?

248
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,125
I guess I'll go try
to find something to eat.

249
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,791
It's amazing.

250
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,458
I don't think I know anybody
that eats as much as you.

251
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,291
When you've got as much Yoki as
I do, you've got to keep eating.

252
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,750
Need anything?

253
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm not hungry...

254
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,916
I'm going to rest for awhile.

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,583
Well.

256
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,041
Suit yourself then.

257
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,125
I'd like to see you
outside please.

258
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,125
It'll only take a minute.

259
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,125
I challenge you to a
sparring match ...

260
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:07,125
I just want to get a feel
for everyone's capabilities.

261
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,583
Is my 47th ranking within the
organization not enough proof?

262
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,458
To be honest with you
I'm having a hard time

263
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,375
believing that's your rank...

264
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,875
it doesn't mesh with my initial
impression of your skill level.

265
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,458
When I first saw you
I thought I was looking

266
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,416
at the most powerful
being I'd ever met.

267
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,125
So now we'll see.

268
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,416
Here goes.

269
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,333
Oh!

270
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,166
They're really going at it...

271
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,541
want some?

272
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,708
No thanks.

273
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,958
Wow she's really
quite amazing huh?

274
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,000
You're right.

275
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,916
I can't believe
how amazing she is.

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,708
I've never seen anyone
so amazingly bad.

277
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,125
I've seen enough.

278
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,625
Go and get some rest now...

279
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,541
you'll need to recover
your strength for tomorrow.

280
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,250
So what are we going
to do now, Miria?

281
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,625
It really doesn't look
like she's going to

282
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,541
be much help to us tomorrow.

283
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,750
In fact it's gonna take a
miracle for her to survive

284
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,375
just the first encounter.

285
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,250
It's glaringly obvious
that we're going to be

286
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,666
doing all the
fighting tomorrow.

287
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,916
You know that right...?

288
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,250
Do you really want
to take a chance

289
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,958
on such an important mission?

290
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,083
I thought I made myself
clear on this subject.

291
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,583
Our superiors made the call and
we're going to follow orders.

292
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,416
That's it.

293
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,541
Talk about carrying
excess baggage.

294
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,416
What a pain in the ass.

295
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,750
Oh well, I've seen enough...

296
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,833
even if she were to die
of exposure tonight

297
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,291
it wouldn't make
a difference to the job.

298
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,458
Teresa.

299
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,125
Ohhh.

300
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:09,791
What do you know?

301
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,333
It's still alive.

302
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,458
Look at that.

303
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,916
She was knocked out
the entire night.

304
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,791
How pathetic.

305
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,000
We're leaving, so stand up
and get yourself together.

306
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,041
We're going to go ahead
and take off.

307
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,500
You might want to stay here
if you value living...

308
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,041
See ya around.

309
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,458
Oh great.

310
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,375
I don't know why
she didn't stay behind.

311
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,541
Come on!

312
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,625
You're not really
going to let her fight.

313
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,583
It would be like
sentencing her to death.

314
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,500
I don't appreciate
repeating myself.

315
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,458
Our orders still stand.

316
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,291
Hey!

317
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:24,958
Over here!

318
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,458
How you doing ladies?

319
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,791
We've been waiting for you
Claymores for quite some time!

320
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,375
Who the hell is that guy?

321
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,791
I've traveled from
the town of Lido...

322
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,250
we're the ones who asked
for you all to come out here.

323
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,875
I tell ya, it's really
great to see that you all

324
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,250
made the journey
out here so quickly.

325
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,000
If you Claymores want
to follow me I'll show you

326
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,666
which direction you need to go.

327
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,416
No!

328
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,125
Miria!

329
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,583
Dammit...

330
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,375
The organization gave us
wrong information...!

331
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,916
We were told that
we would be battling

332
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,333
just a normal
Voracious Eater...

333
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,375
Not something like that!

334
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,458
Do they really expect
the four of us to take on

335
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,791
something of this magnitude?

336
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,458
What is it?

337
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:23,875
Oh no.

338
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,458
You have got to be kidding me...

339
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,875
A male awakened being?!

340
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,791
Suspicion grows
as the danger rises...

341
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,166
But therein lies the truth...

342
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,125
Next time "Those Who
Rend Asunder Part II"
