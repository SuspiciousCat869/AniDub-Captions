1
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:27,583
Clare is not a half-human,
half-Yoma like we are.

2
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,208
She's different.

3
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,916
Implanted inside of her is not
the flesh and blood of a Yoma...

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,166
the blood of a fellow Warrior.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,875
And the name of
that warrior is...

6
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,208
Teresa of the Faint Smile.

7
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,250
She fights for the sake
of the person she lost...

8
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,625
and for...

9
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,166
the sake of the person
she doesn't want to lose...

10
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,875
I think that's just
part of being human.

11
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,666
You killed...

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,333
her...

13
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,000
Teresa...

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,958
Teresa.

15
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,666
Noooo!

16
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,500
Priscilla...

17
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,291
I will kill you!

18
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,083
I will kill you!

19
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,041
Clare...

20
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,541
Priscilla...

21
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,166
you will die...! you will die!

22
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,625
Yoma.

23
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,000
I will never forgive you...

24
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,458
Never...!

25
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,333
Not after what
you did to my mommy...

26
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,125
and daddy.

27
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,791
My brother...

28
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,375
and my sister...

29
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,208
I won't forgive you...

30
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,666
I never will!

31
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,500
I'll kill you!

32
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,958
Priscilla.

33
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,375
No...

34
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,166
it can't be her...

35
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,625
It can't be!

36
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:37,125
God damn Yoma...!
God damn Yoma!

37
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,416
Look out!

38
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,458
Damn Yoma...!
I won't forgive you!

39
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,791
You're gonna die!

40
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,875
By my sword!

41
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,583
You're mine!

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,875
Wow...

43
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,333
Not bad.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,291
Clare.

45
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,916
Unbelievable.

46
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,750
Incredible...

47
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,541
How'd she do that?

48
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,291
It's impossible.

49
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,791
They've both gone
beyond our control.

50
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,666
Clare.

51
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,541
Priscilla.

52
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,875
Why...? What's the matter with
them- why are they fighting...?

53
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,500
Just stop.

54
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,666
Clare...

55
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,166
Priscilla...

56
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,166
Please stop!

57
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,791
That all you've got?

58
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,750
Let her go!

59
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,416
Wait a minute...

60
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,458
You're an imposter.

61
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,916
You're not Teresa.

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,083
But you have the same scent...

63
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,916
Now...

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,416
It's time to die.

65
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,333
I forgot you
don't have wings...

66
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:53,916
well...

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,250
that's too bad.

68
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,000
Now it's time we ended this
charade once and for all.

69
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,333
Teresa.

70
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,833
You killed Teresa...

71
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,000
Clare.

72
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,500
Clare.

73
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:45,916
Clare...

74
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,708
Clare...

75
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,291
Clare...

76
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,875
Clare!

77
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,375
Clare!

78
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,250
Please, don't do this...!

79
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,625
Stop it!

80
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,083
Oh my God.

81
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,625
Stop it Clare...

82
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,000
You have to stop fighting!

83
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,125
All this bloodshed...

84
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,833
It has to stop...

85
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,208
Raki...

86
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,791
What's done is done...

87
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,750
Clare...

88
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,916
I know...

89
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,416
I know Priscilla murdered
someone who was

90
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,208
very special to you...

91
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,541
but...

92
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,125
Priscilla's entire family
was slaughtered by Yoma,

93
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,625
just like mine!

94
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,583
And it doesn't stop with us.

95
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,375
Everyone has been affected
by this somehow.

96
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,500
Don't you see...

97
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,916
We shouldn't be
fighting each other,

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,208
we're all lucky to be alive...

99
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,833
Please Clare...

100
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,375
I beg you...

101
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:44,583
Please...! You've got to try and
keep yourself from awakening!

102
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,666
If you kill Priscilla,

103
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,708
then you're no different
than the Yoma!

104
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,416
Please don't do it!

105
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,583
You took her from me...

106
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,500
Teresa...

107
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,416
Teresa...

108
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,625
Teresa...

109
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,791
You...

110
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,500
You killed her.

111
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,333
You killed her!

112
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,250
Clare...!

113
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,916
No!

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,166
Raki.

115
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,375
Please...

116
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,208
You can't become a Yoma!

117
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,125
You can fight it.

118
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,041
I know you have it in you!

119
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,458
Her aura just dropped!

120
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,708
Please Clare...

121
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,291
You've gotta be strong!

122
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,583
Don't you remember
the promise we made?

123
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,958
That no matter what
we would meet again.

124
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,500
My promise to you
has kept me alive...

125
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,833
it's the only reason I continued
fighting when I felt weak...

126
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,000
I...

127
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,083
I just wanted to see you again.

128
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,416
I want us to be like we were...

129
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,958
Clare...

130
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,166
I love you with all my heart...

131
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,833
Please don't turn into a Yoma.

132
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,708
Don't leave me all alone.

133
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,250
I promise...

134
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,875
this time I'll protect
you like I should have

135
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,500
from the beginning...

136
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:09,500
so you can live the rest of
your life as a human being!

137
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,375
...live a human life.

138
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,083
Ra...

139
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,916
ki.

140
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,083
Yes Clare?

141
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,166
I can't...

142
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,958
stop...

143
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,166
it...

144
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,416
There's nothing...

145
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,166
I can do...

146
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh no...

147
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,875
Raki!

148
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,666
Jean no!

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,041
Jean...

150
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,625
why...?

151
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,666
You didn't run away
this time...

152
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,125
Well done.

153
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,875
Jean...

154
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,041
Why did you...

155
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,500
do this?

156
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,791
It's the opposite...

157
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,500
of what happened before...

158
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,916
Right Clare?

159
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:18,375
Do you remember that...?
When I had awakened...

160
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,750
you were able to
bring me back to humanity.

161
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,750
We have to reverse it.

162
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,708
Now this is my chance
to return the favor...

163
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,041
I am forever
in your debt Clare.

164
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,916
Revert back...

165
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
I know you can do it.

166
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,208
Just like before...

167
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,625
synchronize your
Yoki aura with mine.

168
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,250
Focus Clare...

169
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:46,041
Focus and I'll pull your
aura back to the good side.

170
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,375
You and I pulled it
off once before...

171
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,708
there's no reason
we can't do it again.

172
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,958
No...

173
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,541
If we do that
you're going to die...

174
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,375
Get away from me...

175
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,916
and save yourself!

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,708
It's not too late!

177
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,125
Listen...

178
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,916
These are mortal wounds
I will not recover from...

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,541
There's no hope for me...

180
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,416
So at least allow
me to use what's

181
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,791
left of my life to aid you...

182
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,250
I wouldn't want it
any other way.

183
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,125
Jean...

184
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,541
Damn you.

185
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,833
Let's just do it...

186
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,583
Match your Yoki aura!

187
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,583
Jean...

188
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,916
Stop it...! There's no point in
you going through with this...

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,041
You don't owe me anything...

190
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,250
Don't sacrifice your
own life for my sake!

191
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,458
Damn it Clare,
I need you to focus!

192
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,333
Don't do it!

193
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,375
Stop!

194
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,083
Clare!

195
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,458
Stop it Jean...

196
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,875
Even if you succeed and
revert me back to a human,

197
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,041
there is nothing in this world
left for me to live for.

198
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,083
If I can't kill Priscilla,
then I may as well die.

199
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,625
Clare!

200
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,875
There will be plenty of time
to find something to live

201
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,125
for once you revert back...

202
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,958
Don't you forget...

203
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,666
There are people in this world
that want to see you live...

204
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,958
And there are those who have
put their faith in you.

205
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,666
The truth is...

206
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,250
I am one of those people.

207
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,583
No...

208
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,750
Just live...

209
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,041
Please Clare.

210
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,333
I'm glad that we were friends.

211
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,500
Jean...

212
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,583
don't die!

213
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,250
No...

214
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,166
Why did you do that?

215
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,291
No Jean...

216
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,958
I haven't been that
entertained in quite a while.

217
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,208
It's you...

218
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,375
I should've known...

219
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,375
Isley

220
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,250
The child's unstable...

221
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,208
though I have no intention
of letting her go yet.

222
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,458
That's why I'm
taking her with me.

223
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,208
I've lost my appetite for
violence after watching

224
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,000
these two go at it.

225
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,958
To continue the bloodshed...

226
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,500
would be uncivilized...

227
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,375
Wouldn't you agree?

228
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,541
Let's leave things as they
are for the time being...

229
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,208
And Raki, I assure you
we will meet again someday.

230
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,625
Keep hold of your sword.

231
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,666
It will serve you well.

232
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,500
His aura...

233
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,708
It was overwhelming.

234
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,041
So that was the Silver King.

235
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,041
God damn...

236
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,958
Everyone's a monster.

237
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:23,958
Indeed...

238
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,583
That's just how it is...

239
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,666
in this world of ours.

240
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,583
So what happened?

241
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,291
Well Priscilla and Clare
fought and Isley of the North

242
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,708
showed his face before
they both disappeared...

243
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,750
I assume that's all the
explanation that you'll need.

244
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,125
Is she dead?

245
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,375
I can't sense her aura...

246
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,166
That's all I can say
with certainty...

247
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,458
If you want to know...

248
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,375
go see for yourself.

249
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,875
That's true...

250
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,708
I may.

251
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,416
Or at least I would like to...

252
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,166
But it won't happen...

253
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,083
Besides, I already have
my hands full dealing

254
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,708
with the carnage in Pieta.

255
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,291
Good luck to you...

256
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,208
Clare.

257
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,541
Do you think Clare
is going to be okay...?

258
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,166
She was so depressed
it looked like her soul

259
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,583
had been ripped out.

260
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,500
Whether she dies tomorrow
or lives to old age...

261
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,583
it's all in Clare's hands now.

262
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,208
Besides, it's none
of our business.

263
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,250
Yeah.

264
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,625
I guess you're right.

265
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,500
Let's part ways here.

266
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,916
That's a good idea.

267
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,833
Wait...

268
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,375
So what are you
going to do now?

269
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,083
My plan is to leave
the Organization...

270
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,375
and then train hard...

271
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,541
so that I can
have revenge someday.

272
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,625
And I intend to do the same...

273
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,416
I'm determined to reveal all of
the secrets the Organization

274
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,750
has been hiding...

275
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,166
I'll live among the
civilians until

276
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,916
I have sufficient evidence.

277
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,375
That sounds incredibly boring.

278
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,500
Oh...

279
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,166
Have something more
exciting planned?

280
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,791
I'll be damned if I work for
the Organization again...

281
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,333
so...

282
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,208
I don't know.

283
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,500
Well you know you can
always tag along with me.

284
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,750
Sure...

285
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,041
I mean you're not going
to get very far trying

286
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,583
to spar with yourself...

287
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,416
Plus I could use the company.

288
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,333
I guess this is
goodbye my friends.

289
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,458
Though I can't say when...

290
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,958
we'll meet again.

291
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,625
I'm sure.

292
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,250
You better believe it.

293
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,208
Same goes for her.

294
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,750
Don't you forget...

295
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:10,208
There are people in this world
that want to see you live...

296
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,625
And there are those who
have put their faith in you.

297
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,250
Just live...

298
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,916
Please live.

299
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,458
Something wrong?

300
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,625
I apologize that
it took this long...

301
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,291
to find you.

302
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,625
I'm proud of you
for staying safe.

303
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,166
That couldn't have been easy.

304
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,500
I have no intention of returning
to work for the Organization.

305
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,750
Just know...

306
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,833
The journey will be more
difficult than before.

307
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,000
So...

308
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,541
Will you join me?

309
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,833
Clare.

310
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,708
Of course...

311
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,250
I...

312
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,083
I never want to leave you!

313
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Thank you, Raki.

314
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,000
Teresa...

315
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,416
I'm still alive...

316
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,625
I can almost hear you say,
"That's the way it should be."

317
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,500
Live as a human...

318
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,416
Grow as a human...

319
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,375
Die a human death.

320
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:25,625
This is the greatest gift that
I can possibly give to you...

321
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,208
So use it well.

322
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,750
Farewell, Clare.
