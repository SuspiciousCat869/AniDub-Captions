1
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,583
It happened again.

2
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,875
Dear God, what are we
to do of this?

3
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:33,625
We must...

4
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,250
act.

5
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,250
What is it Father Vincent?

6
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:41,333
I fear we have no other choice
but to send for one of them.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,333
Wait...

8
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,416
You don't mean...

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Yes.

10
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,333
But what about
the rules of the city?

11
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,250
The situation is so dire we
cannot be held back by rules...

12
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,791
I'm afraid that if we don't
address this now, we'll be...

13
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,416
...finished.

14
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,583
Rabona...?

15
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,958
I believe that's
the holy city, right?

16
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,833
But doesn't Rabona
have rules against...

17
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,333
That's correct...

18
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,958
Anyone considered to be
of 'dubious character'

19
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,416
is forbidden from setting
foot within the holy city.

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,958
Needless to say, that applies
to anyone associated

21
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,583
with our Organization.

22
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,916
Then why should we do
anything to help their city?

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,291
Rabona's laws
are not an issue...

24
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,541
This time around we'll
sneak you into the city

25
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,000
without alerting their
guards to your presence.

26
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,833
It will be up to you
to find the Yoma

27
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,541
and slay it as
quickly as possible.

28
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,208
Its different from the norm
but I trust you can handle it.

29
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,875
A covert operation.

30
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,166
Taking one of those pills
decreases your Yoma power.

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,125
The most obvious
change will be your eyes,

32
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,791
which will revert
to their natural color.

33
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:59,458
The downside is you'll lose
your ability to detect Yoma.

34
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,291
With your one major advantage
over the Yoma taken away

35
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,250
you will be forced to
infiltrate the city

36
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,291
as a human and search on
foot until you locate it.

37
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,291
If you say the boy is
your little brother,

38
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,291
it will add another level of
authenticity to your story,

39
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,708
making you less suspicious
to their guards,

40
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,250
who have very watchful eyes...

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,958
Good morning.

42
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,041
So will you two be sharing
a room or having your own?

43
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,583
Uhhh.

44
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,833
One please...

45
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,166
My brother and I
are traveling together...

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,916
We're going to be staying
in this lovely town for awhile.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,625
Any vacancies?

48
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,375
Wow...

49
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,375
This is a great room, isn't it?

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,250
They call this place
the holy city...

51
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,708
It's only natural that their
accommodations would be fitting.

52
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,041
Hey are you feeling okay?

53
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,833
It's just the side effects
of the medicine.

54
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,708
Well maybe you should
try taking a nap.

55
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm fine.

56
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,916
Time is of the
essence let's go.

57
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,125
Going out for the day?

58
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,541
Yes...

59
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,750
We're going to do a little
sight-seeing before lunch.

60
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,208
Well it is a
beautiful day for that.

61
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,250
What?

62
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,541
Oh nothing...

63
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,625
It's just weird to see
you change personalities

64
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,708
instantly like that.

65
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,291
Claymores are trained for this.

66
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,708
One second I can act like
a noble lady and the next

67
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,208
like a flirtatious prostitute.

68
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,750
A prostitute?

69
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,250
Would you like me
to demonstrate?

70
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,458
Oh, no that's okay, I'm good.

71
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,750
Beyond here is
the baptismal chamber.

72
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,375
Casual visitors are not
allowed past this point.

73
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,958
Thank you...

74
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,083
My brother and I are actually
here to baptized by the Father.

75
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,666
Do you have any proof?

76
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,041
Of course.

77
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,666
Alright you are
free to proceed.

78
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,625
Gah! Gross!

79
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,500
He must have been important
to be buried down here.

80
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,750
I've been all over this
town and yet I don't sense

81
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,333
the slightest presence of Yoma.

82
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,500
If you're here to receive
baptism, then please,

83
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,916
come this way.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,458
You wouldn't happen to be
Father Vincent, would you?

85
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,666
I am.

86
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,208
Then I am honored
to be in your presence.

87
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,333
I baptize thee...

88
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,000
in the name of our Lord...

89
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,500
and Savior.

90
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,000
Tell me, what is
the name of thy God?

91
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,375
The name of my God is Rimuto.

92
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,000
I have traveled here
from the land of Sutauf.

93
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,291
Oh dear God,
then that means you are a...

94
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,625
Have discretion...

95
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,291
Please Father.

96
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,666
Meet me in the tallest
of the cathedral's belfries

97
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,000
one hour after
the moon has risen.

98
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,166
The city is under a strict
martial law at nighttime...

99
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,000
Will you still
be able to come?

100
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,250
I will be there
as you say, Father Vincent.

101
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,875
Antiques?

102
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,250
Yes.

103
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,833
We've been selling the
pieces our father collected

104
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,708
before his death in
order to stay afloat.

105
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,583
This is the final and
most exquisite piece

106
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,791
of his collection.

107
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,875
It's nice.

108
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,875
How much are you
selling it for?

109
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,541
It's about ten million bellars.

110
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,083
Ten mill...?

111
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,833
You'll never
get that much here.

112
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,041
Right...

113
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,250
To be honest, we had
been expecting that...

114
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,875
But my brother and I agreed
we would sell each piece

115
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,458
as close to the price our father
would have wanted as possible.

116
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,291
Well, good luck to both of you.

117
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,208
It looks as if your
brother has become ill.

118
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,083
I think he had too much to eat.

119
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,041
The food was really fantastic.

120
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,708
Well, I did serve him
two helpings...

121
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,833
Oh, right.

122
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,250
I meant to tell you
about the curfew.

123
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,000
No one is allowed to be
on the streets at night time.

124
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:35,875
Thanks...

125
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,375
I had heard about that today.

126
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,208
Very good.

127
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,000
Have a wonderful night.

128
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,208
I'm sorry for making you
eat so much food.

129
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,916
You're not in pain, are you?

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,291
Nah...

131
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,625
I remember what you said
before about not being able

132
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,958
to eat much in one sitting...

133
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,458
Besides I work
for you as a cook.

134
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,250
Eating food is part
of the job, or at least

135
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,833
that's the way I see it.

136
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,791
I just look at it as
research for future meals...

137
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,541
Clare, hold on!

138
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:13,500
Be...

139
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,125
careful out there.

140
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,500
Of course...

141
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,250
I'll be back soon.

142
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,958
By direct orders from our
leader Rimuto the Organization

143
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,500
from Sutafu has
sent me to your aid...

144
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,875
By request of a Father Vincent
in the town of Rabona.

145
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,333
I assume that is correct.

146
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,000
The first to pass
was Father Van.

147
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,375
Soon thereafter my priests
were being killed regularly.

148
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,666
Sometimes they were alone
and sometimes in groups

149
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,750
of up to three people.

150
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,083
All of this violence has
occurred within the cathedral.

151
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,583
To think that we as servants
of God would be needlessly

152
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,166
tortured and killed
is beyond reproach...

153
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,000
Tell me, is this
to be permitted?

154
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,708
Yoma do not discriminate.

155
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,166
Huh?

156
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,875
They don't care if the faith
of God lives inside you.

157
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,208
Whether you're a man of
the cloth or an infidel...

158
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,541
We're meat to those creatures.

159
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,750
But...

160
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,708
As long as your guts
are inside your body

161
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,041
you're fair game to them.

162
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,375
Please, you have to help us.

163
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,166
I don't care how much
it'll cost, we'll pay it.

164
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,458
I require no money.

165
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,166
Once the job is complete,
someone from our organization

166
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,625
will come by to
collect the money

167
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,041
and you will give it to them.

168
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,541
If I happen to fail my mission
and die in the process,

169
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,583
you will owe nothing and
this Yoma will continue

170
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,208
its slaughter.

171
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,791
Huh?

172
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,333
Its possible that the odds may
be against me this time around.

173
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,166
I have a request for you Father
as a faithful servant to God.

174
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,791
Request?

175
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,958
If I happen to perish
while hunting the Yoma

176
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,625
within your cathedral will you
promise to take in the boy

177
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,416
I've brought with me
and care for him?

178
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,625
What?

179
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,083
There's no need for worry.

180
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,791
He's a good boy.

181
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,208
His family was killed by
a Yoma and he has no one else

182
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,583
to turn to.

183
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,750
Wherever you could fit him
in would be sufficient.

184
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,416
Perhaps he could assist
the priests or even

185
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,125
work in the kitchen.

186
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,750
We will take care of the boy,
you have my word...

187
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,750
And even though I may
be a servant to the Lord,

188
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,500
it doesn't excuse my behavior.

189
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,083
I should be more concerned
with others than myself.

190
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,583
Like you...

191
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,541
A Claymore who isn't allowed
into our city because she's

192
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,458
deemed to be sub-human appears
to be void of selfishness.

193
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,916
Your benevolent care
for the boy is admirable

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,375
and is an inspiration
to us all.

195
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,708
Thank you.

196
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,375
I'm in your debt.

197
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,625
I assume you weren't aware
of the strict curfew

198
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,916
the city is under.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,875
If you choose to ignore it...

200
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,166
The possibilities of being
mistaken for a Yoma are great.

201
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,958
This guy's got some moves...

202
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,541
He avoided your attack
with ease, Galk.

203
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,625
Though from the looks
of it he ain't fast enough

204
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,416
to dodge my knives.

205
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,416
Damn you!

206
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,125
Hey, those are mine!

207
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,708
A girl?

208
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,583
Let's go get her!

209
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,333
No...

210
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,500
She's long gone.

211
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,333
But I hit her with
a couple of my knives.

212
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,375
We should go after now
while we have the advantage

213
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,833
against her!

214
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,041
Look...

215
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,458
This is the knife
she threw back at us...

216
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,791
Notice it doesn't have
a single drop of blood on it.

217
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,958
No blood?

218
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,250
Who the hell is this woman?

219
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,416
What's wrong?

220
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,833
Did you hear that?

221
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,666
What the...

222
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,291
Where the hell did
this thing come from?

223
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,833
We searched this entire
cathedral inside and out!

224
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,500
Please...

225
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,125
please...

226
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,666
don't kill -

227
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,083
Oh no!

228
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,875
Where's Clare?!

229
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,666
I see you're awake.

230
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,375
Clare your...

231
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,500
eyes.

232
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,041
Oh...

233
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,791
The medicine I'm taking is only
effective for half a day...

234
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,666
I have to remember
to keep taking the pills

235
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,208
whenever they wear
off or we'll be caught.

236
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,375
Wait...

237
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,083
I'll get water.

238
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,791
I'm certain there was
another Yoma attack

239
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,916
at the cathedral last night.

240
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:49,958
Stay where you are.

241
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,583
We're looking for Yoma.

242
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,708
But we're both human!

243
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,291
This morning in the
cathedral we found

244
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,458
the remains of two
of our best sentries.

245
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,958
They'd both been murdered
and eaten by Yoma...

246
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,708
We ask for your cooperation.

247
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:06,500
Hey Galk, is it me or does this
cloak look familiar to you?

248
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,541
Because a suspicious
woman was running around

249
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,625
on the rooftops last
night in the same thing.

250
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,125
I hear you two arrived
in town just yesterday.

251
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,666
What are you accusing us of?!

252
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,125
Look I'm not saying the
woman we came in contact

253
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,166
with last night was
a Yoma or anything...

254
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,333
but I just doubt any
normal human being

255
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,250
could pull off
the stunts she did.

256
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,333
Unless...

257
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,166
she was a silver-eyed witch!

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,166
You're a lot cuter than
I would have expected.

259
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,875
Clare took her
medicine just in time.

260
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,833
See we're looking for
one of those mix-breeds.

261
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,958
Someone who sold their body
and soul to the Yoma...

262
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,500
It couldn't be all that
difficult to change

263
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,333
something simple like
the color of your eyes...

264
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,958
Let's see.

265
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,166
What the hell's your problem?

266
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,833
You've got some nerve
accusing her of being

267
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,083
some witch when you
have zero proof of it!

268
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,208
My sister has more love
and kindness in her heart

269
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,750
than everyone in this
entire city combined...!

270
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,375
And you don't know a
single thing about her

271
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,750
so stop trying
to act like you do!

272
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,250
You...!

273
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,541
Let go of me!

274
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,625
We're done...

275
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,166
Now let's move along.

276
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,791
Jerk...

277
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,958
And don't come back,
you hear me?!

278
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,083
I'm surprised you
were able to come up

279
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,208
with that nonsense on the spot.

280
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,541
Right...

281
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,458
The stuff about you being
my sister is made up but

282
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,208
I do think you're
a kind person at heart.

283
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,916
You don't have to be
a human to be a good person.

284
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,208
Is something wrong?

285
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,166
If that man had attacked you,
I wouldn't have stepped in

286
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,083
to help, no matter
how hard he beat you.

287
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,625
If you're looking to me
for kindness I advise you

288
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,166
not to bother...

289
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,666
I assure you in time you'll
find yourself disappointed...

290
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,208
and hurt.

291
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,208
Okay.

292
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,458
So both of your sentries
appeared to have been eaten?

293
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,875
Yes.

294
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,166
It sounds to me like
your cathedral is infested

295
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,291
with a Voracious Eater.

296
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,541
What is a Voracious Eater?

297
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,791
A Yoma's appetite increases
every day it's alive.

298
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,500
They also become
more cunning and strong.

299
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,291
Yoma that display these specific
types of characteristics

300
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,375
are called Voracious Eaters.

301
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,416
It's very probable the Voracious
Eater chooses to hide here

302
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,208
because Claymores are forbidden
from entering the city.

303
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,875
Our unique ability to detect
Yoma is useless when

304
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,625
we can't get near them.

305
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,916
Do you think we'll be alright
given the circumstances?

306
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,166
I need more information,
such as which people could

307
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,333
have entered or exited the
cathedral yesterday evening.

308
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,041
In addition to those
who are allowed to stay

309
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,583
on the grounds overnight.

310
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,791
Hopefully, the list is small.

311
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,750
After sunset no one
comes and goes...

312
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,041
Inside, only the priests, the
monks and a few chosen guards

313
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,041
are allowed to stay
within the cathedral.

314
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,291
Just as I was expecting,
the most probable place

315
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,291
for it to be is
somewhere inside here...

316
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,625
However I don't understand
why the creature would choose

317
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:16,375
to stay within such a confined
space like this cathedral.

318
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,916
Something's not adding up...

319
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,375
I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

320
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,666
Did you see that?

321
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,500
It's the girl from earlier.

322
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,583
Well now...

323
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,333
Looks like you're out
of excuses this time...

324
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,000
Your little brother
isn't here to stand up for you.

325
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,291
Her eyes are silver...

326
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,416
Hell even the expression
on her face is different.

327
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,333
Unfortunately I don't
have time to talk...

328
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,791
Your efforts are appreciated,
but they're not needed.

329
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,916
Should you attack me, the
consequences will be dire.

330
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,125
Don't you threaten us!

331
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,708
Take that!

332
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,208
She's too good with
both of those blades.

333
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,500
Work on getting rid of one.

334
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,875
I'll try.

335
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,250
Now!

336
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,791
No doubt...

337
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,958
She's a Claymore!

338
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,958
Just look at those eyes!

339
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,750
The cathedral!

340
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,416
She's on the move!

341
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,333
After her!

342
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,041
Did you hear that scream?!

343
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,000
What was that?

344
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,125
It's here...

345
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,791
The Yoma's Yoki
is overwhelming.

346
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,666
Maybe it's a side effect
of the medicine?

347
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,833
But I still can't pinpoint
the Yoma's location.

348
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,958
Its another guard.

349
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,458
He has been eaten recently...

350
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,458
I knew it.

351
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,541
A Voracious Eater
did this to him.

352
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,333
I never expected this
Yoma to be so powerful.

353
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,708
What is that?

354
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,458
A gigantic Yoma!

355
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,875
Stay back!

356
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,041
How in the hell are we
supposed to fight that thing?!

357
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,708
Just keep your guard up
and don't let it get away...

358
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,666
Look out!

359
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,458
What the...!

360
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,291
Hey witch!

361
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,291
What was that for?!

362
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,583
Just get back!

363
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,625
You two don't stand
a chance against it!

364
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,083
You'll die if you stay!

365
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,708
Sacrificing lives
to save lives...

366
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,000
Will it work against
this grave threat?

367
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,625
Next time, Clare's Awakening.
