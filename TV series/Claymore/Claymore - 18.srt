1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,333
Stand Fast!

2
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,083
I said hold your positions!

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:14,958
Eva!

4
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:15,875
Kate's gone!

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,375
They got her!

6
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,208
Lucia!

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,541
What...

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,208
What is this?

9
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,666
What in the world is going on?

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,250
Just-

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,416
Just what in the hell
is happening?

12
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,875
How long do you
intend to follow me?

13
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,916
I won't leave until I've
repaid the debt I owe you...

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,041
I would have died...

15
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,833
had it not been for you.

16
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,875
I am in your debt...

17
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,166
My life is yours...

18
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,375
Use it in any way you please.

19
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,166
That won't be necessary...

20
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,291
I have already been repaid.

21
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,750
Very Impressive.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,958
Yesterday, that technique
was impossible for me.

23
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,625
I don't understand.

24
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,166
Before I met you...

25
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,125
I had begun to think the
Quick Sword technique

26
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,208
would always be beyond me...

27
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,666
But then...

28
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,750
I saw what you could endure
in the cave back there...

29
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,125
And I was forced to change
my way of thinking.

30
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,750
Even though your body had
awakened, you were able

31
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,958
to maintain the humanity
of your mind...

32
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,791
I would have
thought it impossible.

33
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,916
You proved that it's not.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,625
I was shocked at the power
of the human will...

35
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,833
And began to wonder if
I could use that strength

36
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,000
to my advantage.

37
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,375
I decided that the idea
warranted an experiment...

38
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,041
So I tried it with
the Quick Sword...

39
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,708
Allowing my human will
to control my Yoki...

40
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,208
made the technique possible.

41
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,333
I taught you...

42
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,625
control?

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,500
It was seeing how
mentally strong you were

44
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,208
that gave me
the courage to try.

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,541
Oh, don't look at me
like that...

46
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,500
You went missing,
I came to find you...

47
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,208
Are you really surprised?

48
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,625
Rubel!

49
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,166
Impossible...!

50
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,291
I never sensed her coming!

51
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,666
Number Five...

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,416
Rafaela!

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,833
In case you two haven't noticed,
Rafaela here is unmatched

54
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,875
in her ability
to hide her Yoki aura.

55
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,625
Which makes her ideal
for covert operations.

56
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,250
Oh I wouldn't do that...

57
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,416
Even the two of you together
would be no match for her.

58
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
You've never faced
a warrior like her before.

59
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,958
What about Galatea...?

60
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,833
What the hell have
you done with her?

61
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,000
You mean your friend who
ignored her assignment

62
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,041
then contrived a pitifully
transparent lie

63
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,375
to avoid punishment?

64
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,416
Immediately following
her report...

65
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,916
I had her beheaded
for disloyalty.

66
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,416
I'd love to tell you
that's what happened,

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,375
but it just isn't the case...

68
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,958
Galatea is useful
in her own little way,

69
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,750
so we spared her life...

70
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,666
However, she will
find herself assigned

71
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,958
to much more difficult
missions for quite some time.

72
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,000
Speaking of...

73
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,333
I've come here...

74
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,666
with an interesting new
assignment for you, Clare.

75
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,708
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,708
Multiple Awakened Beings
have gathered in the north.

77
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,875
Several warriors,
including Number Seven,

78
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,958
have fallen in our
attempt to destroy them.

79
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,625
Your next assignment...

80
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,208
is to do what
the others could not.

81
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,541
The Organization has begun to
assemble an appropriate number

82
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,333
of warriors for the task...

83
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,208
You will be among them.

84
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,416
If you are able to destroy the
Awakened Beings in the north,

85
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,541
then we may be willing
to grant you a pardon.

86
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,750
Not a bad deal for
a fugitive, wouldn't you say?

87
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,833
Don't worry...

88
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,833
You don't have
to answer right away...

89
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,000
But remember...

90
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,458
You answer to the Organization.

91
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,625
We can locate you
whenever we choose,

92
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,958
and destroy you just as easily.

93
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,666
Oh, one more thing.

94
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,375
Do you remember the young boy
you were traveling with...?

95
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,666
Our resources tell us he's
begun moving north as well.

96
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,375
One might assume he's
still searching for you.

97
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,583
Raki, no!

98
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,458
If it is your wish to be
reunited with the boy

99
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,833
and it's certainly
clear that it is...

100
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,541
I do believe the north serves
a double purpose...

101
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,208
to make that wish a reality
and a chance for you

102
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,791
to earn your redemption.

103
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,250
Bastard!

104
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:03,958
They're...

105
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,250
all over.

106
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,166
Yeah...

107
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,708
why are there
so many of them?

108
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,333
What's going on here...?

109
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,750
I don't understand.

110
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,666
So this is Pieta...

111
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,083
In the northern land
of Alfons.

112
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,666
Just go away.

113
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,416
I've already told you to quit
following me around everywhere.

114
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,750
Or better yet...

115
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,291
just do what you want.

116
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,041
Well, look who's
alive after all.

117
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,166
It's you again...

118
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,750
Long time no see, Clare.

119
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,750
What's up?

120
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,916
Hello, Helen!

121
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,333
Oh Damn.

122
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,833
She was just greeting an
old friend she hasn't seen

123
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,083
in a long time...

124
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,416
There's no need to get violent.

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,833
Deneve!

126
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,875
As greetings go, that was
a bit on the crude side...

127
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,791
Even old friends deserve
some common courtesy,

128
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,583
don't you agree?

129
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,000
What's with your
friend, Clare...?

130
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,125
It looks like you've
partnered up with

131
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,250
a real straight-laced
kind of girl...

132
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,375
So, stranger,
what number are you...?

133
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,875
I'm Helen, Number Twenty
Two, and my associate there

134
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,291
is Number Nineteen...

135
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,291
Well?

136
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,125
Since you asked,
my name is Jean...

137
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,125
But you may call me
Number Nine.

138
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,375
What?

139
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,291
You mean your ranking is
in the single digits...?

140
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,333
Why are you with Clare?

141
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,458
She's only Number Forty-Seven!

142
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,958
If it hadn't been for
Clare's intervention

143
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,500
I wouldn't be standing here...

144
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,333
I didn't ask her number
when she saved my life,

145
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,458
and it matters
even less to me now.

146
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,708
It appears not all the warriors

147
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,458
ranked in the single digits
are completely insufferable.

148
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,791
Who knew.

149
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,750
My name is Deneve...

150
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,541
Please forgive my behavior...

151
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,708
I hope you understand
that Helen meant no harm.

152
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,291
She can be a bit
abrasive at times.

153
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,416
It's fine...

154
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,166
And I didn't mean
to be so critical...

155
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,916
I had no right to speak to a
comrade-in-arms in that manner.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,291
I apologize.

157
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,291
Sure...

158
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,500
Apologies all around?

159
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,541
Everyone...!

160
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,250
Would you please
gather 'round?

161
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,791
It's time for us to
outline our strategy

162
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,250
for the current mission...

163
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,375
For those just arriving,
I'm Flora...

164
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,291
I am ranked number eight
in the Organization

165
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,375
Huh.

166
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,666
Finally, a face to go
with the number.

167
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,875
Hey...

168
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,416
Since you're the
highest ranked warrior here,

169
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,333
that means you're
the leader, right?

170
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,750
Doesn't that make you the
authority in this situation?

171
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,083
It would...

172
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,875
If I were truly the
highest ranked warrior here,

173
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,000
which I'm not...

174
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,291
I believe our leader
is approaching now.

175
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,041
Miria!

176
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,125
Number Six...

177
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,000
I wondered what
she'd look like.

178
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,291
So that's Phantom Miria, then.

179
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,875
Welcome, all.

180
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,583
Thank you for coming so far from
your respective territories...

181
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,625
I hold the Number Six ranking...

182
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,125
You may call me Miria.

183
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:08,625
For the duration of this
mission, I will be your leader.

184
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,458
Here in the
northern land of Alfons,

185
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,125
multiple Awakened Beings
have joined forces...

186
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,458
Our assignment...

187
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,916
and the reason for the size
of this gathering...

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,125
is their total annihilation.

189
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,458
Impossible...!

190
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,875
Multiple Awakened Beings
in one place?

191
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,708
But Awakened Beings have never
banded together before this!

192
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,000
Why would they start now?

193
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,958
All we know is that they have.

194
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,208
That's just great.

195
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,625
What're you, scared?

196
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,666
I guess we're not the
tough crew I thought we were.

197
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,291
I mean I thought that killing
off creatures like these

198
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,291
was basically the entire
reason for our existence...

199
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,208
How can you be afraid when
this mission is exactly

200
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,875
what we were trained to do...?

201
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,041
And you all call
yourselves warriors.

202
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,875
Hey, what's with her?

203
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,375
She sure thinks a lot of
herself, doesn't she...?

204
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,541
And how did she get permission
to carry two swords?

205
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,083
That's Number Eleven.

206
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,458
Her name's Undine.

207
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,750
She claims that she's the
strongest warrior alive,

208
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,833
and she carries two
swords to prove it.

209
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,125
Oh, yeah?

210
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah...

211
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,750
But as far as I'm concerned...

212
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,625
between that and the way
she flaunts her muscles

213
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,458
outside combat, it only
proves she's cocky...

214
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,041
Everything about her
just screams "amateur."

215
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:17,833
Funny!

216
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,083
Pretty harsh, though.

217
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,291
What did you just say...?

218
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,500
Do you really think I'm just
gonna let that slide...?

219
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,583
Speak up!

220
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,125
I'm sorry...

221
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,041
I thought I was speaking softly
enough you wouldn't hear me,

222
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,625
guess I was wrong...

223
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,833
I'll be more
careful next time.

224
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,791
So you think
you're pretty funny...

225
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,666
Don't you?

226
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,583
Whoa, Deneve.

227
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,291
Take it easy, all right?

228
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,833
Everyone. May I please have
your attention?

229
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,125
There are still things
we must discuss.

230
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,375
But if you insist on fighting,
perhaps I can help...

231
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,916
I would be happy to take on any
one of you in single combat.

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,708
Wind Cutting Flora...

233
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,625
The Organization's
Number Eight...

234
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,125
Drawing a sword, cutting, and
returning it to its sheath.

235
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,708
All of them are
simple motions...

236
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,208
But the way she does them...

237
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,500
It's almost unbelievable.

238
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,833
And Miss Jean...

239
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,208
You're also ranked in
the single digits...

240
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,875
Please come forward.

241
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,166
Number Eleven, Undine.

242
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,375
Would you make your way
to the front, too, please.

243
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,583
Also Number Thirteen,
Veronica.

244
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,750
Step to the front.

245
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,291
I count twenty-four warriors
here, so we'll split into five

246
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,958
separate units, each with
four or five members.

247
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,708
The five warriors that you see
before you, including myself,

248
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,708
will be serving as
captains of these units.

249
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,583
Some of you may have fought
Awakened Beings before now...

250
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,875
If so, this particular
strategy may be something

251
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,708
you incorporated.

252
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,250
Yeah, you know,
I think we're all familiar

253
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,666
with the drill by now.

254
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,000
The strategy is simple but
has proven very effective

255
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,625
for us in the past...

256
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,541
Each team will focus its efforts
on a single Awakened Being.

257
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,500
Don't leave your team or
your target for any reason.

258
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,708
We'll mount our
first assault tomorrow.

259
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,750
You will now be
divided into units.

260
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,458
Assignments are
not negotiable.

261
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,750
Number Fourteen.

262
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,875
Cynthia.

263
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,666
Uh...

264
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,416
Here?

265
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,458
Team Veronica.

266
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,458
Number Fifteen.

267
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,208
Deneve.

268
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,333
You're with Team Undine.

269
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,291
Number Seventeen.

270
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,250
Eliza.

271
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,625
Team Jean.

272
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,791
Number Eighteen.

273
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,625
Lily.

274
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,291
Team Flora.

275
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,166
Number Twenty.

276
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,041
Queenie.

277
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,500
You're on Team Miria...

278
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,541
Number Twenty-two,
Helen, Team Veronica.

279
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,666
Number Twenty-Four.

280
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,708
What the hell...?

281
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,333
Why didn't Miria put me
on her team?

282
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,208
Number Twenty-Seven.

283
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:45,875
Emelia.

284
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,375
Team Jean.

285
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,916
Hey...

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,916
You did make sure you weren't
followed, didn't you?

287
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,041
I did...

288
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,958
Besides, everyone
here is far too busy

289
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,333
to pay attention
to anyone else.

290
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,166
Come on in.

291
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,583
The others are already here.

292
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,041
Once again, you're
the last one to arrive.

293
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,500
Miria.

294
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,041
It's been too long,
old friend.

295
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,041
Let's commemorate our reunion.

296
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:47,625
Well done.

297
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,583
We've all survived.

298
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,416
It's good to see all of you.

299
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,500
Who's out there...!

300
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,875
Show yourself!

301
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,750
Why's she here?

302
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,083
Clare...!

303
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,333
I thought you said that
you hadn't been followed!

304
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,583
No, wait...!

305
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,958
Jean didn't follow
me here, she's...

306
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,500
She's one of us.

307
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,208
I'm sorry to intrude.

308
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,833
I didn't mean
to spoil your reunion.

309
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,375
However, it seems this business
relates to me, as well.

310
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,375
You would need to possess an
extraordinarily strong will.

311
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,041
To revert an Awakened body to
human form is no small feat.

312
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,166
So you'll understand if
I'm a bit skeptical...

313
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,500
Clare, I can't help but
notice your new right arm.

314
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,000
It clearly belonged to someone
with astonishing power.

315
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,208
Someone who knew how
to swing a blade...

316
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,708
Who?

317
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,208
Yeah, whose is it?

318
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,625
I'm afraid that's not
something I can reveal.

319
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,333
Of course not...

320
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,708
You just don't have
the best of luck, do you?

321
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,041
You can say the same thing
about every warrior out here.

322
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,791
There are
twenty-four people...

323
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,041
with no idea how
unlucky they are.

324
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,958
Let me ask you this...

325
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,375
What do you think the odds are
we'll actually accomplish

326
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,666
our goal here?

327
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,625
This operation...

328
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,416
has absolutely
no chance of success.

329
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,416
What?

330
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,458
If it were only multiple
Awakened Beings,

331
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,708
we may have stood a chance...

332
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,708
But there's more
to our assignment.

333
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,750
Our real target is the
mastermind behind

334
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,750
all of these Awakened Beings...

335
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,500
And he is the reason that
we're destined to fail.

336
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,541
What...?

337
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,083
Who the hell are you
talking about?

338
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,166
Isley.

339
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,625
The Silver King,
who governs the north.

340
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,750
The Creature of the Abyss...

341
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,250
Our target.

342
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,541
We're here to destroy Isley?

343
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,875
That's- impossible!

344
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,166
Maybe so.

345
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,625
But it doesn't change things.

346
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,958
The true nature of this
operation is to subdue every

347
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,833
Awakened Being in the northern
territory, and the puppeteer

348
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,458
behind them, even if he is
a Creature of the Abyss.

349
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,791
Wait, what.

350
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,791
What in the hell is the
Organization thinking...?

351
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,250
He's probably the most powerful
Awakened Being of all time!

352
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,625
Calm down.

353
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,083
My best guess is that the
Organization is using us

354
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,791
to buy themselves
time to think...

355
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,208
You see-

356
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,416
They don't expect us
to survive.

357
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,416
So that's Pieta, huh?

358
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,958
Boy, there sure are
a lot of them in there...

359
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,791
Think you can tell how many?

360
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,875
Wait.

361
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,750
There are Twenty-four.

362
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,083
Not that it makes too much
difference how many there are.

363
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,958
What do we do now?

364
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,958
Exactly what we came to do...

365
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,416
Forward reconnaissance.

366
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,791
But there are all those
pretty girls down there...

367
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,833
We can't just ignore them.

368
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,416
It'd be rude not to say hello.

369
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
and I hate to be rude!

370
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,958
Damn! Those monsters beat us
to the first attack!

371
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,375
All right boys,
we'll see you there.

372
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,208
Aw.

373
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,666
There he goes again.

374
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,083
I see now what you meant...

375
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,583
He is hopeless.

376
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,625
Evening, everyone...

377
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,083
Anyone want to show
a stranger around?

378
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,958
I'm not feeling
very welcome here.

379
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,333
Hey...

380
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,166
What's the idea
spoiling all my fun,?

381
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,458
Grab your swords
and prepare for battle!

382
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:54,875
Well!

383
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,916
This certainly is a pleasure.

384
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,833
I don't think I've ever seen
so many ladies in one place.

385
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,583
And I look such a mess!

386
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,291
Everyone break into
your units now!

387
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,125
Team Miria,
we'll take this one...

388
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,291
Team Flora, you take the
roof to the right...

389
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,958
Team Jean, see what you
can do about the one

390
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,875
on that stone pillar
to the left.

391
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:11,708
Team Undine!

392
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,458
Team Veronica!

393
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,875
Stand by.

394
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,958
Keep a close eye out and assist
any teams that look like

395
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,166
they need help.

396
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,750
They don't seem to be shaken
at all by our sudden attack...

397
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,125
I underestimated them.

398
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,500
So much for the
element of surprise...

399
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,875
I've been here ten seconds and
they've spotted me already.

400
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,458
The Claymore leader is
clearly no stranger to battle.

401
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,625
She's tough, but...

402
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,541
Her greatest weakness is...

403
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,833
her team.

404
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,125
They're terrified.

405
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,166
They simply aren't experienced
enough to keep calm

406
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,291
in a battle situation with
a real Awakened Being.

407
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,500
Forward!

408
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,583
Get off!

409
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,833
Why don't you quit
scurrying around and fight?

410
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,708
She's so quick!

411
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,208
On my team, I doubt I can
count on Numbers Thirty-Nine

412
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,583
and Forty-Seven to
be of much help...

413
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,541
Which means I have
to end this before

414
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,416
he takes his awakened form.

415
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,583
Oh, no!

416
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,666
Something altered the
course of my attack!

417
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,666
Be careful!

418
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,083
He can control your movements
by manipulating your aura!

419
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:32,791
I...

420
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,625
can't control my body!

421
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't think I can...

422
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,208
stop him!

423
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,375
Please...!

424
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,125
Get away!

425
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,708
I can't stop--...!

426
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,041
He has complete control
of my body!

427
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,583
Please hurry...!

428
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,000
Get back!

429
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,000
Illena...

430
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,583
Help me!

431
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,583
What was that...?

432
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,750
I didn't know anyone could
swing a blade that quickly!

433
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,291
That was pretty good...

434
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,750
I'm actually starting
to have fun!

435
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,291
It's times like this...

436
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,166
that remind me why I became
a monster in the first place!

437
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,541
I'm gonna rip you all apart!

438
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,458
Who wants to be first?

439
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,791
You aren't much of
a leader, are you?

440
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,875
A good leader would have
known her weakest fighters

441
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,041
before the battle even started.

442
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,041
And those are the
soldiers you sacrifice.

443
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,291
But you wasted valuable time
trying to protect them!

444
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,708
You brought this
on yourself.

445
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,416
You should really apologize
to your warriors.

446
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,125
You swing that sword
like a rookie, Jean.

447
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,291
Can't you kill one little
Awakened Being without our help?

448
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,375
Helen!

449
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:17,958
Deneve!

450
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,958
We've got our work
cut out for us...

451
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,625
Looks like a tough one.

452
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,125
Get ready everyone...

453
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,083
We're gonna finish
this right now.

454
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,666
Here he comes!

455
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,166
The white land.

456
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,375
The white night.

457
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,333
A nightmare is unleashed.

458
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,750
Next time: The Carnage
in the North, Part Two.
