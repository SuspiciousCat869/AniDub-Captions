00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was like a roller coaster.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.066  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or would you call it a free fall?

We've secured an escape route. We can
get out to the utility conduit from there.

00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:38.357  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How many times did those bastards kill me

I'm sure you always have it with you
since it's so important, right?

Rights aren't something
that somebody gives you.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:05.544  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or maybe it was Martin Luther King.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.214  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Anyway...

It's too bad about the AASF, but we did
capture Kei Nagai and Ko Nakano.

Their capture will help save
some face with the committee.
