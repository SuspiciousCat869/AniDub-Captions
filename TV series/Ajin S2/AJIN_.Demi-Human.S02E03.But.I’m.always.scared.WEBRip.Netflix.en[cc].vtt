some kind of a plan

100
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.922  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
in order for us to be able
to join the fight without any issues.

101
00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.793  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have compiled some possible places
where the attack might occur

102
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.094  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
based on what we have now.

103
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:38.965  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Shimomura] So, we'll prepare a specific
strategy for each of those places.

104
00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:42.502  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The remaining question is,
how do we fight him?

105
00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We have three Ajin.

106
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The enemy has us beat in numbers,

107
00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:49.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but if we prepare,
we should have what we need.

108
00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:52.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Three? You can't count Ms. Shimomura!

109
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:58.618  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-What's wrong with her?
-We can't put a woman in danger!

110
00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:02.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This isn't like a school competition.

111
00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:06.092  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Young, sick, or old, we'll use who we can.

112
00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.193  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now, look!

113
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.929  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Nakano, that's sweet of you,
but cut it out.

114
00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:12.532  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have no intention
of skipping out on my duty.

115

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:16.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Nagai] Of course not.

117
00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:25.211  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, let's take a break for now.

118
00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.914  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have some e-mails I need to answer.

119
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:31.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Nakano]
How can you be so relaxed, Mr. Tozaki?

120
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.119  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Tosaki]
Rushing things will only lead to mistakes.

121
00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:37.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sato won't be able to find Dr. Kishi
as easily as he thinks.

122
00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.594  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-And one more thing, Nakano.
-Huh?

123
00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:45.198  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My name is Tosaki. Try and remember it.

124
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Huh? [chuckles]

125
00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:51.871  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Tosaki] Well...

126

127
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.748  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What about all that bragging that you
could do anything as long as you had that?

128
00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:07.253  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
As a general rule, there are some things
that can be done and some that can't.

129
00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.490  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, any progress?

130
00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:15.194  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm at a loss. I searched the servers of
the Control Commission and the Ministry,

131
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:16.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but I got nothing.

132
00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:21.868  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, why not skip Kishi
and take care of Keita Iwazaki next?

133
00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:23.903  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's not going to work.

134
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've decided
we're going in order this time.

135
00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:30.142  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We have to follow the rules,
just like in a game.

136
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.713  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But if we have no idea where he is,
then we're stuck.

137
00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:37.850  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, all games have their cheats, right?

138
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:40.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If we don't know where Kishi is,

139
00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.656  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we find out where the men
assigned to protect him are.

140
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.660  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, just hack
the Metropolitan Police Department.

141
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Isn't that impossible?

142
00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No,
that's one of the things that can be done.

143
00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:55.868  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Naturally, it'll take a few days
since we're starting from scratch,

144
00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but just like with the Ministry,

145
00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:01.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
the Metro P.D. server
should have a back door.

146
00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:04.176  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, all I have to do is borrow that.
So, if I can just find it...

147
00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.545  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What's he talking about?

148
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.781  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[hacker] I'll sneak in that back door,
and close it behind me when I leave...

149
00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:11.217  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Sato] Basically... he's using a cheat.

150

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There are two units of riot police,

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:28.801  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
as well as people drummed up from Traffic

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:32.638  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I guess they can't afford to be too picky
when it comes to choosing personnel.

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:34.273  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
