Mr. Tosaki keeps tabs on the minister's

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.884  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Apparently he's been summoned

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, about Dr. Ogura...

45
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.456  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I only ever met him in the monitor room.

46
00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.860  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He left as soon as he heard
about Kei Nagai's escape.

47
00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:18.331  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
After that, you claim that the professor
went outside of the barricade,

48
00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.199  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
despite the ongoing attack,

49
00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:24.270  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and that he was then killed by someone
on his way to the car.

50
00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not fully aware
of the exact details,

51
00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.343  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but I heard that an IBM was used
in the attack.

52
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.579  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's what the report we received said.

53
00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.715  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And the corpse's dental records
are a match. However...

54
00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:39.419  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
However, there are several points
we have questions about.

55
00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:40.453  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Such as?

56
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.654  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Such as...

57
00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:45.925  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why has the security camera footage
from the time of the attack disappeared?

58
00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, that is curious...

59
00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.864  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It may have been caused by the explosion
Sato set off in the attack.

60
00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:01.541  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Almeida] It's also odd that the bodies
of the professor and his bodyguard

61
00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.843  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
were found in different places.

62
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's possible they got separated
as they fled.

63
00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:07.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Possibly.

64
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:12.819  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've also heard that a researcher who was
supposedly there that day is missing.

65
00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.787  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's the first I've heard of it.

66
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:19.626  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't believe you'll find anything
corroborating that on our staff list.

67
00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:25.632  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Finally... After Dr. Ogura
left the monitor room,

68
00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:28.434  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you went outside the barricade as well,
didn't you?

69
00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't seriously suspect me, do you?

70
00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:34.741  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hypothetically...

71
00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:39.545  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
if the professor was killed
not by Sato, as we suspect,

72
00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
there's only one person within
the facility that could have done it,

73
00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.918  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and, Mr. Tosaki, that would be you.

74
00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:49.622  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What reason would I have
to do something like that?

75
00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.626  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The only thing I know is

76
00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.863  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that despite the ongoing Ajin attack,

77
00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:01.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you were unaccounted for somewhere
outside the facility for nearly an hour.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.771  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Tosaki] The truth is...

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:16.382  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

He was the Ajin on the news
a while ago, right?

102
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.407  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The one who threw someone off the roof
and escaped from the government facility.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.144  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can't help but worry...

104
00:06:56.883 --> 00:07:00.119  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's become a tough world
for Ajin to live in.

105
00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.622  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just like smokers.

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:06.893  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When we stop Sato,
we can go back to our old lives.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.597  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Unlike those cigarettes,
Ajin aren't harmful.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
At least, let's hope so.

109
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.521  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A secret weapon, huh? I've always wanted
to build something like this.

110

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.473  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is really turning into a big deal.

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:57.710  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Things just keep getting worse

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You got a problem?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.948  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course not.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:05.184  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But, I wonder if we're going about it
right.

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:09.088  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay... What other way is there?

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.057  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:16.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
True, the heat

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:19.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But it's not all bad, you know.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:25.638  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ajin from all over Japan

Some of them
came to the Ministry before,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:31.277  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and there's even a group who are here
because they heard about you guys.

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:34.113  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The authorities can't do anything
about word of mouth.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:39.552  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You see, they've all stood up

Mr. Tanaka, I've got everyone helping

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:54.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is there anything else to do right now?

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:00.773  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

I'm working as the coordinator,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.775  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.222  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What do you mean by that?

139
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:18.758  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Anyway, where's Mr. Sato?

140
00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:22.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Uh... I haven't seen him for a while.

141
00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.197  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah... That should be obvious...

142
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.568  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Tosaki] Right. Understood.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.006  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Apparently it happened
on a moving bullet train.

Mr. Tosaki, you're up.

The next target, the Minister,

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:55.261  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
they're passing a new measure.

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:59.599  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He's been pressed for a response and will
be meeting with the Vice-Minister

151
00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:01.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:06.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've already checked out
where they're meeting.

153
00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.874  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's a facility used by VIPs.

154
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.611  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You said the attack would be
at the Ministry,

155
00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:13.980  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
his home, or his usual restaurant?

156
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.384  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I said those were nothing more
than guesses.

157
00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:23.022  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Besides, Nagai, I'm sure that you
can adapt to a change or two.

158
00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:30.363  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I guess so,
as long as we stick to the plan.

159
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:36.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hirasawa, get the building plans and
figure out where people will be stationed.

160
00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, sir.

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.772  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Tosaki] I'll get a detailed schedule.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.141  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
As for the rest of you,
focus on your training.

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:43.075  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All right!

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:46.879  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Shimomura, let's go.

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:48.047  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mr. Tosaki.

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:53.719  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
From now on,
every second we've got counts.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.088  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We can't afford any failures.

Who do you think you're talking to?

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:11.937  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Excuse me.

170
00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:15.708  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not only are you unable to catch Sato,

171
00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:18.210  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you're letting our sponsors get
annihilated.

172
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:22.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Very brave of you to come here
and show your face like this...

173
00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:24.050  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My apologies.

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.952  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I want to make sure
nothing happens to you, Minister.

175
00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:29.321  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This place is like a nuclear bomb shelter.

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:32.258  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Even the Ajin can't get me here.

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.228  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
if you go outside,
it's a different story.

179
00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:39.198  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Just in case, you--
-Don't make me laugh.

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:43.936  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why should I bother with an incompetent
lackey who's about to be cut loose anyway?

181
00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:49.809  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you hardly have time
to be worrying about others.

182
00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:52.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
According to Sokabe,
those two people from the Pentagon

183
00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.748  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
have launched an investigation on you,
haven't they?

184
00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:58.150  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've already finished
my interview with them,

185
00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.987  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I haven't given them anything
that they should doubt me.

186
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:09.328  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
With the police's permission, Dr. Ogura's
personal items have been moved in here.

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:14.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've already given you the list
from when they were moved.

188
00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.902  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Please give us some time to check.

189
00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:34.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's no problem.
Everything on the list is here--

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:38.124  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I see your observation skills
are still nonexistent.

191
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.091  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:46.031  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just as I thought.

193
00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:50.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's something that should be here,
but oddly enough, it's not.

194
00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:57.943  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What happens now? How can you get the
schedule like this?

195
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.914  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't worry about it.
If the minister won't give it up,

196
00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:04.216  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we'll just target someone
close to him.

197
00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:07.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I've just sent you your schedule, sir.

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:10.990  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, I'm still at the Ajin lab.
When I've finished--
