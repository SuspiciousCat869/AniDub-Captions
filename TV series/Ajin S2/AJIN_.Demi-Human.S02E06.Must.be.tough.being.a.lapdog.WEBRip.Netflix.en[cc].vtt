You're the one most familiar with it.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's Jianglide.

You'll feel as though
you're slowly suffocating.

Tweak the dose right, and you can
keep them alive and in agony forever.

Our schedule and location

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.814  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but this shouldn't be a problem.

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.983  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We'll start by using strategy pattern B

Nakano, I'm going to test you

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:56.128  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:11.744  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The minister's schedule...

Something temporary would also do.
Can you find one for us?

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.630  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:36.102  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Mr. Manabe, Mr. Kuroki,
get whatever you need into the car.

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.351  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What do you mean?
I'm getting ready to move the hideout.

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:56.055  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What?! No!
First we have to get Mr. Tosaki.

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:59.992  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, Nagai! What about poor Mr. Tosaki!?
We've gotta go help him!

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:03.295  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How, exactly? Where is he being held?

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:05.097  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Our primary objective is to stop Sato.

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:08.868  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But Mr. Tosaki is--!

151
00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.404  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We can be sure
that Mr. Tosaki's being interrogated.

152
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.373  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And if he talks, they're going to be
coming for us, here.

153
00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And that means we're done for.

154
00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.144  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But...!

Mr. Hirasawa!

Mr. Hirasawa,
you said it yourself, didn't you?

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:30.456  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That we'd need to make decisions
that go beyond morals or emotions here.

159
00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:32.224  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is one of those times.

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:35.394  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
First we have to make sure we're safe.

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.097  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Then we can start thinking about
our next steps.

162
00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:41.901  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Thinking logically,
that's our best strategy right now.

163
00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:45.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But, wait, what about Mr. Tosaki...?!

164
00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:49.075  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Hirasawa] If the positions were reversed,

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:52.778  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mr. Tosaki would be
giving the same orders.

166
00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.181  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

First, you'll have to pick an alias.

173
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
An alias?

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:30.382  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You need a new name for a new life.

175
00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:35.054  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It will be easier for you to get used to
if it's a name you can relate to somehow.

176

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:42.895  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
my real father's last name was

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:48.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That settles it, then.

180
00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:52.338  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Let's get moving

Ms. Izumi Shimomura.

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:02.414  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm going to start over.

184
00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:07.353  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And this time, I won't run away.

185
00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:12.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Hirasawa]

-Huh?
-If I were Sato,

189
00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:27.239  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I would have kept you locked up
for the rest of your life

190
00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:28.908  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
in a dark, cramped space.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:33.579  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But you're not Sato.

192
00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:37.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And if you can't even beat me,
how do you expect to stop him?

193
00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:40.186  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We only have one chance to stop Sato,

194
00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:43.923  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and that's to counterattack when he moves
on the minister. However...

195
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:49.228  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
the only one who knows when is
Mr. Tosaki. Think about it rationally.

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:53.933  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No matter how I look at it, picking
a fight with the U.S. is irrational.

197
00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:58.237  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We're done packing up, Nagai.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.948  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Nagai] Unpack everything.

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:11.150  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-What?
-[Nagai] Change of plans.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We're going to go rescue Mr. Tosaki.

201
00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:15.321  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nagai.

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.193  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Nagai] If we're facing the Americans...

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:23.896  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
at least it will be good field training.

205
00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:25.931  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you.
