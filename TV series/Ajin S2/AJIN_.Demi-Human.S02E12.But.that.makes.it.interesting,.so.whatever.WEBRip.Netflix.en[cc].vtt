00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:43.355  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Looks like it'll be a late night party.

208
00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.164  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is exciting.

209
00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:56.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We're about to take on
the strongest army in the world.

210
00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:58.404  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We must provide appropriate entertainment.

211
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.610  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Was this what you've wanted
this whole time?

212
00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:09.048  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Hmm?
-I mean, dragging the Americans into this.

213
00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's why you saved me,

214
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
built up a team, and went through
with those terrorist attacks?

215
00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.488  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not at all!

216
00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:20.526  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's no fun if you know who
the last boss is from the get-go, right?

217
00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:24.230  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, so, this is the end?

218
00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:25.364  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Eh?

219
00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:29.401  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, the game ends
when you beat the last boss, doesn't it?

220
00:14:29.468 --> 00:14:33.038  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[laughs] What do you mean, Tanaka?

221
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:36.442  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The best part of the game
is the second playthrough!

222
00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:37.576  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[clanging]

223
00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:41.547  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Nagai] Pardon me.

224
00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:47.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hate to interrupt your fun.

225
00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:50.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So it's you, Nagai.

226
00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.057  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was fast.

227
00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.893  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm impressed you found me.

228
00:14:53.959 --> 00:14:55.961  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Even hiding in the sewers

229
00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.931  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you can't cover up
your murderous stench.

230
00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:02.668  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mm. Okuyama and the others.

231
00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:05.638  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I certainly didn't expect that.

232
00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:08.908  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But that makes it interesting,
so whatever.

233
00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.910  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll give you interesting.

234
00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.512  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
About that U.S. military
you're waiting for...

235
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:16.482  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
By the way, Nagai,
do you remember how I told you

236
00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:21.153  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that I hate it when people get in my way?

237
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.321  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Vaguely.

238
00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:26.225  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But you're the one getting in the way
of my--

239
00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:29.695  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[yelling] I'm asking if you remember!

240
00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:31.964  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Answer the question!

241
00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:36.201  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There are three ways we can hit
someone like Sato.

242
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.071  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
One, we can provoke him.

243
00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:40.639  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Watch out!

244
00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:42.942  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Go, Ghost!

245
00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:44.610  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Kill him!

246
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:51.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Two, we can create a diversion.

247
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.385  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Pardon me...!

248
00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:56.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Too bad.

249
00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:58.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You lose.

250
00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:05.297  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ghost!

251
00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:08.367  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Whoa, two in a row...?!

252
00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:11.303  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He's as impressive as ever.

253
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Three.

254
00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:20.045  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The fact that I'm a known threat,
coupled with my escape.

255
00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:25.384  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We have to fall back!

256
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.689  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You won't get away today.

257
00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:34.660  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[all panting]

258
00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:41.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If we can lure Sato to this point,

259
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.104  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we simply have to blow up the ceiling
and we can bury him alive.

260
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.338  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Makes sense.

261
00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:49.274  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If he's buried alive,
it doesn't matter if he can regenerate.

262
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:50.309  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Exactly.

263
00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:52.378  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And we win.

264
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
One more time, Ghost!

265
00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:06.325  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Stop them with all you've got!

266
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.627  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I know!

267
00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:12.798  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How many can that kid make?

268
00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:18.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Nagai's got a ton of black stuff
to work with. [laughs]

269
00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:28.614  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But even so, he can't make more than one
at the same time.

270
00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:31.550  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Damn it!

271
00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:34.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They stopped him!
I can't use my ghost for a while!

272
00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:35.821  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hurry!

273
00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:40.292  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The only problem left is whether or not
you guys can stay ahead of Sato.

274
00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:42.661  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll use my ghost.
We'll figure something out.

275
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:47.066  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The way you plan and think
is just like Sato.

276
00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:49.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Although your endgame
could use a bit of work.

277
00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:52.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[gunshot then shouts]

278
00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:55.574  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nagai!

279
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:02.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, well.
I'll have to arrange some insurance.

280
00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:06.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's fine.

281
00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:09.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let's go.

282
00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:14.860  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Huh?

283
00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:24.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So this is your handiwork, Okuyama.

284
00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:29.541  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sorry to have to do this.
We had some good times together.

285
00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:46.758  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sorry to bust your beloved toys, Okuyama.

286
00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:50.129  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Sato] Since when are you
such a good shot?

287
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.232  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
"Everything takes practice."

288
00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:55.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Shall we get going?

289
00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:58.837  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, let's continue.

290
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.774  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I see it, Nagai!

291
00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just a bit more!

292
00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:07.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They're here. Kuro-chan.

293
00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:11.150  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wait. We can't get stuck here.

294
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We can cut through here.

295
00:19:23.762 --> 00:19:25.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I expect nothing less from an Ajin...

296
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:26.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

297
00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:32.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What?!

298
00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:43.715  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wanted
to finish that talk from before, Sato!

299
00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:49.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You can wait all you want,
but the U.S. military won't be coming.

300
00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:56.628  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They're aiming to disable you
with the nerve gas.

301
00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:01.233  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What?! Is that a joke?!

302
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All of us,

303
00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:08.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we're sick of being
a part of your games!

304
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:10.709  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What?

305
00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:15.447  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Buried alive, huh?

306
00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:17.516  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mr. Sato!

307
00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:19.651  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nice idea.

308
00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:21.486  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
However,

309
00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:23.956  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
just when you think you've won...

310
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:28.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
somebody pulls the rug out
from under you.

311
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:47.813  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
