Yes. It's handy in a skirmish

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:48.962  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We've also made the impulse water cannons

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

they started calling it "The Executioner."

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.650  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:18.925  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Since the grenade detonates
precisely above the target's head,

61
00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it renders
any sort of shielding ineffective.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:23.863  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:28.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We've verified how effective it is
by using it against the Ajin Tanaka.

64
00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:34.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:39.679  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and automatically sets the airburst
detonation position on the round's fuse.

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:43.816  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
