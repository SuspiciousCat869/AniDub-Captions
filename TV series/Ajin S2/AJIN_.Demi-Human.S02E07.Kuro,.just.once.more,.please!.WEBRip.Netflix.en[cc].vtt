00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

might go after Sato as well.

219
00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:16.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:45.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's grammatically correct, but they don't
really use it like that over there.

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:48.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

there's no point.

00:16:57.783 --> 00:17:00.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
