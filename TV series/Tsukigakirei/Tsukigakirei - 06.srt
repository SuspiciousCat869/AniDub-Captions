Have you ever tried writing
one of those before, huh?

167
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,958
Personally, I think
your time and energy

168
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,125
would be better spent
on something like that,

169
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,125
not literary awards.

170
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,000
I mean, you don't
wanna be in your thirties

171
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,833
and still struggling
to be a writer, do you? Ha!

172
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,083
I think you should try this
out while you still have

173
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,541
youth on your side.

[CROWD chattering]

175
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,375
So is Nishio the only one
who made it to the semifinals?

176
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,666
Yeah, but get this.

177
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,958
Nishio set a new
personal best record!

178
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,208
That's great.

[HIRA] What the heck
happened out there?

Your time was actually
worse than last year.

I mean, jeez, you could've
made it to prefecturals!

But instead you just
threw it all away!

Are you listening?!

[JUNKO] Your father
told me what happened.

Tell me the truth,
did a publisher call you?

We could at least hear him out.

195
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,833
Being contacted by a
publisher is a pretty big deal.

I will not! He has to

I've been fine with this

can come of writing!

If you try, you'll just
lose everything.

Shut up.
