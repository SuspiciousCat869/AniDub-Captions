Do you see your name?

00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:16,958
[CHINATSU]
Oh, I'm in Class Three!

00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,583
[AOI]
I'm in Two.

5
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,291
[AKANE]
There I am.

6
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,958
It says Class One.

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,208
Well this sucks.
We're all in different classes.

8
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,500
What about the track club?

9
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,750
None of the other
members are in my class.

10
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,208
[AOI]
Aww.

11
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,375
It's cool, at least we'll
see each other at practice.

12
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,750
[AKANE]
Yeah, that's true.

13
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,375
Maybe our club will get
some new members this year!

14
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,666
[KOTAROU]
Hey, watch it, man!

15
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,333
[CHINATSU] Shoot, I
forgot about the poster!

16
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,416
[ROMAN]
Hey. What's up?

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,750
--The lawyer poster?
--[CHINATSU] Uh-huh.

18
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:42,708
Did you ask her out?

19
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:43,833
Oh, I will!

20
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,333
Right, Akane?

21
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,125
[AKANE]
Today's the day...

22
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,458
...I start my last year
of middle school.

23
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,458
[SENSEI 1A] Good morning
and welcome, everyone!

24
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,375
Spring not only brings
about new life;

25
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,583
it also signals the start of
a new school year as well.

26
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,625
And for all of you
first year students,

27
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,416
I hope you're excited
for the adventures

28
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,166
that await you in middle school.

29
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,500
Know that if you need help
finding your new classes,

30
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,708
our excellent teachers
would be more than happy

31
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,750
to assist you.

32
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,708
It can be confusing at first.

33
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,666
I'm sure the second
and third year students

34
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,125
will set a fine example.

35
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,041
[STUDENTS chattering]

Man, that was so boring.

37
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,083
[STUDENT 1E]
Yeah, no joke.

38
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,625
[AKANE]
Jeez, I'm so nervous.

39
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,666
Just stay calm, just stay calm.

40
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,166
[AKANE whimpers]

41
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,750
Okay.

42
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,958
It's so cool, the graphics
on that game's like so legit.

43
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,541
[KOTAROU] Even in middle school,
inequality is alive and well.

44
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,208
There's the upper class
and lower class.

45
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,791
There's the cool clubs...

46
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,791
...and the not-so-cool clubs.

47
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,458
Whether it's good looks
or good grades,

48
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,375
we'll use whatever tools
we can to establish

some kind of pecking order.

00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,583
[HIROSHI] On second thought,
make mine melon!

161
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,750
[AYANE] Hey, Sis,
do you need help with that?

162
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,750
Who's that?

163
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,791
He's just a boy from my class.

164
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,291
[AYANE]
Here you go.

165
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,833
[SAORI]
Thanks, sweetie!

166
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,958
Oh, my gosh, Mom,
you gotta hear this.

167
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,958
No kidding?

168
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,291
So you see, my daughter's
actually in his class!

169
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,166
[JUNKO]
You don't say!

170
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,333
But why didn't you say
anything sooner, Kotarou?

171
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,250
Well, I'm Junko Azumi.

172
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,375
I'm his mother;
nice to meet you.

173
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,791
[HIROSHI]
Oh, hello there!

174
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,416
I'm Akane's father.

175
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,333
Hi! It's a pleasure!

176
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,791
[WOMAN 1B] Just let me know
if you need anything else.

177
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,500
I can't wait to see
you eat all this!

178
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,416
Hilarious!

179
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,375
Leave her alone. Eat up!

180
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,041
Hey, she's pretty cute,
don't ya think?

181
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,916
Now, you cut that out
before you embarrass him

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,333
in front of his
little friend.

183
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,291
Kotarou has eyes;
he knows she's pretty.

184
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,416
[KOTAROU coughs]

185
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,041
[JUNKO]
Are you okay, sweetheart?

186
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,708
It's bitter.

187
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,541
[WOMAN 1C]
Thank you for dining with us.

188
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,083
Maybe we'll see you again.

189
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,875
Jeez, I'm so nervous.

190
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,583
I wish I had my squeezie.

191
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,666
Uh, listen.

192
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,333
Please don't tell anyone...

193
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,416
Y'know, about us
running into each other.

194
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,041
It's so embarrassing.

195
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,958
Um, thanks so much.

196
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,625
But being in your track suit
doesn't embarrass you?

197
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,125
[KOTAROU]
We haven't spoken.

198
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,833
Not since that night
at the restaurant.

199
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,208
Even though we've
noticed each other a lot.

200
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,291
Okay, that should
just about wrap up

201
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,916
the duty assignments.

202
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,416
Next we'll have a briefing.

203
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,916
The Sports Festival Task Groups

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,166
will have a meeting
after school.

205
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,708
So once the announcements
are over at the end of the day,

206
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,791
you can go ahead and
break up into your groups.

207
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,375
Any questions?

208
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,791
[HIRA] Thanks for
meeting with us today.

209
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,333
Let's get started.

210
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,083
I'm Hira from the track club.

211
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,208
This year we'll be taking on
the equipment group's work

212
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,916
for the sports festival.

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,083
It's a big job, so we're
going to need everyone's help

214
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,208
to pull this off.

215
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,208
If you helped us
last year, then great!

216
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,333
You probably already know what
some of our tasks include...

217
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,750
It's curling up.

218
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,875
Huh? The LINE app?

219
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,166
Yeah, that's right.

220
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,708
Last year we made a group
for the task members

221
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,625
and it helped a lot.

222
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,916
You should ask everyone.

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,125
Hey, I need your help, please.

224
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,208
[GROUP]
Huh?

225
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,791
[AOI]
What's up?

226
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:40,666
[ROMAN]
Yo!

227
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,625
[DAICHI]
Don't you have club?

228
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,500
[KOTAROU]
I'm not going today.

229
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,666
[ROMAN]
You skipping?

230
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,583
[KOTAROU]
No, I'm just writing at home.

231
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,041
[ROMAN chuckles] Man, when
are you gonna let me read it?

232
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,375
Never.

233
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,166
[ROMAN] Aw, it's not like
it's top secret info!

234
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,166
[KOTAROU]
Doesn't matter.

235
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,458
[ROMAN]
Yes, it does!

236
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,375
[GROUP laughing]

237
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,083
[DAICHI]
Oh, yeah? Still doesn't hurt!

238
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:58,833
Ow! Ow!

239
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,333
[chattering]

240
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,416
[AKANE]
LINE.

241
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,583
[AYANE humming]

242
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,708
[phone whistles]

243
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,916
[AKANE]
Okay, got it.

244
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,458
Now I just need
to get Curly- <i>kun</i> 's ID.

245
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,083
[SETSUKO]
Oh, yeah. Hey, Nagahara,

246
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,833
did you check
LINE yesterday?

247
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,791
Because you never
responded to me.

248
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,000
[SHOU]
I was at the arcade.

249
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,250
[SETSUKO]
You're the worst.

250
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,000
[SHOU]
Dude, come on!

251
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,833
--I said I was sorry!
--Sorry isn't good enough.

252
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,750
[SHOU] But I set the new
high score in <i>Taiko</i> !

253
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,083
[SETSUKO]
Actually, that's pretty cool!

254
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,291
[SHOU]
I'm like a drum god!

255
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,458
[AIRA]
What's <i>Taiko</i> ?

256
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,625
[SETSUKO]
It's like a drum rhythm game.

257
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,083
[AIRA]
How do you play it?

258
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,625
[SETSUKO] You should ask
Nagahara to teach you.

259
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,125
[SHOU]
My fee is minimal.

260
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,291
[SETSUKO]
No one's gonna pay you!

261

--[AKANE] Uh...
--[KOTAROU] Uh...

262
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,583

Hey Akane, can you help me?

263
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,291
Uh, yeah, sure!

264
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,041
[DAISUKE]
Hey.

265
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,166
Hi.

266
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,791
[DAISUKE] We're practicing
for the festival next week.

267
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,125
Cool.

268
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,166
[DAISUKE]
That's a great short story.

269
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,625
[KOTAROU gasps]

270
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,166
Dazai writes a
girl's inner thoughts

271
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,125
from a first person
point of view.

272
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,125
Though personally
I don't think a guy

273
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,166
can truly understand
a girl's feelings, y'know?

274
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,041
[KOTAROU chuckles]
Yeah.

275
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,708
[DAISUKE]
Oh, here's this.

276
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,708
It's the thing we were
talking about before.

277
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,458
[KOTAROU]
"Yudemen"?

278
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,250
That's right.
It's the original album

279
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,875
by a folk rock super
group called Happy End.

280
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,500
All of the band members went on

281
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,750
to become well known
in the music industry.

282
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,291
They're pretty amazing.

283
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,708
[DAISUKE]
Borrow it as long as you'd like.

284
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,875
I'll take good care of it.

285
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,625
[DAISUKE]
Any books you want today?

286
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,125
I guess I'll get this one.

287
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,875
Then this one's on me.

288
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,041
[DAISUKE] You should
read all kinds of books.

289
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,416
[KOTAROU chuckles]

290
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,208
[GYM TEACHER 1A] Azumi,
care to explain why you missed

291
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,833
the equipment meeting?

292
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,250
[AKANE]
Huh?

293
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,708
[KOTAROU]
I'm... I'm sorry.

294
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,791
[GYM TEACHER 1A] Everyone
else is doing their part.

295
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,458
Get with the program.

296
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,583
[KOTAROU]
Okay.

00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,041
[AKANE gasps]

298

299
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,166
[KOTAROU]
Yes, sir.

300
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,125
[AKANE]
Excuse me.

301
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,208
[KOTAROU gasps]

302
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,333
You scared me!

303
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,250
I'm actually the one
who forgot to contact you,

304
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,333
I'm sorry!

305
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,541
[AKANE] There's a contact list
for the equipment group.

306
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,375
Uh... oh.

307
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,416
Do... you have a LINE ID?

308
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,833
I made a LINE group
for the task members.

309
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,583
Oh.

310
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,500
[KOTAROU] I don't have
my phone on me right now.

[AKANE gasps]
Wait, I've got it.

312
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,916
Here it is.

313
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,500
Here's my ID.

314
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,000
Right, thank you.

315
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,291
I can help you!

316
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,541
[KOTAROU]
Uh, it's okay.

317
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,125
But it is kinda my fault.

318
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,750
[KOTAROU]
Don't you have club?

319
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,041
Yeah, it's okay.

320
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,041
It won't take long
if we work together.

321
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,208
There's dust on your jacket.

322
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,000
Where at?

323
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,916
On your back. I'll get it.

324
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,083
[AKANE]
There, much better.

325
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,666
[AKANE]
I really am sorry.

326
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,875
[KOTAROU]
It's fine.

327
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,041
Bye.

328
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,208
[KOTAROU]
Bye.

329
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,583
[KOTAROU chuckles]

330

Dazai once said,

332
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,708
"The feeling of joy is
perhaps like a speck of gold,

333
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,708
glimmering faintly at the
bottom of a river of grief."

334
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,416
[AYANE]
Your boyfriend?

335
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,041
[AKANE]
Butt out, nosy!

336
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,666
This'll teach her.
