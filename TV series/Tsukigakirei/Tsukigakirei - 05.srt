<i>Kokoro</i> is a classic book.

202
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,833
Written by the novelist
Natsume Souseki.

203
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,583
The setting is during
the Meiji era,

and the plot of the story
revolves around a love triangle.

No, it's fine, really.

329
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,291
[KOTAROU] Dazai once said,
"One thing that humans have

330
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,750
that other creatures don't:

331
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,375
We have secrets."

332
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,166
Once again,
I guess he was right.

333
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,125
[phone chimes]

334
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,625
[AKANE]
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

335
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,000
Hey, Roman,
have you gained weight?

336
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,291
How can you tell?

337
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,208
Eh, looks to be
around four pounds.

338
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,041
Awesome! You're exactly right!

339
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,333
I can guess a person's weight
with only a quick glance.

340
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,666
[GIRLS gasp]

341
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,708
[AIRA]
Don't use your voodoo on me!

342
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,791
[MIU] What kind of
superpower is that?

343
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,041
Oh, hey.

344
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,291
[YASUHITO]
Huh?

345
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,166
--Which one's better?
--[YASUHITO] This one.

346
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,291
[MIU]
Hmm...

347
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,458
I like the other one.

348
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,500
[YASUHITO]
So why bother asking me?

349
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,041
Which one of these is better?

350
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,125
Uh, oh, well I like
whatever you like!

351
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,625
Wow, you're useless.

352
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,458
[YASUHITO]
I seriously can't win!

353
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,958
What an obnoxious vehicle!

354
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,875
Probably some hooligan!

355
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,833
Mom! Dad! What's up, you guys?

356
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:57,500
[BOTH gasp]

357
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:58,791
Ayane?!

358
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,291
[AYANE] My boyfriend
gave me a ride home.

359
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,250
Hello there,
I'm Ayane's boyfriend.

360
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,166
My name is Riku Kasai.

361
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,458
Nice to meet you!

362
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,083
[SAORI]
What a polite young man!

363
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,083
[HIROSHI]
Complete loser!

364
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,791
Are you going to college?

365
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,500
Yes, and thanks to my boss,

366
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,750
I'm also apprenticing
in carpentry.

367
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,666
Through hard work, I hope to
become a respected craftsman.

368
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,208
[SAORI]
What a dedicated young man!

369
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,458
[HIROSHI growls]
And a suck-up!

370
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,500
[toy squeaks]

371
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,458
He actually gave that to you?

372
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,166
What a respectable young man!

373
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,208
