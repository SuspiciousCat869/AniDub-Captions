[KOTAROU sighs]

2
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,750
[KOTAROU]
I'm applying.

3
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,708
But I still haven't
really told my parents.

4
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,583
Right.

5
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,916
[JUNKO]
Can you believe Kotarou?

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,166
He's finally studying!
I'm so happy.

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,666
[JUNKO] I'm so glad
that the festival is over.

8
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,041
Without that silly drum
practice to distract him,

9
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,208
Kotarou actually seems to be
taking his future seriously.

10
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,708
[KOTAROU]
Dazai once said,

11
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,250
"To decide that I'm hopeless
before I even begin

12
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,958
is nothing but laziness."

13
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,750
I can't afford to be lazy.

14
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,458
[JUNKO] He was just so absorbed
in that little festival.

15
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,250
Not to mention his novels.
He just wouldn't listen to me!

16
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,333
[chuckles]

17
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,125
You don't say?

18
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,625
About a high school...

19
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,250
We would most prefer for him
to attend something public.

20
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,291
And of course the closer
to home, the better!

21
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,541
I really think that's what
would be most suitable for him.

22
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,083
It sounds like you might want
a municipal school, then.

23
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,125
[KOTAROU]
No.

24
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,708
I want a private school.

25
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,916
One like Koumei.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,208
[JUNKO]
Huh?

27
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,833
[RYOUKO]
Koumei?

28
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,666
Wait... isn't that where
Mizuno is applying?

29

[JUNKO gasps]

30
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,250
What's the meaning
of this, young man?

31
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,625
Who's Mizuno?

32
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,166
Why didn't you tell me about it?

33
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,791
--Where is this school even at?
--[RYOUKO] Well, uh...

34
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,125
Answer me!

35

[JUNKO]
Well?

36
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,666
What's going on?

37
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,708
Why didn't you tell us
about Koumei?

38
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,541
[KOTAROU]
I literally just decided.

39
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,041
I literally don't care.

40
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,166
This wasn't your
decision to make alone!

41
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,541
Your entire future
is riding on this!

42
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,958
Do you get that?

43
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,416
Yes, I'm aware.

44
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,541
Kotarou...

45
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,083
Why does it have to be
that particular school?

46
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,041
Uh, Koumei, was it?

47
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,416
Because some girl
is going there?

48
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,458
Wait, a girl?

49
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,791
Yes, his teacher said
something about it.

50
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,000
I think she said
her name was Mizuno?

51
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,583
Ugh. I was so embarrassed.

52
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,708
I can't believe you'd let
some silly little crush

53
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,333
rule a decision as big as this!

54
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,625
[KOTAROU]
I've thought this through!

55
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,000
It's clear that you haven't!

56
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,250
Yes, I have, Mom!

57
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,250
If that's the case, you tell me!

58
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,791
You tell me, why go
all the way to Chiba?

59
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,208
Tell me why it's so important!

60
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,666

That's what I thought.

[KOTAROU]
Sorry.

00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,500
Now just calm down; yelling
won't help. Let's talk--

00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,208
You're being way
too easy on him!

67
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,458
As his parents, we know
what is best for Kotarou!

68
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,708
Koumei High School is nothing--

[KOTAROU]
I don't care!

I've made up my mind.

after graduation?

What then?

is harder than you think.

[JUNKO]
Thanks.

166
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,208
[JUNKO] Excuse me,
I'm looking for Miss Sonoda.

167
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,125
[RYOUKO]
Oh. Hello!

168
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,125
Thank you for coming in.

169
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,083
No problem. You wanted to meet?

170
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,500
[DAISUKE]
Exams are pretty brutal, huh?

171
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,125
Yeah, and, my grades suck.

172
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,250
Is that so?

173
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,375
I'm just worried.

174
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,500
I might fail.

175
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,916
You look kinda pale.

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,291
Are you eating right?

177
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,666
Your parents are
probably worried, too.

178
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, worried I'll go to Koumei.

179
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,833
They don't really approve.

180
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,250
Regardless,
take care of yourself.

181
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,250
Get lots of sleep,
eat well, all that jazz.

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,541
After things calm down,

183
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,958
maybe you should try
talking to your folks again.

184
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,875
[door opens]

185
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,875
[KOTAROU]
I'm home.

186
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,333
Hi, welcome back!

187

[GIRL 11B]
Look, this bear is huge!

190
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,333
[GIRL 11A]
So cute!

[KOTAROU panting]

192
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,041
[AKANE]
Huh?

193
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,291
Hey, were you waiting long?

194
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,666
[AKANE]
Not at all.

195
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,875
It's been a long time
since we've hung out.

196
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,000
[KOTAROU, AKANE]
Hey. Uh...

197

[BOTH chuckle]

198
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,041
[AKANE]
Sorry. I know you need to study.

199
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,166
[KOTAROU]
It's okay.

200
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,250
So, this is...

201
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,583
[KOTAROU]
Hm?

202
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,666
...for you.

203
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,000
[KOTAROU gasps]

204
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,333
Wow, thank you!

205
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,458
Oh, uh, here.

206
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,041
Is it okay to open it?

207
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,083
[KOTAROU]
Sure.

208
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,708
[AKANE gasps]

209
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,583
[KOTAROU] I thought maybe
you could use it for track.

210
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,708
It's so cute!

211
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,541
Thanks so much!

212
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,000
[KOTAROU chuckles]

213
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,750
So? Can I open mine?

214
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:02,791
[AKANE]
Uh-huh.

215

Um...

I'm so sorry!

I know it's bad.

[KOTAROU gasps]

219
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,666
It's actually my
first time knitting.

220
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,458
Uh... Seriously?

221
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,666
It's awesome!

222
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,083
What's wrong?

223
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,166
[gasps] What the heck?

224
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,916
It's totally ginormous.

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sorry.

[KOTAROU]
It's perfect!

228
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,166
See?

229
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,750
Cozy!

230
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,583
Well, that's good.

231
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,291
Thank so much, Akane.

232
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,333
[AKANE]
You're studying a lot, huh?

233
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,458
[KOTAROU]
Mm-hmm.

234
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,000
[AKANE]
You always look sleepy lately.

235
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,041
[KOTAROU chuckles]
Eh.

236
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,583
[AKANE]
Are you staying up real late?

237
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,833
[KOTAROU]
Yeah.

238
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,125
[AKANE]
I see.

239
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,541
[KOTAROU]
I'm running out of time.

240
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,041
[AKANE]
Hm?

241
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,666
My mom's against the
whole Koumei thing,

242
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,375
so I tried to get
my test scores up

243
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,958
to prove her wrong.

244
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,958
But I'm still really struggling.

245
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,250
[AKANE] Having your family's
support means a lot, huh?

246
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,125
You know what?

247
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,083
For my last track meet,
my mom made me

248
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,750
a special lunch.

249
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,958
It had a note that said,

250
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,375
"Good work over
the past three years."

251
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,416
[KOTAROU]
Huh.

252
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,916
[AKANE] My parents were
always cheering me on.

253
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,625
It really meant a lot to me.

254
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,375
[KOTAROU] No matter
what, I'll try my hardest.

255
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,416
[AKANE]
Hmm.

256
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,625
[AKANE]
Me too.

around the corner.

[KOTAROU]
Let's do our best!

259

Yeah.

for Akane's results?

Wait, was that Akane?

[KOTAROU]
Morning.

00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,958
Were you up all night?

00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,416
[KOTAROU]
I was studying.

[milk pouring]

280
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,458
Listen, about high school--

281
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,416
Please don't start, Dad.

282
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,833
You can apply to
Koumei if you want.

283
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,291
But, if you don't
pass the exam,

284
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,375
you have to apply
to a public school.

285
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,625
Okay?

286
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,041
[RYUUNOSUKE]
Deal? Does that sound fair?

287
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,083
Yeah, sure.

288
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,333
[RYUUNOSUKE]
The other day,

289
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,500
your mother met
with your teacher.

290
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,125
Your teacher thought
Koumei was a poor choice

291
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,750
due to your current grades.

292
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,083
[RYUUNOSUKE]
However...

293
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:34,500
Your mom was inclined to
disagree with Miss Sonoda.

294
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,125
She asked her to
give you a chance.

295
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,875
Since you're trying so hard.

296
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,333
[RYUUNOSUKE] I know she's
a bit naggy sometimes.

297
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,708
But it's because she cares.

298
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,625
[KOTAROU groaning]

299
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,375
[KOTAROU sighs]

300
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,625
Oh. Is something wrong?

301
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,750
Are you hungry?

302
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,666
I was just about to
bring this upstairs.

303
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,291
Have a seat.

304
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,916
[JUNKO] I wish you'd start going
to bed a little bit earlier.

305
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,625
You're looking a bit run down.

306
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,750
You're working so hard.

307
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,541
But what good is it if you
get sick before the exam?

308
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,875
[JUNKO]
Here's some tea.

309
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,083
Goodnight, dear.

310
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,541
Uh, goodnight.

311
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,250
[JUNKO]
Don't stay up too late.

312
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,166
Do you have your exam ticket?

313
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,291
[KOTAROU]
Yep, got it.

314
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,500
I wrote down the
train schedule for you.

315
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,291
Don't you dare take
the wrong train,

316
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,750
or else you'll miss your exam.

317
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,291
I won't, Dad, I promise.

318
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,625
Here, it's your lunch.

319
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,666
Thank you, Mom.

320
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,041
Okay, well you'd better
hurry or you'll be late!

321
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,208
See you later.

322
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,708
We believe in you.

323
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,458
[KOTAROU]
Dazai once said.

324
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:48,000
"I must live up to my
precious promises.

325
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,083
And that is all that
matters to me now."
