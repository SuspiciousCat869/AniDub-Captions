00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,666
[yawns]

332
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,791
[gasps]

333
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,041
[AYANE]
What?

334
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,125
Uh... Nothing, sorry.

335
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,625
[AYANE growls]

336
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,666

337
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,083
[phone chimes]

338
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,166
I'm telling you,
when it comes to a guy,

339
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,916
you've gotta have
high standards.

340
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,541
He needs to be smart, kind,

341
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,458
super good-looking,
and preferably rich.

342
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,625
[KASAI]
Truck coming through!

343
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,125
This should only take
a few minutes; pardon us.

344
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,833
[AYANE]
So hot!

345
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,125
And that's how
I met my boyfriend!

346
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,500
Huh...

347
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,333
Forget all that other stuff;
those muscles are legit.

348
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,083
In Kyoto, twice.

349
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,083
No way!

350
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,166
[YASUHITO]
Who paid for the room?

351
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,375
Her parents are loaded.

352
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,416
You're the man!

353
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,458
Yeah, for real!

354
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,208
I know, right?

355
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,375
[laughing]

356
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,083
[SETSUKO]
In Kyoto, we went twice.

357
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,458
--[AIRA] No way.
--[MIU] Ew!

358
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,500
[MIU]
Who paid?

359
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,750
My parents are loaded.

360
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,833
That cheapskate!

361
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,291
What a pathetic loser.

362
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,750
I know, right?
