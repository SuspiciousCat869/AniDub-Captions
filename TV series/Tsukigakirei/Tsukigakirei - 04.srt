00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,125
Cut it out, guys!

164
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,083
[ROMAN]
There's a passcode.

165
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,333
[DAICHI]
Probably his birthday.

166
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,333
[KOTAROU] I'm not kidding!
I said let go!

167
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,541
[ROMAN]
All right, I'm in!

168
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,500
--[ROMAN] It's a girl?!

171
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,416
[HIDAKA] Hey, what are
you still doing up?

172
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,083
[HIDAKA]
I'll take that.

173
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,333
[KOTAROU gasps]

[sighs]

175
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,250
Listen up, you have free time
now until later tonight.

176
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,958
A few final reminders.

177
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:57,250
Stay safe and make good choices.
Have fun, but not too much fun!

178
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,708
You're representing
our entire school,

179
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,583
so be on your
best behavior today!

180
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,291
Do I make myself
perfectly clear?

181
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,833
Hey, where's Setsuko at?

182
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,291
She's off with Nagahara.

183

[AIRA sighs]

184
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,500
Well, where to, then?

185
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,625
--What about Tsubasa?
--Ugh, forget him.

186

[MIU]
Wanna come with us, Akane?

187
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,750
Well, uh...

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,791
[AIRA]
Very suspicious!

[AKANE laughs, sighs]

190
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,250
Are you keeping secrets from us?

191
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,458
Not at all.

192
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,708
My parents were just
asking about souvenirs.

193

[laughs]

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,625
Oh, well that makes sense.

195
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,125
Do you wanna hang
with us, then?

196
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,666
Uh, sure.

197
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,833
[KOTAROU]
Uh...

198
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,250
Let's go hit up the gift shops.

199
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,833
We should use the bus.
I heard it's actually faster.

200
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,125
Hey, Kota.

201
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,375
Let's go, man!

202
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,375

I'm cool with it.

203

Awesome, it's this way.

204
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,916
--[AIRA] Okay.
--[MIU] I'm excited!

Uhh...!

206
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,958
Oh, have you heard about these?

207
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,083
They're supposed to be
great for your skin.

208
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,375
Hey, um...

209
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,958
There's something I need to do.

210
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,208
Like what?

211
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,541
Some shopping.

212
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,500
We'll come with you.

213
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,625
Which store?

214
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,166
Umm...

215
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,250
You can tell us.

216
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,958
Yeah, we're your friends.

217
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,291
I'm... getting a drink.

218
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,833
--A date?
--Why would she lie about that?

219
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,291
Beats the heck out of me.

220
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,416
Something wrong?

221
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,208
Come on, you can tell us.

222
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,083
What's wrong?

223
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,458
Jeez, enough!

224
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,458
Let's split up.

225
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,166
Does that work for you?

226

Come on, Miu.

were gonna train on this trip?

Aw, why'd you bring that up?

How dare you.

a thug or something.

Should I ask her
to give it to me?

00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,833
It's not like you had to.

275

Oh, nevermind, just forget it.

276
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,166
So, we're calling Akane?

277
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,041
[KOTAROU] Yes, if it's
not too much trouble!

Huh? Who's this?

It's Azumi.

283

[AKANE]
But why?

284
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,208
[KOTAROU]
It's a long story.

285
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,416
[AKANE]
I don't get it.

286
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,916
I was waiting.

I know.

292
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,791
[AKANE] You told me
to meet you here.

293
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,791
And then you didn't show up.

294
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,458
It's raining and you
didn't answer your phone...

295
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,125
[KOTAROU]
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,666
The teacher confiscated
my phone last night.

297
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,250
[AKANE] Why'd you use
Chinatsu's phone?

298
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,541
You must be really
close, I guess.

299
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,250
[KOTAROU]
She was just there.

300
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,500
That so?

301
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,166
[KOTAROU]
What is?

302
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,625
Oh, never mind.

303
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,416
I don't know!

304
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,791
I don't know.

305
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,083
We can barely talk
to each other.

306
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,125
Yeah.

307
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,208

I want...

308
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,708

To know you better.

[KOTAROU]
Is that...

311
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,875
...your answer?

312
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,291
[AKANE]
Yes.

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,916
Aren't maikos the
coolest, Miss Ryouko?

316
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,416
Well, they just don't
appeal to me that much.

Hm?

I'm Roman, the maiko.

Whoa! She's friggin' gorgeous!

00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,625
Let me just get my camera!

323

Stay right there!

Hey, let's go somewhere fun.

Okay. I know a great spot. Heh.

326
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,250
[SETSUKO] Wow, he's actually
being dependable for once.

327
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,125
I can't believe that
Nagahara's trying to make

328
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,833
this school trip
so special for us.

329
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,583
He's so wonderful!

330
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,500
[SHOU] You see,
a school trip is special.

331
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,875
Don't you agree?

332
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:08,791
[SETSUKO groans]

333
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,583
This is a friggin' hotel.

334
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,083
[SHOU]
Shoot!

335
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,500
I didn't bring enough cash!

336
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,166
This is the worst.

337
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,000
Darn. Oh, well,
we should head back.

338
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,125
Sorry, Setsuko.
Would you spot me?

339
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,708
Huh?!

340
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,583
[SHOU] Can you put
a price on memories?

341
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,500
[SETSUKO]
He is such a loser.
