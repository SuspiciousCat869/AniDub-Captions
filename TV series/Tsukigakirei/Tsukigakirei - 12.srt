00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,791
[KOTAROU] I have lived through
a lot of embarrassing moments,

2
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,541
but this one's the worst.

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,541
Well, I let you down, Akane.

4
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,541
No.

5
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:46,541
I know that you
worked really hard

6
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,791
and tried your best.

7
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,541
That's all that matters.

8
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,416
Thank you, though.

9
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,166
So, I'll just go to school here.

10
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,041
[AKANE]
Okay.

11
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,541
I see.

12
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,833
Know what I think?

13
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,166
[KOTAROU]
Huh?

14
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,208
Nothing an author goes
through is in vain, right?

15
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,500
'Cause you can use it
in your writing.

16
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,166
So why not write?

17
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:37,916
It might make you feel better.

18
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,125
Jeez. Well, that sucks.

19
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,291
[AKANE]
Right?

20
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,666
[AYANE]
Well, what are you gonna do now?

21
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,541
Huh?

22
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,583
Date long distance? Or what?

23
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:57,625
[AKANE]
Yeah.

24
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,791
[AYANE]
Are you serious?

25
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,416
Of course I am.

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,583
Real talk?

27
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,208
It'll never work out.

28
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,791
[AYANE] Boys only see
that stuff as a hassle.

29
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,291
How would you know?

30
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,416
Just dump him.

31
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,708
You don't have
to be such a jerk!

32
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,625
Well, I'm not the one
dragging things out.

33

[KOTAROU chuckles]

34
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,666
Hey!

35
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,083
Did ya get in?

36
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,000
I did.

37
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:04,875
Me too!

38
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,041
I'm super excited!

39
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,083
I was worried I wouldn't
make it, y'know?

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,416
We'll be together
in high school!

41
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,375
Cool, right?

42
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,625
Uh, cool.

[CHINATSU sighs]

44
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,083
Know what?

45
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,291
I'm like really happy right now.

46
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,333
[KOTAROU chuckles]
Come on, it's just high school.

47
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,458
[CHINATSU]
Which is a big deal!

48
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,125
Though I do feel
a little bad for Akane.

49
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

50
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,125
Do you maybe want me
to change the subject?

51
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,666
Don't worry about it.

52
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,833
[CHINATSU]
So, what are you gonna do now?

53
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,166
[KOTAROU]
Huh?

54
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,791
With Akane.

55
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,625
I guess, uh,
just keep things the same.

56
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,958
[CHINATSU]
Ah, okay.

57
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,708
Hey, Azumi?

58
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,500
I have a confession.

59
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,541
I never mentioned it before
since Akane's my friend.

60
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,250
But uh...

61
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,833
I have to tell you.

62
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,833
I've just always had
a huge crush on you.

[KOTAROU gasps]

64
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,458
How do you feel about me?

65
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,291
[KOTAROU]
Sorry, but...

66
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,458
Glad that's off my chest.

67
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,166
See you in high school!

68
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,916
Later, alligator!

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000

Aw, crying already?

Wow, the dog filter is so funny.

Aww!

You're so lucky, Kota!

85

That was the worst picture ever!

Why?

You look dead, dude.

Well, I was up
writing all night.

Must be something good!

Nah.

--It's a secret.

What's the point
of writing it then?

99
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,500
You could post it online.

100

Sorry. Were you waiting long?

[AKANE]
Mm-mm.

109
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,041
[KOTAROU]
Moving must be pretty rough.

110
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,416
[AKANE]
We're used to it by now.

111

[KOTAROU]
Tomorrow's the big day.

[AKANE]
Yeah.

113
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,916
So when can we meet up again?

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
[AKANE]
Whenever, I guess.

115
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,416
Can I visit you?

116
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,375
[AKANE]
Mm-hmm.

117
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,625
Every weekend?

Uh, is that too much?

119
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,583
It's not that.

120
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,666
But train fare is expensive.

121
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,916
So I'll get a job.

122
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,958
I'll get one, too.

123

three or four times a week.

And we can text.

Still, though.

139
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,958
It's not fair for you
to do everything.

Nah, it's fine.

up too, you know.

And I'm sorry.

[crying]

171
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,208
[AKANE]
What should I do?

172
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,958
[crying continues]

173
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,416
[HIROSHI]
Honey, can I throw this out?

174
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,708
[SAORI]
What is "this"?

175
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,041
I need you to be
more specific, dear.

176
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,458
[AYANE]
Mom, the movers have a question.

177
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,291
[SAORI]
Ask your father.

178
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,041
[SAORI]
Akane!

179
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,750
Do you have everything?

180
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:11,875
Yeah.

181
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,166
[MOVER 12A]
That's everything.

182
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,208
[MOVER 12B]
Got it.

183
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,875
[AKANE]
I'm gonna miss you so much.

184
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,208
Both of you.

185
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,666
[CHINATSU]
I'll miss you more.

186
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,416
[AOI]
It's not a contest.

187
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,833
Get it together.

188
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,166
Come on, guys.

189
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,208
Stop.

190
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,250
[GIRLS crying]

191
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,250
See you later.

192
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,750
Bye.

193
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,791
Yeah.

194
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,708
Here's a thought.

195
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,750
Would you rather just
catch the train later?

196
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,791
You mean it?

197
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,833
Absolutely, so take your time.

198
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,041
You shouldn't have
to rush goodbyes.

199
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,125
Hey, Akane.

200
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,750
What about Azumi?

201
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,166
Ah. The thing is--

202
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,291
[CHINATSU]
Oh, yeah!

203
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,291
Just a sec.

204
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,500
[CHINATSU]
Check it out!

205
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,541
I found it online not long ago.

206
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,375
No way.

207
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,208
[AKANE]
This sounds like me and Kotarou.

208
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,750
[taiko drums playing]

209
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,916
[DAISUKE]
Kotarou!

210
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,083
It's today?

211
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,208
The move?

212
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,125
That reminds me,
I read your story online.

213
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,166
[KOTAROU]
Uh, well...

214
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,875
[DAISUKE]
Hey, you updated it.

215
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,500
It has a ton of comments.

216
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,416
[KOTAROU gasps]

217
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,625
[DAISUKE]
See for yourself.

218
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,250
You seem surprised.

219
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,166
It's popular, though.

220
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,708
Congratulations.

221
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,416
[AOI] All right, goodbye
for real this time.

222
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,541
Promise to come
back and visit us.

223
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,916
I promise.

224
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Bye, guys.

225
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,958

[phone chimes]

227
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,750
[KOTAROU]
Dazai once said,

228
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,041
"The true substance of love
lies in the act of howling

229
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,916
words of love,
with the desperation of a man

230
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,666
jumping into high seas."

231

233
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,791
No!

234
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,375
[AKANE]
The end?

235
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,250
[KOTAROU panting]

236
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,958
[coughs]

237
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,375
[KOTAROU]
I love you!

238
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,750
[AKANE crying]

239
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,916
[KOTAROU]
She was my first love.

240
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,500
Back when I knew nothing.

241
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,458
I was young and naïve.

242
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,375
She taught me
how to hold hands.

243
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,416
How to kiss.

244
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,958
We shared secrets--

245
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,083
Things we'd never share
with our friends.

246
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,750
[AKANE]
I was always anxious.

247
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,666
And I never knew what to do.

248
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,750
But that day, when he found
the courage to tell me...

249
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:42,125
I began to believe we
would always walk together,

250
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,583
on the same path.

251
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,125
[KOTAROU]
To find someone you love,

252
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,458
and for that person
to return your love...

253
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,000
[AKANE] That is the
greatest kind of miracle.
