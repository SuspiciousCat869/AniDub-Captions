I think that you're...

327
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,166
You're fine.

328
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,208
Just the way you are.

329
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,833
Have a good night.

330
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,250
[AKANE]
Uh, thanks.

331
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,125
[phone chimes]

332
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,333
[KOTAROU laughs]

333
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,416
[phone chimes]

334
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,000
[laughing]

335
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,333
[phone chimes]

336
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,333
And also,

337
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,208
this section here was
a little confusing to me.

338
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,875
Maybe try and clarify
it for the reader.

339
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,208
[KOTAROU]
Okay.

340
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,041
Uh, but I really
liked the story.

341
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,083
Thanks!

342
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,666
[DAISUKE] I thought you were
embarrassed to show people

343
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,791
your stories.

344
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
Yeah.

345
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,916
[keyboard clicking]

346
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,125
I get way embarrassed,
but I also really love running.

347
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,250
[KOTAROU] People can
influence other people.

348
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,000
How about that?

349
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,125
[AIRA]
I'm so jealous!

350
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,875
Isn't that lipstick expensive?

351
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:00,833
[AIRA]
You're like a celebrity.

352
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,500
[SETSUKO]
It's not a big deal.

353
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,958
You're lucky, Setsuko!

354
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,541
You have lots of money and
a super cute boyfriend too!

355
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,250
Hey, what's Nagahara like?

356
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,250
He's a gentleman.

357
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,291
[AIRA, MIU]
Mm-hmm.

358
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,500
And he's always
really sweet to me.

359
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,375
[AIRA, MIU]
Mm-hmm.

360
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,875
And he's very boyfriend-like.

361
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,708
[AIRA, MIU gasp]

362
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,750
[AIRA] So he's only
a gentleman around you!

363
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:18,833
[MIU]
For real!

364
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:19,958
[AKANE]
How surprising.

365
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,708
[SETSUKO] Only when he
wants to mess around.

366
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,208
[groans]

367
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,166
[RYOUKO]
No way! But he's my student...

368
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,166
Hey, do you like Miss Ryouko?

369
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,041
Yep! Love her!

370
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,000
She's an awesome teacher!

371
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,250
[RYOUKO]
Does he mean love love?

372
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,291
Okay. Go out with me, babe.

373
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,875
--[AIRA] What?
--[TSUBASA] Just say yes.

374
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,958
As if.

375
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,250
Huh, what's is it?

376
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,833
Your face is turning red.

377
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,958
Well, duh, I mean, you're all
up in my personal space.

378
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,916
You'd better not kiss me!

379
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,041
What? You saying you
don't want me to?

380
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,166
Go away!

381
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,583
Come on, let's get
outta here, babe.

382
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,875
[AIRA]
Yeah, right, in your dreams!
