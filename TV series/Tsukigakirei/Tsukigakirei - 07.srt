I think I liked our old
music teacher better

328
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,666
than Miss Ryouko.

329
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,000
I feel the same way.

330
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,958
But I mean, it's not like
I hate her or anything.

331
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,166
There's just something
about her.

332
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,583
Something...

333
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,000
...annoying.

334
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,250
[GIRLS laugh]

335
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,458
[AIRA]
Exactly.

336
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,583
[BOYS inhale]

337
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,125
She smells so amazing!

338
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,791
Oh, man, our teacher must
be some kind of goddess!

339
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:20,916
[SETSUKO, MIU growl]

340
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,250
[SETSUKO]
Boys are stupid.

341
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,083
[MIU] I thought it was against
the rules for teachers

342
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,250
to wear perfume.

343
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,833
Too much perfume is trashy.

344
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,666
You're absolutely right, Aira.

345
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,750
I found the type
of perfume she uses.

346
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,041
Does that say soap scent?

347
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,541
Really? How childish.

348
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,583
Yeah.

349
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,291
--[MIU] I wanna try.
--[SETSUKO] I got next.

350
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,541
[AIRA]
Stop hogging it!

351
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,833
[GIRLS inhale]

352
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,083
Wow, that smells heavenly!

353
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,708
[MIU] It's nice,
but not overwhelming.

354
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:47,875
I might buy one.

355
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,708
[AKANE]
Hey, check this out!

356
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:54,916
[AIRA]
What?

357
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,166
Wait, isn't that Miss Ryouko?

358
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,000
The caption says,
"Charming Women Spotted

359
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,375
Around Town."

360
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,583
I've heard of this website;
it's like super popular!

361
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,916
I can't believe they tagged her!

362
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,541
[MIU] I saw you on
that website, Miss Ryouko!

363
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,416
[overlapping chatter]

364
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,166
[SHOU] Since when did the
girls like her so much?

365
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,250
[TSUBASA]
Beats me.

366
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,000
I wanna break up.

367
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,083
But why?

368
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,166
Well, for one thing,
it's because...

369
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,666
...you never listen to me.

370
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,291
You're cheap and you just
wanna mess around all the time.

371
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,916
Okay, fine, let's talk about it.

372
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,916
[SHOU] This looks like
a great place to chat.

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,916
[SETSUKO growls]

374
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,583
I knew it was too
good to be true.

375
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,458
What a loser.

376
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,083
Sorry, can you pay?

377
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,625
You're a total jerk!

378
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,583
[AIRA] So Setsuko
finally dumped Nagahara.

379
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,625
[MIU]
Wow!

380
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,541
Wait, that would mean
the biggest player

381
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:55,125
in class is single, and
potentially heartbroken.

382
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,708
Maybe he's actually
a super sensitive guy

383
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,500
with a heart of gold
and a soft spot

384
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,041
for cute animals.

385
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,125
What if I'm the only one
who can bring out

386
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,541
his more sensitive side?

387
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,250
"Weird, this is the
first time we've talked,

388
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,916
but it feels like we've
known each other forever."

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,083
"Yes, it must be destiny!"

390
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:17,625
And then, the two of us
fall madly in love!

391
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,291
[BOYS laughing]

392
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,666
[SAKURA]
Nah, that fantasy's dumb.
