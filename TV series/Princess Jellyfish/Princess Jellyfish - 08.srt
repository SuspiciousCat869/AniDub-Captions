1
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,541
Yikes... dust-bunny central!

2
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,916
Get it off!

3
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,791
Now all we gotta do is
track down the good stuff.

4
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:57,916
Maybe?!

5
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,291
No dice.

6
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,416
Wow... those are great!

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,791
Whaddya mean "great?"
These are tacky as hell!

8
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:10,875
Don't be a snob. Aw, I think
the pattern's really cute!

9
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,875
Fine! Next box!

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,666
Her family must be old.
The further back you look,

11
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,583
the dustier the
boxes seem to be...

12
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,458
"Dustier..." Yes, of course!

13
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,666
Change o' plan! Forget the
crap in the front of the room!

14
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,916
It's the golden oldies we want!

15
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,541
The mother lode!
Retro '70s kitchenware!

16
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,000
So lame!

17
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,375
Morons!

18
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,750
Dolphin dishes for the win!

19
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,333
That's my favorite set, also!

20
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,875
Morons... all of ya!

21
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,166
Trendy antique shops are selling
this stuff and making bank!

22
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,750
We could get a hundred
thousand yen, easy.

23
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,833
A hundred thousand?!

24
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,958
Shu. I hear that
developer will be at

25
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,291
next week's
exploratory meeting.

26
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,458
I trust all our materials
are suitably ready?

27
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,166
I'm sorry, Father. Not yet.

28
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,791
Son, go on inside.
I'll be along.

29
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,666
But... yes sir.

30
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,333
Does Shu seem a
little bit... off to you?

31
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,666
He seems like the
same ol' Shu to me.

32
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,541
You know those pricey wheels
you wanted for the Benz?

33
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,958
His glasses... were
returned by a seductress.

34
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,541
So he has a girlfriend?

35
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,500
Looks like he dealt with
his issue and finally had se--

36
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,708
Hey! You idiot, we're out
in public! Not another word!

37
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,000
This leaves us with an
altogether different problem

38
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:04,666
to solve. Have this
mystery woman looked into.

39
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,291
I'm sorry, sir.

40
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,291
I know I'm in your
personal employ...

41
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:18,000
But Shu has been my
friend since we were kids.

42
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:22,333
That's why... I can't bear
to spy on him or his lover.

43
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,166
I refuse.
Fire me if you must.

44
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,291
I'll buy you a
brand new Benz...

45
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,958
Yo. Sugi m'man... Yeah, I need
a background check on somebody.

46
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:36,125
What? Usual spot? All righty,
see you at the Mr. Doughnut.

47
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,125
That's Sugimoto, an
old school friend of mine

48
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,375
from abacus class. Works
as a private eye these days.

49
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,125
Right. From abacus class.

50
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,791
Okay. I give up. What's this
white thing supposed to be?

51
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,666
Its a little Clara
good luck charm I made.

52
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,416
Hand-made? Wow, that's cool.
This, I'm thinking we could

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
part with for a hundred yen.

54
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,083
Check it out!
How much do you want?

55
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,250
For you? Three thousand yen!

56
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,916
Huh? Three thousand?!
That's pretty steep!

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,208
What? That's a killer price!

58
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,083
These are genuine
Wedgewood mugs we're--

59
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,750
No... not the
mugs, silly! That guy!

60
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,291
Wha--?! This thing?

61
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,541
Yeah, of course!
It is so cute!

62
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,625
Well... how about 500?

63
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,041
Sold!

64
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,416
You always find the good stuff!

65
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,083
She bought it!

66
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,416
It sold!

67
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,041
Tsukimi! Call the girls!

68
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:42,875
Huh?

69
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,083
What? Any clothing
we don't want?

70
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:50,208
And a sewing kit?
Bring 'em now? Okay...

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,125
She just said if we bring
a sewing kit over to them,

72
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,083
she'll give us 5,000 yen.

73
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,708
Let's hit the road!

74
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,625
One old-fashioned
and... iced coffee.

75
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,541
Hold up. Make that two
of each, why don't ya.

76
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,708
'Sup!

77
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,291
Hey you made it.

78
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:14,416
Geez... Must be rough,
huh? Growing up political.

79
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,458
Imagine a grown man
having to get every piece of

80
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,208
strange he meets
vetted by his parents?

81
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,791
So... this vamp got a name?

82
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,083
No name, huh?

83
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,333
No worries, friend-o.
Just sketch her for me.

84
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,916
Now draw me a Benz. S-Class.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,958
A Benz S-Class?

86
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,583
Damn, you got chops when
it comes to drawing cars.

87
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,375
Y'ever see a Benz do a hit
and run, their ass is caught.

88
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,166
Uh... those are all I can draw.

89
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,791
Anyway, I'm on the hunt. I'll
see what sorts o' shenanigans

90
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,458
the young master's up to. Oh.

91
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,541
Give my doughnut
a good home, yeah?

92
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,583
Huh? Thank you! I will.

93
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,458
Hey! I'm so glad you came!

94
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,166
We're doomed! This
is Stylish country!

95
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,958
Get back here!

96
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,958
It burns! The fashion. It burns!

97
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,833
Oh, you're fine! I'll gussy
you up again. How's that sound.

98
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,500
Shirt! Wrap! Hat!
And Chieko, you rock it OG.

99
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,708
Again?!

100
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,875
You're not even trying today.

101
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,416
There's too much to do.
That's all I can manage!

102
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,875
Tsukimi! You ready?

103
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,208
Uh, almost... Just a sec...

104
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,750
Huh? Tsukimi?

105
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,833
Say, where has
she scampered away to?

106
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,916
She's right here! Follow the
finger. I dressed her up a bit.

107
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,500
Sorry... I didn't
even know it was you.

108
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,041
Can you find it in your
heart to forgive me, Tsukimi?!

109
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,000
I thought you were
one of those dirty Stylsh,

110
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,875
so I yelled the word
"Die!" in my mind at least

111
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,166
two hundred
times just now.

112
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,708
It's fine. Here. I'll
put my glasses back on.

113
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,208
Please don't die!

114
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,458
Here's the plan. We're all gonna
sit here and make Claras.

115
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,916
Hang on.
Y'mean here, in public?

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,833
What's your game?!

117
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,833
We already sold one of 'em.

118
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,583
Whoa. How much'd you
get for it? Like, ten?

119
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,750
Five hundred.

120
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,958
You know, I
don't think jellyfish

121
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,708
come in bright floral print.

122
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,416
Wha? But, you said... I was
supposed to make more Claras

123
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,958
out of these
clothes in the box...

124
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,625
Honestly, Tsukimi! You don't
just grab something willy-nilly!

125
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,833
Finding the perfect fabric
is what fashion is all about!

126
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,041
Check this little beauty out!

127
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,250
Fluttering frills.

128
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,625
Hey you! Going up?

129
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,708
Go on ahead, Father.
I need to use the restroom

130
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,416
before the meeting.

131
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,000
You're doing this
to me why, exactly?

132
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,125
Meet me for drinks tonight
at my building's bar, lover,

133
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,291
and we'll talk all about it.

134
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,208
And if I say no?

135
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,125
Blackmail. Ah. You do
know that's a crime.

136
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,458
Come on. Life is
so boring if you don't

137
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,958
break a few
rules now and then.

138
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,208
The redevelopment
project. Of course.

139
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,666
You want my father
to sign off on it.

140
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,083
Now, don't keep me waiting.

141
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,250
Like a boss!

142
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,625
Look at her go!
Warp Factor Nine!

143
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,833
How can you sew
by hand that fast?!

144
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,916
How can I not? It's a
must for traditional clothing.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,958
I have to start with nothing
more than a bolt of fabric.

146
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,416
"Go big or go
home," as they say.

147
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,833
And, here you are!

148
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,750
It's... It's...
It's... perfect!

149
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,000
Damn!

150
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,208
A Sanderia malayensis!
Her name is Sissy!

151
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,250
Just look at the lovely
lace. It's more than perfect!

152
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,750
She's a brand new character,
and I bet she wants

153
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,041
a little sister, whaddya say?!

154
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,541
You think anyone's gonna
buy a fabric jellyfish?

155
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,916
Not even
Stylish are that dumb!

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,875
Even kids are gonna
think they're lame!

157
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,791
Lookit how pretty
the weather charm is!

158
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,416
What's it cost?

159
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,458
Five hundred yen.

160
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,125
No, little girl!
Why do you vex me?!

161
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,541
Y'know, these aren't
charms for good weather.

162
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,208
They're jellyfish dolls!

163
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,708
Huh? Those
squishy ocean things?

164
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,750
Well I'll be! I don't
think I've ever seen

165
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,708
little jellyfish dolls before.

166
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,125
Hey, I want one!

167
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,791
Yeah! I do too!

168
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,416
What are these?
They're adorable!

169
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,541
Hand sewn jellyfish!

170
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,375
Oh, how much?!

171
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,333
Only five hundred!

172
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,041
Too cute! What does it do?

173
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,958
Nothing! It's a jellyfish!

174
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,500
We're gonna need a poster!

175
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,500
Nobody can figure
out what they are!

176
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,458
What... should it say?

177
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,541
Something like, "World's best,
and only, jellyfish dolls!

178
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,666
A unique face on
every one! Buy one now!"

179
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,875
That makes no sense
at all! You're fired!

180
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,916
Trains are not relevant!

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,875
Neither is Takeo Chii!

182
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,291
Never mind! Tsukimi, can you--

183
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:40,125
Perfect! Flower
Hat Jelly! Purple Jelly!

184
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,583
Lion's Mane Jelly!
Spotted Jelly!

185
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,666
Meet the family!

186
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,083
Mayaya! Move all the
ceramic stuff outta the way!

187
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,750
We're goin' full jelly!

188
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,041
Hold on... did we...?!

189
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,541
We sold 'em all!

190
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,333
Commercial message!

191
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,458
Clara!

192
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:10,958
Are ya ready for more?!

193
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:11,833
Tequila!

194
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,166
Hey, Chieko! D'you have a piggy
bank 'round here somewhere?

195
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,166
Believe so. Let me check...

196
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,375
Will this work?

197
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,500
A wood bear. Not
quite what I asked...

198
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,250
It looks like wood, but
it's made out of ceramic.

199
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,250
See? Money goes in the slot.

200
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,708
He's been stabbed in the
back by a treacherous yen note!

201
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,541
This knick-knack embodies
the defeat of Earth's wildlife

202
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,750
at the hands of
humanity's greed.

203
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,500
Yeah, whatever.

204
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,916
Huh?

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,458
Starting now, we're gonna
save all the money we can.

206
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,166
This is our war chest.

207
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,416
War chest?

208
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,625
Yeah, our bankroll! So
we can make thousands of

209
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,166
jellyfish dolls and
sell 'em on the internet!

210
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,041
Whoa-ho! You're
gonna make us slaves

211
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,833
like those poor kids
in "Temple of Doom!"

212
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,625
Spare me! You guys
don't do squat right now.

213
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,875
Do a little work for a change!

214
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,375
Yo, original Clara here!
Number One on this week's

215
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,166
"Top Five Things You Shouldn't
Ask the Sisterhood..."

216
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,333
"Do... work!" They hate that!

217
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,125
Those who don't work
don't eat, if ya ask me!

218
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,333
Hold up... Where'd
Tsukimi run off to?

219
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,541
Hi, Mom...

220
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,458
Tell ya what, Tsukimi. When
you grow up and get married.

221
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,291
I'll make you a dress
just like these jellyfish.

222
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:35,583
So, yeah... I know that
girls like me don't get

223
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:40,000
Prince Charming at the
end of the story, but maybe...

224
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,916
I'm sorry, does
that sound weird?

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,291
That a jellyfish would
remind me of a princess?

226
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:49,583
Y'know... just maybe by some
one-in-a-billion chance...

227
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,208
Tsukimi!

228
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,791
Some guy actually
did want to marry me...

229
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,208
...and if... if you were
still alive to see it...

230
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,791
I'm coming in!

231
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,291
I'd hold you to your
promise... and have you

232
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,541
make my wedding dress...

233
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,916
Tsukimi...?

234
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,750
Have you lost your mind?!

235
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,208
The Hell was that...?!

236
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:38,083
Fine, I get it. I'll leave.
You're welcome! Good night!

237
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:48,041
Is it... pounding
'cause I...? No! Hell, no!

238
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,291
That nutjob was
about to jump out

239
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,416
a second-floor
window in front of you.

240
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,375
Of course your pulse is
gonna be all screwy. Yeah...

241
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:01,250
Crazy day! Oh,
whatta scent! Black tea?

242
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,666
It's roasted tea!

243
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,000
Sounds delish! Mind
if I get in on that?

244
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,625
Of course, dear.
Have some yokan, too.

245
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,875
Aw, you're a doll!
Just what I needed!

246
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,625
It's still pounding!

247
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,083
Stupid heart, you cut
that crap out already!

248
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,375
What-the-crap?!
Emergency! Is it the yokan?!

249
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,500
Are you choking on
its squishy goodness?!

250
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,750
Drink some tea! Stat!

251
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,166
My chest. Ah man,
it's killing me...

252
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,416
She can't breathe!
Vicks VapoRub to the rescue!

253
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,916
Uh, I don't think
that's what she needs!

254
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,666
Impossible... this isn't
happening! I've been a hit with

255
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,208
the ladies since, like,
birth! She's my Waterloo?!

256
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,125
The rack is a lie!

257
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,416
Oh snap.

258
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,750
Arise, Tsukimi!

259
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,750
We've been tricked.
Oh, the humanity!

260
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,125
Huh...?

261
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,750
I ran and got Vicks
VapoRub for that wretch out of

262
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,916
the goodness of my heart,
but when I pulled down

263
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,916
her tube-top to apply
its mentholated magic...

264
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,375
They were fake! Your friend's
not really stacked at all!

265
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,541
She's just a poseur
who wears too much makeup

266
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,875
and hasn't come to terms
with her mosquito-bites!

267
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,708
Good boy. I was
afraid you wouldn't come.

268
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,625
As soon as we're
done here, I'm leaving.

269
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,750
Oolong tea, if you please.

270
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,833
Don't you want
something a little stronger?

271
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,083
No.

272
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,750
You come to a
bar and order tea?

273
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,791
You're a bit of a
tease, aren't you, Shu?

274
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,333
I won't have a drink.

275
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,250
So stop. Just say your piece.

276
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,708
There's no piece. Sorry.

277
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,416
Maybe I just wanted
to see you again.

278
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,458
Well, if you're
not going to drink...

279
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,458
How about you take
this girl for a spin?

280
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:35,208
Pick you up in
Roppongi? Of course. Huh?

281
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not taking you home?

282
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:42,833
Strange. Maybe Sugi
can enlighten me.

283
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,375
Uh, hey Sugi. You're trailing
Shu currently, aren'tcha?

284
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,625
He wants me to bring
the car down to Roppongi,

285
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,791
but he was being vague.
Thought he might be with that

286
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:02,000
mystery girl of his. If so, make
sure you get some clear photos.

287
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,708
Mr. Koibuchi won't
stop pestering me

288
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,791
to find out who she is.

289
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,833
He totally saw! A male Stylish
who makes a prettier girl

290
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,833
than I do saw me
being an absolute dork!

291
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:28,208
Good job, self! Let's wrap
this ugly, awkward body of ours

292
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,625
in some old sheets
and play "Tsukimi's magical

293
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,666
one-in-a-billion
wedding!" Yeah!

294
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,416
That's a great idea!

295
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,458
My head...

296
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,791
Mom... what the heck
is wrong with me tonight?

297
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:54,666
My heart-rate's funky and I can
hardly breathe. Man, it sucks!

298
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,750
And how come Tsukimi was
all dressed up like that, huh?

299
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,125
Wrapped up in a sheet,
with a cloth on her head.

300
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,625
A little old to
be playing princess.

301
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,583
But hey,
maybe thanks to me,

302
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,750
she's getting
interested in clothes.

303
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,500
If that's the case...

304
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,791
Wanna know
a secret, Kuranosuke?

305
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,166
Your mama has a big dream!

306
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,791
Here it is! Mama wants to pack
this closet to the gills with

307
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,375
beautiful dresses
from all over the world!

308
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:33,250
If that's the case...
I wonder... How would

309
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:38,166
Tsukimi's face look...
if I showed her Mom's closet?

310
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:52,250
Even if I ever met the right
guy and Mom were still alive...

311
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,833
and she made me a dress of

312
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,833
snow-white lace
like that jellyfish,

313
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,500
it wouldn't even look good on
me. I'd have to be all slender

314
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,958
and pale with big
eyes and long lashes...

315
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:15,541
I'd have to look...
like him, basically.

316
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,791
Aw, come on! Stop
spazzing out on me!

317
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,333
And you dropped this!

318
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,041
I don't want that old
thing. Jus' throw it away!

319
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,833
Hey, it's nothing to
be embarrassed about!

320
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,916
Every girl plays
"one-woman fashion show"

321
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,208
now and then,
right? No worries!

322
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,250
Well, I wasn't having
a fashion show, okay?!

323
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,083
My mom told me
something a long time ago

324
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,750
and I was testing a hypothesis.
It's perfectly rational!

325
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,750
What'd she say?

326
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,625
Back when my mom
was still alive...

327
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,750
she promised to make me
a dress like a jellyfish!

328
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,708
I hadn't thought
about it in a while,

329
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,625
but making all those
dolls this afternoon...

330
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,916
I... I remembered, and...

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,291
Tsukimi...

332
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,416
I know it's stupid.
Please don't tell the others!

333
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,666
Tsukimi! Let's make one!

334
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,125
Let's make one! You and me!

335
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,333
We'll mass-produce 'em!
Sell 'em by the truckload!

336
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,666
We'll be filthy rich, thanks
to your jellyfish dress!

337
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,458
Uh, hold on. Wha...
whaddya mean, we're going to

338
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,833
make the dress?

339
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,500
We'll take all the money
we earn and buy this place!
