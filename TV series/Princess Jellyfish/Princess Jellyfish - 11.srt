1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:10,708
Tell ya what, Tsukimi.

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,875
When you grow
up and get married.

3
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:17,291
I'll make you a dress
just like these jellyfish.

4
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,625
A fluttery dress
fit for a princess.

5
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,250
Beautiful...

6
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:11,500
Beautiful... You're
like... You're like...

7
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,500
the Princess
of the Jellyfish!

8
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,916
Just of the jellyfish?!

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,166
Yes! Yes! Now let's
do a Purple Jelly!

10
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,166
What? Another already?

11
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,541
Why don't we take
a break? For tea...

12
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,291
Also, is your father here?

13
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,750
Tsukimi... You've had
a complete awakening,

14
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,000
haven't you, girl?!

15
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,333
Huh?

16
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,458
I knew I wasn't mistaken
about you! Yes, make more!

17
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,500
More jellyfish dresses!
As many as you want!

18
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,000
Perfect! Baby Purple Jellies are
the same pinkish-mauve color!

19
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,833
Oh! Yeah, my mother
gave me that dress.

20
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,791
Do you mind?

21
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,208
Wha--? Oh, uhm... Go ahead.

22
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,000
Wow! Thank you so much!

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,166
Wait, you're gonna...
Right here?

24
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,833
Oh, yes. That's right.

25
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,375
I thought... you
wanted to wear it!

26
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,541
♪Oh, Purple Jelly! Oh, Purple
Jelly, you're pink when♪

27
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,791
♪you're a baby, yeah!
Oh, Purple...♪

28
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,916
We should go.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
Agreed.

30
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,958
♪...when you go stingy-stingy!♪

31
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,458
♪Oh, Purple Jelly!
Yeah, Purple...♪

32
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,458
Do you think we might be
allowed to visit again sometime?

33
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,958
'Cause hanging on
the wall in there,

34
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,625
I saw a photo of the
late Ichiro Koibuchi.

35
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,416
He completely
would've been my type,

36
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,333
so I'd really love to
meet Kurako's father as well.

37
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,166
Perhaps we can drop in tomorrow.
In a home that spacious,

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,166
there must be a
Taisho-style room that's

39
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,791
just perfect for
Midoriko and Umeko.

40
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,083
It won't come off!

41
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,666
Amamizu-kan...

42
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,500
Umeko! Matsuko!
Yoshibo! O-Take!

43
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,375
Tah-keo!

44
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,291
'Kay, listen, So I realize
I'm the one who dragged you

45
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,041
into all this fashion stuff,
so I can live with you

46
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,333
hackin' up my mom's dress to

47
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,708
make your own
jellyfish dress, but...

48
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,541
She totally just ignored
me! I can't believe her.

49
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,708
She's usually so timid.
In her fully awakened mode,

50
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,625
Tsukimi is fierce!

51
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,041
Now that she's
realized her potential,

52
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,666
Tsukimi can keep making
more and more dresses.

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,166
Allowing me to focus
on the brand strategy.

54
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,708
I can see it all now.

55
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,166
We'll open our first store
on Fifth Avenue in New York!

56
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,083
We'll have a second store
on Rue Santo Noree in Paree.

57
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,708
And we'll launch our first
wholly-owned Japanese outlet

58
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,458
in Ginza! We're
gonna make it after--

59
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,916
Hang on. You went home.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,083
We have no home!
Amamizu-kan, it's...

61
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,208
Huh?

62
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:51,583
The castle falls! The
mighty Guan Yu is no more!

63
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,083
This... can't... be...

64
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,291
Whoa, now... Chieko!
You call your mom?

65
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,625
I keep trying but
she won't pick up!

66
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,083
O-ho! Chieko's honorable
mother has been deceived!

67
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:07,208
Curse you, Dong Zhuo! You
shall pay with your liiiife!

68
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,583
Yep, this is the place!

69
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,541
Let's make it quick.

70
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,583
Hold on there!
Isn't it a little bit...

71
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,583
early for all this noise?

72
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,833
We humble ourselves
as before Zhuge Liang!

73
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,541
Please, grant us more time!

74
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,541
We can have all our
stuff out in ten minutes!

75
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,375
My O-Gauge model train is
heavy, I'll need a bit longer.

76
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,708
Please, sirs! My babies
are still inside there!

77
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,833
Before you demolish
it, at least let me--

78
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,958
Demolish it? No,
y'got it all wrong!

79
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,125
Huh?

80
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,458
What?

81
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,125
Actually, the one who
got it all wrong, was him.

82
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,333
Well I couldn't find the
right address. But then...

83
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:50,041
Uhh... that place,
huh? In't that it?

84
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,000
We'll get the tarps off
and have your lives back to

85
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,000
normal straight away.
Sorry for the trouble.

86
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,916
Apparently, the place
is completely vacant now.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,291
Word has it all the residents
have packed up and moved.

88
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,250
This is...

89
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,875
This is a really good
shot. Nice work, Sugster.

90
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,250
Always been a
bit of a shutterbug.

91
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,833
Please accept this as
a small token of our apology.

92
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,708
Oh, my! How thoughtful!

93
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,791
It must really
be tough though.

94
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,875
What with all
the redevelopment plans.

95
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,208
What?

96
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,500
S'pose this one's coming
down too, sooner or later.

97
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,208
So Shu-jo has fallen as well.

98
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,458
Diggers are cool, too.

99
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,875
That gentleman from the
construction company was

100
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,916
kind of a hunk,
don't you think?

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,250
They brought us
cookies from Ginza WEST!

102
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,125
Let's have some tea, girls!

103
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,500
Go WEST!

104
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,791
Is it the leaf pies?

105
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,208
I hope there's some
almond tarts in there!

106
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,458
Go, go WEST!

107
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,291
Discuss what? Hello, Mother?

108
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:12,666
Mother, hello! Are you
still there?! I lost her.

109
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,416
What'd she wanna say?

110
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,541
She said she had
something important to

111
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,791
discuss about Amamizu-kan.

112
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,375
This is all taking a
dreadful turn for the worse.

113
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,333
Shall we be
forced to surrender?!

114
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,291
Guess our only choice now
is to become live-in workers at

115
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:31,500
a gourmet food store.
Just like in The Facts of Life.

116
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:40,375
Ms. Inari. I think others
in the office like coffee too.

117
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,625
What am I thinking?
Yeeaaa-ha-haaa!

118
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,416
What's the matter with you?
Did something happen?

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,666
"Happen?"

120
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,875
You've been really
pushing yourself lately.

121
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,166
Maybe you'd feel better
if you took some time off.

122
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,666
Shu should be getting back
with the car anytime now.

123
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,458
Guess I'll
take this over there.

124
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,291
Kuranosuke!

125
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,958
Kuranosuke, hey!
Kuranosuke!

126
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,625
The... Th-The Burmese Harp?

127
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,208
Mizushimaaa! Let's go
back to Japan together!

128
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,375
No! Wait!

129
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,625
They're gonna tear
it down! Amamizu-kan!

130
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,166
What? I thought
that was just a mix-up.

131
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,500
You have
perfect timing, though.

132
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,875
We still need to
finish the dress--

133
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,250
They're gonna
tear it to pieces!

134
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,500
We have to make... jellyfish
dolls... Lots of them.

135
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,791
And quick! And then we
have to buy Amamizu-kan!

136
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,166
Let's see, the train
goes through the tunnel,

137
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,958
turns around at
the depot, and then back

138
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,000
through the tunnel
to the station.

139
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,416
A hole in my
precious finger!

140
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,916
I offered you a thimble.

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,541
We'll shoot for twenty
dolls a person per day.

142
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,458
A hundred a day.
One thousand in ten days!

143
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,000
Can we do it?

144
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,875
We have no choice. Honestly,
this is really all we can do.

145
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,166
I can't do it!

146
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,500
You just started!

147
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,750
My right hand
refuses to do as I say!

148
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,250
Oh why have you failed me?!

149
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,333
Sounds like you
just lost interest to me.

150
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,583
Agreed. You haven't
even finished one yet!

151
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,208
We need a miracle.

152
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,041
Wait! Yes! That might work!

153
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,958
Ho! Stylish magazines!
Legend has it touching these

154
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,416
will make you
trendy in an instant!

155
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,458
Got any Railway Journal here?

156
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,958
Look for every audition
and model wanted ad here.

157
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,000
We'll apply for all of
'em. Here, take some pictures.

158
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,583
Motion blur!

159
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,000
We're gonna force people
in the fashion industry to

160
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,041
see Tsukimi's dresses.
I know someone'll love 'em.

161
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,625
Once they bite,
we're in business!

162
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,750
What... the
jellyfish dresses?

163
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,708
How's that gonna
make us money?

164
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,083
Clothing costs
five thousand yen tops.

165
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,541
In fact, these fine
threads only set me back

166
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,375
a cool fourteen-eighty!
Are you shocked?!

167
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,875
Fancy clothes go for much
higher! Hundreds of thousands,

168
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,375
or more! I'm talkin'
'bout name-brand.

169
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,583
Name-brand?

170
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,833
Oh, you mean
like that Louie CK?

171
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,083
Louis Vuitton.

172
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,958
No way, you can't
be serious... My dresses?

173
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,333
Oh, yes! If I'm
right, your stuff will

174
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,666
catch a professional's
attention.

175
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,458
So you need to make
dresses, Tsukimi. Lots of 'em!

176
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,583
Hi-iiii!

177
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,708
Ah, Sara, love!
Looking simply fabulous!

178
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:30,083
You're a modern-day Muse!
Still hangin' in Yokohama?

179
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,708
Of course!
Basha-michi, Chinatown,

180
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,208
it's the next hot spot!

181
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,125
Just don't make
too much spectacle.

182
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,208
You are our top
model, after all.

183
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,458
Are those applications
for the contest?

184
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:44,458
Yep. Whole boatload
came in! Wanna look-see?

185
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,875
Okay.

186
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,583
Afro!

187
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,583
Commercial Message!

188
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,750
Clara!

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,375
Aaand we're back!

190
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,541
Tequila!

191
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:08,791
Me? An unrequited crush?
How many years has it been?

192
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,041
No, I've got to put
him out of my mind.

193
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,583
Oh boy, that was
scary. I thought it was

194
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,000
payback time for sure.

195
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,250
Shu-Shu, it is you!

196
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,666
Prime Minister.

197
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,291
Oh, it's just us, you can
call me... Uncle Negi-poo!

198
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,791
I'd rather not.

199
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,250
Everybody stopped talking
to me once my approval rating

200
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:49,333
fell below 5%. So I figured
I'd go have some "me" time.

201
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,458
Ooohh! I got an extra ticket!

202
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,333
Come with, Shu-Shu.

203
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,416
What? But, I'm...
supposed to...

204
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,458
So. Many. Stylish.

205
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,625
Strength, Jiji...
This is for Amamizu-kan.

206
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,833
But these clothes
and this place...

207
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,541
I can't adapt! Not to this!

208
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:20,625
Oh yes! You three look
adorable! Modern-day Muses!

209
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,625
No more!

210
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,791
Afro?

211
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,375
Afro?

212
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,000
I fear change!

213
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:31,208
Afro! Afro! Over here!

214
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,166
So we good to go?

215
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,916
Yes. But um... are you...
really sure about this?

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,458
What?

217
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,375
It's just, this is my very first
time making clothing at all.

218
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,625
And everyone else here looks
so much more put together.

219
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,916
And plus...

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,791
You're still talking
like that? You'll be fine.

221
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,500
Just trust me on this.

222
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,833
Kura! Hi, hon!

223
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,791
Oh my! A princess!
A modern-day Muse you are!

224
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:01,916
Thank you.

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,333
Hey, girls!

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,791
Oh, how beautiful! You're
a modern-day Muse, I swear!

227
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,416
Whoa! Is this a new dress?

228
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,541
Huh?

229
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,708
Sorry, we haven't
been introduced.

230
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,291
Oh! This is Tsukimi,
the girl I told you about.

231
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,958
She designed these dresses.

232
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,416
They're the first pieces in
a new brand we just launched.

233
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,208
A brand?! But I've
only made two so far!

234
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,541
C'mon, we gotta
start workin' it here!

235
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,541
Yeah but...

236
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,291
Your dress is
totally fabulous!

237
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,500
Isn't it?

238
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,500
Wha--? Hey... Who's
that?! She's way cute!

239
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,583
Whoa, I wish my
dress was like that.

240
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,333
Next up, entry Number 12...

241
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:49,125
from Miya-zaki Pre-fecture...
Kurumi Ebihara!

242
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,666
And now, entry Number 13...

243
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,875
from Kana-gawa...

244
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,708
When's Kurako coming out?

245
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,666
Better not be piggin' out
at the Craft Services table...

246
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,166
Mom. I am so nervous
I think my heart

247
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,333
might jump right
out of my mouth.

248
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:08,541
But, for some reason,
I don't feel the urge to run.

249
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,083
Even though
I'm sure my old self

250
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,208
would have been
out the door by now.

251
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,041
Could it be because of him?

252
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,625
Let's make one! You and me!

253
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,916
Next, entry Number 35...

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,125
from Tokyo... Kurako Amamizu!

255
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,625
Amamizu?

256
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,875
That wretch took the Nunnery's
name without even asking!

257
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,750
Well, Mom...

258
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,541
I...

259
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,458
Lookin' to buy some nice
vacation property there.

260
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,083
You can run the numbers.

261
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,333
Of course, Uncle.

262
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,625
Groovy!

263
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:57,208
He loves me... Loves me
not... Loves me... He lov--

264
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,125
Another one! Make sure it's
got lotsa petals this time!

265
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,166
Right... right away, ma'am!

266
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,791
Would you please
give me my glasses back.

267
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:14,750
Chieko! The pink dress.
The other one Tsukimi made!

268
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,750
Got it.

269
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,833
Good, take it
and put it on her.

270
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,458
Pu-Put it on?!
I can't do that!

271
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,125
My ancestors would
be ashamed of me,

272
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,625
wearing a naked-shoulder
garment like that!

273
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,041
It's called "strapless."

274
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,208
I would slit my belly
and perish this instant

275
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,791
rather than wear it.
Chieko, be my Second!

276
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,458
All right, but at least
try the darn thing on

277
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,583
before resorting to seppuku.

278
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,875
Why do I have
to wear it anyway?!

279
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,625
We're first by a
landslide in every category!

280
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,416
The winning designer
can't just sneak out the back!

281
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Hey Jiji, I'll hold her
down, you put it on her.

282
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,416
Right.

283
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,791
Noooooo!

284
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,875
Dangit! The zipper...
won't close!

285
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,291
No, are you serious?!

286
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,416
Plus, her upper arms're...
a bit on the flabby side.

287
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,916
Just kill me.
Please, kill me now!

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,750
Don't worry. I'll
sew you a quick stole.

289
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,875
Ah! Look, we have fur!

290
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,000
How will you fasten
it? Safety pins?

291
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,416
Good question.

292
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,250
So uh... Where are we?

293
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,125
All right. Wait right here.

294
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:26,291
Wait for what? Um,
what the heck is going on?

295
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, I forgot all
about the brand's name.

296
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,083
What?

297
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,250
Think fast... Oh boy,
what do we do?

298
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,125
Finally, let's bring
out the winners of

299
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,708
the top score
in all categories.

300
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:41,083
Kurako Amamizu and her
designer, Tsukimi Kurash-ta.

301
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:41,875
Huh?

302
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,375
Come on out!

303
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,791
Here we go.

304
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,625
Is... is that... a jellyfish?

305
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,083
Hey, Tsukimi...

306
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,333
Yeah?

307
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,125
Y'know when they grow
up, all little girls...

308
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,375
can blossom into
beautiful princesses.

309
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,583
Princesses!

310
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,625
Let's go to our
lovely presenter, Sara!

311
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,041
Congrats, can you tell
us all the brand's name?

312
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,041
It's... uh... Hey...

313
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,916
We need to come up with
a brand name. Help me out!

314
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,583
Huh? Oh, a brand name?

315
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,500
I'm not really sure.
Jellyfish, I guess?

316
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,916
What she said!

317
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,083
Who dares plunder
my tasty beef?!

318
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,125
Sorry Sister,
you snooze, you lose.

319
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,875
I am not snoozing at all!

320
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,458
I simply prefer my
meat to be cooked well-done!

321
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,875
Oh look, this is ready.

322
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,291
Tsukimi, you haven't eaten
at all. This is Matsusaka.

323
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,916
I'm sorry. I'm
not very hungry.

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,333
Something the matter?

325
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,708
Yes... a little while ago...

326
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,333
I had a... Heh...
a near-death experience!

327
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,125
First I was climbing up
a long staircase in the dark,

328
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,750
then suddenly a door opened.

329
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,250
And I was surrounded
by a bright light...

330
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,041
Tell me. Am I dead?

331
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,000
They don't have
yakiniku in heaven.

332
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,250
Ms. May-Jiro asked if
she could have seconds.

333
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,583
Oh... That's
fine, I'll get it.

334
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,833
So Mom, according
to everyone else,

335
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:33,708
I got up on the stage and
was introduced as a designer.

336
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,958
But all I remember is...
Kuranosuke leaning over

337
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,375
and asking me
about a brand name...

338
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,083
and the feeling of my
hand being held tight.

339
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,375
Guess I could hire a pro to
come up with something better

340
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,625
but I don't wanna
spend a ton of money.

341
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,916
Allow me to figure it out!

342
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,375
Completion! Everyone, shout
a huzzah of triumph! Boom.

343
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,958
We're selling clothing here!

344
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,333
This is it for sure.

345
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,166
Again, clothing, not trains!

346
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,708
How about this, then?

347
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,500
That just looks
like a café sign!

348
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,708
Well, combining everyone's
opinions... Here you go.

349
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,250
That doesn't have
anyone else's opinion in it!

350
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,458
I need you to
take this seriously.

351
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,250
We're aiming for
Paris Fashion Week!

352
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,000
Did you say "almond parfait?"

353
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,750
What are you talking about?

354
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,500
You know, like at that
fancy café you took us to.

355
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,875
Ah, criminy. Like
talkin' to a brick wall.

356
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,208
Tsukimi?

357
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,791
Oh, here you are.

358
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,750
Ugh, this wig
stinks like meat!

359
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,500
Ah, jeez... Get
used to it already!

360
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,916
I'm fine if I don't
look directly at you.

361
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,541
Come on. You gotta learn to
look at me when I'm not in drag.

362
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,875
After all you and I
share a common destiny now.

363
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,375
What the heck am I saying?!
And why am I blushing?!

364
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,458
So um, can I
ask you something?

365
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,750
Uh... Yeah? What is it?

366
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,208
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

367
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,333
It will. It'll be great.

368
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,708
Mother...

369
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,875
Two Chiekos?

370
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,125
They're twins?

371
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,083
No! She is Chieko's
honorable mother!

372
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,875
My phone got crushed at
an event with my dear Yon-Yon.

373
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:39,458
So you said um... you
needed to talk to me about...

374
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,041
Amamizu-kan?

375
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,458
Yes, about that, girls.

376
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,750
Give us a little time!

377
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,750
Please, Mother! Reconsider!

378
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,708
Oh? You think I
should sell it then?

379
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,041
Huh?

380
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,500
Yon-Yon decided to work
out of Japan for a while,

381
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,541
so I came to tell
you I don't need to

382
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,375
sell the building anymore!

383
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank goodness.

384
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,833
But if you think I should
go ahead and sell, I will!

385
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:03,583
Wait--!

386
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,000
Halt!

387
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,250
Well, Mom. It's been six
months already since I moved to

388
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,041
Tokyo to try and
make it as an illustrator.

389
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,250
Here, in this sprawling
spectacle of a metropolis,

390
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,958
there are lots of surprises.

391
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,958
It's been one
right after another.

392
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,583
I think this city's
made of mystery.

393
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,625
So I have no doubt
there's plenty more

394
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,875
adventures just
around the corner!

395
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,166
You know it!
