1
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,166
I have this secret
hiding in my closet.

2
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:02,000
Mama, this house is
amazing. It's super gigantic!

3
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,375
That's right, Kuranosuke.
If you get good grades,

4
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,791
I bet Papa will get
you whatever you want.

5
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,791
Really? Do you think
he'd buy me clothes?

6
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,291
Of course he will.
He's got plenty of money.

7
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,000
Dude, what's up with your lame-o
glasses? One, they're huge.

8
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,541
Two, they're...
nah one was enough.

9
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,541
I must have
lost mine somewhere.

10
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,166
I'm getting a new pair now.

11
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,625
Well, crap.

12
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,666
I can't just...
up and ask him...

13
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,083
"Hey Bro, so you're still a
virgin at 30. Is that 'cause you

14
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,916
got your brain fried seeing
your dad and my mom making out

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,458
like a couple horny
teenagers in the wardrobe room

16
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,291
backstage at some
theater or whatever?"

17
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,875
Man... that's too
bold even for me.

18
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,458
What? You're
telling me you haven't

19
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,833
fixed the
Amamizu-kan deal yet?

20
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,166
Why the hell is Acquisitions
taking so long on this?

21
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,166
That place is a beast. We
need to tear it down first.

22
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,958
Uh, well, they did get a
verbal agreement from them.

23
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,333
It's just... the owner's
been traveling overseas,

24
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,541
so scheduling a time for closing
has been a little tricky.

25
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,083
They think it could
come together by next month.

26
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:46,333
What? Why next month? It's
too late. This is me leaving.

27
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,500
I've got work in the
neighborhood anyway.

28
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,333
I have to return a little
something to my boyfriend.

29
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,416
Nice to see you
all again. Remember me

30
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,166
from Global City Create?

31
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,916
That "woosh" noise.
Uh, was that them?

32
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,541
Hi! Clara's here to help! The
Banba Scope can analyze any bag.

33
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,041
And based on its logo,
size and relative weight,

34
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,708
can determine its
most likely contents.

35
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,333
Doesn't even matter what's
inside! It could be meat,

36
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,125
desserts, squid, sea
urchin, or any number of

37
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,250
high-purine seafood.
Banba has an uncanny

38
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,083
and intuitive
knowledge of that as well.

39
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,833
It really is quite remarkable.

40
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,750
'Kay listen up, that vixen's
totally got snacks in the bag.

41
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,208
Really? Ah, I bet it's
only plain rice crackers.

42
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,833
I don't think so... Judging from
the logo design and bag size,

43
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,625
I'm thinking it's
from a bakery. A good one.

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,541
I'm bettin' macarons.

45
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,458
Muh! macarons?

46
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,041
Hello, I am the
manager of this building.

47
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,083
Please tell me what
I can do for you today?

48
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,875
You have to be the owner's
daughter! I'm sorry to show up

49
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,666
unannounced like this...
I was in the neighborhood so

50
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,541
I thought I'd
come say "hello."

51
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,375
The vixen attacks!

52
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,916
Mayaya! Why on earth are you
coming in through the window?

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,750
You do realize I'm on
the second floor, don't you?

54
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,666
But... the Vixen!

55
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,625
The Vixen's here?

56
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,416
Oh yeah, she's here!
Invading our sacred land!

57
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,666
She's come from the
depths of Hell, oh yeah!

58
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,750
Come to take our
souls, good lord!

59
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,250
And to buy our home, oh no!

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,416
Depths of Hell I
say, depths of Hell!

61
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,666
Yay! We got macarons!

62
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,958
Macarons?!

63
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,708
Why was she here?

64
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,333
They're from that
place Yakkun was

65
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,416
raving about
on Hanamaru Market.

66
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,916
What the heck? She
left some glasses in here.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,833
I wonder whose they are...

68
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:21,416
Sorry. Silly me. It seems I
accidentally left something

69
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,125
in that bag I dropped off.

70
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:28,708
Oh my... What a curious
room... So... unique.

71
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,833
Stay out!

72
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:37,541
Oh great. You found them... I'll
just get out of your way then.

73
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,916
One more thing...

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,583
Minister Koibuchi's
residence is nearby, isn't it?

75
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,916
Yeah, it's about...
10 or 15 minutes on foot.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,250
You some kind of spy?

77
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,333
Not at all, I'm just going
to return something that

78
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,333
got left behind. Now,
if you'll excuse me.

79
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,375
Well... please be sure to
drop me a line, as soon as

80
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,833
your mother comes home.
It won't take long to

81
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,083
explain the contract to her.

82
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,458
Okay! I'm really
going this time.

83
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,833
Who're you?

84
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,875
Do you live here young lady?

85
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,458
You bet your butt I do.

86
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,750
No he doesn't!

87
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,708
Well in that case,
here's my card. Feel free to

88
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,750
contact me if you have any--

89
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,750
I shoulda known! What's wrong?

90
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,791
Why aren't you all
dressed in your battle gear?

91
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,750
Because... they didn't
warn us... before they came.

92
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,625
Figures...
Hey! You landsharks.

93
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,166
I'm gonna talk real
loud so you'll understand.

94
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
Nobody here has any
intention of leaving.

95
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,166
So you might as well go
tell your bosses you can't get

96
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,500
Amamizu-kan to sell, 'cause
it's just too Tom Cruise!

97
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,041
Mission Impossible!

98
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:48,083
Huh? Izzat so? I thought the
building owner got to decide.

99
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,416
Owner... Yeah, I guess
you're right. Then we'll just

100
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,416
make sure this place gets
bought before you tear it down.

101
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,708
Sorry... I don't
follow your logic.

102
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,666
Maybe we'll decide to buy it.

103
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,875
Right, that's funny!
Good luck with that.

104
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,708
Do you have any idea
how much this place costs?

105
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,416
I don't care. A hundred
million? A billion?

106
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,625
Nothing's going to stop us.
No matter how much it costs...

107
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,083
We'll buy it.

108
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,291
Mayaya, throw some salt.

109
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,541
On it!

110
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,250
Woo! Salt assault!
Be gone you evil spirits.

111
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,291
It's working!
Keep throwing. Go home!

112
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,458
Next time bring your
cute older boss man with you.

113
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,625
No... Wait!

114
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,083
Atta girls! Defend that door!

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,125
Problem solved!
That wasn't so hard!

116
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,583
Yeah, um... How's it solved?

117
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,708
Ah no worries, seriously!
My family is totally super rich.

118
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,083
Plus I've got
some dirt on my dad.

119
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,333
Please stop
saying things you have

120
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,333
no intention of
following through on.

121
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,750
What do you mean? Chieko
is just going to walk right up

122
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,541
to her mother when
she gets back and say,

123
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,166
"Yo Mom, I wanna
buy your building."

124
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,416
What? Ridiculous. She'd
kill me just for saying "yo."

125
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,541
Hey, um...? Can we...
go talk somewhere?

126
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,583
This is different. It's
not every day you invite me out

127
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,916
to a park. What is
going on with you, Tsukimi?

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,375
Nothing. I just
wanted... to talk.

129
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,458
So, that woman who just
came by... is she? Your buh--?

130
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,375
Boogieman?

131
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:30,291
No... is she your big brother's,
I dunno... girlfriend?

132
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,541
N-Not that I care either way...

133
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:37,291
Wait a minute. You think
my brother has a girlfriend?

134
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:41,416
Yes... I'm sure... She was
returning his glasses to him...

135
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,416
like he'd left them
at her house or something.

136
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,750
Glasses, huh? Wait
when he came home yesterday

137
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,583
he wasn't wearing them...

138
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,375
And this morning when
I saw him he had on his

139
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,250
old institutionally
huge 90's pair.

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,458
Please, do not tell
me... they're "doing it?!"

141
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,666
Hey... are you okay?

142
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,375
I walked right past
them. The two of them...

143
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,125
they were
definitely together.

144
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:20,791
Tsukimi... What are
you crying for? Why--?

145
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:38,875
You smell nice... Is that
a new perfume you're wearing?

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,500
So um... Technically I
am still a guy, you know.

147
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,625
Oh yeah...
I guess you are, huh?

148
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,750
Ahah! Lesbians!

149
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,250
Buzz off, y'snotheads.

150
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,625
I'm gonna go wash my face.

151
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,583
Commercial Message!

152
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,916
Clara.

153
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:13,958
Now the other part.

154
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,041
Tequila.

155
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,875
Really? Three figure balances!

156
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,166
No! Mine has only
two figures this month!

157
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,291
Why are you so broke?

158
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,333
I shouldn't have yelled. Not
like I expected you guys to have

159
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,541
much in the way
of savings anyway...

160
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,000
Money, money,
money, whatever...

161
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,916
What's your damage,
Scrooge McChick?

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,583
It's like I keep telling you,
we've got to buy this place.

163
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,041
Hey! What's so funny?

164
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,333
Oh, just let it go. That
joke was never funny anyway...

165
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,875
A true Katsura Comedy
master would know that.

166
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,375
This is not a joke! I'm
dead serious.

167
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,875
If we put our minds
to it, we can make

168
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,375
all the money we need.

169
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,333
Look at all the talent here.

170
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:06,541
Am I right, Mom? He's
completely nuts, isn't he?

171
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,666
I have no idea where
he comes up with this stuff.

172
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,375
Oh! Maybe he's an alien...

173
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,333
But then, rich people
all seem like aliens to me...

174
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,208
Still somehow we
all keep getting swept up

175
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,166
in his wacky hijinks. When
he's around, it's hard not to

176
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,208
feel excited about
what the day may bring.

177
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:31,375
So... I would just like to
say that girl was smokin' hot.

178
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,458
You listen here!
She was just fooling you

179
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,333
with her makeup, moron!

180
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,333
If you scrubbed her face
clean, you'd see there was

181
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,500
nothing underneath there
at all! Her lashes were those

182
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,333
fake Hollywood Legends
ones everyone thinks

183
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,125
are hot right now.
Betty Davis?

184
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,875
There's other
styles, but who cares?

185
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,916
It's how you wear them that
counts! Now agree with me

186
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,958
before I find another
way to make you suffer!

187
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,291
Yes... Right as always but

188
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,208
she still had a
body that wouldn't quit.

189
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,583
Gag me, ugh! It figures
you'd like a skinny broomstick

190
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,166
like her you friggin' idjit.

191
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,833
Do you not realize nobody that
skinny has boobs like those?!

192
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:08,208
Fat deposits do not work that
way. They do not, not, not, not!

193
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,458
Sorry I'm not some twig
with a ridiculous boob job

194
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,541
that makes my breasts defy
gravity and sparkle like candy!

195
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,958
You're making a scene.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,708
Are you crazy. Stop it.
We'll get arrested.

197
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,750
Enough with the whining! I'll
wreck all the rundown buildings

198
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,083
in this neighborhood,
and then, I'll drop a giant,

199
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,625
soul crushing
hotel on their ruins!

200
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,958
Perhaps we should
use our inside voice.

201
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,125
Creepy... What is this room?

202
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,166
Some bizarre "Doll Graveyard?"

203
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,083
How dare you say that?!
I graciously open up a

204
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,291
precious corner of my life
to you and you poop in it!

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,416
These give me the willies. Which
one's hair grows 'cause it's

206
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,125
possessed by a little girl?

207
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,583
This one's the
worst. Let's sell it.

208
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,958
Sakurako!

209
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,958
Now, say that
again, I dare you!

210
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,666
Whoa... Torpedo...

211
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,000
I double dare you!

212
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,583
No... Listen! I'm saying
you should sell these to

213
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,958
put towards our
Amamizu-kan Purchase Fund.

214
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,791
You wanna just sell 'em
off them as if they're some

215
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,208
cheap trinkets that
have no meaning to me?

216
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,250
They're only dolls, Chieko!

217
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,958
No, they're alive! Each
and every one is my living,

218
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,166
breathing child,
don't you see?

219
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,041
Sakurako, Midoriko...

220
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,500
Tell me, what did
Sakurako set you back?

221
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,791
200 grand.

222
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:38,958
O Chiyo! Matsuko! O Take!
Bondo! Umeko! Kawako! Reiko!

223
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,083
Do not become that person.

224
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,916
Maybe you don't get it,
but to Chieko... these dolls

225
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,666
might as well be her
family. She can't lose them.

226
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,666
Like that guy who
married his anime pillow!

227
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,916
Shut up.

228
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,458
I suggest you get out
of this room right now.

229
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,375
Okay here's your-- Whoa!
Naked man! Naked man!

230
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,583
Would you just get
used to it already?

231
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,166
Please put some clothes on!

232
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,541
Ah, I would but my
shoulders are all stiff.

233
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,583
What's with you? If my memory
serves, you had no problem

234
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,750
hanging all
over me in the park.

235
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:38,333
I did not! Not all over.

236
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,875
Got a tea leaf on ya.

237
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,083
A decree! You! Miss Stylish,
girl! Please tell me that you

238
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,666
have a fax machine
at your mansion and

239
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,791
then tell me you'll
let us use it right now.

240
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,041
Okay, home sweet home.

241
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm sorry for
making you drive me.

242
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,708
It was such a silly little
errand. You're a patient man.

243
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,875
It's... kinda my job.
Though,  I'm not sure

244
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,166
you needed to rush
out for new ones.

245
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,625
Look.

246
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,083
I had business in
the neighborhood anyway.

247
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:34,041
I'm glad I was able to bump
into you. Though it seems

248
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,750
I'm a little late by the looks
of those cute new specs I see.

249
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,250
Heave-ho. Heave-ho.
Heave-ho. Heave-ho...

250
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,750
But you look so very
serious. What's troubling you?

251
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:49,458
Trust me... It'll be just
between us. I won't tell a soul.

252
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,291
Actually, I would
like to ask you a question.

253
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,041
Go ahead.

254
00:16:54,125 --> 00:17:00,500
That night... Did we have...
um, s-suh... suh...

255
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,375
Sexual relations?

256
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:09,333
I apologize, my memory is
hazy, I was quite inebriated.

257
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,916
But I don't recall
anything actually happening.

258
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,875
And more to the point... I
don't believe I'm the kind of

259
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,208
person who could
do that, so you see...

260
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,708
Here. All the proof
you need that we made love.

261
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,416
Oh god... Oh god... I almost
just mouth-faced a girl who's

262
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,708
practically a character straight
out of a Shigeru Mizuki manga!

263
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,750
What the heck's
come over me?!

264
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,750
How do you do it?
How can you just sit there

265
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,166
calmly drinking tea
like nothing happened?

266
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,250
You're messed up!

267
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,208
What are you talking about?

268
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,208
So now you're saying you
don't even know what I did

269
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,666
'cause you had your
eyes closed? I'm an idiot!

270
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,083
No, you can't hold
the manuscript like that,

271
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,166
or you'll crease it.
Those're worth 20,000 yen

272
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,791
per page, for
cryin' out loud!

273
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,291
You have to be
careful with it.

274
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,458
Really? This stuff
makes that much?

275
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:22,458
So... times how
many hundred pages?

276
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,958
We humbly request your decree.

277
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,541
You'd think we
could text or email her.

278
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,416
Who writes notes on
paper anymore? Not this boy.

279
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,583
Sh... If she finds out
you're male you'll be killed

280
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,541
in a slow and cruel manner.

281
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,750
Sweet! We've got our
down payment. So, now...

282
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,375
My hearing must be going...
What did you say?

283
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,916
You heard me. I'm going
to buy an apartment building

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,583
and I need a loan.

285
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,833
Yeah? How much?

286
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,333
I don't know exactly...
Guess about 300 million?

287
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,125
I've got an early morning.
I think I'll turn in.

288
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,250
Hanamori told me you know...

289
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,166
the reason why Shu
can't handle women.

290
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,916
And you think that you
can blackmail me with that?

291
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,291
Yeah... Whenever you
went to see Mom's shows

292
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,458
you guys would totally
do it right in front of Shu.

293
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,416
I can see why he'd
be so traumatized.

294
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,250
Kuranosuke, I only
have one thing to say.

295
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:44,875
The one time that did happen...
I barely made it to second base.

296
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,541
Watchin' your pops
get to second base with

297
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,000
someone who's not your mom...
That'd mess with a kid's head...

298
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,250
But as blackmail
it's a little weak.

299
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,041
I know...

300
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,208
Hey... Still no touching.

301
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,125
What's up with this look?
Awful conservative for you.

302
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,875
Got an exam today.

303
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,250
Figure cross-dressing
might be a bad idea.

304
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,625
Good call.

305
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,916
Hey dude, this Benz
you're always making sweet,

306
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,916
sweet love to with a
shammy... how much is it worth?

307
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,833
Mercedes Benz S-Class. Base
price: Fifteen million yen.

308
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,708
Whoa, that's
more than I thought.

309
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,833
How many Benzes
do we have again?

310
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,375
Only three.

311
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,625
Only?

312
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,291
Look, it's Kuranosuke!

313
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,666
How come you never
hang out with us anymore?

314
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,250
Yeah sorry, ladies. I've
just been really busy lately.

315
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,166
What about today? Aren't you
free? Let's go out someplace.

316
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:41,958
Yeah, c'mon!

317
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,208
What is today?

318
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,666
Yeah, we miss you!

319
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,291
What? A flea market?

320
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,041
No arguing. I've
already reserved us a stall.

321
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,666
It's in Harajuku.

322
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,916
Spring cleaning time!

323
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,458
I'm going to completely
clean out your storage.

324
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:05,041
Stop! You can't!
Mother will be angry!

325
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,541
Whoa there! Why don'tcha
sell off the seemingly

326
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,458
endless supply of fancy
clothes you're always wearing?!

327
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,708
Over my dead body.
