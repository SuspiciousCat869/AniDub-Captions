1
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,625
Tsukimi!

2
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,250
Let's make one! You and me!

3
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:46,166
We'll take all the money
we earn... and buy this place!

4
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,458
Come again? Take you back
home as quickly as possible?

5
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,125
Sure, but what's the hurry?

6
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,833
I don't know what put the
idea into my father's head...

7
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,083
but I need to make sure
that he understands...

8
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,458
there's nothing between us.

9
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,458
Think I'll tag along.

10
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,458
Out of the question.

11
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,625
Uh, try again!

12
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,041
Wow! I've never
been chauffeured before!

13
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,250
Sugi m'man... You
dropped the ball big-time.

14
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:20,125
Yo, Clara here! This is ironic,
'cause Hanamori doesn't know

15
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,208
he's the one
who dropped the ball.

16
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,458
When you dial from
your "Recent Calls" list,

17
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,166
press the right one!

18
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,083
Uh, hey Sugi...

19
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,416
I can't believe I'm about to
meet the Mr. Koibuchi in person!

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,916
I'll be on my very
best behavior... of course!

21
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,041
What do you... hope
to accomplish by this?

22
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,791
Pardon me, Shu...
Traffic is light this evening.

23
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:48,041
We'll be home in
five minutes, maybe less.

24
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,083
Can't we...
just drive you home?

25
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,125
Oh, Driver! Step on it!

26
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,541
As you wish.

27
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,958
I give that bath a 9.5!

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,250
Fancy some of this,
now that you're done?

29
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,583
Do I ever! That's a bottle
of "Khan-tay" Shao-shing wine.

30
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,083
An homage to Guan Yu!

31
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,208
An "homage" huh? I thought
it was just regular sake.

32
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,916
The couple next
door's moving away...

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,625
They left this for
us as a goodbye gift.

34
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,750
Aw, I'll be sorry to
see them go. He was aging.

35
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,958
Like a bottle of fine wine.

36
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,666
Apparently, they bought a
little place in the suburbs.

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,541
Don't tell me those cowards
fell for the machinations of

38
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,875
that high-breasted she-devil!

39
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,875
What?! You're saying she
pressured them to sell?!

40
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:40,041
Man... jellyfish come in a
bunch of different types, huh.

41
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:44,791
Um... could you please put your
girl clothes back on... please?

42
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,916
C'mon, you want me
to freeze my butt off?

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,416
Yeah, they look
great, but once the

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,291
sun goes down, I'm a popsicle!

45
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,375
Your sweats are warm, but
boy they're tough on the eyes.

46
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,375
Even I look unfortunate
when I'm wearing them.

47
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,791
Well, change out
of them already, then.

48
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,541
Focus, Tsukimi. We're
looking for inspiration here.

49
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:09,833
Hey, what about...
something like this?

50
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,083
We start out with that
really colorful one...

51
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,541
We use that jelly as
the motif... and then we

52
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,208
bust out a skirt... y'know,
something in the same vein...

53
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,708
Tsukimi, why are
you freaking out?!

54
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,833
That sketch is a travesty!
That sketch is a travesty!

55
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,333
You're repeating yourself.

56
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,208
That thing you drew might
as well have been a sifo-zoan

57
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,000
whereas the jelly from the photo
is a hydrozoan, which should be

58
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,000
obvious, even to an
XY-chromosome savage

59
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,541
such as yourself!

60
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,333
It has a thin bell, thin as
blown glass! And the tentacles!

61
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,875
They're much more slender
and delicate! They're gorgeous!

62
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,500
They're worlds
apart, you philistine!

63
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,708
They're worlds apart!

64
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,916
And you're still
repeating yourself...

65
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,208
I'm gonna show you...
how it's s'posed to look!

66
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,000
This is a flower hat jelly!

67
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,416
Gimme.

68
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,666
Huh?

69
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,541
Serious... if I saw that
in a window, I'd buy it

70
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,458
no matter how much it cost!

71
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, I get where
you're coming from,

72
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,333
but they're super
delicate, so you can't

73
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,750
really keep these
jellies as pets.

74
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,000
Bathtub's free,
knock yourself out!

75
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:25,583
Oh, Fake-Boob Chick's
still up here, huh?

76
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,250
Sure is! But she
was just leaving!

77
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,791
Where are you taking me?

78
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,833
My place. No one'll
barge into my room.

79
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,125
So... That means... We're
going inside your house!

80
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,625
The same house as
your older brother!

81
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,791
Nah... I wouldn't worry
about Shu being around.

82
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,666
Lately, it seems like he hasn't
been home very much at all.

83
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,916
Think he was already
gone when I headed out.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,958
Oh... uh... what a relief.

85
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,416
An' anyway... Shu doesn't
realize that "Before" Tsukimi

86
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,291
and "After" Tsukimi
are the same person.

87
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,750
Here's the deal... You stay
in the car until I'm done

88
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,250
speaking with my
father, understood?

89
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,250
The only reason you're
tormenting me with that photo

90
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,541
is to gain access to him,
so I'm going to play along

91
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,250
and introduce the two
of you. And once I have...

92
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,666
That's it... You're
going to leave me alone,

93
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,458
once and for all.

94
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:31,625
So that's all I am to you...
a blackmailing hussy...

95
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,333
I... didn't mean...

96
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,208
What are you waiting for...
if that's how you feel...

97
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,458
Hold on...

98
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,375
This is real leather, I
don't want you getting your

99
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,208
snot on it. Take the
handkerchief already...

100
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,666
I'm not kidding.

101
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,583
Hold on. Who's sitting
out front in the car?

102
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,333
W-W-Wait a sec, what
if it's your brother?

103
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,666
You told me he wasn't
going to be around!

104
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,375
Chill out.
It's Hanamori, and...

105
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,708
What the hell...?
Some chick?

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,291
Huh?

107
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,791
Uh... can I help you?

108
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,666
Check it out.
It's that land shark who

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,583
wants to tear
down your building...

110
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,000
isn't it?

111
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,583
You're from... Amimazu-kan!

112
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,791
Hanamori! Ya mind telling
me what the hell's going on?!

113
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,916
Why is this woman sitting
in our car?! See this coin?!.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,083
It's gonna scrape the
hell outta the Benz's paint!

115
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,708
She's a friend
of your brother...

116
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,375
I picked them up at her place
and drove them back here.

117
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,875
Shu brought a girl home?

118
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,208
Kuranosuke!

119
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,000
Hold up, Bro. I
need some answers here.

120
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,458
Why'd you bring this
man-eater back to the house?

121
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,166
What--?! I can't have a guest?

122
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,708
Good evening.

123
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,625
I want to thank you for the
friendship you've shown Shu...

124
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,208
I'm his dad.

125
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,291
A pleasure to meet you...
My business card, if I may.

126
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:18,875
Sure. But I know who you are.
Please excuse my coming out

127
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,208
in my robe instead
of inviting you in,

128
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,333
but Shu insisted
we do things this way.

129
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,833
Of course.

130
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,083
Well... I guess there's no
point beating around the bush.

131
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,958
Miss Inari... is it true
that you and my boy...

132
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,875
made it to home base?

133
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:51,958
Oh my... I confess... we
have joined, in body and soul!

134
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,916
You chicken!

135
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,208
Tsukimi!

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,666
Don't go freaking out! I
don't know what she's up to,

137
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,708
but I do know
she's full o' crap!

138
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,125
Really?

139
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,166
He didn't get with you?!
There's no way! It's impossible!

140
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,958
'Cause Shu's still a--!

141
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,250
He's! A... um...

142
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,125
All ears!

143
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,500
'Cause he's... a virgin.

144
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,208
Vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi!

145
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,750
Vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi!

146
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:29,750
Say it!

147
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,083
A virgin, huh?!

148
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,083
Yup.

149
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,875
Like... a virgin...
virgin...?!

150
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,916
I bet you two
haven't done jack.

151
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,666
I... we...!

152
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,041
See, Tsukimi? It's okay...
She's just trying to

153
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,041
play my brother. Those
two so didn't get it on.

154
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,833
We did it all! Back in my
neighborhood, virgins tremble

155
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,791
at the mere sound of my naaaame!
In Ichikawa over in Chiba,

156
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,958
the boys used to call me
"Shoko the Virgin Slayer!"

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,541
Man, you're so full of it!
That nickname is obviously fake.

158
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,333
What book did
you swipe that from?

159
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,083
I'm telling the truth,
dammit! Don't believe me?!

160
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,125
Fine! How about... some
photographic proof?!

161
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,333
In your face!

162
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,666
Tsukimi!

163
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,125
Oh, Mom... what's a
girl supposed to do when

164
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:35,500
she finds out something...
she really didn't want to know?

165
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,833
I mean, how... how do
you un-see something...

166
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,750
once it's burned
its way into your brain?

167
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,916
It's no fair. Why can't
I forget what just happened?

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,125
Just erase it completely?

169
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,708
Not only what happened
right now... but all of it.

170
00:10:55,791 --> 00:11:00,166
Every last memory...
that he's a part of...

171
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,875
Please, I don't
want them anymore...

172
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,875
Tsukimi...

173
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,708
Huh?

174
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,708
Chilly.

175
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,458
Commercial message!

176
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,708
Clara!

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,083
Are you ready for more?!

178
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,166
Tequila!

179
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,250
Hey, Mom... Here's the plan...

180
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm gonna go to sleep and forget
about all the horrible stuff.

181
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,625
That's my specialty, right?
Even when I was little.

182
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,833
Like if I had a
rough day at school...

183
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,916
Hey, Kurashita.
What's that book about?

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,125
Huh? It's just
jellyfish stuff?

185
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,375
Eww, gross! They're
all slimy and weird!

186
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,458
I'd walk home
all by my lonesome.

187
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,500
Welcome home, Tsukimi.

188
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,708
I'd eat the curry you
made... and then you'd slice up

189
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:14,875
an apple for dessert... and
I'd be all happy and full...

190
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,291
Before long... I'd snuggle
under the kotatsu blanket with

191
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,833
my jellyfish field
guide and fall asleep...

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,416
I dreamed about jellyfish, of
course. In my dreams, we would

193
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,000
float through the sea
together, my friends and I...

194
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,375
It felt like I was really
floating... drifting through a

195
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:44,333
world of infinite blueness...
It was so much fun...

196
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,208
I could have
done it forever...

197
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,416
I'd wake up already tucked
into bed... like magic...

198
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:58,416
Yeah... just like
when I was little...

199
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll go to sleep... and
dream of a sea of jellies...

200
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,500
Tsukimi...
Tsukimi... Tsukimi...!

201
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,875
Come on girl!
Wanna be... swim-buddies?

202
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,291
Hi, Clara! Yeah!
C'mon, let's go!

203
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,625
Didja know? I'm really
good at the butterfly stroke!

204
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,250
Oof... Oof...

205
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,666
There you are...
Care to see it again?

206
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, open them! Look at this
gorgeous dress, Kuranosuke!

207
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,208
Your daddy gave
it to me as a gift!

208
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,833
The color makes it almost
look like a wedding dress, huh?

209
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,041
Try it on, Mama. Try it on!

210
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:52,500
Oh, honey... Only a bride should
put on something like this.

211
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,083
It's funny. Mama's
got so many dresses...

212
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,083
but that's the one
nobody's going to give her...

213
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,166
That's what I'm talking
about. Bravo, Tsukimi.

214
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,333
I really think you're
on to something here.

215
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,625
I almost forgot to girl it up.

216
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,125
Eh, just the wig.
I'm in a hurry!

217
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,833
How long are you gonna
scowl at me for, huh?

218
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,666
All I did was tell
your father the truth.

219
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,541
We might've...
joined in body that night...

220
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,958
But I still don't
believe we joined in soul.

221
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,625
Oh my god! I almost
choked on my coffee!

222
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,416
Listen to you, that's
the thing you're hung up on?!

223
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,791
You are a riot,
Shu, y'know that?!

224
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,666
Isn't the
night breeze romantic?

225
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,250
Would you please
stop changing the subject?

226
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,958
Look... You've met my
Father... now please do as

227
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,333
I've asked you
and leave me alone.

228
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,375
Can I... let you
in on a little secret

229
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,000
you haven't
figured out yet?

230
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,875
What's that?

231
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,625
The truth is... you like this.
You enjoy being wrapped around

232
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,041
the finger of a woman like me.

233
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,750
What? That's absurd!

234
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,000
If I were really such
a bother, you'd just leave.

235
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,000
No one's forcing you to
drink tea with me tonight.

236
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,208
But here you and
I sit. Because...

237
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,833
Deep down, in your
secret heart of hearts,

238
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,666
you can't wait to
get me into bed again.

239
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,250
Thank you for coming!

240
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,875
He really is a
virgin... Good lord.

241
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,541
Well, I can't
say I'm not relieved.

242
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,583
You've a lot on your plate.
I'm sorry it concerned you

243
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,708
in the first place.

244
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,583
Don't be silly.
But... this is indeed a

245
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,875
growing problem
in Japanese society.

246
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,000
Thanks to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Law

247
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,666
taking effect, more women are
venturing into the workplace.

248
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,916
Some forgoing
marriage altogether...

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,958
The number of Japanese
men who've yet to marry

250
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,208
has shot above 40%.

251
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,791
I'll sleep easy tonight...

252
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,666
knowing that boy of yours
got his V-card punched!

253
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,125
Yes. And the lady in
question is quite experienced.

254
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,375
The best kind to
turn a boy into a man.

255
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,625
It's true! Very true...
the lucky dog.

256
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,708
So, how would you classify
her? Club bunny? Teenybopper?

257
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,791
Christmas cake? Plain
Jane? Online dating type?

258
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,208
Raging Twitter addict?

259
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll be straight with you.

260
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,916
Apparently, it's
that redeveloper.

261
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:58,125
Uhm... That puts... us
in a... bit of a fix, yeah?

262
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,541
"In a bit of a fix"
is putting it lightly...

263
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,250
That's why I'm
sending Shu out on a

264
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,208
nationwide inspection tour.
To have Hanamori investigate

265
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,291
the hell out of
her while he's gone.

266
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,208
I may as well
admit there's one more.

267
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,875
There's one more girl
I'm concerned about.

268
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,791
No way! So there's another
one?! Like father, like son!

269
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,541
You're such a
horndog, y'know that?!

270
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,041
Thank you?

271
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,416
Sorry to barge in, Uncle...
I didn't know you were here.

272
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,708
Something is different about
you. Tell me, dear Shu-Shu.

273
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,208
Did you finally
have some S-E-X?

274
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,416
Hah?!

275
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:39,166
It's no use. When I close
my eyes and try to fall asleep,

276
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,833
I see it all again,
shot-by-shot, like a slideshow

277
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,916
on the insides
of my eyelids.

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,625
It hurts a lot.
Too much to sleep.

279
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,833
I humbly request your wisdom!

280
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,666
Intruder alert! Bandit!
Highwayman! Burglar!

281
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,958
A thief, for reals?
Dude, I got this!

282
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,791
What's your cunning plan?

283
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,791
Cooking wine. That's
all the alcohol we've got?

284
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,625
Maybe I'll walk to
the convenience store.

285
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,541
Huh?

286
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,791
It's a she-burgler!

287
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,708
Tsukimi, you ninny! What
possessed you to burgle us?!

288
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,083
I raised you better than that!

289
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,083
Robbing the menfolk
would be one thing, but this!

290
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:40,833
This!

291
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,541
Wait! I wasn't burgling!

292
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,250
I just wanted a
little drink, okay?!

293
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,041
"Little drink?!" So this is
the handiwork of demon rum?!

294
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,541
You're an under-aged
alcoholic burglar, Tsukimi.

295
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,375
And that is
something I cannot abide!

296
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm sorry, I couldn't
sleep and I thought a drink

297
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,208
or two could
help me get to bed!

298
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,583
Couldn't sleep, huh?!
Well, why didn't you just say?!

299
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,166
Drink up, young non-burglar!
And let Guan Yu's

300
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,208
peerless spirit cart
you off to dreamland!

301
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,916
Don't let the bottle play you
for a fool, though, Tsukimi!

302
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,125
It's just regular sake from
our cowardly ex-neighbors.

303
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,250
Less talking,
more drinking, ladies!

304
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,291
Start you off with just one.

305
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,083
Whoa.

306
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,833
Woo hoo! She's
chugging like a champ!

307
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,208
Man!

308
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,041
She was sunk by sweet sake?!
You gotta be kidding me!

309
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,875
C'mon. That's not
even the good stuff!

310
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,708
What's all the hollering about?
And for the love o' Pete.

311
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,375
What were my girls doing
in the middle of the hall?!

312
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,958
Uh... they were...
on guard duty!

313
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,875
Honestly, you two!
You'd better put them back

314
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,000
where you found them!

315
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,875
Ten-four, mama-san.

316
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,875
Tsukimi? Aw... You should
be sleeping in your bed, dear.

317
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,166
What am I going to do with you?

318
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:58,833
Tsukimi... Tsukimi...
Hey, Tsukimi... come on!

319
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,625
Hey, Clara.

320
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,708
Are you okay?.

321
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,666
It sounds like you're
getting the sniffles!

322
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,625
Um... my forehead
is kinda hot.

323
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,166
That's fine, if it
helps me get to sleep.

324
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,208
Because, then I'll
forget all the bad stuff.

325
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,416
Huh? What kind of bad stuff?

326
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,375
Uh... guess I forgot. I forgot
the bad stuff already, Clara!

327
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,166
So it's all gone?
I'm so happy for you!

328
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,541
Hey... now that you're
here... wanna swim to the

329
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,916
East China Sea with
me? It'll be fun!

330
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,416
Wow... it's a brood
of Japanese sea nettles!

331
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,041
Look at 'em all!

332
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,875
They're pretty, but don't forget
how poisonous they are, Tsukimi.

333
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:40,833
No touching!

334
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,083
Okay!

335
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,375
Gorgeous! Like something
a princess would wear!

336
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,791
How come... I feel
so warm and floaty?

337
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,041
This is neat!

338
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,208
I feel so peaceful!
Oh... I get it...

339
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,125
Mom must've picked me up.

340
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,250
She's carrying me
off to bed right now.

341
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,458
Oh, Mom...

342
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,791
Geez, you're heavy...
