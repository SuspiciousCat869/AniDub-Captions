1
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,625
Time to get
baked, little dude...

2
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,750
Oh no. You're
in sweet potato hell!

3
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,291
Banba! When you bake a sweet
potato, aren't you supposed to

4
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,250
put it on the wood before
you light the fire? Hah?

5
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,458
No worries.
I'm a pro at this.

6
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:57,750
Huh?

7
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,583
Fro-mageddon!
Fro-mageddoooon!

8
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:04,416
Hey Mom. The Sisterhood and
I put together a little bonfire

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,916
and baked some sweet potatoes
from Dad's farm this afternoon.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,750
Crisis averted.

11
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,125
For now!

12
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,875
That smells good.

13
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,208
You and me and Dad... we
used to have bonfires a bunch,

14
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,125
didn't we?
Yeah... like that day...

15
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,250
Hey, sweetie, wanna help
me gather some firewood?

16
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,541
Yeah!

17
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,500
Don't push yourself
too hard, okay?

18
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,958
I'll take it easy, I promise.

19
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,833
Lookit, Mommy! Look!

20
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,541
I found some driftwood. There's
a whole bunch of it over here!

21
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,083
I'm gonna bring
it back to Daddy,

22
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,750
'cause he makes
really good fires with it!

23
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,166
When'd you get so smart, baby?

24
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:48,958
I a'member the one Daddy
made last time! Wow, look!

25
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,125
That's the biggest driftwood
in the whole worl--!

26
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,083
Mommy...?

27
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,541
Another minute or two
and they should be done!

28
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,625
I know it was years ago,

29
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,375
but it feels like
it was just yesterday.

30
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:13,458
Something reminds me
of you, and I start to cry.

31
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,666
Days like this, I just
wanna watch the jellyfish.

32
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,875
The more established restaurants
and kimono fabric shops

33
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,458
oppose the
redevelopment plans.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,708
That's something
to keep an eye on.

35
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,166
Hey, bro!

36
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,625
What have I told you
about barging into my room?

37
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,416
I broke into
the old man's room.

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,833
Come on, searching
the house again?

39
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:44,041
Yeah... But I still didn't
find Mom's address anywhere.

40
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,041
Sucks to be you. Holed up in
here, working on your day off...

41
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,500
What's this?

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,416
Oh... Redevelopment plans
for your friend's building.

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,458
Probably a high-rise hotel.

44
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,333
Listen up!

45
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,000
Hands off the starchy
carbs, girls! This is no time

46
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,083
for sweet potatoes!
Feast your eyes on these!

47
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,833
Top-secret documents! This
block is getting a facelift!

48
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,625
Two years from now,
it'll be a ritzy hotel!

49
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,750
What's this all about?

50
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,000
A ritzy... hotel?

51
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,625
Hey! I never lived
anywhere ritzy!

52
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,416
Right?

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,958
Oh my, yes!

54
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,500
Wise up! You five ain't gonna
be living in the damn hotel!

55
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,083
Without this building, you're
all screwed! You're a bunch of

56
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,166
NEETs, remember?! Who's gonna
rent apartments to you guys?!

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,500
No jobs, no references?!
Not gonna happen!

58
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,166
And I don't want to see
an awesomely retro place

59
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,208
like this bite the dust!

60
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,875
It shall endure! The Nunnery
must live on when all of us

61
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,500
are dust! God may forgive its
destruction but I never will!

62
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,666
Do calm down, Mayaya! It's
still in the planning stages,

63
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,416
and folks're already
protesting against it!

64
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,791
Wait, you knew, what was up?

65
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,791
Duh. Even we read the
neighborhood newsletter, Meat.

66
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,291
We do live here.

67
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,541
Don't cry anymore. Please,
Mayaya! Just try to remain cal--

68
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,541
"Better to wrong the
world than have it wrong me!"

69
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,625
by the brave warlord Tsao Tsao.

70
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,291
Don't know why I expected
a sensible response

71
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,708
out of any of 'em.

72
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:22,750
Could you please go home
already? Like I ask every time.

73
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:27,750
I'm heading out for a bit so
you. Should. Go. Home. Now...

74
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,500
You, go out?
Who'd a thunk! Shopping?

75
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,958
No... to an aquarium...
for the jellyfish...

76
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, I'm not busy.
I'll tag along!

77
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,708
Huh?! No, no you don't wanna
do that! It's like an hour away!

78
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,458
Y'know the Enoshima Aquarium
in Shonan? It's that one!

79
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,041
If we go by car we'll
be there in no time!

80
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,708
Let's take my brother's
Benz. Driver included!

81
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,125
Huh?!

82
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,500
We'll get ya all Cinderella'd
up, just like before!

83
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,833
Tsukimi, hon? Could I
grab another sweet potato?

84
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,291
Tip of the
iceberg, ladies!

85
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,041
Sick! And we can
borrow any one of 'em?!

86
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,583
My dear girl! I am so
glad you've awakened to

87
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,625
the wonders of the kimono!

88
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,291
Hey! This one's
got a cute pattern!

89
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,208
You have good eye!

90
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,708
That's an heirloom obi from
the early Showa period that

91
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,708
I discovered in this kimono
shop in Nishiogi I frequent--

92
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,875
It's in amazing shape
for its age, right?!

93
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,125
There aren't many sashes
of this pedigree and vibrance

94
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,375
in circulation anymore! This one
started life as a double-weave

95
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,333
sash but was repurposed in
the Nagoya style so it could be

96
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,000
worn in more casual situations.

97
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,750
You can pair it
up with every pattern.

98
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,750
Chieko, you're
kinda freaking me out!

99
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,250
Let's shoot for the moon and
use a collar with roses, too!

100
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,625
I think you should
do the honors, Chieko.

101
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,083
When it comes to putting
on a kimono, this boy--

102
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:47,541
♪Oh boy! Oh boy! I'm gonna
try on a kimono, dugga-dun!♪

103
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:52,291
♪Dance the Kimono Samba!
Oh boy! Oh boy, oh boy!♪

104
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,458
You can't keep saying
"boy" in front of them!

105
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,291
Okay, okay. Chill!

106
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:01,041
Now it is time to give yourself
to the kimono, body and soul!

107
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,791
Oh, big brother!

108
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,500
Do us a solid, huh?
Lend us your car?

109
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,333
Didn't think you and the
Benz were a package deal.

110
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,000
Hanamori's with Father. He's
golfing a round in Hakone.

111
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,000
Fore!

112
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,875
Excellent shot, sir.
You're on a roll today.

113
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,708
Yeah, whatever! You're
only chauffeuring 'cause

114
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,708
she's here with me.

115
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:36,875
Tsukimi...

116
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,958
Uh... yes...?!

117
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,000
The other day... when I stopped
by to return your glasses...

118
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,916
I'm sorry about how that went.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,291
Huh?

120
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,833
I meant to hand the bag
right to you, but... well...

121
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,708
Then... why didn't
he hand it to me?

122
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,875
Of course! I was so gross
he was afraid we might

123
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,500
accidentally touch
or something!

124
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,541
Lesson time! See how
she decided she was all grody

125
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,625
without anyone else
telling her she was?

126
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,416
This is "textbook behavior"
for your typical otaku-girl!

127
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,375
Wait... But we're
talking and I don't even

128
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,541
feel like I'm gonna barf...

129
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,000
Tsukimi, you want some?

130
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,291
Is it because I'm
not wearing my glasses?

131
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,541
Not too shabby, eh guys?

132
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,666
I heard this place was
popular lately, but dang!

133
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,291
Uh... Tsukimi...?

134
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,541
Whoa... Somebody's
walking faster than usual.

135
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,041
Wait for us, yeah?

136
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,166
Come on, the jellyfish
room is this way!

137
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,375
Move it, slowpokes!

138
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,708
She's like a
whole 'nother girl.

139
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,666
Check out all the spotted
jellies! And they're

140
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,375
way teensier than Clara,
even! Aren't they just

141
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,208
the cutest things you've
seen in your whole life?!

142
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,750
Just look at how happy
she is. Her love of

143
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,791
nature is invigorating.
Isn't it, Kuranosuke?

144
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,666
She doesn't love
nature, just jellyfish!

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,125
Tsukimi...

146
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,125
Ground Control to Major Shu!

147
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:17,250
Uh... brother guy...
would you... mind...

148
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,500
standing over here for me?

149
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,333
What, like this?

150
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,208
Perfect! Don't move!

151
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,833
They really do look alike!

152
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,208
Huh?

153
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,875
I so called it! Your brother
is the spitting image of

154
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,750
Sanderia malayensis, the
prince of the jellyfish world!

155
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,166
I mean, your brother doesn't
have tentacles and the jelly has

156
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,208
no brain, but they
give off the same vibe!

157
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,708
Hey, um...

158
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,708
Yeah? What's up? Uh...

159
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,291
Would you mind... standing...

160
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,333
Over there? You're in my way.
I've never made this jelly's

161
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,958
acquaintance before.
Without my glasses,

162
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,000
I have to get real close!

163
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,208
No prob. I gotta pee, anyhow.

164
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,625
Look at me. Waltzin' straight
into the ladies' room...

165
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,750
Come on... why're you
letting it get to you, man?

166
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,083
Eeee! What're you doing
in here?! You have got

167
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,833
a perfectly good bathroom
of your own! What a stud!

168
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,541
My bad. Not payin' attention.

169
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,541
Don't worry. No harm done...

170
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,958
What the hell? Why's
she being so cute right now?

171
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,666
I'm seeing her have
fun for once, is that it?

172
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,916
Betcha that's a big part of
it. And, I don't think she's

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,875
ever actually looked at
me when we're talking before.

174
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,833
Why... why does
that... piss me off?

175
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,666
Commercial message!

176
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,083
Clara!

177
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,250
Are you ready for more?

178
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,666
Tequila!

179
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,541
All of my life, from birth
up 'til five minutes ago,

180
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,250
basically... I've always
had girls flock to me.

181
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,500
My pockets? Full of business
cards. Modeling and pop idol

182
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,833
agencies. Record labels. Agents
run after me on the street.

183
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,916
Hottest girl in school? Check.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,708
Hottest girl at some
other school? Check.

185
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,166
And local beauty queens?

186
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,500
Oh yeah, checkity
check check check.

187
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,375
I was a hit with the
ladies. Too big of a hit.

188
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,666
Caused me a lot of woman
drama, and now I'm bored of 'em.

189
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,166
Popularity is for chumps.
It's a pain in the ass.

190
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,541
So why does this,
an awkward little hug...

191
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,291
between my bro, the political
dweeb with the charisma of

192
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:06,125
a sweet potato... and some
otaku girl with a head full of

193
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,625
jellyfish who can't
even hardly see him.

194
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,541
Why the hell does
it piss me off, huh?

195
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,166
What do I care?!
They're both nerds!

196
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,458
Yeah, no, don't care.

197
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,250
Hey, guys? Hanging on
each other in public?

198
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,208
Kinda tacky.
Let's wrap it up, yeah?

199
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,958
Get yer paws offa her!

200
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,708
Tsukimi, what are you crying
for? Come on what's wrong?

201
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,916
Aw, now your makeup is a mess!

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,375
I... I'm sorry... I'm
gonna go clean up a bit...

203
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,291
Well! Don't touch your
eyes unless you gotta!

204
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,708
Ahh, the mascara's waterproof,
guess it doesn't matter.

205
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,250
What was that all about?

206
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,083
I... I don't know...

207
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,666
A likely story! Remind
me how old you are?!

208
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,541
I'm... thirty...

209
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,583
The heir of a famous political
family hanging all over a girl

210
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,208
barely outta high
school in a public place?!

211
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,250
I'm calling the tabloids, perv!

212
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:10,250
Hold on! It wasn't like that.
She just started crying, okay?

213
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,833
Out of nowhere...
I didn't know what to do.

214
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,500
So I guess... I hugged her.

215
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,083
She said the
jellyfish reminded her.

216
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,166
Mama will still be
watching you... okay, baby?

217
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,708
Up in heaven. I'll be
watching you, every day...

218
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:43,208
Please, don't cry,
Tsukimi. I'm sorry.

219
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,083
Are you all right?

220
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:54,666
I'm sorry... These... weren't
here the last time I came...

221
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,708
Uh, can you tell
me what's wrong?

222
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:04,000
I shouldn't cry!
I promised her...

223
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,375
What?

224
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:10,458
When... my mom died... I
promised... I wouldn't cry!

225
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:19,916
It's okay. You can
cry. Let it all out.

226
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,791
I feel a little calmer.

227
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,833
Wait... What just
happened back there?!

228
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,000
Are you all right?

229
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,791
It's okay. You can
cry. Let it all out.

230
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,916
What? This can't be
right! According to these

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,250
thermal imaging
memories, it's as though

232
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,833
we were occupying
the same space!

233
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,250
Warmth on my back,
and shoulders and cheek

234
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,666
and coolness as
though his glasses!

235
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,416
Did the two of us... Did
Kuranosuke's brother and I...

236
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Huh, huh...! Hug?!

237
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:20,041
He hugged me? Like, with
his arms?! On purpose?! Why?!

238
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:25,666
Of course! I was sobbing like
a baby in front of everyone.

239
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,750
I was disturbing the peace!
He had to take one for the team,

240
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:33,041
like a... like some kind
of "otaku whisperer!"

241
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,791
I like to snuggle with 'em.

242
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:39,416
Then let 'em just tucker out.
This one is especially daft!

243
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,750
That's so selfless of him!

244
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,791
You know...
bloody's not your style.

245
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,250
Stop freaking out! I go into
the ladies' room all the time!

246
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,958
Lose the gore...
wipe your face...

247
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,750
a little kimono
triage... and voila!

248
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,416
I seal thee!

249
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,458
It's no good.
When I can see him,

250
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,791
I'm too nervous
to say anything!

251
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:14,541
Tsukimi?

252
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,541
Oh! Uh... yeah?

253
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:22,083
Sorry. You know... about your
mom'n all... I didn't realize.

254
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,041
What? No. I'm the
one who's sorry for

255
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,916
causing such a
scene back there.

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,166
I know what it's like.

257
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,500
Huh?

258
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,791
Sucks to lose your mom.

259
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,375
Uh, thank you!
For driving me out to

260
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,125
the aquarium like you did!

261
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:49,583
I hope I didn't ruin your day or
anything! 'Kay, then! G'night!

262
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,750
Good! Plunking those glasses
on her transformed Tsukimi

263
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,875
back into her usual
awkward self. Wait a sec...

264
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,208
Why am I jazzed
about something like that?

265
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,791
Emergency! Emergency! Bona
fide crisis, coming through!

266
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,541
The nib of my pen's
worn down to a nuuubbbb!

267
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,750
What's going on?

268
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,791
There you are! It's
about time, young lady!

269
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,916
We have a situation!
Hurry into the foyer!

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,541
Ms. Mejiro got her
deadlines mixed up!

271
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,916
Banba! Fill in the
solid blacks on this.

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,833
Ten-four.

273
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,666
This hasn't been inked at all!

274
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,458
Banba! Your hair's
working against us!

275
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,291
It's going to
soak up all the ink!

276
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,208
Bah, nib famine! They
were sold out of my brand!

277
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,541
Good lord, Jiji.
Don't draw extra old men!

278
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,041
Just finish what's
on the page!

279
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,083
Whoa, you're good
at old dudes...

280
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,666
My poor nib-less
calligraphy pen!

281
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,125
You're like a
decapitated soldier...

282
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,583
Honestly, these girls
aren't any help at all.

283
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,541
Quick, go get changed
as fast as you can!

284
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,541
You're the last
fresh troop I've got!

285
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,458
Aye-aye!

286
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:57,458
What the...?! How am I supposed
to take it off? What if I untie

287
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:01,541
this part? Huh?! It's like
I'm wearing a Rubik's Cube!

288
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,958
Hurry, Tsukimi! Hurry!

289
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,666
Poor pen!

290
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,666
Banba knocked over the
inkwell! It's everywhere!

291
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,708
Nibless nub!

292
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,666
Okay, we do this the hard way!

293
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,625
Jiji's drooling over
those old men she drew!

294
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,750
She's totally delusional!

295
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,000
I give up!

296
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:28,166
Chieko! Help! I can't get
myself out of this kimono!

297
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,791
Hugging you... was
the height of presumption.

298
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,291
Please excuse my
behavior. Good night.

299
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,666
Really, you too?!

300
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,458
What's with the nosebleed?
That's really sad, Bro.

301
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,500
Geez... All you
two did was hug.

302
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:09,333
Hey, now. Stop the presses. Shu
was already in high school when

303
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,083
I moved into the mansion. We've
lived under the same roof for

304
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:17,375
a decade and change now.
But I don't think he's had

305
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,458
a girlfriend this whole time.

306
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,083
Sir... Tomorrow's front page.

307
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,291
How's the front?

308
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,708
You'd have to run
the media gauntlet, sir.

309
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:38,250
Like always. Maybe I should
cancel that dinner tonight...

310
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,958
What's crack-a-lackin,'
Kura-poo!

311
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,583
'Sup, Uncle? Hey, am
I calling at a bad time?

312
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,958
Dontchu worry your pretty little
head! Nine percent of 'em

313
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:55,458
still like me. It's all
good! Oh-ho-hooo yeah!

314
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,000
Good job, Unc. You an' Shu have
always been pretty tight, yeah?

315
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,000
Word!. Shu's my boy!

316
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,333
Have you ever heard him
talk about the women he likes

317
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,708
or anything? Far as I know,
he's never brought one around.

318
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,958
Is the fam not down
with sex in the house?

319
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:14,375
Ha! You're kiddin' me, right?
The Shu-meister's still

320
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,166
a virgin! It's all the rage
these days, but whatevs!

321
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,333
How many are left?

322
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,916
Tsukimi's working
on the very last one.

323
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,458
Trace faster, dude!

324
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:33,791
Tsukimi! You must become one
with the pen, in body and soul!

325
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,708
He totally saw me! Half
flopped out of the kimono with

326
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,708
a busted old tank top
I've had since high school!

327
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,583
I wasn't even wearing a bra!

328
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,666
Noooooooo!

329
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,666
Ink wave!

330
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,541
Tsukimi, no!
What have you done?!

331
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,125
Aw, Boys Love party-foul!

332
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,416
Grab something to
blot it with, quickly!

333
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,625
Banba! I'm
commandeering your afro!

334
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,125
Wait! Stop it! That's worse!

335
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,541
Tsukimi?!
Why're you screaming?!

336
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,958
My life! Is over!

337
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,291
You're white as a ghost!
Or, as they said in the '80s,

338
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,000
"like, majorly
pale, for sure!"

339
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:16,458
Mom... it's driving me nuts!
I mean, seriously. Am I jealous

340
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,875
about a... a lousy hug
between a couple of virgins?!

341
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,208
What the hell?!

342
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,833
I can't take it!
