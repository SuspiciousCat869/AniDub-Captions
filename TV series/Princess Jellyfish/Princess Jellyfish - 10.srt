1
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,875
Good morning, everyone.
Saku-rako, Midori-ko, O-Chiyo,

2
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,041
Matsuko, O-Take,
Umeko, Yoshibo...

3
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,416
You're all looking
as lovely as ever.

4
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,708
Good morning!

5
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,083
Hey Chieko, would
you do me a favor?

6
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,583
You're certainly
here early this morning.

7
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,791
Well... I just have way
too much on my plate today.

8
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,208
That's why I'm here...
to pick up that thing.

9
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,666
Ahh, "that thing..."
All right, I'll let you play,

10
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,458
but promise you'll be nice.

11
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,291
Not the dolls. I meant
that thing over there.

12
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,250
The machine?

13
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,958
Oh, that's right. I stayed
up late drinking sake in

14
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:35,708
the kitchen last night... And
then... Mom carried me to bed.

15
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,250
A dream?

16
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:47,166
Hey Mom, guess what? Had
a dream about you last night.

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,625
But if that was a dream, how
did I get back to my own room?

18
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,208
I don't remember that at all.

19
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,250
You're up early
this morning, Tsukimi!

20
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,958
Hey. Yeah, g'morning.

21
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,166
Got two words for you
last night. Rock Star.

22
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,416
That brings up a good
question. Do rock stars usually

23
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
not remember how they
got back to their room?

24
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,250
Oh wow! The sake gods were
pleased with your drinking.

25
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,041
That's why they carried
you safely back to your room!

26
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,333
That elixir of Guan
Yu's is magic sauce.

27
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,375
That's not what I--

28
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,250
What are you doing?!

29
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,291
Come on, no worries.
I took Home Ec...

30
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,666
'Course I took
it in fifth grade.

31
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,541
I'm telling you, I've
had this machine for years.

32
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,458
I'm the only one who
knows how to use it right.

33
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,291
'Kay now this thing?
I think it goes here...

34
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,833
Don't do that.
You're going to get the

35
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,875
thread completely tangled.

36
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,083
It got all tangled.

37
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,125
I told you!

38
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,083
Hey. What're you
guys doing in here?

39
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,750
Tsukimi! Stop her...
She's completely off her nut!

40
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,875
Oh... you're awake.
Is your fever any better?

41
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,166
Fever?

42
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,583
Oh, that's right, I was
a little sick last night.

43
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,333
Wait, but how does he know?

44
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,250
Technology! Let's
start over here.

45
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,416
I bought all this as
soon as I got up. Look!

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,250
Fabric! Rhinestones!
And lace and beads!

47
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,458
O-kay...

48
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,833
Come on, let's do it!

49
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,916
Let's do what? I'm lost.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,375
Cryin' out loud! I told you,
we're going to make this!

51
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,458
You want to make
a jelly? A flower hat?

52
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,666
Hel-lo?! The dress!

53
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,416
You know, I drew
that back in high school.

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,000
It's really not all that great.

55
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,958
I know that... but it
looks like a cool dress to me.

56
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,500
If we make something that
looks like this, it'll sell.

57
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,291
It's too cute not to! We'll
take over the fashion world!

58
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,125
We'll save Amamizu-kan!

59
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,083
I want to make this...
out of this, right here.

60
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,541
And I want Chieko to do it.

61
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:37,250
Sorry... I can only
make traditional clothing.

62
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,166
And I only use this
machine to stitch yukata.

63
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,916
Yukata... You made that, too?

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,291
Whoa! Chieko... you rock!

65
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,916
You're so sweet but anyone could
do it, it's nothing special.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,958
How do you do it?

67
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,750
It's really very
easy. I'll show you.

68
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,333
Watch, I just started
making a new kimono for

69
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,541
Midoriko this morning and
I'm nearly finished with it.

70
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,708
So fast!

71
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,708
The type of stitching used
in traditional clothing is

72
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,708
refined from a technique
passed down in Japan

73
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,250
since ancient times, exclusively
using straight lines.

74
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,666
Western-style clothing is
all curved lines designed to

75
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,125
accommodate the
wearer's body shape,

76
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,166
it's completely different,
even on a conceptual level.

77
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,125
You're sewing without
even looking at your hands!

78
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,875
Come on, I know
you can do this!

79
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,708
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

80
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,250
Why not?

81
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,041
I already told you, Japanese
and Western sewing come from

82
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,666
completely different
schools of thought.

83
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,791
Skills don't matter if they're
in a different discipline.

84
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,666
I'll give you an analogy,
it's like you're asking

85
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,875
a sushi chef from
Tokyo to make a fine roux

86
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,375
like a French chef in Paris
would. It can't be done.

87
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,541
You're a sewing
savant, don't you see?!

88
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,583
The point is, I can't possibly
make something so complicated.

89
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,250
If I help, it'll only
be with stitching.

90
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,500
You'll just have to make the
rest of it work yourselves.

91
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,666
"Make it work," she says...

92
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,541
And that's all I have
for the moment regarding

93
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,666
our Hotel Createur
Tokyo. Let's move on now to

94
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,375
the situation with the
west side of Amamizu Station,

95
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,416
where construction is
planned. We are in continuing

96
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,958
negotiations with the residents
so that we can break ground

97
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:02,041
the year after next at the
latest. The site purchase is

98
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,416
proceeding on schedule
and shouldn't encounter any

99
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,791
major delays as the project goes
forward over the coming months.

100
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,750
That's no good. Amamizu-kan
is right in the middle of the

101
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,958
proposed site. What'll Tsukimi
do once the buyout is final?

102
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,666
What? I'm evicted?

103
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,125
Yes... unfortunately.

104
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,666
But where will I
live? It's my home.

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,708
I've got nowhere else to go!

106
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,833
It'll be all right, Tsukimi.
We can make a home together!

107
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,833
Together?

108
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,375
We can rent a little
house by the shore.

109
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,875
We'll live a humble,
quiet life together

110
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,291
just watching the jellyfish.

111
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,291
That'll never happen.

112
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,541
Y'see... she won't forgive
you having sex with me.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry!

114
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,541
Tsukimi Kurashita, huh.

115
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,916
Mhm. Mr. Koibuchi insisted.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,166
Shu's gone... he leaves
tonight to go overseas...

117
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,875
so he won't find out.

118
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:28,041
So you don't got a photo?
How about an address?

119
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,500
H-How many
meters did you buy?

120
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,958
I don't know, I just
bought the whole bolt.

121
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,333
Let's cut the sucker up.

122
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,833
Are you sure that's
the right way to start?

123
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,916
No clue. But we've
gotta start somewhere.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,458
But isn't cutting a little
permanent? Just because you're

125
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,041
a Stylish, doesn't mean
you know how to make clothes.

126
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,625
Well no, but I wear
them all the time.

127
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:58,875
Banzai!

128
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,708
Fabric faceplant!

129
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,166
Iketani!

130
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,750
Look I'm a salmon roll or...

131
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,500
Raise a white flag for
Ma Chao! It is useless to

132
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,291
fight Liu Bei's army if
Ma Chao fights with them!

133
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,958
Do not get in our way! Special
Attack: "Take money and go eat!"

134
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,833
Ichiyo Higuchi!

135
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,333
We're going to Chinatown!

136
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,666
The Minatomirai Line is mine!

137
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,875
It's Chinatown, Jake!

138
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,666
And extra batteries!

139
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,208
So... where were we?

140
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,791
Now... Scissors!

141
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,166
I-I don't--

142
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,166
It doesn't have to be exact.
Just cut around me...

143
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,166
try to make it
somewhat dress-shaped.

144
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,291
If it doesn't work, try again.

145
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,416
Okay, Mom. What is
it that makes me think

146
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
this strange guy is so
beautiful? Maybe it's because

147
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,000
his arms and legs
are so pale and slender.

148
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,541
He's just like a jellyfish.

149
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,083
Make it like
that whatsit-jelly.

150
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,791
It's called a
"Flower Hat Jelly."

151
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,333
Yeah, that.

152
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:16,166
Looking at this beautiful young
man... he fills my heart with...

153
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,416
I don't know... like my heart
is filled with jellyfish lace...

154
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,125
It's almost enough
to make me forget

155
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,791
all the bad things
that have happened.

156
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,416
Good afternoon!

157
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Hello.

158
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,291
What're you up to after this?

159
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,333
Back to the office.
I have to write up all the

160
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,208
details from the meeting.

161
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,833
Where're we going?

162
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,375
Get out of the car.

163
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,041
Let's go to--

164
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,416
Please get out!

165
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,041
What exactly do
you want from me?!

166
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,666
I get it now. So I was no more
than a one-night stand for you.

167
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,333
Have it your way.

168
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:02,750
If that's what you want...
I'll just disappear... forever.

169
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,416
Elite Man Snaring Techniques,

170
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,541
Inari-Style:
A Beginners' Course.

171
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,666
If pushing doesn't work, try
guilt ridden pulling him along.

172
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,333
I guarantee he'll call
in the next two or three days.

173
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,916
Please don't go.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,583
That was fast! Guess I should
expect as much from a virgin.

175
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,625
He's got the resolve
of a middle schooler.

176
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,583
But watch how I
boldly ignore him.

177
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,125
Taxi!

178
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,958
No wait! Please!

179
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,500
Commercial message!

180
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,708
Clara!

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,875
Now the other part!

182
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,208
Tequila.

183
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,541
Down to 5 hundred 35 yen?
Dang, Madam Ichiyo didn't even

184
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,125
last us half the day.

185
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,708
That's because you insisted we
have the mango flan for dessert.

186
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,875
Right... Let's pay our respects
to the spirit of Guan Yu...

187
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,333
then get squeaky
clean at the public bath.

188
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,541
How cool!

189
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,500
That afro is totally righteous.

190
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,541
It's like, the way
biggest I've ever seen.

191
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,833
Do you mind if I touch it?
Omigod I already am touching it!

192
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,041
It's a Stylish!

193
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,625
Picture time... smile!

194
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,041
Listen up, you two.
There's no reason to try

195
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,083
and spare your feelings on
this. You've killed any chance

196
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,375
of quality work
from this fabric... ever.

197
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,041
No need to cut us
down right when we're

198
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,000
beginning to get
motivated. That's not cool.

199
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,291
Well... let me
see what I can do...

200
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,750
She's still breaking
the sound barrier!

201
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,458
I'll put some elastic in...

202
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,000
Yuck... How dare you
give my haute couture skirt

203
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,333
an elastic waistband?!

204
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,916
Hush now... Just
try it on this way.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,541
Really?

206
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,583
This spring... Rock the "poor
pauper" look in a dorky skirt

207
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,625
with an elastic waistband!

208
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,333
No! Nooo!

209
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,708
It should be way flouncier!

210
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,458
With the pattern you cut...
there's no way it could be!

211
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, man...

212
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,208
It's wrong! That pathetic piece
of cloth isn't even close to

213
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,000
expressing an inch
of the delicate beauty

214
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,416
of the Flower Hat Jelly!

215
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,583
Not even a micrometer or
nanometer of the awesomeness!

216
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:04,333
My god... The otaku girl
rant has been unleashed.

217
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,541
To start with, the bells
of all jellyfish, not just

218
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,583
the Flower Hat Jelly,
contain a fluidity of

219
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,125
motion requisite to
their body structure.

220
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,500
If that's what you want,
I'll just disappear.

221
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,708
I'm sorry. I can't come
to the phone right now.

222
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,000
Tsukimi. What are--?

223
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,166
Mm, please just stay still.

224
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,250
Jeez, at least say sorry!

225
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,166
Careful... go slow.

226
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,458
It's okay. Just let her be.

227
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,833
There, it's finished.

228
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,083
At least it looks a little
bit more like a bell now.

229
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,750
Hey, you're right. Not bad.

230
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,333
Chieko, could you sew
it on the machine for me?

231
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,208
No problem. But what do you
want me to do with the edges?

232
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,333
All your margins
on the outside.

233
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,458
I really don't care. Long
as it's shaped like a bell,

234
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,958
that's good enough for me.

235
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,791
It's a good start, but I don't
think it'll get that shape

236
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,666
unless I wear
a pannier underneath.

237
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,208
Pa... what?

238
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,166
"Pannier..." That thing
all the Goth-Lolis wear

239
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,375
under their skirts... Y'know,
like a ballerina's tutu.

240
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,166
Sure... I knew that.

241
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,791
Oh hey, let's go
finish this at my place.

242
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,291
I've got a bunch
there. My bro's gone.

243
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,583
And there's no one else
to interrupt us. It's perfect.

244
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,750
O-kay...

245
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,541
Tsukimi?

246
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:41,875
Chieko?

247
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:42,875
Yes?

248
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,208
You like all
sorts of old stuff.

249
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,666
How'd you like to
take a bunch of pictures

250
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,958
of a cool old mansion?

251
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,750
Actually, I love old houses.

252
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,791
I recently went to a

253
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,916
Western-style
house in Kamakura...

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,958
Look.

255
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,166
Wow!

256
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,250
Could I ask you
for one more favor?

257
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,958
Perfect, thanks! This
is totes going on my blog.

258
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,500
Buh... Blog?

259
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,583
Afros are just so scrunchy.
Where did you get yours done?

260
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,166
Ah-oh-yama? It was, huh?

261
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,000
Uhh... I was born this way.

262
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,458
I've always thought
they were totally retro cool.

263
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,583
But my agency
won't let me get one!

264
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:19,375
One more feel
please? It's so animal!

265
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,291
So this is it. Not such
a bad place, I guess.

266
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:31,083
Excuse me, sir! Do you know
where I can find this address?

267
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,916
Uhh... that place, huh?

268
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:39,708
Dang... Why do those guys always
make me drink so damn much?

269
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:44,000
And who the hell orders
Dom Pérignon Rosé these days?!

270
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,833
Twelve messages...
What's a girl to do?

271
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,458
Wow, this salami's good.

272
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,041
It's ringing again!
I'm not here...

273
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,291
but I'll answer... speak.

274
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,541
Hi, it's Shu--Koibuchi.

275
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,916
I believe I said I wouldn't
talk to you anymore, didn't I?

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,791
Well, yeah,
but I just thought.

277
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,166
Oh crap.

278
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,333
Excuse me?

279
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,083
I've had too much.
My head's all fuzzy...

280
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:19,166
It's getting dark.
I'm over. Nice knowing you.

281
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,708
What's that? Too much
what? Talk to me... Hello?

282
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,583
What have you--? You didn't go
and do anything stupid did you?

283
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,250
I'll be right there.

284
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,833
What a dork. He's gotta be
joking. As if I'd kill myself

285
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,916
because I couldn't
have Mr. Promise Keeper.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,541
Virgins are such
a pain in the ass.

287
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,208
Oh! Taisho Romance!

288
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,958
Jackpot! It's
a treasure trove!

289
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,958
I told you we had
a crap-ton of pictures of

290
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,166
old dead dudes
hanging everywhere.

291
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,333
Now are you ready to
come out of your shell

292
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,666
and help me with the
dress? We can do this.

293
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,708
Talk to me.

294
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,708
Please let me go home.

295
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,458
Why are you being so silly? My
brother's not here. I told you.

296
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,375
It's not him... it's--
I don't like the way I feel...

297
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,875
I get all heated
up over stuff and then

298
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,833
I go cold all of a sudden...

299
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,666
I'm sick of it.
Too confusing.

300
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,541
I want my life
just to be lukewarm.

301
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,583
Okay, here it is... I want
to take this jellyfish you drew

302
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:40,375
and make it real...
I want to see that... got it?

303
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,041
But why?

304
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,041
It's beautiful.

305
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,458
I am truly impressed!
And look...

306
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,291
another picture perfect room.

307
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,583
It's wonderful!

308
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Be careful.

309
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,541
I'm so sorry! I
got over-excited...

310
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,666
That's okay. It's totally
cute, right? I love it.

311
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,625
This room is divine! I wish I'd
brought Midoriko and the others!

312
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,833
I wonder... If I could somehow
give the feeling of that moment

313
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:14,750
in life, not just in a drawing,
but also in real life...

314
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,458
a shape, with
my own two hands...

315
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,291
Hey, Tsuki...

316
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,583
Jiji... Chieko...

317
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,208
Lend me your aid!

318
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,208
No!

319
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,875
Psych! In your face!
Were you scared?

320
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,083
'Cause these are
just my vitamins.

321
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,250
What?

322
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,458
Ow, hey, stop it! Ow, ah ow! Ah!

323
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,958
It was just a stupid joke
there's no reason to freak--

324
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,500
Wow hey, that
was awfully quick.

325
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,458
I, guess she was
dead. Your getaway car.

326
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,291
Take me to the
airport, please.

327
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,541
Skippin' town entirely?

328
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,000
Let's go. Now.

329
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,208
Yessir.

330
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,666
She wasn't dead, thank god.

331
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,416
I'm finished over here.

332
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,250
Okay, what about
over on this side?

333
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,958
Oh boy... I fell asleep.

334
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,125
These pearls are
beautiful, though, aren't they?

335
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,750
They're fakes but
they're high quality fakes.

336
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,875
I think I want a
little more down here.

337
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,208
That's... whoa...

338
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,458
All done.

339
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,333
We finally finished! The
day is saved thanks to...

340
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,750
The Sisterhood
Human Wave Attack!

341
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,250
Fine detail work always
gets to my shoulders!

342
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,375
I could get the Kita no Kuni
Kara DVD box set as my reward.

343
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,083
Oh my god, hot!

344
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,458
Yeah... the
Flower Hat Jelly's the

345
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,416
pop idol of
the jellyfish world.

346
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,291
I think the tentacles
came out really nicely, too.

347
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,125
Hey... can I... try it on?

348
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,916
Oh, yeah. Tsukimi
tore apart the necklace.

349
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,958
But uh, they are fakes, right?

350
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,708
Yeah no, they're real.
Probably worth a few million...

351
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,000
What?! Then each pearl
is at least ten thousand?!

352
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,541
I'm so sorry I broke
your necklace. I just--

353
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,166
I thought they looked perfect
for a jellyfish's tentacles

354
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,166
especially the ones on
a Flower Hat. I'm sorry.

355
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,416
It's okay.

356
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm sure it would make
my mom happy to see this...

357
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,208
She always
loved pretty dresses.

358
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,875
Mama... What if...
What if I were a girl?

359
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,250
I'll give you these, too...

360
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,083
I got them from your
papa a long time ago.

361
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,916
Yeah?

362
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,750
Sometimes I really
wish you were a girl.

363
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,208
Then your Papa
would understand better.

364
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,750
If only I'd been born as
the perfect little princess.

365
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:47,666
Maybe... maybe then I could
have stayed with my mom forever.

366
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,291
Never expected
we'd stay out all night.

367
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,833
Your fault again for not getting
out of the electric bath

368
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,625
in time for the last train.

369
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,666
Sorry! I just kinda figured
shock therapy would be

370
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,083
the best way to zap away

371
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,458
any Stylish juice
that got on us. Huh?

372
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,791
What's goin' on?

373
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:25,625
It's over! Baidi's been
conquered. It can't be!
