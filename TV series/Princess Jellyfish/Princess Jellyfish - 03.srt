1
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,750
Hey, Mom, it's Kuranosuke.

2
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,875
I've been having a
pretty good time lately.

3
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,916
You'll never guess
what I found nearby.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,458
An ivory tower filled with
maidens! Well, more like

5
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,958
an old co-op building
stuffed with girl-geeks...

6
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,416
Down but not out,

7
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,208
vowing at a press conference
earlier today that he will

8
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,791
give the task of
revitalizing Japan's economy,

9
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,833
quote, "One-hundred--"

10
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,750
Shu... your uncle is on his
way. Where's your brother?

11
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,125
I'll fetch him.

12
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:16,041
Ready yet, Kuranosuke? Hello?!

13
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,083
Well? How do I look?!

14
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,833
Check it out!

15
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,375
Kuranosuke... You do
know who's coming over

16
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,500
for lunch, do you not?

17
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,708
'Course I know. Do you think
I forgot? It's Uncle Saburota!

18
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,666
And you're meeting
him dressed like that?!

19
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,833
Yeah-- Why wouldn't I?
C'mon, they're gonna love it!

20
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,208
I went extra-busty for 'em!

21
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,750
Shu! Kuranosuke! Get
down here on the double!

22
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,250
'Kaaaaay!

23
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,416
Do you care to tell me...

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,375
what's going through
your head right now?

25
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,625
I am really at a loss here!
Soon as you're in college,

26
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,291
every single day it's
dresses and wigs and padding!

27
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh yeah! Let's
get ready to uncle!

28
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,666
Damn it.. He's already inside!

29
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,875
Where does he even
pick up this stuff?

30
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,416
Take that off!

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,083
Nah... I'm good! 'Sides, my
dressing up like this helped me

32
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,208
make a bunch of new friends.

33
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,625
The thing I believe in most
is the underlying strength

34
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,416
of my countrymen!

35
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,875
Seems they're running
these ads more and more.

36
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,666
Is there an election coming up?

37
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,750
How am I supposed to
believe in a prime minister

38
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,708
who's got that much
empty scalp? Forget us!

39
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,458
The thing you should
believe in most is a toupee!

40
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,875
He's got family
nearby doesn't he?

41
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,750
I already told you,
it's the Koibuchis!

42
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,958
Prime Minister Negishi
is Koibuchi's wife's brother.

43
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,791
They've been all over the TV.

44
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,500
Family's been
full of politicians

45
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,833
since back before
the war, even.

46
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,583
Tsukimi, what's the matter?!
Why is ectoplasm floating out

47
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,083
of your mouth like that?!

48
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,000
Thanks for coming,
I know you're busy.

49
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,458
Hey, Uncle! I saw
your commercial!

50
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,833
Brother dear wants to know
why I'm in Gaga mode lately?

51
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,500
Two reasons, basically.
Reason the first,

52
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,333
being a politician
would totally suck!

53
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,916
Nobody'll make me be one if they
all think I'm some sort of nut!

54
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,125
Mr. Excitement here can
follow in their footsteps,

55
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,416
leaving me to do
whatever I please!

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,250
Kura-poo! Oh! You are
just the cutest thing ever!

57
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,500
Hey... Kuranosuke's
pretty hot, huh.

58
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:42,333
Uh, yeah... Jus' don't forget
what he's packin' underneath...

59
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,000
My Kura-poo is... so...

60
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,458
Kuranosuke!
Stop that wiggling!

61
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,291
Aw... Dad! Don't
be such a square!

62
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,500
Me an' Unky are jus'
having a good time here!

63
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,333
Dear... stay calm!

64
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,000
If he were any cuter,
I would explode!

65
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,791
Get out of my
sight! No, not you!

66
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,666
That's more like it! Who
wants to waste a beautiful day

67
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,625
having lunch with a couple
of fogeys? Not this boy...

68
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,250
Today's look is especially
fetching, young sir.

69
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,750
Merci beaucoup!

70
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,333
Man, I'm impressed Shu
can even choke down his lunch

71
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,833
with all o' their droning
on about politics...

72
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,166
What's up?

73
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,750
We're still on for tonight
right, Kuranosuke?

74
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,666
Uh, maybe...?

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,083
The cosmetics showcase
in Shimokita? Duh!

76
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,416
Oh yeah...

77
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,000
So you're coming, right?

78
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,291
Hmm, nah. I'm out.

79
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,916
Why not? You got
something better planned?

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,833
Hanging out with them isn't as
fun as it used to be. I dunno...

81
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,000
All it ever is with them is
music and fashion and sex.

82
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,708
The clouds look
like jellyfish...

83
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,416
Y'know... listening to Tsukimi
geek out about jellyfish has

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,541
gotta be a hundred times more
interesting than all that stuff.

85
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,208
Wow! I'da never guessed
you have to take her out

86
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,666
of her tank
just to get her fed.

87
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,083
Speaking of... whaddya
feed her, anyway?

88
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,000
Uh... just cultured
zooplankton from the fish store.

89
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:33,500
Hey... can I ask you a question?
I mean, like, after this one?

90
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:38,791
But of course! Today is "French
Lolita meets '20s Flapper!"

91
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,250
No... it's about your fa--

92
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,125
Fangirl?

93
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,041
Uh... no... sorry...

94
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,250
I... heard that, your
family is kind of like,

95
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,041
important in politics...

96
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,166
What's that?

97
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,291
Oh. Hey, Meat.

98
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:57,000
Ya know... calling people
"Meat..." Not so polite.

99
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,958
Where's the beef? Get it,
Meat? Where's the beef, Meat?

100
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,458
Whoa! Banba! We're
having anmitsu today!

101
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,208
Get outta town! From where?!

102
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,375
This way! This way!
Chieko! Incoming!

103
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,625
That's right, Banba.
It's from Kinozen,

104
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,583
that dessert shop
you're so partial to!

105
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,666
Mayaya bought it for
us on her way home from

106
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,875
a Three Kingdoms
fan fic event!

107
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,250
Thirty-eight
hundred yen?! Pricey!

108
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,833
And there's Bavarian
Cream green tea!

109
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,666
Mind if I ask you
ladies something?

110
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,125
What do... you all
do for a living, anyway?

111
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,041
I mean, I'm just saying...

112
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,500
Plankton and
aquariums are expensive,

113
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:41,833
and the anmitsu at Kinozen
is like 700 yen a pop!

114
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,833
I thought maybe you
were students or something,

115
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,000
but none of you ever
seem to go to school...

116
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,333
Clara here! Number One on this
week's "Top Five Things You

117
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,291
Shouldn't Ask the Sisterhood!"

118
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,916
Kuranosuke's "What do you
all do for a living, anyway?"

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,500
Oh also, "how
old're all of you?"

120
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,791
Well aren't you
a nosy little wench!

121
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,916
As far as your first question
goes, we of the Sisterhood

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,750
have a perfectly respectable
income! And it's...

123
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,041
What?

124
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,916
Our allowances!

125
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,166
You... put on... your
game-face to say that?

126
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,833
We're kids of baby boomers. Our
parents lucked out and came of

127
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,875
age during the most prosperous
era in all of Japanese history.

128
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,083
We, on the other hand,
the baby-boomers' babies,

129
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,958
came onto the scene just in
time for the bubble to burst

130
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,291
and leave us idling in the
"Lost Decade." Not enough jobs

131
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,166
to go around and with us
all young and inexperienced,

132
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,666
of course we couldn't
earn enough to pay our bills!

133
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,583
And Mom and Dad were
like, "Mayaya, don't worry.

134
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,125
We'll cover your rent, dear!"

135
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,541
There's no shame in it! What
was I s'posed to do, say no?!

136
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,708
Mayaya... just stop! She
gets it! Everyone gets it!

137
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,750
Wait a sec!
You're boomer kids?!

138
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,750
That means you're
in your thirties, huh!

139
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,125
Asking a woman's
age is very rude!

140
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,708
Well... I'm eight.

141
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,583
Huh?!

142
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,875
Oh yes. Our Banba
was born in a leap year.

143
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,791
Yep. February 29th.
Been eight for a while now.

144
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,416
What you're saying is... This
is headquarters for a bunch of

145
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,750
jobless 30-something
NEET chicks with afros?

146
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,958
That is not what
we are saying at all!

147
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,416
We have jobs,
thank you very much!

148
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,000
I stuff envelopes from
the safety of my room.

149
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,500
Chieko sells homemade
clothes and stuff online.

150
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,083
E-commerce, yo.

151
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,458
Also, we"re assistants
to Ms. Juon Mejiro,

152
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,791
the popular
"Boys Love" manga-ka.

153
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,250
Furthermore, Chieko
has been chosen to

154
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,833
run the building and defend it

155
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,750
from all foes so her mother, our
landlady, can fly to Korea with

156
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,458
little-to-no advance
warning in pursuit

157
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,083
of her favorite actor, Bae!

158
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,041
Wait... that Bae?

159
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:54,916
Yes, that one!

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Fro's legit.

161
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,541
So you see... we
are all... definitely...

162
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,875
not a bunch... of NEETs!

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Man, they sure freaked out...
Thought Mayaya was gonna hit me!

164
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,625
Was what I said
really that bad?

165
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,916
Gee, ya think?

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,916
Sorry.

167
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,333
Hey, Tsukimi. What were
you going to ask me before?

168
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:24,375
Oh... that... I saw your brother
and dad, y'know, on TV...

169
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,083
Yeah! I can't change
channels quick enough.

170
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,291
And those neckties? Ugh...

171
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,333
So, um... how
come the son of

172
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:38,416
a big politician's
dressing... like that?

173
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,250
You wanna know?

174
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,208
Wow. I never saw it before...

175
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,583
Why don't we...
go back to my place?

176
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,708
Let's have some fun...

177
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,458
Huh?

178
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,666
Commercial Message!

179
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,958
Clara!

180
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,208
Are ya ready for more?!

181
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,500
Tequila!

182
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,833
You'll thank me for this!
It's time to free you

183
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,666
from those lifeless rags!

184
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,625
Let's comb that hair!

185
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,791
Tame that unibrow!
Shave those legs!

186
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,041
Reason the second for
dressing the way I do...

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,125
The world of
politics is so boring!

188
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,875
For me, it's
fashion or nothing!

189
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,083
Now! Make-up-ocalypse!

190
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,541
Kuranosuke? Are you
holed up in there?

191
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,458
Uncle's on his way home. Put
on some pants and come on ou---

192
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,125
Hey!

193
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,416
Get your ass back he-- uh!

194
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,541
Oops... Did I do that?!

195
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,208
Thanks again for your time.

196
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,750
Hang loose, Bro-in-law!

197
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,833
Another cutie-pie?! What're
you putting in the water?!

198
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,500
No! What'd he do to me?!
I can't look like this!

199
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,458
Get it off, get it off!
If the Sisterhood sees me all

200
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,250
dolled up and
looking like a Stylish,

201
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,916
they'll tie me up in the middle
of Ikebukuro and pelt me with

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,875
junk for being a
traitor to geekdom!

203
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:54,750
'Sup?

204
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,541
Kuranosuke! My makeup and outfit
don't work together at all!

205
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,083
Can you get over here ASAP?

206
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,416
Nah... I think I'll pass.

207
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,958
Say what?!

208
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,041
You guys just aren't enough
of a challenge for me anymore.

209
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,250
Huh?

210
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,375
I've realized something!
Polishing a diamond

211
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,541
in the rough
is tons more fun!

212
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,958
What? My jewelry
isn't the issue here!

213
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,458
Looks like it's go-time, Mom.
I'm gonna put my skills

214
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:20,791
to the test! Deep down,
all women want to be pretty...

215
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,083
even those freaky spinsters
over at Chez Otaku.

216
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:29,166
Every girl is born a princess.
Some of 'em just forget is all.

217
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,625
Well, Mom... I was wrong
about that boy I met...

218
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,958
He's no princess.
He's a wicked witch!

219
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,333
Why would he
pick on me like this?

220
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:43,166
I never did a thing to him!
"Hey, let's slap a dress on

221
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,583
the awkward girl!"
What a laugh, right?

222
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,041
Oh good. Coast is clear.

223
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,916
Among men, Lu Bu!
Among horses, Red Hare!

224
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,458
And among honored women!
Poor departed Banba! Huh?

225
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,833
Chieko, come quick!
Zombie twelve o'clock!

226
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,416
It wants to knock us
down and eat our brains!

227
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,666
Clara!

228
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,666
What's all the fuss about? Good
lord, girl, that face of yours!

229
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,041
You look like a
Chinese hopping vampire!

230
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,750
She totally does.

231
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,333
Oh, so that's jus' cosplay!
Why didn't you say so?!

232
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,375
Gonna getcha!

233
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,666
She's on the prowl!
My jugular is off-limits!

234
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,916
It's my blood
an' I'm keeping it!

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,541
That's right,
you hop up there!

236
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,916
Hey! Bring me some garlic!

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,333
I am gonna clove
the crap outta you!

238
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,833
Uh, Mayaya... you're
on Banba's hair. Yoo-hoo?

239
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,875
That was close!

240
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,541
Please tell me I still
have that old pair of

241
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,416
glasses with
the cracked lens.

242
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,833
Please please please!

243
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,125
Yay for high-school glasses...

244
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,416
Whoa. Vampire's right!

245
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,500
What a spaz that
girl is. Ran outta here

246
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,541
without her
glasses and sweats...

247
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,958
Kuranosuke... I...
wanted to ask you about...

248
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:28,875
Uh... well... what're your
thoughts on... the new...

249
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,083
i-increase in the sales tax?

250
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,000
It's bad?

251
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,083
Ah.

252
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,166
Hi again...

253
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,958
Yeah hi...! What?!

254
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:44,041
That friend of yours,
the girl who just ran off...

255
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,541
D'you... know her
from school or somesuch?

256
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,291
Ooh! You like her?!

257
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,875
So you noticed a chick?!
Our little Shu's all growsed up!

258
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,166
What?! No! I'm just
making conversation!

259
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,666
I could introduce ya!

260
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,083
For the low, low price
of my mom's address.

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,916
You know where,
don't you. So, cough it up.

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,291
C'mon... I just want to see her.

263
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,625
Look, as I've told you before.
I haven't the faintest idea.

264
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,250
Not that it matters, but...

265
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,541
she's a virgin!

266
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,583
And, you know...
such a sweet girl.

267
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,333
You just don't find that
kind of innocence anymore.

268
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,458
AKA socially awkward!

269
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,916
She loves the fine arts.

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,541
She loves drawing jellyfish.

271
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,208
She's a lady,
through and through.

272
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,375
High priestess of otakudom.

273
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,916
I think... she'd be a
great wife for a politician.

274
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,041
A wife...

275
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,833
And she lives real close! In
that retro building that looks

276
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,583
straight outta the '20s.

277
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,250
Yes, I know it. The
Amamizu-kan on Block 3.

278
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:53,250
Oh wow, Mr. Diet Secretary.
You know your neighborhood!

279
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,708
Well, the area's being
considered for redevelop--

280
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,791
She forgot these when she
left. Glasses and sweats.

281
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,375
Go on! Take 'em
back to her, big boy!

282
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,875
While she's still dolled up!

283
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,875
I can write it down if ya
want, but her name's Tsukimi.

284
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,208
"Tsukimi..." "Tsukimi..."

285
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,500
Here we are.

286
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,416
Oh my! It's Kuranosuke's
dashing older brother!

287
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,250
Believe these are yours.

288
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,583
You came all this way
just to give these back?

289
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,916
Care to join me for some
tea? It's the least I can do!

290
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,583
I'll admit... I've been
hoping for a chance to

291
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,833
talk to you for some time.

292
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,208
As have I.

293
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,041
Noooooooooo!

294
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,333
Game over, vamp!

295
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,208
Bloodsucker, be gone!

296
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,541
Huh? Kuranosuke's brother?!
Didn't... Didn't I just

297
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,875
run past him earlier?
What's he doing here?!

298
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,041
You came all this way
just to drop these off?!

299
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,666
Thank you... you really...
shouldn't have!

300
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,291
Uh... those belong
to a lady named Tsukimi?

301
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,333
I'm told she lives here?

302
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,958
Yeah. That's right! Thanks
so much for dropping by!

303
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,541
Hey, girls! I made
us some Dokudami tea!

304
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,333
All right! Dokudami tea!
That's gonna hit the spot!

305
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,125
Here comes the snack
train! All aboard, you guys!

306
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,291
Also, I picked up Rakuten
Market's Number One

307
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,375
rated sweet,
green tea roll-cake!

308
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,916
Yeah! Epic om-noms!
Target lock!

309
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,458
Banba needs cake! Banba
needs cake! Banba needs cake!

310
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,291
Last one to the green
tea roll-cake's a rotten egg!

311
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,041
What just happened?

312
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,125
Say, who was that shady looking
fellow in the suit out front?

313
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,958
Door-to-door salesman, maybe?

314
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,791
What a dump.

315
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,458
The sooner we
tear that place down

316
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,583
for redevelopment,
the better.

317
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,208
If the flower hat
jelly's the flashy one...

318
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,916
the suave older
brother's none other than

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,333
our friend
Sanderia Malayensis!

320
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,416
Oh! What a match!

321
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,833
Hey, Clara? Kuranosuke
and his brother don't really

322
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,333
look all that related do they?

323
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:09,166
Well, Shu? How'd it go?
Mission accomplished?

324
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,958
The only women I
encountered there were

325
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,125
a bunch of creepy wackjobs.

326
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,375
One of 'em... had her
hair in braids, yeah?

327
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,833
Creepiest one of
the bunch, that one.

328
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,458
Damn... the magic wore off.

329
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,666
Be straight with me. Why do
you want to track down Lina?

330
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,583
I mean... your mother?

331
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,083
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna do anything to

332
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:37,916
make myself a political
liability. I just... wanna...

333
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,500
I wanna look in Mom's closet
again, like when I was a kid.

334
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,416
Mom... y'know how people
say that falling in love

335
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,541
makes a girl beautiful? Does it
mean if she never finds someone,

336
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:57,000
she'll be all grubby forever?
What about the Sisterhood?

337
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,125
They don't have boyfriends, but
they love Three Kingdoms stuff,

338
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,916
and trains, and dolls
with all of their hearts.

339
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,166
Today, when
his eyes met mine...

340
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,333
could I have been...
falling in...?

341
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,666
Don't even tell me
you used makeup remover,

342
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,208
'cause that's a damn lie!

343
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:18,916
Oh, Mom... who decided that
girls had to be pretty, anyhow?

344
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:24,666
I don't wanna be pretty!
I just wanna be me! Tsukimi!
