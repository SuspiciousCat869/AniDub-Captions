1
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,291
Hey Mom... So it's been
three months since I moved in

2
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,166
with the Sisterhood
here in Tokyo,

3
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,750
and I still haven't
blossomed into a princess.

4
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,375
But it doesn't
really matter because

5
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,916
life with them is pretty fun.

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,291
And a little weird.
I met someone.

7
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,833
From out of nowhere,
right in front of me

8
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:59,958
this very strong, very
beautiful, boy princess.

9
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,583
Tsukimi... are you awake?

10
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,208
Is everything okay in there?

11
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,875
Sure, of course! Sorry
I-I'm just in the middle of

12
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,750
a little issue right now...

13
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,541
Uh... Do you need
something from me?

14
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,583
I wanted to double check
that the jellyfish in

15
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,583
the bathtub is
all right for now.

16
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,500
Who's that?

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Hey--

18
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,375
Uh-- What's going on in there?

19
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:29,250
No one! I mean I'm fine! I'll...
I'll be down in a minute!

20
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,333
If you say so...
we'll see you downstairs.

21
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,625
This otaku hand actually
crossed into their world

22
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,791
and made contact with
the mouth of a Stylish...

23
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,458
Now it's all
sticky and sparkly...

24
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,625
I've been contaminated
with goo! What is it?!

25
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,666
It's only lip-gloss.

26
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,625
Of course I know its lip gloss!
Now please put your clothes

27
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,541
and wig back on before
somebody comes in here!

28
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,958
I am so freaking out...

29
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay... but, didn't you
leave the wig in the hall?

30
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
There it is!

31
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,416
What are we waiting for?

32
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,750
The bathroom's thataway, right?
I'll just go wash my face--

33
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,291
No!

34
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,666
Tsukimi!

35
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,458
It's an Emergency! Emergency!

36
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,541
Whatcha doing?

37
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,833
I couldn't stand the
dust anymore so... you know...

38
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,750
You have to come downstairs...
We have a situation!

39
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,416
Is it another applicant?

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,041
Uh-huh. A homosexual
couple this time.

41
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,541
Homosexual?

42
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,916
"Die in the field,
you receive no burial!"

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,458
Do they think just
because we're girls,

44
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,708
their super-gayness will
make us squeal with delight

45
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,750
to have them as roommates?!
Foolish homosexuals!

46
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,250
I don't care if they're gay
transvestite, wheelchair-bound,

47
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,125
homeless babies! A man is a man
and will never be allowed to

48
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,583
breathe the sweet air
of our sacred nunnery!

49
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,875
Not even Kong Ming himself!

50
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,083
Fair enough... I'll send a firm
but polite rejection letter 

51
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,458
so they'll
understand our rules.

52
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,041
And... send!

53
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,000
Hey... Who's that?

54
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,916
Yeah, 'cause I thought
Banba and Jiji said

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,916
they were going
to the front lines.

56
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,208
There, it's gone...
Probably just a cat.

57
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,416
A cat? We don't have one.

58
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,583
I know! It's Ms. Mejiro!

59
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,250
She always sleeps
during the day...

60
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,625
She'd turn to dust if she ever
stepped into a sunny hallway.

61
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,375
She even bought those really
expensive black-out curtains.

62
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,416
Yeah, that's it...
she's awake because

63
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,166
her deadline is coming up!

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,208
Ms. Mejiro would
never make so much noise

65
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,041
and she rarely showers...

66
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,708
It's bandits!

67
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,666
Guess we better
go take a look.

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,416
Let me do it, please!

69
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,791
This is a job for
the building manager.

70
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,708
Huh. That's strange,
there's nobody here.

71
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,875
I know we didn't imagine it.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,291
Whoa! That noise
came from Tsukimi's room!

73
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,458
I should be the one
to check it out then!

74
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,916
Hey... you came back.

75
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,708
He makes my eyes hurt.

76
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,958
Well? Was it bandits?

77
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,125
It's no one...

78
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,041
Here! Take your stupid wig.

79
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:08,333
This place is so cool! Who has
communal bathrooms anymore?

80
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,083
Everything about
this place is so retro!

81
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,625
Like I'm in a time
warp. I kinda like it.

82
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,708
Hey... do you mind
if I come back?

83
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,666
Yes. Actually I do.

84
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,500
'Kay. See ya' later!

85
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,541
I told you not to come back!

86
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,625
Hey, Mom... I did
something today that

87
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,875
I haven't done
since grade school.

88
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,458
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I spent all the money

89
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,041
you sent on a fish tank...

90
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,333
It must've been fourth
grade since I actually

91
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,625
talked to a man
that wasn't Dad.

92
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,166
Even if he was
dressed like a girl.

93
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,791
Bye, Dad.

94
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,208
A'right. What did all
of this jellyfish stuff

95
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,916
cost you for real?

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,041
About... twenty-thousand
yen, I think?

97
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,375
With that kind of
money, I could get

98
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,500
the Director's Cut "Grumpy
Old Men" DVD collection.

99
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,458
I could get that red
agate sash fastener I want...

100
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,666
"20,000 kilometer ride..."

101
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,666
Full set of Records of
the Three Kingdoms... used...

102
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,583
Awesome! A bold move, Tsukimi!

103
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,250
I have to say you're
as rash as Zhang Fei!

104
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,166
Yeah... and I've also blown
all my money for the month.

105
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,166
By the way, who was that
Stylish girl from last night?

106
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,583
Her? That was just
some stranger I met.

107
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,208
S-She ran into me on
the street, that's all.

108
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,833
But I saw her in the bathroom
watching the jellyfish.

109
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,583
Is that true, Tsukimi?

110
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,416
Well, yeah but you have to
consider she was the one who

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,375
saved Clara from certain
death by taking her out of

112
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,375
the tropical fish shop when
there was nobody else around

113
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,041
to help, and she may
be one of the Stylish

114
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,666
but she can certainly
kick butt when she needs to.

115
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,250
'Zat so? I like this girl.

116
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,708
In Three Kingdoms terms,
she's Zho-u Yu of Wu...

117
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,416
Oh, or maybe
Zha-o Yun of Shu...

118
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,875
If we don't stop her
now, she'll be making

119
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,041
Three Kingdoms analogies
until she passes out.

120
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,541
Yeah...

121
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,708
Oh, we've still got to go
shopping for the Hot-Pot Party.

122
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,333
That is today, isn't it?

123
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,791
It's our tradition
at Ama-mizu-kan to have

124
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,291
a big Hot-Pot Party once
a week. We all get together

125
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,083
and decide what to eat,
then everybody pitches in

126
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,583
what they can and
we all cook it together.

127
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,208
It's one of my
favorite things to do.

128
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,541
Dude! How come
nobody ever told me

129
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,416
they made
Three Kingdoms Chips!

130
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,875
It's a retro
pack of Big-1 gum!

131
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,833
You're mine!

132
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,375
It's Kong Ming!

133
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,875
Die a thousand deaths!

134
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,750
Mayaya, Banba, let's
go pick out some meat!

135
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,708
Red as the flags of Sun Quan's
army, with the white canals of

136
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:02,041
Guang-zhou throughout! This
is definitely Matsusaka beef!

137
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,625
I waaant!

138
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,750
It looks so good...

139
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,625
I hope I get to
taste it someday.

140
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,458
Don't make it worse... we can't
afford it. Come on, she's here!

141
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,083
The half-price sticker lady!

142
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:16,416
Everyday right at six o'clock...
Okay, quick! Banba Scope.

143
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,541
On it.

144
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,416
Clara here! Allow me to explain.
Banba was born with the

145
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,833
instinctive ability to pick
the best tasting meat by sight!

146
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,750
Right here and... there.

147
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,416
Understood! Come on, Tsukimi!

148
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,583
Right!

149
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,708
Two hundred grams
per person secured.

150
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,916
Yeah, but over
half of it is pork.

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,208
Hey. If the cow's no
good, always go with the pig.

152
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,833
Wow, so this place is
a vacant lot now too.

153
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,458
Seems like more and
more appear every day.

154
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,583
That's from a newer model.

155
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,250
I was out all night
partying again...

156
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,500
Hey... do you
mind if I come back?

157
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,625
"Dear Ms. Mejiro, hypothetically
speaking, if someone were to

158
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,958
bring a man
into Amamizu-kan..."

159
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,125
Ma'am! I humbly
request your guidance!

160
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,541
"What should her punishment be?
Please give me your opinion.

161
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,333
Sincerely, Tsukimi."

162
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,041
Thanks for the help.

163
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,500
Tsukimi, supper is ready!

164
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,541
Hey hon! Is your little
jelly-thing still alive?

165
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,791
Please Mom, what do I do?
I wanna live! I wanna live!

166
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,500
Commercial message!

167
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,958
Clara!

168
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,083
Now the other part!

169
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,166
Tequilla!

170
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,041
Mm, that is divine! Go on!

171
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,833
Put the other ingredients
in already, girls!

172
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,791
Let's go, in the pot!

173
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,708
Tsukimi, a word in
the hallway, please.

174
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,541
This is the bright spot of
the Sisterhood's whole week.

175
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,458
"It's the 8 o'clock
Hot-Pot Party!

176
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,916
Or Grilled Meat or
Naga-shi Somen or

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,541
Whatever We Can Afford in
the Summer" or did you forget!

178
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,166
What is that Stylish stranger
doing here ruining it?!

179
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,208
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

180
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,958
She said she wanted to come hang
out here but I have no idea why.

181
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,791
She did save Clara's
life so it's not like

182
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,708
I can just kick her out.

183
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,083
But that doesn't mean you have
to invite her to partake in

184
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,083
our sacred feast!
Everyone's turned to stone!

185
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,291
They can't even
hold their chopsticks!

186
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,250
Clara here once again! Tokyo
is a concrete desert wasteland

187
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,708
crawling with natural
enemies of the Sisterhood,

188
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,083
against which
they employ their

189
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,666
defensive powers
of petrifaction.

190
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,041
At first, if they come anywhere
within ten feet of a Stylish,

191
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,208
they automatically
become petrified.

192
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,583
Almost as if they're
stones on the roadside!

193
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,000
Second, if the enemy tries to
engage them, they pretend that

194
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,083
they don't notice it! But
they aren't really pretending.

195
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,416
The part of their brain that
"sees" goes into hibernation!

196
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,958
And third, should it come
to an actual enemy attack,

197
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,375
the brain freezes all
non-essential activity,

198
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,000
effectively shutting
down the temporal lobe.

199
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,708
Their brains are wiped clean.
When they finally wake up,

200
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,500
they get to fill in the
blanks with whatever they want!

201
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,791
Um... maybe if I can
talk to her she'll just

202
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,500
go home all on her own.

203
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,250
Uh, yeah could you?
The presence of

204
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,583
a female Stylish makes it so

205
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,000
none of us can even
think about chewing on meat.

206
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:24,041
"Female Stylish." Well at least
you got half of that right!

207
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,083
Clara!

208
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,708
This pork is pretty
tasty stuff, huh?

209
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,791
Yeah... meat... uh, yum.

210
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,958
Hey, what was your name again?

211
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,416
Uh... It's... Kurashita.

212
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
No, silly...

213
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,458
Tsukimi.

214
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,416
Oh, that's pretty.

215
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,916
Okay, Tsukimi...
Supper time! I'll serve.

216
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,750
So... friendly...

217
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,583
Is there anything
here you don't care for,

218
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,833
like garland
chrysanthemums or fennel?

219
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,291
I like it all.

220
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,416
Oh, good. You
can have mine then.

221
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,416
Who likes sweet herbs with
their savory? Not this boy!

222
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,666
"Boy?"

223
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,916
♪Oh boy! Oh boy! We're
gonna eat some fancy meat♪

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,125
♪and stuff tonight, Oh boy!
Dugga-dun! Hot Pot Party!♪

225
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,208
Oh! I never realized
you were so musical!

226
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,333
Aw yeah! Dinner and
a show at the Nunnery!

227
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,166
Well the song's not
doin' much for my appetite.

228
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,833
Be nice, Banba...

229
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,666
Oh yeah, I almost
forgot, how was your

230
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,916
streetcar ride the
other day, Banba?

231
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,875
I was on my way
to the butler café,

232
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,666
when I saw your hair
hanging out of the window...

233
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,166
If I see a retro car
on the Arakawa Line...

234
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,291
I can't stop myself
from going for a ride.

235
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,500
So, who did you go to
the butler café with?

236
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:48,166
Nobody... Can you believe it?
I ventured out by myself!

237
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,875
Retro train cars?
And Butler cafés?

238
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,625
I get it now... is everyone
who lives here a total otaku?

239
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,833
If you don't want me
homeless you have to leave!

240
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,166
What's the prob? I came
here as a girl so as long as

241
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,291
nobody finds out
we're cool, right?

242
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,416
Then you can't
call yourself a boy!

243
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,750
Boy... did I really say that?

244
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,375
You just did it again!

245
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,041
Why did you want to
come back here, anyway?

246
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,625
Duh! I told you I
wanted to hang out.

247
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,666
But why would you
want to hang out with us?

248
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,583
What a dumb question... Because
I wanted to see you, Tsukimi!

249
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,875
Because I wanted
to see you, Tsukimi!

250
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,291
Because I wanted
to see you, Tsukimi!

251
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,708
Because I wanted
to see you, Tsukimi!

252
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,250
Because I wanted
to see you, Tsukimi!

253
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,791
Because I wanted
to see you, Tsukimi!

254
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,583
Because I wanted
to see you, Tsukimi!

255
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,791
You still in there?

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,750
Marvelous, she's losing it.

257
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,125
Isn't our little
dinner lots of fun?

258
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,291
I thought you said you
were gonna get rid of her!

259
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,666
What the heck?

260
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,708
Mayaya, honey... Why
don't you try some meat, too?

261
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,250
"Mayaya... honey?!"

262
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,708
That's your name... isn't it?

263
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,250
What's with the gibberish
from the Stylish one?

264
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,125
Nobody would ever
call me "honey" like that

265
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,083
especially not one
from her tribe! Yeah right!

266
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,125
Like I buy that.

267
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,291
I could've sworn
I heard Tsukimi here

268
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,083
calling you that
yesterday... Jiji darling?

269
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,291
Don't try to tell
me you're full already?

270
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,583
You'll starve if you
eat like a little bird.

271
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,583
Actually it doesn't matter
whether you think I eat like

272
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,000
a little bird or
any other kind of animal.

273
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,250
You know it's quite rude to
just bust into people's lives

274
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,250
and start calling them
"honey" and act all nice.

275
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,375
That's different. Okay,
then, I'll just set it here.

276
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,708
It won't taste
good overcooked.

277
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,125
I'll go ahead and
put in the next batch!

278
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,500
Hold it.

279
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,041
Don't put Shirataki
noodles next to the meat.

280
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,500
Unless you want it
to be hard as a rock.

281
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,291
Banba wait...

282
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,708
I'll be in my room.

283
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,875
You too, Jiji?! Hold on!
Don't leave me here!

284
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,333
Okay, retreat!

285
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,750
Wha-- No, don't!

286
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,041
Awwww... Why'd
they all run off?

287
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,583
I'm sorry to have to say this...
But it's clear the ladies in

288
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,750
this house don't exactly
share your enthusiasm.

289
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:39,375
That is... and I'll say
this as plainly as I can...

290
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,458
There isn't anybody
here who has even the

291
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:45,041
slightest interest in
trying to be your friend.

292
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,791
My family manages this
building so I expect you to

293
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,791
listen to me very
carefully. Please.

294
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,083
Don't ever
come back here again.

295
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,458
Are you okay?

296
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,708
Sorry... I ruined everything.

297
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,833
I was really starting
to have a good time but

298
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,916
I guess I just
got carried away.

299
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,208
That's not it...
It's like we're...

300
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,875
like we're Shirataki
and meat, I guess...

301
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,208
How's that?

302
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,500
When you're around,
we literally turn to stone.

303
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,333
Could be biological.

304
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,625
What does that mean?

305
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,166
Never mind...

306
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,041
The thing is everybody
in my family is too busy to

307
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,000
bother eating together,
so I usually eat alone...

308
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,250
I've never had a meal like
that, with a bunch of people

309
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,875
who just enjoy
each other's company.

310
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,666
Make it sizzle Mama!
Make it sizzle!

311
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,458
You really like
that don't you, Tsukimi?

312
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,708
Yeah I know... It's been
a long time for me, too.

313
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,791
But you guys do that
all the time, don't you?

314
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,208
Well yeah, but that's
not what I'm trying to say.

315
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,291
When I was little...

316
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,041
My mom and dad and I ate lots
of meals together... but...

317
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,125
Where are you
from, originally?

318
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,791
Kagoshima.

319
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,208
Whoa, in Kyushu?! So
you're a Southern girl!

320
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,916
Sure am. I miss the cold
winters we used to get there,

321
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,750
especially when I smell
a hot-pot meal cooking.

322
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,541
It's hard sometimes...

323
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,291
Oh, I get it. Since you
moved to Tokyo you haven't

324
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,875
been able to visit them.

325
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:15,166
What? No, that's not it. It's
not 'cause Kagoshima is too far.

326
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,875
When I was little,
my mom would--

327
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,708
Oh Crap! There's a light
on in my old man's room!

328
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,916
He's usually never
home this time of night.

329
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,125
No! There's no way...
This is where you live?!

330
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,541
Kuranosuke!

331
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,333
Ugh, there you go
dressing like that again.

332
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,291
You know Dad's
here today, right?

333
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,916
I need a favor from
my brave big brother.

334
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,458
That Matsusaka beef,
the stuff we got yesterday?

335
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,500
It's still in
the fridge, isn't it?

336
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,416
Yes... but why
should I go get it?

337
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,250
Because, if you don't want
to, I'll have to go inside

338
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,541
and see if Dad
can get it for me.

339
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,708
Hide in the
bushes over there.

340
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,041
To think that the red of Sun
Quan's army now belongs to me!

341
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,625
The Banba Scope is
completely off the charts.

342
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,708
That proves its real Matsusaka.

343
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,875
Jeez the Sisterhood
seems almost proud of

344
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,000
their complete lack of shame.

345
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:28,083
It's my turn to cook!
Please eat as much as you want!

346
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,625
Okay!

347
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,250
Wah! The most delicious
meat in all the kingdoms!

348
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,416
We'll have to bring
some to Ms. Mejiro, too.

349
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,208
What about my meat?

350
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,666
He said he came 'cause
he wanted to see me.

351
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,500
Can you believe it Clara?

352
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,791
In response, the government held
emergency meetings to discuss

353
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,833
what should be done with
Diet members Ohno and Matsu.

354
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,750
There's Koibuchi again.

355
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,333
He's got a big mansion
somewhere near here.

356
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,208
Izzat so?

357
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,458
Ah! It can't be...

358
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,916
Well, Mom...

359
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,750
Tsukimi, the coffee!
You're spilling!

360
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,541
Thanks, big bro.
Catch you on the flipside!

361
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,000
You should try going
to school for a change.

362
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:24,500
Wait a minute! That expensive
meat... might've been a bribe!
