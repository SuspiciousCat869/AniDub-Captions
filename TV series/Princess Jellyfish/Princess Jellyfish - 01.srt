1
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:18,583
Look at that one, honey!
The long, flowing tentacles...

2
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,541
It's like the
snow-white lace on

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,208
the dress of a
princess, isn't it?

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,916
Tell ya what, Tsukimi. When
you grow up and get married,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,416
I'll make you a dress
just like these jellyfish.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,666
When I was little... There
was a jellyfish aquarium that

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,125
my mom used to
take me to visit.

8
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,750
I'm sorry, does
that sound weird?

9
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,500
When she saw the fluttering
frills on the jellyfish that

10
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,833
looked like a princess's
dress, Mom told me...

11
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,833
That's not weird, Mom. I would
love a jellyfish wedding dress!

12
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,250
They're so... pretty!

13
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,416
"When they grow up...
All little girls can

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,041
blossom into
beautiful princesses."

15
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,250
What? Dreaded Shibuya?!

16
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,833
Have you gone mad?
Shibuya, on a weekend?!

17
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,375
And you would
risk going there alone?

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,541
Oh, the horror! One time,
when I went there...

19
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:30,375
But still you insist on taking
this perilous journey, hah?!

20
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:35,375
Then live, Tsukimi! Please!
Come back to us alive!

21
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:12,250
Hi, Mom. Well, you were right.

22
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,166
It's been six months
already since I moved to

23
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,958
Tokyo to try and make
it as an illustrator.

24
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:22,208
Here, in this sprawling
spectacle of a metropolis,

25
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,291
there are lots of princesses.

26
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:29,666
But... I'm sorry, Mom. That's
where the bad news comes in.

27
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:36,750
I'm not sure where I went wrong,
but somewhere along the way,

28
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,041
instead of becoming
a beautiful princess...

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,541
Ho-Home... I'll just go home.

30
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:55,083
Somehow, I just
ended up being a freak.

31
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,000
Tsukimi has returned to us!

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,333
Tsukimi Kurashita,
age eighteen!

33
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,291
I have returned from
Shibuya alive and well!

34
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,916
Lady Tsukimi! Thank
goodness you're home safe!

35
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,958
Yeah so... Before I
could even make it to

36
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,416
the photo exhibit
at that "Parco" place,

37
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,583
I was hit with dizziness,
heart palpitations,

38
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,416
and shortness of breath, forcing
humbling and tearful retreat.

39
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
That happened to me too...

40
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,375
Ohhh! So even your great love
of jellyfish could not guide you

41
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,500
through that
maelstrom of madness!

42
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,958
You were right. I should
have just gone on a weekday.

43
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,666
The crowd at the
station was especially huge.

44
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,166
I had the same problem when I--

45
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,166
It's always been a
traffic hub. In the Sixties,

46
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,625
the old Tamagawa
streetcars were packed.

47
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,916
Cool.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,375
They carried me to
the station office one time

49
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,125
when I was
swooning from anemia.

50
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,250
Don't know whether
it's even worth

51
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,041
giving it another
shot tomorrow.

52
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,458
You reckless
lover of adventure!

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,708
I wouldn't do it,
Tsukimi. In fact, you were

54
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,750
lucky to make it
back alive this time.

55
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,750
So Mom... Even though I
didn't manage to blossom into

56
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,625
a beautiful princess...

57
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,291
I do have a really
fun life here in Tokyo.

58
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,583
It wasn't a total loss though.

59
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,750
I did manage to get the
things you all requested.

60
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,458
Oh! Joy!

61
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,958
Let's see... This is what you
were askin' about, right Banba?

62
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,500
Mmm... yeah.

63
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,333
I made some new friends online,
and about three months ago,

64
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,875
they invited me to move into

65
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,791
their communal
apartment building.

66
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,750
I've been living
here ever since.

67
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,750
All the residents are so nice.
Very considerate of each other.

68
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,375
And I'm happy to report
they're all a lot like me!

69
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,958
Okay, here you go, Mayaya,

70
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,416
straight from
Aki-habara Station.

71
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,625
Three Kingdoms
Mini-Figures, Akihabara-style!

72
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,333
I didn't open any of 'em.

73
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,875
Yep, they're all freaks.

74
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,666
Shee-AH-ho DOON!
Shee-AH-ho Yu-WAN! Tsao Tsao!

75
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,500
Welcome to the Nunnery,
honored warriors!

76
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,833
Kingdom of Wei in the house!

77
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,833
We've all got our
own different interests.

78
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,541
But like me, they're
all otaku to the core.

79
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,541
I'm so sorry! It got
all crumpled in the crowd.

80
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,083
And of course...
None of us have boyfriends.

81
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,416
Wish I could
see his rumply hair!

82
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,291
So we came up with a slightly
tongue-in-cheek nickname for us.

83
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,958
We call ourselves...

84
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,125
The Sisterhood.

85
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,666
Another email from
someone who wants to

86
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,583
live here at Ama-mizu-kan.

87
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,958
I wish they'd stop.
Yes, there's a vacancy,

88
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,041
but "if we don't know ya,
someone's gotta vouch for ya."

89
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,833
There've been a
lot of these, huh?

90
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,458
I guess the
Sisterhood community is

91
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,083
bigger than I realized.

92
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,916
And it's such a hassle to have
to turn down every single one.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,583
Maybe we should settle on some
rules to post for applicants.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,583
Times like this
call for one thing.

95
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,625
We must consult Ms. Mejiro!

96
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,500
Good plan! Why
don't you take care of

97
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,416
writing the note
this time, Mayaya?

98
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
I accept! Whoosh!

99
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,666
"More and more people
are asking to live here.

100
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,708
We'd like to post clear and
simple application requirements

101
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,416
on the community
home page, but..."

102
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,166
Sure. This'll work nicely.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,041
Most honored Ms. Mejiro!
We humbly request your wisdom!

104
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,875
Did I... see a bike
courier here this morning?

105
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,041
Yes... She just
made her deadline,

106
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,625
so she's most
likely relaxing today.

107
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,500
So, do you think she
might come out of her room?

108
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,333
She's anthropophobic
and nocturnal...

109
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,000
And as a best-selling
manga artist who

110
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,166
was called "the Grand
Dame of Boys' Love,"

111
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,916
her extremely rare days
off are devoted to sleeping.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,541
Yeah, I know, it's just I'd like
to at least see her sometime.

113
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,416
Iriomote wildcats.

114
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,791
What?!

115
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,708
Sightings of both are
just as rare. Mother made me

116
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,708
acting building
superintendent five years ago,

117
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,416
and even I've only seen her

118
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,791
barely a handful
of times since then.

119
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:08,958
Here it comes!

120
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,458
That's our Ms. Mejiro!

121
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,875
The last time my mom was
able to take me someplace...

122
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,375
it was to that same quiet little
jellyfish aquarium by the sea...

123
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,666
in our hometown of Kagoshima.

124
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,541
The snow-white jellyfish
we gazed at together were the

125
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,625
most beautiful things
my young eyes had ever seen,

126
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,916
and I was completely
enchanted by them.

127
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,625
Look, Mom! This one's
a Flower Hat Jelly!

128
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,833
See all the pretty colors?

129
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,375
This is a Spotted Jelly!

130
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,625
The book says that's cuz it
looks like a Spotted Octopus!

131
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,833
Wow! You've become
quite the expert, Tsukimi...

132
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,083
Yup! Oh! And check this out!
When you write out the

133
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,916
kanji for "jellyfish," it's
spelled "sea" and "moon."

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,666
But if you flip that to "moon"
and "sea," it spells "Tsukimi!"

135
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,166
Fess up, Mom! Did you
name me after a jellyfish?

136
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:16,166
Even I'm not silly enough
to name you after a jellyfish!

137
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,291
You know this story! I named
you "Tsukimi" because you were

138
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,625
born by the sea on a
night when the moon was

139
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,416
at its most beautiful.

140
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,833
Oh yeah, forgot!

141
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,458
So on those really lonely
days... those days when

142
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,166
I miss her the most...
I always go visit Clara.

143
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,208
Hi, Clara! How've you been?

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,333
Guess it's been a couple days!
Dang, you've got it good.

145
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,291
Wish I could float
around with you.

146
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,666
Oh... Hey, you've
got a new frie--

147
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,875
Is that... Is
that a Moon Jelly?

148
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,458
No! This is bad! I read
if you put a Spotted Jelly

149
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,791
and a Moon Jelly in
the same tank together,

150
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,250
the Spotted one
will weaken and die!

151
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,541
The shopkeeper must
not know! I have to te--

152
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,416
It's...!

153
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:23,416
It's... one of the
Stylish! And it's a boy!

154
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,833
We're doomed! I couldn't
talk to a Stylish boy even if

155
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:40,041
we were the last two
people on Earth! But...

156
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,500
Tsukimi! Please help me!

157
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,000
Clara?

158
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,625
Please Tsukimi!
You have to help me!

159
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,875
Clara!

160
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,791
Please hurry! I'm
freakin' dyin' over here!

161
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,791
Cuh-lara!

162
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,250
Tsukimi!

163
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,291
Claraaaaa!

164
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,708
Tsu-ki-mi!

165
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,583
Clara!

166
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,541
She stood up! She stood up!
Clara stood up! Clara stood up!

167
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:25,208
Yeah, what? Can't you see we're
like, closed... and stuff?

168
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,750
Over uh...
Over--tank--over--there...

169
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,041
Yeah?

170
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,916
In-in-the-Sp-Spotted
Jelly, w-w-with the tank,

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,625
a-and the M-Moon Jelly--?

172
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,791
Huh?

173
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,875
I'm certain you are aware
of the incredible intricacies

174
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,041
and difficulties involved
in raising jellyfish.

175
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,625
It is generally accepted among
breeders that if a Spotted Jelly

176
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,083
and a Moon Jelly are raised
together in such a small tank,

177
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,833
the Spotted Jelly, a member
of the order Rhizostomee-eye,

178
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,625
will become weakened
by the mucus secreted by

179
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,291
the Moon Jelly and die.
Honestly, why you would even...

180
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,416
Yeah, so... listen...
Boss'll be in tomorrow.

181
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,916
Thank you, come again!

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,416
Tomo--rrow--too--late!

183
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,916
Whoa! What the crap?!
Do I gotta call the cops?!

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,625
Leggo!

185
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,875
You hafta--

186
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,125
Back off! Dammitall...
I'm serious! Get! Out!

187
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,958
Crazy freakin' otaku!

188
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,083
Ooh... you okay, hon?

189
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,666
Excuse me! I just...

190
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,375
I couldn't believe it, Mom...
The person standing right there

191
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,208
in front of me...
She was a princess!

192
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,458
Commercial Message!

193
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,666
Clara!

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,208
Aaand we're back!

195
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,333
Tequila.

196
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,041
Lovers' quarrel?

197
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,625
No! Why would I ever go
out with someone like that?!

198
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,291
I don't even know this chick.

199
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,166
So what then,
you just knocked over

200
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,791
some girl you
"don't even know?"

201
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,208
Yeah well, she was
like, talking all crazy

202
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,000
and tryin' to
come up in here...

203
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,333
No... wait! I
just wanted him...

204
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,833
to transfer that
jellyfish to a different tank!

205
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,041
'Cause if he
doesn't soon, it'll die!

206
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,083
Die you say?

207
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,916
Yes! Die!

208
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,916
Why don't you just take it?

209
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:20,083
Give us that one. Hop to,
shop boy. What's the problem?

210
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,333
Well y'see, my boss...

211
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,791
You can just tell him
the poor thing died earlier!

212
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,541
If you don't do something,
that's what'll happen anyway.

213
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:35,250
Right? You said that it would
die soon? This... jelly-thing?

214
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:39,041
Huh? Uh, yes! It'll die!

215
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,125
It's... It's already
dead, if that helps!

216
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:48,416
Jellyfish sure need a
lot of stuff! Here I thought

217
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,750
all you had to do was
drop 'em in some water.

218
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,416
Yeah, I'm sorry...
I can pay you back

219
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,250
as soon as I
get home though.

220
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,083
No, forget about
it! This was fun!

221
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,125
That's what you call "fun?"

222
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,958
Which way?

223
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:17,041
Huh? Oh! Uh... this way!

224
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,541
Next stop is Shibuya. Change
here for the following lines:

225
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,250
Tokyu Toyoko, Den-en-toshi,
Keio Ino-kashira,

226
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,583
Hanzomon and
the Ginza Subway.

227
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,958
Oh! You have such a
lovely figure, Midoriko!

228
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,958
It looks perfect on you!

229
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,416
I shall not waste
my father's essence...

230
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,625
nor my mother's blood!

231
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,416
Curse you, Tsao Shing!

232
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,875
Oh, good! Nobody's up!

233
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,166
Oh! What a fabulous building!

234
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,291
Shh! Could you
please lower your voice!

235
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,291
How come? Do
you have a curfew?

236
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,833
No, but it-- it might
be bad if the other tenants

237
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,333
saw someone
like you in here...

238
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,833
What?!

239
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,541
Wait! No! I didn't mean it
like-- it's just-- you're like

240
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,708
a whole other
species from them.

241
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,916
Like from a
different world, I guess.

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,333
Ah, so you can
tell then, can you?

243
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,666
Sorry 'bout this, Clara...

244
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,041
I'll buy you a proper tank first
thing in the morning, 'kay?

245
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,416
Hey! She's swimming!

246
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,250
Oh, thank goodness.

247
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,916
So uh... I can't
thank you enough.

248
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,625
You're totally
like, Clara's savior.

249
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,541
"Savior's" a bit much.

250
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,833
Yeah... So, you see, um...

251
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,458
I'm real sorry to
hafta ask you this...

252
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,416
But... would you
mind going away now?

253
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,750
Go! Through
the window! Quick!

254
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,833
What? Way up there? No way.

255
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,166
Ack! One of the Stylish!

256
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,833
Oh gosh, no! Mayaya's
completely turned to stone!

257
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,041
C'mon! Snap out of it!

258
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,875
Who the heck is this
intruder woman, huh?! Ah!

259
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,166
There's a jellyfish
in the bathtub!

260
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,166
Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,250
Did you draw all these?
Pictures of jellyfish?

262
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,541
What's this one
that looks like beads?

263
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,166
That's a... Flower Hat Jelly.

264
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,166
And this one?

265
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,625
A Comb Jelly.

266
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,166
They sparkle.

267
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,833
Yes, although strictly
speaking, Comb Jellies are

268
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,041
actually ctenophores, not
cnidarians like true jellyfish.

269
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,458
The cilia in those lines
on their bodies reflect light

270
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,250
like glittering rainbows,
they're as beautiful as any--

271
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,791
Oh, this one's gorgeous!

272
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,083
It's like... it
reminds me of lace...

273
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,125
Snow-white lace.

274
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,000
Can I use this a sec?

275
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,333
I was out all night
partying again, I am so wiped.

276
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,333
Just a lil power nap, 'kay?

277
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,500
She's out?!

278
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,000
Woah! Shibuya? Now you would
venture to dreaded Shibuya?!

279
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,458
Yes. My favorite butler,
Tokiwazaka, is working today

280
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,583
only at their location there...

281
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,541
Where Tsukimi
was slain in battle!

282
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,375
Do you go to seek revenge?!

283
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,375
Do you go, even though I,
Guan Yu, warn you not to?!

284
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,458
I think I'll be fine...
just for the occasion--

285
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,166
In Shibuya... Those
power failures from the

286
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,250
Ginza Line's third
rail made everything crazy.

287
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,541
Just for the occasion--

288
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,541
Girls! What on earth
happened to the bathroom?

289
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,333
Just for the occasion...

290
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:58,083
I bought a whole bunch
of iron pills!

291
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,416
Oh, right... She passed
out here last night...

292
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,750
It's... a wig?

293
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,416
Now that think of it, I
remember reading the Stylish

294
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,958
are all into a wig fad lately.

295
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,541
Now that's a look
that'd turn people to stone!

296
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:55,833
Wow, Mom... I never
realized such beautiful people

297
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,791
like her existed.

298
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,875
Give us that one... Hop to,
shop boy! What's the problem?

299
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:05,708
She's tall, and fair-skinned,
with big, bright eyes...

300
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,208
Like some real-life
Barbie doll...

301
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:14,458
She's bold and brash,
using her beauty as a weapon.

302
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,458
Basically, the
complete opposite of me.

303
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,625
She actually did
grow up to be a princess.

304
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,000
S'a great wig, huh?

305
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,250
I'm so sorry! I don't--!

306
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:34,083
Found it online... For like,
12 thousand yen? 13 maybe?

307
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,791
Ah jeez... Sorry...
Didn't I tell ya last night?

308
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,250
Tsukimi!

309
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,791
Am-m-m-m-m-m...
Am-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m--

310
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:51,541
What's with all the
shoving? Yeah, I'm a man.

311
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,916
A-Are you a drag queen?

312
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,375
What? No! Cross-dressing's
just my hobby... I'm... normal.

313
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,833
"Normal?!" I'd say
you're anything but!

314
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,125
Anyhoo, bum
some makeup remover?

315
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,625
I fell asleep with this
on. My face is all... bleh!

316
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,583
I don't... I don't
own any such thing!

317
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,708
Wha-- You don't? Why not?

318
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,791
"W-Why not?" Well, you see...
I am not in the particular habit

319
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,375
of painting my
face in order to meet

320
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,083
archaic social standards
that have no bearing on--

321
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,666
You don't wear makeup at all?

322
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,625
No, no, I don't! Oh, but they
did put lipstick on me one time

323
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,583
when I graduated grade school!

324
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,000
What're you lookin' at?!

325
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,083
Waitaminit are
you a... virgin?

326
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,458
Clara here! Coming in
at Number One on this week's

327
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,416
"Top Five Things You Shouldn't
Ask the Sisterhood" is...

328
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,791
"Are you a virgin!"

329
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,083
Vuh... vuh...

330
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,958
Oh, I get it, that's why
you're so bent outta shape.

331
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,541
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna attack you.

332
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,708
Ah, bummer...
I guess soap it is.

333
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,375
Please do not
go out this door!

334
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,625
Why not? The sink's
out there, isn't it?

335
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,583
The point is you can't
go out there like that!

336
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,083
Please-please-please
put on some clothes!

337
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,250
And don't forget
your wig and lady bits!

338
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,083
Tsukimi! Are you awake?

339
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:20,541
Well Mom, I finally met
a princess here in Tokyo...

340
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:25,541
She's strong, and she's
beautiful... and she's a boy!
