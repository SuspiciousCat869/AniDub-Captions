1
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:46,000
What is this fierce attack that
has breached our castle walls?

2
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,958
We've been saying for a while
we need to fix this corner...

3
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,416
Right?

4
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,583
Check it out... looks like
the Metropolitan subway map.

5
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,833
Ho?

6
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,833
Huh?

7
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, Clara... You're
so lucky. Seriously.

8
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,458
No! No! No! I want to
forget! I want to forget!

9
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,333
I want to forget!
I want to forget!

10
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,041
Could it be
evil spirits again?

11
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,333
Any idea where
Chieko is hiding?

12
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,333
She's on the phone, I think...

13
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,458
Wha-What are
you trying to say?

14
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,916
I'm saying I decided
to sell the place.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,833
People have been trying to
get us to for years, you know.

16
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,416
This really looks like
the perfect opportunity.

17
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,916
When we finally close, I'm
going to use all the money to

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,708
become fluent in
Korean... in Korea!

19
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,291
But... Mother...

20
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,375
I'll leave it to you to inform
all the boarders, okay honey?

21
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,250
Just tell 'em,
"Amamizu-kan'll be gone

22
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,916
a year from now!
Sorry, girls."

23
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,375
But I thought...

24
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,125
If you'll please excuse me.

25
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,916
What's wrong Shu?
Are you finished already?

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,666
I'm sorry...
I'm just not hungry.

27
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,208
I'll bet he's just depressed
because he's still a virgin.

28
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,875
Still a virgin!

29
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,458
You're sure
you're all right?

30
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,583
That presentation
is today, isn't it?

31
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,625
Yes, sir. I'm just a bit
sleep-deprived this morning.

32
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,750
I was... up
late doing research.

33
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,416
A virgin has no business
doing research on the internet.

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
Vir-gin!

35
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:37,375
What's he lookin' up? Advice
on getting to first base?

36
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:42,166
"If she closes her eyes,
she's giving you the OK."

37
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,166
Nosebleed!

38
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,250
So gross!

39
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,916
Big ol' V-boy!

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,916
Kuranosuke,
what's the matter?

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
You haven't eaten a
bite of your food either.

42
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, yeah. I guess my
stomach's a little upset.

43
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,375
I should probably get going.

44
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,958
To class?

45
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,041
That'll work. If you'll excuse
me father, my books are waiting.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,041
Heaven's sake.

47
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,375
Suppose I should
go get ready too.

48
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,666
Now Shu... If they try to pin
you down, make sure to be vague

49
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,500
regarding your position on the
matter. Whenever you promote a

50
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,875
redevelopment project, you'll
always end up painted as

51
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,291
the villain, no matter
what the situation really is.

52
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,750
Do you understand?

53
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,041
Yes sir.

54
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:27,125
Mom, why does my chest feel
so tight? I'm so embarrassed

55
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,500
I don't want to remember any
of it, but somehow I always

56
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:35,125
catch myself thinking about
him. Each time, it feels as if

57
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,291
someone's wringing my
heart out like a wet rag.

58
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,250
I've never felt
pain like this before.

59
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:45,333
Don't tell me I'm starting
to... fall... in... in--

60
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,625
Yes!

61
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,041
Check it out.

62
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,416
This means war.

63
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,208
The power went out.

64
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,500
So this is it...

65
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,458
Not even Dong Zhuo would expect
an attack in all this rain!

66
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,333
I love the smell of fresh rain
on asphalt. It's all musty!

67
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,750
Stay strong. This is
our only shot, ladies.

68
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,291
Amamizu-kan's entire
future is at stake.

69
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:20,791
Right.

70
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,125
Then... into the fray we go!

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,750
I dunno. I've got a
bad feeling about this...

72
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,500
I think I'm gonna wait here.

73
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,750
Same with me.

74
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,666
Hey! Hold on! I'm not
gonna do this by myself!

75
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,083
Are you here for the
development presentation?

76
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,333
A career woman!

77
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,541
We're about to get started.
Why don't you all come in?

78
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,291
Are you okay?

79
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,583
Let Clara explain.
The Sisterhood has trouble

80
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,583
dealing with women
in business suits.

81
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,958
There are few things that stir
up their insecurities more.

82
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,583
Right this way. There's
plenty of room, please,

83
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,083
sit where you'd like.

84
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,166
Is that...?

85
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,500
Kuranosuke's brother's here.

86
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:12,166
Amamizu-kan's coven of witches
is here, but where's Tsumiki?

87
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,000
Hello she's right here, duh! I
guess Shu doesn't recognize her.

88
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,500
After all last time he saw
her she did have a little bit of

89
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:22,333
makeup on. Sheesh! Homo sapiens
can be really stupid sometimes!

90
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,208
Clara!

91
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,875
I... wanna go...

92
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,625
The atmosphere is
kind of unusual for us.

93
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,291
Boy, do we stick out.

94
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,875
I think she's
gonna talk to us.

95
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,041
Well... we've got a lot to get
through, so if you don't mind...

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,708
Don't be shy ladies.

97
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,250
Tsukimi, you have to save us!

98
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,458
Why?!

99
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh crap my heart!
I should say hello.

100
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,125
Huh... I...

101
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,416
Stop beating so fast, heart!

102
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,375
Sorry! I was rude the other day.

103
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,375
Guess she means
that weird zombie act.

104
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,916
Yeah, don't worry about it.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,208
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm so
glad you could all make it here,

106
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,833
especially with all the
rain we've been getting today.

107
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,625
I'll begin this presentation
on the Amamizu Area

108
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,541
Urban Renewal Plan
by introducing myself.

109
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,333
My name is Shoko Inari, and I'm
here as the representative

110
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,541
of Global City Create,
the firm spearheading this

111
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,000
ambitious project which
we are tentatively calling

112
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:25,208
"Amamizu: The City Reborn."
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

113
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,458
Tsukimi! Tsukimi!

114
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,833
I can sense a demon
standing behind that vixen.

115
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,875
She must be a servant
of the underworld!

116
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,625
Mayaya, be quiet!

117
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,250
Guy next to the
demon vixen's hot.

118
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,500
My switches are all
green on that one.

119
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,833
I can't believe you two would

120
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,458
turn traitors over
some sexy gray locks!

121
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,166
Don't you realize that man is
like Shun Yoo to her Tsao Tsao?!

122
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,291
Oh, was he an older man too?

123
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,541
Excuse me ladies...
in the fifth row?

124
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,333
Did you have a
question, or...?

125
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,041
Time again for the Sisterhood
Top Five! Number One in

126
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,583
"Things They Can't
Stand... Being stared at!"

127
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,000
We shall never forgive
that brazen demon-witch!

128
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,750
She talked to us... and right
in front of all those people...

129
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,375
How dare she humiliate
us like that! Never forget!

130
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,166
And, like I said,
never forgive!

131
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,250
It was your fault
for freaking out.

132
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,000
Hey, where'd Chieko go?

133
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,083
I guess we left her behind.

134
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,250
It is hard to
run in a kimono...

135
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,833
I'll go back and get her.

136
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,250
No, I should do it.
This is a job for

137
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,625
the lowest Sister
on the totem pole.

138
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,291
Are you sure?

139
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,000
Heck yeah!

140
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,375
Okay, let's take a ten minute
break. After that I'll take

141
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,583
any questions
you might have.

142
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,416
My purse.

143
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,375
Former Prime Minister
Koibuchi's son was in there.

144
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,458
Really? You don't miss
a thing. At least the fact

145
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,291
he's here means he'll
be supporting us... right?

146
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,041
You still have a lot
to learn, little man.

147
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,375
Negishi's numbers
are in single digits.

148
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,166
People've even started
calling to dissolve the Diet.

149
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,833
There's a chance Koibuchi'll
back the opposition just to

150
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,958
score support. That's
why his son is here.

151
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:34,666
To figure out which stance
is to their advantage. Got it?

152
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,250
Wait, don't tell
me you're gonna--?

153
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,583
Of course, you idiot. Why do you
think the company specifically

154
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:45,916
chose me for this project? Be
a dear and handle the Q and A.

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,125
What?!

156
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,208
Much better...

157
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:01,083
Oh, Mom, we can't
do anything right?

158
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,583
We got intimidated by that
beautiful career woman and

159
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,916
just ran away without
a single protest.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,375
That guy was there too. I'm sure
he thought we we're losers.

161
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,875
Today he was... He was like a
different person from the one

162
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,541
I met at the aquarium.
He completely ignored me.

163
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,125
He didn't even try
to talk to me at all.

164
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,625
Forget about talking, he
didn't even look at me once.

165
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,125
He didn't take his eyes off
that woman running the meeting

166
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,250
to even notice I existed.
My chest feels tight.

167
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:36,416
My throat is burning.
I think I'm... I'm...

168
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,625
I might be...

169
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,750
This could be it...

170
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,375
You are too sweet. I saw
the weather forecast for

171
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,958
today and I thought,

172
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,791
"I should bring an umbrella."
But then I got caught up with

173
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,291
the morning routine
and I guess I just forgot.

174
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,750
The other day I
was soaked to the bone

175
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:56,791
because of my silliness.

176
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,166
If I'm... If I'm
ever reincarnated...

177
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,208
I dont want to be a human.
Or a dog... or a even a cat.

178
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,250
Because they can
still be cute or ugly.

179
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,416
If I am ever reincarnated...
I want to be...

180
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,666
I want to be a jellyfish.

181
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,291
A jellyfish just...
rocking gently on the waves.

182
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,708
Finally! You're back!
Did everyone go out?

183
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,416
The place is locked,
and I can't get inside!

184
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,458
Hey, where's your umbrella?

185
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,500
Commercial Message!

186
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,833
Clara!

187
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,041
Now the other part!

188
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,375
Tequila!

189
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,708
Hey! What's
the matter with you?

190
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,208
Tsukimi, come on
out of there! Tsukimi!

191
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,041
I'm sorry, Mom. Why do I feel
so depressed all the time?

192
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:04,375
I know it's crazy,
but I just can't help it.

193
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,666
What happened at the
aquarium... it made me feel...

194
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,000
what it must be like
to be a normal girl with

195
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,708
a normal guy paying
attention to her...

196
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,458
Congratulations. Did
you "win" his umbrella?

197
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,291
Of course I did. No man
could bear to see me

198
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,250
go home without one
in a rain like this.

199
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:34,125
Your methods are classic,
but executed so flawlessly!

200
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,041
"Oh, I forgot my umbrella. Would
you mind letting me share?"

201
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,583
No one else is
using that one anymore.

202
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,833
Would you shut up? A guy
like that is only gonna

203
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,000
respond to the classics.
Now I have got to get out of

204
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,666
these wet things
A-SAP, so drive.

205
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,666
What? You're
calling him tonight?

206
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,166
When a man offers a courtesy
it's best to return the favor...

207
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,916
as soon as you can.

208
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,416
We're home.

209
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,625
Welcome back! Oh, goodness!
It's "Attack of the

210
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,750
Rain Soaked Zombie
Recycling Trash!"

211
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,375
It will be for real
if you don't tell me

212
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,375
what the heck you
think you're doing here!

213
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,583
Calm down. I thought
I'd come help out with the

214
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,125
Hot-Pot meal again. Can I
interest anybody in salmon?

215
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,291
Silence Style-stress!
We got bigger fish to fry!

216
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,291
We're exhausted from tonight's
redevelopment presentation!

217
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,083
Presentation? Hope you
didn't go dressed like that.

218
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,083
I'm surprised
they even let you in.

219
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,416
Our fashion choices are a
protected inalienable right.

220
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,583
They have nothing to
do with the redevelopment.

221
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,916
If you say so...
but nobody wants to

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,208
hear their recycling
get all indignant.

223
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,458
I can't breathe!

224
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,833
So... How'd it go?
Did you get to tell them

225
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,208
not to tear down Amamizukan?

226
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,583
Well, we're all cold from
the rain, so I think we should

227
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,166
just go take a nice, hot bath.

228
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,916
You can see the
streetcars from the window

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,458
of the bathhouse on Block 2.

230
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,750
I prefer Block 4. The clerk
there's a smoldering hottie.

231
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,166
I'll take that as a "no."

232
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,916
I see. That's why
Tsukimi is so sad.

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,291
I'm home.

234
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,833
Thank goodness you're here!

235
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,125
What took you so long?
Tsukimi said she was

236
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,583
going back to get you.

237
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,875
Yeah? Well, I
sure never saw her.

238
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,750
Tell us what happened?!

239
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,291
Were you able to turn that Vixen
into a whimpering troglodyte?

240
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,125
How could I do that? I
left maybe a couple minutes

241
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,791
after you guys did.

242
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,666
It's all over!

243
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, it doesn't matter. My mother
still has the final say on it.

244
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,916
Protesting is a waste of time.
Amamizukan will disappear...

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,958
worn away to nothingness
by the ravages of time...

246
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,416
With a new hotel here no one
will even remember this place...

247
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,750
I fear you're right.

248
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,458
We're just renters anyway.

249
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,041
You're just giving up then?

250
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,750
Okay girl, get out here!

251
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,791
That's enough! Come on out!

252
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,416
Tsukimi?! Can you hear me?

253
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,625
She's dead!

254
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,375
Dead? Who's dead?

255
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,791
Oh no...

256
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,291
Tsukimi... You
can't just give up!

257
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,416
That girl repeats herself.

258
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,583
Isn't this where you belong?!
The only place you've ever felt

259
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,500
it's okay to be yourself?!
This is no time to mope!

260
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,000
Does her voice
sound kind of low?

261
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,625
Yeah, pretty man-ish.

262
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,458
You girls don't have time to
sit around bummed out either.

263
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,166
Get your stupid butts
into that bath right now.

264
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,708
That bruise looks really bad...

265
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,583
And for the love of fashion
take off those filthy rags!

266
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,041
Really? Right now?
Ah yes, my umbrella.

267
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,208
I... suppose that's
all right. See you then.

268
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,708
I'm home!

269
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,791
Wig makes my head hot, clothes
are so tight I can't even

270
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,916
move in 'em... Ah,
I'll still be good if

271
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,541
I keep my bra stuffed
and the make-up nice.

272
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,500
Why're you being so loud?

273
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,791
Oh, hey bro.
You're back, that's great.

274
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,625
I'm gonna borrow
Hanamori and the car!

275
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,541
I'm sorry, but I have
somewhere I need to go.

276
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,833
What?! Then let
me hitch a ride, huh?

277
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,875
Drop me off at Amamizukan.

278
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,791
Amamizu--?

279
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,125
Can I ask you something?

280
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,583
Sure go ahead, as long
as we don't waste any time.

281
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,125
Are you certain
that girl Tsukimi

282
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,083
really lives in that building?

283
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,041
What? You're asking me now?

284
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,541
Only because I didn't see
her at the meeting tonight.

285
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,833
Wait... that's where
you were? At that meeting?

286
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,375
Yes, I was there.

287
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,416
You're consorting with
the enemy, aren't you?

288
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,916
And helping
them tear it down!

289
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,541
Well... not definitely at
this point, but it's possible.

290
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,708
Hey!

291
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,083
Oh, sir, you're too much!

292
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,500
You've been such a
stranger to me lately.

293
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,541
You're always saying we
should have lunch sometime,

294
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,958
so when are you
going to take me out?

295
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,958
This weekend sounds good.
Sure, that's no problem.

296
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,416
I'm a "lonely
single girl" so I don't

297
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,916
have anywhere to
go at night. Huh?

298
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,541
Where should we eat?

299
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,458
Oh! Mr. Kubota, thanks again
for taking me out the other day!

300
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,708
It was so, so, so
delish! I can see why

301
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,625
Michelin gave it two stars!

302
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,916
I'm willing to bet they'll give
you three next year for sure!

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,500
Honestly, all the restaurants
you open are just so... yeah?

304
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,458
You're going to open
another new one next year?!

305
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,708
Tomorrow? No can do and I
wish you'd quit dragging your

306
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,750
feet on this one. Have you
managed to convince your wife?

307
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,125
What's that? A hotel?
You booked a room?

308
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,875
Yeah sure, I'll meet
you there if you get her

309
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,500
to sign the damn forms.

310
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,708
Just get off your rear and sell
that passé kimono shop already.

311
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,125
Property values in the area
are going to plummet next year.

312
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,291
You bought me Chanel? I'll
get it next time I see you.

313
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,500
For now, close the
deal! Stupid old lech...

314
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,125
If I didn't know
better Miss Inari,

315
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,416
I'd say you sound
like a high-class escort.

316
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,750
Oh is that right? Is that
what you were telling that

317
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,041
bimbo in Section 3 about me?

318
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,208
All I said was I
was impressed how you

319
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,291
worked the bosses
at the company party.

320
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,875
You idiot. Saying I'm good at
a party is the same as saying

321
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,875
I close deals
between the sheets.

322
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,791
Oh. Yeah, sorry, my bad.

323
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,833
Women can be so vindictive
towards each other.

324
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,125
Shouldn't matter
since that's the way

325
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,750
you close all your deals.

326
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,583
I heard that!

327
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,916
I like public bathhouses...
but our little bath here

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,041
isn't half bad either!
Plus I get fresh clothes!

329
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,833
That's not what you
were wearing before?

330
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,625
What was that?

331
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,416
What?! What are
you... you can't!

332
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,375
That definitely sounded
like Mayaya getting taken down

333
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,958
with a one-armed shoulder throw.

334
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,041
Tsukimi! Go take a look.

335
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,333
W-Why does it have to be me? I
can't even watch a horror movie

336
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,500
without flipping
out and stuff.

337
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,416
What in the world is
happening to her in there?!

338
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,916
Hundred yen says she's dead.

339
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,583
Do something, Tsukimi!

340
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,916
W-Well...?

341
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,916
Is it the grateful crane
from that old fairy tale?

342
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,583
It's a strange woman
I've never seen before.

343
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,625
No way.

344
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,750
It can't be.

345
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,250
Nicole Richie style.

346
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,125
So...?

347
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,666
Uh. Nicole Richie?

348
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,708
No idea. Could be
the style of pants?

349
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,333
Sean Connery's not my type.

350
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,791
If we're talking "rack
railways" it's the Shin-Etsu--

351
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,208
She's Lionel Richie's daughter!
Paris Hilton's ex-B.F.F.?

352
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,916
Your homework
is to Google her.

353
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,416
Listen... You need to
understand how drastically

354
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,125
clothing can change a person.
Now the last thing I want is

355
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,750
for you to be untrue to
yourselves, or heaven forbid,

356
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,666
become Stylish for once...
But you have to realize

357
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,000
you can't fight
in those clothes!

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,708
To do battle, you have to dress
for battle. You have to get

359
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,750
the people who judge by
appearances to stand up

360
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,125
and take notice or you'll
never even have a chance!

361
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,333
It's really not
difficult to do.

362
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,708
All of you are capable
with the proper motivation!

363
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:40,166
Come on. Put on
your battle armor.

364
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,541
Okay, Mom, why do you
think he goes through

365
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,625
so much trouble for us?

366
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,208
You don't think he and his
brother are just teaming up

367
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,583
to play some horrible
joke on me, do you?

368
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,625
No, I know that's just
me being too self-conscious.

369
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,083
But for some reason...
before he showed up

370
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,666
and started doing his
thing my heart felt so heavy

371
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,583
and painful, and now
it's suddenly lighter...

372
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:06,583
This hair!

373
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,583
Hey, that hurts.

374
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,250
Fine, then!
Afro... I seal thee!

375
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,125
Before he showed up and started
doing his thing, my heart felt

376
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,833
so heavy and painful, and
now it's suddenly lighter.

377
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:24,958
Somehow, I'm finally
starting to feel... happy!
