1
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:40,750
Chic!

2
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,250
Cool.

3
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,791
Alright, next! I'm on a roll!
You there! Breakfast Club!

4
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,291
What the heck's
your name, again?

5
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,916
 A-Are you talking... to me?

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Here, put this on!
And these capris too!

7
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:54,916
I don't--

8
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,041
It was plenty dry already.

9
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,458
These things have
more uses than just drying!

10
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,375
Tsukimi! In the bath, now!

11
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,750
Wha-- I get a makeover too?

12
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,833
We're all dressing up today!

13
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:13,083
You're all getting my
signature before-and-after!

14
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,083
So sorry! And you
came all this way...

15
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,125
I can't thank you enough!
It was a big help.

16
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,333
Thank you for returning it.

17
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,458
Say, are you free right now?

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,833
I owe you a drink as my
thanks for the umbrella.

19
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,750
So uh, might I ask why I'm the
only one still dressed the same?

20
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,000
No need to change! You look
great the way you are!

21
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,375
Really, it's just a
simple matter of framing.

22
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,583
Uhh... explain "framing."

23
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,708
Hi everyone! This is
Clara's Style Check Corner!

24
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,208
Here we see Chieko alongside
the "before" Sisterhood...

25
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,708
Surrounded by a panther,
a Three Kingdoms geek,

26
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,583
an Afro-headed train geek,
and a jellyfish geek.

27
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,458
You can tell right away
she's a traditional-dress geek!

28
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,958
But, presto! Can you
believe your eyes, folks?!

29
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,916
With Tsukimi and the
others looking all Stylish,

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,166
Chieko looks like a
celebrity who wears a kimono

31
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,833
just 'cause she can afford it!
There's "framing" in a nutshell!

32
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,583
And that's all for
Today's Style Check Corner!

33
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,458
You see? For all
intents and purposes,

34
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,458
your "before" is your "after."

35
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,333
Oh! How nice! Not
sure if I should feel

36
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,958
flattered or left out.

37
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,083
Don't worry about it. Next time
you'll get the full treatment.

38
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,375
No, no, I wasn't really
fishing for a makeover.

39
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:42,625
Okay! Who's ready for a
little "after dark teatime?"

40
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,916
But we... we have plenty of
dokudami tea right inside, so...

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,833
Don't be silly! I didn't get
us all gussied up for nothing!

42
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,208
Let me take you
to this great café.

43
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,291
No! Not a café!

44
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,625
And Number One with
a bullet on this week's

45
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,708
"Words that Make the
Sisterhood's Hearts Stop..."

46
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,458
You guessed it! "Café!"

47
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,875
Oh! Mayaya!

48
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,083
Villain! What'd you
put in my shoes?!

49
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,000
Untwist your panties.
They're spike heels.

50
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,875
What?! You spiked my
heels with leeches?!

51
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,291
They're all wibbly-wobbly!

52
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,625
That's ridiculous! Your
ankles are all wibbly-wobbly!

53
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,791
I'm gonna change
into normal shoes.

54
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,958
Yeah me too.

55
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,666
Nope! Wrong way!
No woman is properly armed

56
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,583
without her high heels!
They say "style starts

57
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,166
from the feet up," right?

58
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,541
Sure, they may hurt a
little, but you have to learn

59
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,541
to get used to them.
If you let the enemy

60
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,541
see you fall during battle,
you'll look like doofuses!

61
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,583
Yeah, so, you keep using words
like "enemy" and "battle."

62
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you
planning to do exactly?

63
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,833
I told you! I'm gonna stop them
from tearing down Amamizu-kan!

64
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:56,708
"Stop them?" But how, though?
What will you do to stop them?

65
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,375
I haven't thought
of that part yet!

66
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,916
There's no plan?!
Insolent wench!

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,375
Disembowel yourself
in apology to Kong Ming!

68
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,500
It'll be fine, trust me! If
we all put our heads together,

69
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,666
I'm sure we'll come up with a
brilliant strategy in no time!

70
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,708
Today we prepare
for that moment!

71
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:20,041
It's like... cosplay
training for war!

72
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,125
Hey, Meat... You
totally just pulled that

73
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,208
out of your butt, didn't you?

74
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,250
A speech so hollow
would stun even Lü Bu!

75
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,291
This cannot be
easily forgiven! Hwaa!

76
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,583
Quiet, you! And Mama
didn't name her boy "Meat!"

77
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,375
"Boy?"

78
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,833
♪Oh boy! Got ourselves
all dressed up!♪

79
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,125
♪Gonna go get some tea!♪

80
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,916
Whatever! Just shut
up and come on!

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,625
And if you fall down, you
get right back up, got it?!

82
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,708
I think of "redevelopment" as
a "reexamination" of the role

83
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,583
we want our
precious land to play.

84
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:59,291
Though, of course, that's just
my own personal opinion on it.

85
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,166
I'll admit, the Amamizu
Station area is lacking some of

86
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,875
the features I'd
like to see there.

87
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:09,208
Exactly! There's virtually
no luxury space there at all.

88
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,041
'Scuse me a moment.

89
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,458
Take all the time you need.

90
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,291
Hello, Father...
Yes. I'm speaking with

91
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,833
that developer we discussed.

92
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,916
That's right. I'm just gathering
information at this point.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,041
I apologize.

94
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,250
No need.

95
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,791
So, Mr. Koibuchi.
Do you hold your liquor?

96
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,916
As well as the
next man, I suppose.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,916
But with your
position to think of,

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,416
I don't imagine you
let yourself get drunk.

99
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,875
After all,
you're "Koibuchi Junior,

100
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,208
Up-and-Coming
Politician," right?

101
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,666
Oh, gosh. No I'm still
just my father's flunky.

102
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,625
And these days,
second-gen Diet members

103
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,666
aren't too highly-regarded.

104
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,666
An' 'ere's the factions
within the ruling party

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,458
at each other's throats...

106
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:10,250
Sho bashic'ly... right
now the polillical shfere'ss

107
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,583
a lillel bit...
Huh? Plollickti--?

108
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,291
You don't look well!
My place, then?

109
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,375
Wow! You're like
the Buddhas of Bamiyan.

110
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,750
Wait, more like
Mount Hush-more!

111
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,416
Come on girls, try and relax.

112
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,291
No go, huh? Drinks
to start? Order whatever

113
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,916
looks good to you!
Ah, still no go?

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,625
They serve cocktails
here! Nope. No go.

115
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,833
It's all good, you know.
Look at yourselves up there!

116
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,583
You're not out of place
at all. You're fabulous!

117
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,833
So stop freaking
out and enjoy it.

118
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,250
You can simply act like
you're drinking tea back home.

119
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,041
But there's no
dokudami tea here!

120
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,333
Mayaya's sensitive to the
cold, she needs her dokudami

121
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,333
before she can get to sleep.

122
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,041
I've been getting
awful chills lately, too.

123
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,083
Excuse me!

124
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,416
Yes?

125
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,750
What drinks would be
good to warm us all up?

126
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,958
Well, milk tea with
ginger is a good choice.

127
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,708
Or we have several
hot dessert cocktails.

128
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,458
Listen to her
and her "milk tea!"

129
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,958
It's just hot
ginger water with

130
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,625
maybe a drop of cream! Stuff
gives me goose bumps anyway.

131
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,166
Ack! By the three kings!
Eight hundred yen?!

132
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,000
They're trying
to rip us off, man.

133
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,791
Round of the milk teas for
the table. Oh, and how about

134
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,500
a sampler of those
dessert cocktails too.

135
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,333
Uh y'know, I think I'll try
this green tea cocktail here.

136
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:54,791
This looks delicious!
Caramel par-- "par-fate?"

137
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,416
What is that, some ritzy
way of spelling "parfay?"

138
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,166
Order one and find out.

139
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,166
But it's so expensive.

140
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,833
I've got gold! The
whole night's on me girls,

141
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,291
so go ahead and
order anything you want!

142
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,958
One clubhouse sandwich
please! And one pasta with

143
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,041
prawns in pink sauce!

144
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,500
Who is this
"Bagna Càuda" person?!

145
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,041
Well? Tsukimi?

146
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:21,666
Oh! Um... I'll have one of these
"Margherita" pizzas, please.

147
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:31,291
Oh, goodness. Maybe that mickey
was just a touch too effective.

148
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,875
What a cute face.
My new wallpaper.

149
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,041
Whoopsie!

150
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,333
And say cheese!

151
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,500
Ugh, this lighting is
terrible! There's a shadow

152
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,125
right across my
face! Delete! Delete!

153
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,458
Kill the overhead...
this one on... Good!

154
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,958
Ack, no! Now it's too dark!
'Kay switch to nighttime mode...

155
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,625
keep my hand still,
hold my breath.

156
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,291
Oh no, don't you
move! Just sleep...

157
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,666
Sleep like the dead
kings of ancient Egypt!

158
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,500
Yes, yes, there's a good boy.
Now then, time to dig in.

159
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,625
Time to dig in!

160
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,916
Oh, it does taste like par-fay!

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,958
Mm-mm! Raw meat!

162
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,250
It's prosciutto.

163
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,625
There... there are
actual grains in this bread!

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,833
Oh, wow! I love it!
It's so sweet!

165
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh gosh! The way she's
blowing on her drink!

166
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,791
It's... it's cute!

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,416
Bagna! Bagna-Bagna!
Bagna! Ban--

168
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:50,958
Whoa, the Kaiji limited
express! Ah! The Chuo Line.

169
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,750
Now I know where we are!

170
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,416
Excuse me, could we switch
to a table on the terrace?

171
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,083
Breathtaking...

172
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,375
Look! A Mitsu-501!

173
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:14,916
What a view! Mine eyes do see
the burning capital of Luoyang,

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,291
set ablaze by Dong Zhuo!

175
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,875
You don't say.

176
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,291
Yep, I knew it! They love it!

177
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,250
Looks like they've
finally started to rela--

178
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:38,208
The moon tonight looks...
just like a Moon Jelly.

179
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,875
It's almost like
we're underwater!

180
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,916
Dammit! That was freakin' cute!
You can't gaze all dreamily

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,958
into the night sky
with your eyes all sparkly

182
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,375
and say it looks
like we're underwater!

183
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,291
That's cheating, dammit!

184
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,000
Hey, whaddaya doin'?!
Quit bangin' on the stall!

185
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,625
I'm terribly sorry!

186
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,875
Ha ha ha ha!
Burn it to the ground!

187
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,500
Good morning!

188
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,458
Commercial message!

189
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,708
Clara!

190
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,083
And, we're back!

191
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,166
Tequila.

192
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,208
What's wrong?
Still trashed, honey?

193
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,041
Something to drink?

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,833
I have mineral water.

195
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,125
May I have my clothes, please.

196
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:09,041
Sparkling all right?
The bubbles used to get to me,

197
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,166
but on my trip to Italy
I learned to love it!

198
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,166
May I have my clothes please.

199
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,250
Look at this! It's a photo
of the trip to Paris I took

200
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,916
last year with my
oldest BFF, Yoko!

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,458
My clothes. May
I please have them?

202
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:26,875
Tokyo is a city with as many
stars as its people have dreams,

203
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,125
and as much neon light
as its people have despair,

204
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,458
don't you think?

205
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,666
Goodness, going home already?

206
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,833
I'm sorry if I burdened
you. Have a good night now.

207
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,041
Wait a minute,
you forgot your pants!

208
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,166
You'd forget your head
if wasn't screwed on.

209
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,041
You were great, by the way.

210
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,166
Seems we've got
amazing chemistry.

211
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,166
Well that's a first.
Knocked on my backside.

212
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,208
I have to say, it was
most gracious of you to

213
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,666
buy a sandwich
for Ms. Mejiro too!

214
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,375
It was nothing.

215
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,416
Luoyang Fire!

216
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,291
Hey, Meat! Buy me that
raw ham again anytime!

217
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,208
It's called prosciutto! And
stop calling me "Meat!"

218
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,375
I have a perfectly
good name, it's Kura--

219
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,708
"Kura?"

220
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:34,000
Um right! It's uh...
Sorry, it's... Kura-ko...?

221
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,583
Oh god! That is the
fakest-sounding name ever!

222
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,416
Kurako-Kurako-Haaa!

223
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,125
It sounds so old-world Japanese!

224
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,625
Sounds like a
locomotive crankin' up.

225
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,125
They bought it!

226
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,666
That's me! I'm
Kurako! Right, Tsukimi?

227
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,708
Oh, I wish you
could've seen it, Clara.

228
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,666
It was amazing tonight,
just like a moon jelly!

229
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,166
O-Oh God, the barf-tastic act
of talking to a jellyfish is

230
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,666
looking cute to
me for some reason!

231
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,958
I ate so much my
pants are gonna burst.

232
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,416
Oh! My achin' foot!

233
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,250
I just walked home
without my shoes.

234
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,791
Hey would ya
look at the time!

235
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,500
You're leaving?
Good night. Thanks again.

236
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,583
Ugh! I think I have
to burn my coolness card!

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,625
Kura-poo! Welcome home!
From Hollywood... Here's Uncle!

238
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,250
Hey, Unc. I didn't
know you were gonna be here.

239
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,458
Don't you have too much on
your plate to be visiting us?

240
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,750
I'm here because there's
too much on my plate!

241
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,958
Unless your papa
saves my sweet patootie,

242
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,708
I'll be in deep doo-doo!

243
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,041
Boo-hoo!

244
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,833
Kuranosuke! How many
times do I have to tell you?

245
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,500
Don't show your face in
front of me dressed like that!

246
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,375
Yeah. Sorry 'bout that!

247
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,166
Tastes great! Less filling!

248
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,708
Uncle, what are you doing?!
I'll take you to court!

249
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,958
No, no, Kura-poo,
you've got it all wrong!

250
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,500
I'm done with my private
chat with your papa,

251
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,666
so now it's your turn.

252
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,000
What?

253
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,166
Someone told you about
what happened to Shu-Shu?

254
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,125
What "happened" to him?

255
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,458
I mean, that is why you called
me the other day, right?

256
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,416
Fishing for dirt on
his history with women?

257
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,416
Nah, I just figured
you might know something

258
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,083
about his seeming
lack of love life.

259
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,791
Hey, would you
look at the time...

260
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,541
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
You can't start that story

261
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,875
and just leave. Finish it!

262
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,500
Ah! Oh, Kura-poo! Naughty boy!
Now no one will want me...

263
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,791
Get back here, Baldy!

264
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,541
Oh! My poor virgin eyes!
I'll never be the same!

265
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,916
Dammit! Where'd he go?!

266
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,291
Uh, brother dear?
Wow get a load of you!

267
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,083
You're like a chick in a bad
TV movie who just got molested!

268
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,208
"Molested?"

269
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,416
Crap! He's gettin' away!

270
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:22,625
Is that it? Have I
just been... molested?

271
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,166
Hanamori! I need the car--!

272
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,083
No touching!

273
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,291
Right! Right, sorry,
I see that you're waxing.

274
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,791
Which means...

275
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,166
This needs ten full hours
to dry. It's quite impossible

276
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,208
for me to take you
anywhere right now.

277
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,041
Cryin' out loud!

278
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,083
Hey, Uncle, why'd
you run away, huh?!

279
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,000
Finish your story!
Spill the beans already!

280
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,375
I'll never get
to sleep like this!

281
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,333
I tried to get Hanamori to
go after you in the car, y'know!

282
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:59,333
Seriously! Huh?
Hanamori? Yeah, he's here.

283
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,291
Hanamori...

284
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,666
No touching.

285
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,500
Uncle just told me if I
wanted to know why Shu's got

286
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,958
such a phobia of women,
I should ask you about it.

287
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,875
There are some things...

288
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,166
you're just better
off not knowing.

289
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,000
That's a load of
crap and you know it!

290
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,458
If you don't tell, I'll
plaster my hands all over

291
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,041
your shiny, shiny hood! Eh?

292
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,000
There is a perfectly good
reason for Shu's woman phobia.

293
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,583
Whoa, not even one second!

294
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,833
It all stems back to something
that happened 21 years ago,

295
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,375
when he was only nine.
Your father took Shu to

296
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,625
the theater to
see a musical...

297
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,916
Where he saw your father... and
your mother, Lina... Together.

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,500
Hanamori? I know it's late.
Could you run me somewhere?

299
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:01,166
It won't come off! No matter
how many times I wash my face

300
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,625
and my hair, this
stuff won't come off!

301
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,083
Good grief. Sounds like
we're out of soap and shampoo.

302
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,208
Tsukimi, could you run
to the Iwahashi drug store

303
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,666
and pick up some more?

304
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,958
Roger!

305
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,875
Be back in a few, ladies!

306
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,833
I'm sorry to come so
late, and dressed like this.

307
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,708
Could I ask you
to shake my hand?

308
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,625
Thank you for your time.

309
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,583
Sorry again for the
hour. Have a good night.

310
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,875
What? Wait, what?!

311
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,500
Shu, I'm afraid I've messed up.

312
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,958
I told Kuranosuke
about your trauma.

313
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,833
I'm sorry. I found myself
in an impossible predicament...

314
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,083
Uh, oh, I see. Okay.

315
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:20,166
Well, I suppose you have
always had your... weakness.

316
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,750
I am sorry.

317
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:30,250
Father! Father, where
did you go? We have to

318
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,041
hurry back home...
Mother is waiting for us!

319
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,625
She said we have
to come home early,

320
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,166
'cause we're having
sukiyaki for dinner.

321
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,916
It's your favorite.

322
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,291
Father?

323
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,708
That's some... heavy stuff.

324
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:01,708
Oh no, we didn't do anything...
But he thinks we did.

325
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,375
Hook, line n' sinker!
Yeah no, it's perfect.

326
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,958
Pictures, the whole nine!

327
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,333
He was so flustered that
he left something behind,

328
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,625
so when I go return it,
I'll use my rad moves

329
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,791
and wrap him
'round my finger.

330
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:19,583
What? My slang is
too dated? The 80's?!

331
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,458
'Nother crack like
that and you're toast!

332
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,250
What... just happened...?
