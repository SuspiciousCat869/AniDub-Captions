00:00:09.593 --> 00:00:12.554
[VASH]
So this is a space colony?

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.431
[REM]
That's right, Vash.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:18.519
We left Earth 200 years ago
in search of a new home.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.772
[KNIVES] Like a Western.
Life on the frontier!

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:22.856
[VASH]
Huh?

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:24.816
[KNIVES] You know, where
cowboys fight for justice

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.569
and beat the bad guys?
Heh. Bang, bang!

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.447
That kinda stuff
just isn't for me.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.451
And here we are.
Look you, two.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:36.370
Project SEEDS means hope.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.665
A future for humans
and plants alike.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.875
[VASH] How come we're the only
ones that can live outside

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.419
the bubble tank thing?

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.298
[REM] Nobody can say for sure,
but my theory is that

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.051
you're a bridge between
plants and humanity.

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:55.055
I believe God sent you here to
help us figure each other out.

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:56.848
[KNIVES]
We're like angels.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.727
[VASH] I wonder if we can
get along with humans.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.145
[REM]
Don't worry.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.857
No matter what may happen,
I'll protect you boys.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.775
[KNIVES, VASH gasp]

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:08.527
I promise you.

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.906
[KNIVES] The arms of an
Independent shall carry

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:16.034
this broken world
into a new order!

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.996
Behold the genesis of paradise!

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.706
[RADIO HOST] This is a
Satellite News Flash from

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.417
November Public Broadcasting!

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.378
The unknown object that sprouted
up out of nowhere in central

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.756
JuLai earlier tonight
has engulfed the city!

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:33.260
[WOLFWOOD sighs]
So this is how it ends.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:35.554
[CONRAD]
Knives made it.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.347
He's on the other
side of the gate.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.224
[MERYL]
The other side of the gate?

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.226
[CONRAD] The higher plane
contains dimensions

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.604
mankind cannot possibly fathom.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:47.149
What we do know is that
there he can reach the core.

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:54.323
[CONRAD] This will allow him
to artificially impregnate

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.326
the plants, thus creating
new independents.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.245
They'll be born much
like he and Vash were.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.541
[CONRAD] The final step in
the creation of his new world

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.418
is to eradicate mankind.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.419
[MERYL gasps]

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:11.590
So you're saying that if his
plan works out, we'll all die?

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.009
C'mon, Vash! Wake up, already!

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:16.720
There's no point.
That's not who you knew.

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:19.473
Vash the Stampede is no more.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:21.850
[CONRAD]
Accept it.

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:26.146
The gate is open and being
sustained by his power.

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:29.524
The only way you could close
it now would be to destroy it.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.445
To do that,
you'd have to kill Vash.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.280
No way.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:36.698
Finally...

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.829
[KNIVES]
I can feel it!

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:49.127
This power has lain dormant
inside you, but now they'll see!

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.963
[MALE SOLDIER A] JuLai
requesting immediate backup

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.507

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:54.466
[MALE SOLDIER B]
Any ideas?

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:55.425
[MALE SOLDIER C]
I got nothing!

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:56.927
[MALE SOLDIER D]
It's not stopping!

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.944
[ZAZIE]
Oh, you're not going to run?

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.738
At this rate, the twins will
take the whole planet.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.240
[WOLFWOOD]
Well, look at that.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.450
Not everyday
I see you flustered.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.202
Your big plan didn't work out?

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:24.454
[ZAZIE scoffs]
Poor little human.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.791
If you had a network like mine,
you wouldn't have to be worried

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:29.459
about your imminent demise.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.878
We aren't all blessed
to be a Worm.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.339
[ZAZIE]
Have a nice death, Punisher.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.302
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.229
[MERYL pants] The only...
one that can stop Knives is...

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:55.485

He's a plant, now.

don't mean a thing to him.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.164
Not anymore.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:11.334
But what's he doing?
What's he trying to start?

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:14.546

Don't you give up on me!

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:28.935
It's you, Vash! The only one who
can hope to stop him is you!

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.687

How pathetic.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.827
You'd let that parasite
feed off of you?

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:50.123
This power is ours alone.
No human can touch it!

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:54.252

Wake up! Please, Vash!

What's that song?

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.306
[VASH]
I don't really know.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.392
It just comes to me sometimes
and helps me calm down.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.978
I feel like I learned
it a long time ago.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.605

Hm?

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:15.816
[VASH]
Hey, Nai? Be honest.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.443
Do you think that we can
get along with humans?

Don't worry. Whatever happens,
I'll protect you.

Huh?

[VASH] Let go, Nai!
I can't hold it back anymore!

It'll destroy the planet,

I can't send you back.
There's no way!

[KNIVES] I'll use this energy

The humans will never understand
our Independence, Vash. Never!

They will only ever see
us as their slaves!

That isn't true!

A crowd has gathered at what was
once the mighty third city to

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.474
pay their respects to those who
weren't lucky enough to make it

out alive.

Hell, if I were the demon who
turned the city into a crater,

I would hide my face, too.
