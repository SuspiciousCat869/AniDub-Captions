with the people you love!

I don't need to eat
this junk, I told you.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.736
Hey! Stop whining!
I'm so hungry!

Some of us don't have to deal
with things as stupid as hunger.

This is such a waste.

whether you eat it or not.

was served a fair share.

Of course you're my accomplice!

[BRAD] Hey, there's a kid!
He looks alive!

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.901
[LUIDA]
I had a feeling.

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:20.654
But now I'm sure.
That's a plant reaction.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.365
[BRAD]
He looks like a kid to me.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.825
[VASH grunts]

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.036
An "Independent," huh?

[BRAD grunts]
What's that?

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.666
Plants are usually cloned
from an original cell,

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.709
but that's not the only
way they can form.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.921
On very rare occasions,
plants can give birth.

00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:41.299
[BRAD] Are you saying one plant
gave birth to another plant?

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.593
Geez.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.428
Does he pose any risk?

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.432
Shouldn't we toss him in a case
like the non-human looking ones?

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.852
[LUIDA]
Mm. Don't know. Not yet.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.478
[BRAD]
Wow, that's a first.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.397
Do you at least know
someone who does?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.898
[LUIDA] You could track
down one of the Sinners

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.693
in molecular plant studies
or their team lead, Conrad.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.820

It's still surprising, okay?

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.956

Hey, uh.

you were on before the crash?

Hm?

[VASH] What happened to it?
And what happened to Rem?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.262
Do you know?

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:35.312
[LUIDA] Officer Rem Saverem, on
duty at the time of the crash.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.689
Is she your friend?

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.442
Well, she raised us,
so she's more like a parent.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:41.484
Who is "us?"

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:42.903
Were there any
other Independents

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:43.904
aboard ship with you?

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:49.451
[gasps] Yeah. There was one,
but I bet he's dead now.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.162
[BRAD] So you ditched everyone
and ran off to save yourself?

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.205
What's wrong with you?
What a little shit.

You're going to scare him, Brad.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.294
[BRAD]
Boohoo. Brat's hiding something.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.464
How crazy are you?
Look at him. He's just a kid.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.382
I'll go look for Ship Five.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.218
I mean, it's been over 80
hours since the crash now.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.763
The chances anyone survived
don't seem likely.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:10.639
But who knows?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.267
If we could activate our gravity
plant in time, so could they.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.518
[LUIDA sighs]

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:20.398
[VASH]
Why did you bother saving me?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.858
Huh?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.819
I wanted to die out there.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.281
You understand how lucky you are
to have made it out, don't you?

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.116
We survivors can't
talk like that,

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:32.494
even if we think we mean it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.962
Let's talk about what we
can do starting now.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.052
[LUIDA]
What's your name?

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.345
Vash.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.764
Hey there, Vash.
I'm Luida Leitner.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:53.807
After the big crash,

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:57.102
I somehow wound up in charge
of good ol' Ship Three, here.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.103
[VASH]
Hm?

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.397
Now, let's talk about you.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.107
Since you're a
generator and all,

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.900
what kind of stuff
do you generate?

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:08.071
Electricity? Chemical compounds?
Maybe amino acids?

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:11.074
Sorry, no. I'm not
like other plants.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.702
I can't "generate"
anything at all.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:17.580
The other independent
could, though. Not me.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.874
All I do is eat,
drink, and sleep.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.712
[LUIDA] I see.
Sounds about like what I do.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.131
Earlier, you told me that
I'm lucky to be here

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.091
and to come up with
something to do.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:32.137
But there's nothing that
I can do. I've tried.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.596
[LUIDA]
Mm.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.778
[LUIDA] So Brad just
called in from Ship Five.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.739
He said he found
a few survivors,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.658
but no trace of your friend Rem.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.077
I'm sorry, but the
ship was in ruins.

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.996
It's safe to say she's--

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.461
You should know what
the survivors told us.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.838
That Rem held her post
'til the very end.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.174
She was trying to
stop the crash.

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:17.015
[LUIDA] Is this all you
could find of Rem's?

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:20.560
We spent two weeks under rubble
and corpses to find this stuff.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.520
The least you could
say is "Thanks."

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.482
Right, thanks.
You didn't find anything else?

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:29.944
We recovered the black box.
But not sure we can analyze it.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.571
It's pretty banged up.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:36.576
We also dug up this guy...
but it's trash, too.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.995
So, Ship Five was
completely destroyed,

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:43.083
and ours isn't looking great.
Sounds like we're stuck, huh?

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:46.503
Hey. How long are you planning
to keep that kid around?

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.381
[LUIDA]
The food not to your liking?

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:54.052
I'm not gonna eat it, okay?
So stop bringing stuff.

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:55.386
It's a waste.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.180
[LUIDA chuckles]
Oh, please.

you eat it or not, silly.

Believe in yourself.

There has to be something
special that only you can do.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:26.167
[VASH] I'm useless.
I can't do anything.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:28.628

[KNIVES] Don't scold me.
You're my accomplice.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.711
[KNIVES] You gave me the

[LUIDA]
He must've heard us.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.835
He's gotta be hiding a clue
about the other Independent

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.253
somewhere in here.

Hm?

00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:22.179
Find one?

Uh.

Thanks to everyone,

I was able to get back
on my feet again.

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:35.943
I consider all of you as family,

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:39.447
so I couldn't continue to lie.

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:41.323
I'm so sorry.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:46.162
[VASH] No matter how much
you want to forget the past,

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:48.789
there is no escape.

00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:51.041
It's time for me to face that.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.879
[VASH] An Independent
will make up

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.506
for what an
Independent has done.

00:20:57.548 --> 00:21:01.719
The last thing he wrote is,
"This is my atonement."

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.429
We have to go after him!

You can't stop me!

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.893
I won't try. When you find
the punk, tell him I'm sorry.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.311
I didn't mean what I said.

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:12.563
[gasps]

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:16.233
Just wait and tell him yourself.
I'm going to bring him home!
