[RADIO HOST A]
This just in.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.018
We've received an update
on the plant robberies

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.145
plaguing Noman's land.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.897
Trusted sources say
the stolen plants

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.400
are being transported
to a facility in JuLai.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.486
The JuLai government
denies involvement,

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.280
but the investigation into
the matter is ongoing.

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.491
So stay tuned for more updates!

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:11.757
[ZAZIE] Are humans going
to do more for my planet?

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.550
Or are plants?

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:15.886
Well, who should I let live?

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:18.180
I don't get you.
Whose side are you on?

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:22.559
[ZAZIE] You humans love putting
everything in pretty boxes.

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:27.773
We Worms don't take sides.
See, we are the planet!

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.151
[ZAZIE]
Here's what Knives told me.

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:35.989
Humans are too greedy to dream
of using plants correctly.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.785
More over, he thinks given
the chance, you'll devour them

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.121
just like you did with your
previous planet, Earth.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.415
You know about the
Last Run, don't you?

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.959
[ROBERTO sighs] That's what
Hundred Spoons has been

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.544
saving the red plants for?

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.798
[ZAZIE] It's either that
or let them go to waste!

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.133
So, humans or plants?

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.469
Who's gonna be better
for my planet?

00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.472
[MERYL] I know there's a lot we
need to change. But there's

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:03.642
already humans raising flora
to take the load off plants.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:06.937
[CONRAD]
You mean Luida. I'm familiar.

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:09.398
She's a geoplant specialist.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.942
It doesn't surprise me she's
pursuing her own way

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.944
of saving the human race.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.821
I am doing the same.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.574
[MERYL] You call this "saving?"
I'm not so sure I'm convinced.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.827
[CONRAD sighs]
Follow me.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.163
[ZAZIE]
Mm?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.793
[ROBERTO sighs]
Where are you going?

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.002
To find the truth.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.797
Ugh. Why don't you just
tape a "Kill Me" sign

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.382
on your back, Newbie?

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:37.217
[MERYL] C'mon, this is our
chance to find out what

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.010
Knives is really after.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.804
[ROBERTO groans]

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.891
[ZAZIE]
Aw, they were mine.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:51.440
[JULAI CITIZENS chattering]

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.152
I guess this is JuLai.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.487
Little different than
I remember it.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.744
[WOLFWOOD]
The third and largest city.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:07.456
It's basically a
fortified metropolis.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:11.835
But thanks to their monopoly
on water-producing plants,

00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:15.172
JuLai can buy all the
bullets she wants.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.050
[WOLFWOOD]
Too flashy for me.

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:31.980
[CHUCK LEE]
Huh?

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.195
--[CHUCK LEE] Huh?!
--[WOLFWOOD] You dipshit!

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.697
You! I remember you!

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.116
Hold it! Come back!

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.535
You can run,
but you can't hide!

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.249
[VASH, WOLFWOOD grunt]

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.879
[MALE SOLDIER B]
Don't move! Or I'll shoot!

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.675
Right there, now you
be good boys for me.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.260
[VASH chuckles]

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:05.055
Hey, take it easy there officer.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.390
Why don't you tell
us what we did?

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:08.767
[CHUCK LEE]
Don't act so innocent!

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.896
Your pal's the Humanoid Typhoon!
Here to destroy this city, too?

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:14.272
[MALE SOLDIER B]
I won't let you make JuLai

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.024
the next Jeneora Rock!

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:18.360
[VASH gasps]

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.029
Let's go. Don't shoot.

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.948
Not the time
or place, Blondie.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.367
[MALE SOLDIER B] My parents
lived in Jeneora Rock.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.577
They were there
when it happened!

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.539
You destroyed it.
How could you?

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.250
[MALE SOLDIER B whimpers]

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.751
[WOLFWOOD gasps]
Look alive!

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:37.587
--[gunshot]
--Hey! You okay?

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.090
[CHUCK LEE gasps]
I did not give that order!

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.675
[WOLFWOOD]
Oh, shut it, asshole!

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:42.634
[CHUCK LEE]
Okay!

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.718
[WOLFWOOD]
Tsk.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.095
[VASH]
Come on.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.013
[WOLFWOOD]
What the hell, man?

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:50.392
[WOLFWOOD]
Fine.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.726
[MALE SOLDIER B]
After them!

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.775
[CONRAD] No doubt the
flora impressed you.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:01.319
You must've thought it was
quite the breakthrough.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.821
[MERYL]
Well, yeah.

00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.031
[CONRAD] The issue with that
plan is the generations

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.700
it'll take to realize.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.036
It's a gamble when mankind's
hardly promised another day.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.706
[gasps]

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:16.793
Luida's ambitions are admirable,
and her beliefs hold truth.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.379
However, time's of the essence.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.173
And there's not enough
to change the world.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:27.262
Well, something's gotta
change, so what is it?

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:28.930
[CONRAD]
Humanity.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.565
[CONRAD]
Needing neither food nor water,

00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:41.318
and capable of withstanding
the desert heat,

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:44.571
my goal was a new breed of man.

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:47.616
[MERYL]
You'd operate on people here?

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.910
You've seen my work.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.661
E.G. the Mine.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.622
Monev the Gale.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:56.124
Livio the Double Fang.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.209
One more... Wolfwood.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.462
[MERYL gasps]
Our Wolfwood?

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:04.633
[CONRAD]
Indeed. Nicholas the Punisher.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.844
He, too, is my creation.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:14.059
You may have a death wish, but I
don't, so cool it, ya hear me?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.352
Sorry.

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:19.522
They put a human in front
of you, and you just freeze up.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.233
[VASH] I'm sorry,
but thanks, by the way.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.610
Huh?

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:25.904
Well, you didn't
kill them, did you?

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:26.780
[WOLFWOOD]
How could I?

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.115
You got shot and
ran for the hills.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.326
[chuckles]

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:35.413
Patch that up, Needle Noggin!
You pass out, I'm out, too.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.083
[VASH sighs]
Loud and clear.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.089
Holy...

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.592
[WOLFWOOD]
Those scars...

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.428
[laughing]
Yeah. How embarrassing.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.639
[WOLFWOOD]
Tsk.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:55.141
Your morality comes
at a price, I see.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.393
[VASH grunts]

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.561
I know how they treat you.

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.022
Look at yourself,
you're a monster.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:05.193
Whoever you don't scare to
death is disgusted by you.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:07.988
They hate you, yet you
take bullets for them.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.656
Makes no sense.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:15.036
My body moves before I
can even think about it.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.622
I can't leave anyone
in a tight spot.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.207
[WOLFWOOD grunts]

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:22.252
And that includes you.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.587
Well, I guess you
figured me out.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.589
[VASH, WOLFWOOD chuckle]

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.300
Just itching to sacrifice
yourself, huh?

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.845
Think that'd make us
little guys happy?

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.223
[MERYL]
How awful.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.599
They would've died.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:40.854
They were all either a victim
of illness or poverty.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:45.150
I saved them, in fact, and gave
purpose to their ordinary lives,

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.818
which had none.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.154
Please. You kidnapped
orphans and the sick

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.697
just to toy around with them.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:51.740
He's right, y'know.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:52.615
[CONRAD]
You're wrong.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.868
Nothing I did demeaned
them in any way!

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.453
Sheesh, relax.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:09:00.248
That stick's even further up
your ass than it looks.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.333
Drink up, Baldy.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.754
[sighs]
My surgeries helped.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:09.632
I made them stronger than
thought humanly possible.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.635
[CONRAD] But that was it.
They still got hungry.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:16.097
They still needed water.
Failures, all of them.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.475
[gasps]

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.560
[CONRAD] They were nothing
like the Independent plant,

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:24.314
"Millions Knives." Not at all.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:29.402
[CONRAD]
He is the ultimate life form.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.002
[CONRAD] If surgical
efforts are to no avail,

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.005
we must alter the
specimens before birth.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.258
So we did.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.385
Through my own study
of lab-grown clones

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.472
and the help of Knives,
we created this child.

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.266
[CONRAD]
Behold.

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:07.357
You've gotta let her go.

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:10.276
[CONRAD] You see, its power
level sits somewhere around

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.237
that of a supply gate.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.740
The child is neither
human nor plant.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.492
[MERYL] What do you
mean "before birth?"

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:20.995
These kids are born!
You can't keep them here!

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.374
[CONRAD] Please understand.
I'm not doing this for me.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.377
Everything that I've done has
been to ensure the future

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.754
--of mankind.
--[ROBERTO] Mm-hm.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.798
You're despicable.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.842
Then release me.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.470
Kill me here and now to
atone for my arrogance.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.431
You'll get your wish.
You'll save a few lives.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.684
But before you strike me down,

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:46.646
know that you're eliminating
a world of possibilities.

[CONRAD]
Both Knives and I,

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:54.112
we look further into the future
than others would dare.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.031
It's a rather lonely job.
But still, it must be done.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.284
[ROBERTO burps]

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.703
In order to create
a new human race,

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.997
I'd be willing to pay any price.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:07.250
If a twin dies, that will be
a tough loss we must take.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:11.921
You're not fooling me.
"Save humanity," eh?

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:15.133
If you aren't gonna save these
kids right in front of you,

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:18.011
you aren't gonna
save a damn thing.

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.637
Poor baby.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.641
[gasps]

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:28.146

[ROBERTO grunts]

[ELENDIRA]
That's why I hate humans.

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:50.585
You only ever judge based
on the parts you can see.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.378
[CONRAD]
Elendira! Stop, now!

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.463
Quiet!

[ROBERTO gasps]
Run like hell, newbie!

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.267
You gotta be kidding me.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.477
Now what did I tell you?

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.020
[MERYL]
I'm sorry!

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.689
[ROBERTO] Always dangling
our asses over a cliff!

[MERYL]
I'm sorry!

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.359
[ROBERTO] If worker's

getting skewered, expect a bill!

[ROBERTO]
That doctor's a freak show.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.125
This whole thing's a trap.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.127
They're trying to
lure Vash here.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.755
We've gotta let him know!

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.677

[gasps]
Huh? But how?

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:05.994
How could you kill
a poor baby like me?

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:08.955
The horror! The cruelty!

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.373
How could you?

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.959
See? Always judging
by the looks of things.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.878
You humans are all driven
by discrimination.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.422
You're a monster.

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:21.592
A monster? Should you be
pointing fingers, here?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:26.139
I don't think so.
The real monster is you!

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.560
Hang on, newbie.

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:33.271
Just survive until the
elevator gets here.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.522
Huh?

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.941
We're gonna run on
the count of three.

Yeah, well, the
feeling's mutual.

We're the same, you and I.

We are absolutely not!

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.050
Well, that's no good.

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.098
[ROBERTO]
Too close to the sun, huh?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.183

Oh, no!

[ROBERTO laughs]

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:39.814
I told you so. Knew it
wouldn't be the booze.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:43.025
Keep your paws to yourself.
It hurts bad enough.

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:45.069
I know. But the bleeding.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.823
[ROBERTO coughs]
Pass me that flask?

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:51.159
[MERYL] This is not the
time for that junk!

[ROBERTO grunts] Will you
ever get off my case?

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:59.125
It'd just go in one hole
and out the one in my gut.

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:05.882
It's me. I did this to you.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:08.134
[ROBERTO]
In a way.

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:13.473
I mean, you did limit my
smokin' and drinkin', so...

Not quite how I thought it'd go.
Head's too damn clear.

[ROBERTO]
Here, take it.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.653
And leave you?
I can't just take it and go!

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.739
You listen to me.

You're calling the shots
from here on out.

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.159

[thudding]

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:09.862
[MERYL]
I'm sorry.

00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:36.931
[WOLFWOOD]
Not wanting to kill anyone?

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:41.811
That's just a coward's idealism.
A kid could tell you that.

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:46.357
[WOLFWOOD]
The only reason we get to live

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:50.403
is because somebody else died.
That's the way of the world.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.782
[WOLFWOOD] I don't have the
luxury of thinking through

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.367
tough decisions.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.414
[WOLFWOOD]
I have to choose.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:05.376
To protect those dear to me,
and to protect myself.

00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:10.298
[WOLFWOOD] Protection is
my primary instinct.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.217
I do what I have to do.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.219
[VASH]
For the orphanage, you mean?

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:19.223
[WOLFWOOD]
No, Blondie, for your jumpy ass.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:24.020
You're so eager to die,
I doubted that we would make it.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.813
But, hey, here we are.

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:30.818
[VASH] Wolfwood.
Just wanted to say thank you.

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:18.532
[KNIVES] She was killed
in the early days.

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:21.619
I keep her here as a reminder.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.162
[VASH]
You've got to understand.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:26.082
The humans aren't exploiting
them because they want to.

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:29.460
[KNIVES sighs]
What did you come here for?

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.712
I'm taking their
plant back from you.

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:37.551
[VASH]
Not just that.

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.888
All the robberies were you,
weren't they? Admit it.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.390
It was you, Nai.

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.101
[KNIVES]
You'd dare accuse me?

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:48.688
All I've done is rescue our
brethren from the confines

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:50.022
of mankind's oppression.

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:52.149
[VASH]
Nai! They're not evil!

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.234
We can coexist, I know--

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:54.402
Silence!

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:55.945
[gasps]

00:19:55.986 --> 00:20:00.241
[KNIVES] Your staunch defense
of humanity is no act of love.

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:01.909
Huh?

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.828
It's an attempt to
make up for the crash

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.913
that you caused all
those years ago.

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.416
[gasps]

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.376
[CONRAD]
Your contract is complete.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:11.877
This is yours.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.546
[WOLFWOOD grunts]

00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:17.883
Risked my life, and all I get is
a crappy piece of paper?

00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:19.760
I'll never forgive it.

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:23.889
What you did to me,
and what you did to Livio.

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:28.436
[CONRAD]
Nicholas.

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:32.398
Do you now feel you're able
to lay down your cross?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.233
[WOLFWOOD]
I don't know, do you?

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.739
[sighs]

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.787
[CONRAD]
My stars! Nai?

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:50.082
You survived the Big Fall!
What great news!

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:51.751
It's a miracle!

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:53.836
[gasps]

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:57.506
What do we have here?
It's Count Lebnant Vasques.

00:20:57.548 --> 00:21:01.051
Or shall I call you Bill Conrad?

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.303
[CONRAD gasps]

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:06.056
You choose. Die and rot
in the trash heap

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.559
with the rest of
your pathetic kind,

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:12.813
or let the souls of the
Sinners atone through you.

00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:17.109
Your eyes, my boy. Forgive me.

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:21.697
What I've done to you...
can never be undone.

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:29.830
[CONRAD] I will atone
until the end of time.

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:32.166
[KNIVES] No matter how much
good you try to atone,

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.210
they'll never forgive you.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:37.505
No matter how much
you fool yourself,

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:41.258
in their eyes you will
always be a monster.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:46.597
[VASH sighs] I know humans make
sacrifices in order to survive,

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.350
but they're trying
to move forward.

00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:51.894
I want to believe in them.

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:56.440
I pity you, brother.
Your mind is not well.

00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:59.485
I will put you out
of your misery.

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:00.945

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:16.669
You're going to be born anew.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.212
I'm your future.

00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:21.298
You'll be the perfect
Independent like me.

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:24.885
Don't, Nai. Please!

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.019
[KNIVES]
All shall be even once more.
