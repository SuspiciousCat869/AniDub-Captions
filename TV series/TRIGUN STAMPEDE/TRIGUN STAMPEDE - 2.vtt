Hi, everybody. Morning.

[VASH gasps]

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:22.147
[AI VOICE A] This is a Level
E-three emergency...

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.732
[VASH]
Nai! Rem!

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.152
[REM]
Get in. Quickly.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.529
[VASH]
Hey!

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.905
[REM]
Getting to know you two...

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:32.324
...has meant the
whole world to me!

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.909
[VASH]
Please don't!

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:40.958
[VASH]
Rem, no!

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:52.761
[KNIVES laughs]

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:57.266
[KNIVES] I finally did it!
A brilliant success!

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.810
[laughs]

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.522
[KNIVES]
You're my accomplice.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.234
Vash?

[RADIO HOST B]
Wasteland is an understatement.

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.993
"Land" implies
something livable.

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.495
This pit's got no water, food...

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:21.248
If it weren't for plants,
our ancestors would've met God

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.750
long before they had a
chance to repopulate.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.210
Maybe they should have.

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.588
Can we call it a miracle
that we get to barely exist

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:28.505
in this hellscape?

00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:32.259
Or should we call it as it is:
an inheritance of bad luck.

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.177
Anyway, here's a tune.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.231
[RADIO HOST A]
Late last night,

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:13.151
two dangerous criminals
escaped the May City Prison!

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.488
These prisoners are known
as the Nebraska Family.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.658
They'd been incarcerated on
69 counts of manslaughter

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.619
and an additional 12 counts
of attempted murder.

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.121
[TOWNSMAN A]
May City?

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.831
[TOWNSMAN B]
Too close for comfort.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.291
Let me make sure
I'm following you.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.419
This mad man running
around stealing plants

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.671
and wreaking havoc
is in fact, not you.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:33.922
[VASH]
Mm-hm.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:35.590
Although, he does look like you.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.718
Because this guy's your
identical twin brother.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.802
[VASH]
Mm-hm.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:39.636
[MERYL grunts]

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.389
[ROBERTO sighs] You're saying
we've got ourselves

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.516
an evil twin scenario, huh?

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:46.560
That sounds a bit too
convenient for me.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.812
No tangible proof, though.

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.439
Gonna take more
than a pretty story

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.482
for us to stick our
necks out for ya.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.235
[VASH gasps, whimpers]

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:56.945
[MERYL]
Crying won't help your case.

[VASH sighs]

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.616
[ROBERTO] So, this mystery
brother, "Knives," of yours.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.745
What could a guy like him
possibly want with the plants?

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.873
[MERYL]
The money? Or is it about honor?

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.542
[ROBERTO] Nothing spurs
people like revenge.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.629
[ROBERTO]
Hm?

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.881
[MERYL yelps]

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.340
Hi there, kiddo.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.342
Those guys for me?

[TONIS grunts]

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:24.055
[VASH] Thank you, Tonis.
I'll keep your buddies safe.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.434
[MERYL chuckles] What a truly
heartwarming scene.

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.644
Please, you're not even looking.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:30.854
[MERYL]
Are the bugs gone?

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:31.813
Almost.

[ROSA]
Quit that, boy!

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.817
How many times do I have to tell
you not to bring your Worms

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.569
in here?

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.863
Mama loves you,
baby, now shoo!

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:42.616
You didn't have to do
that on my account...

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:43.909
[ROSA]
Sorry, Vash.

[MERYL yelps]

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.877
It's the cash, not you.

What the hell is going on here?

[MERYL]
Get off.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.319
[VASH] If you figure
it out, lemme know.

[grunting]

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.247
Are you a bad driver or
do you just want to die?

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.456
[SOLDIER A]
All the cars in these parts

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:14.875
are buckets of bolts.

Oh, boo! Well, my son can't
lose anymore braincells!

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.463
[SOLDIER A] If you wanted
a smoother ride,

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.716
you should've hit a
big city like July.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.759
[NEBRASKA]
You know, I think I will.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.678
Just as soon as
we poach this punk

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.306
and Papa rakes in his six milly!

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.893
He's quite the goon, with that
dumb, slack jawed look.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:37.814
We'll snatch him up in no time!
Won't we, Gofsef?

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:41.484
[grunts] Ugh. Why'd they
have to use this photo?

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.070
[ROBERTO]
That's your issue?

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.698
[TOWNSMAN A] So those journalist
folks are part of his gang?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.992
[TOWNSMAN C] Who cares.
Catch 'em either way.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:52.495
[TOWNSMAN A] Yeah, then we
can demand a higher bounty.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.998
[ROBERTO] And this is why
we don't save lost puppies.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.625
[MERYL]
Sorry.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.251
[ROBERTO] Hey, puppy,
this would be easier

00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.878
if you'd put up a fight.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.797
[VASH] Huh? Are you really in
the mood for a shoot-out?

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:03.673
Not me.

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:05.550
What's your deal?
Wait, let me guess.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.052
You forgot ammo.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.720
No, I even packed extra,

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.764
I would just prefer
not to use it.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.183
Bullets are pretty pricey,
you know.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.101
[MERYL] Yeah, and so is
paying for our bail!

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:19.064
I could buy one bullet or
two dozen donuts though!

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.231
We're as good as dead.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.609
C'mon, guys,
we're gonna live, okay?

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:25.487
All we gotta do is to get
our butts out of town.

[MERYL, ROBERTO]
Huh?

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.534

caught your guy.

Run them all over!

me go before we hit town!

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.053

Silence him, Gofsef.

drive this death trap?

this money is our last hope.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.571
[MERYL]
How can you be so cruel?

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.907
You would sacrifice the man
who saved your town twice?

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.367
It's heartless!

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.120
[ROSA] We're well
aware of that, missy.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:09:00.707
If it were just us here we
wouldn't do it, trust me.

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:03.460
But we have our children
to think about.

And I won't sit idly by while
our poor babies starve to death.

I'm sorry, Vash.
Spare me the blame.

I'll get drunk.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:01.218
[GOFSEF grunts, gasps]

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.012
[MERYL grunts]
Listen!

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:04.722
You say that I'm not
long for this world,

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.808
but it's not me who's smoking
and drinking all day!

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:12.396
[MERYL] Pay attention!
I'm saving you!

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.583
[ROBERTO]
You couldn't spare a goodbye?

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.335
These folks'll miss you.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.754
Well, I've never been
the type to overstay.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.839
[ROBERTO sighs]
You're not fooling me.

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:42.343
Even if you wanted to stay
for awhile, you couldn't.

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:45.805
[grunts]

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.641
[ROBERTO] Who are you so
convinced is after you?

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:51.727
Oh, wait, I know this one,
don't tell me.

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:55.773
That'd be Millions
Knives, huh?

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.483
[TOWNSWOMAN C screams]

00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:01.904
[GOFSEF grunting]

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:03.572
We have a situation here!

00:22:03.614 --> 00:22:05.074
[ROBERTO]
I see that.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.326
[NEBRASKA]
What are these creepy crawlies?

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:12.081
Hold on. That's lost tech!

00:22:15.209 --> 00:22:19.964
[GOFSEF grunting]

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.632
[NEBRASKA]
Gofsef, no!

00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:28.055
