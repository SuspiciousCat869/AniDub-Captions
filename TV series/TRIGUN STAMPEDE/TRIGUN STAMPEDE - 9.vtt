00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.870
[VASH sighs]

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:35.630
There he is.
Heard you busted your arm again?

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.090
[VASH]
Brad...

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:40.009
[BRAD] Ugh.
Every time I see your mug,

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.136
you've slaughtered
my masterpiece.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.555
[VASH chuckles]
I, uh... You got me.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.140
[BRAD]
Come on, show me the damage.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.809
Right.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.646
[sighs] You're the same
as always, huh?

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.524
Look who's talking!
I'm just old.

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:57.652
Us humans don't get
the "fountain-of-youth."

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:00.738
--[groans]
--Boo-hoo. Big baby.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:03.616
Huh?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:07.370
Heh. Welcome home, Vash.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.666
Home, right.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:12.834
The others?

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.419
They're all safe.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.838
Everyone from the Humpback
and the orphanage,

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.506
and your friends, too.

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.300
[VASH]
That's good to hear.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.344
You're okay!

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:24.512
Well, I'm not.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.015
Don't associate me with him.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:28.808
I'm impressed.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.811
We actually stopped
the ship, all thanks to you.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.271
[WOLFWOOD]
Enough flattery.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:37.233
Can we talk about the spaceship
hiding in the sandstorm?

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:40.320
[ROBERTO]
Damn smart camouflage.

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.364
[MERYL]
Thank you for saving us.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:44.657
You all seem close.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:47.118
Have you two known Vash
for a long time now?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.289
[BRAD] For a little while--
'bout a 150 years.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.290
Huh?!

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.417
You don't look that old!

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.377
We have cold sleep to thank.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:14:00.506
When we're under, we don't
age a minute. Can't ya tell?

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:03.259
[LUIDA] As long as we're around,
we can continue to maintain

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:06.471
the ship and its passengers.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.349
Speaking of passengers,
you'll see that many of them

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.559
are still asleep.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.812
[WOLFWOOD] Got it.
So it's not eternal life.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.982
Not at all.
We're only human.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.234
We just have a little help
from technology.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.569
[MERYL sighs]

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.364
The plants... They're helping
you out too, right?

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:25.448
[ROBERTO groans]

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.741
Ah.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:29.243
Hmm.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.412
There's something
that you should see.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.543
Ah?

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.128
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.547
[MERYL]
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.300
[giggles]

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.015
No way! This place
is incredible!

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:53.476
[laughs]

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:56.687
Oh! Everything's so
beautiful and green!

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:57.688
[giggles]

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.774
I can't say I was
expecting this.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.318
Come here!
You've gotta check this out!

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.486
[grunts]

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.196
[ROBERTO]
Newb down.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.532
[MERYL]
That's gonna bruise...

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.868
Ah? What are these?

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.870
In my field, we call them flora.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.205
What's that mean?

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.333
They use photosynthesis
to grow and multiply.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.252
They're a special sort
of life-form that's neither

00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:20.962
human nor Worm.

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:23.131
These things are living?

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.466
[LUIDA] Yes, but they don't
eat like we do.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.553
They use water and sunlight
to create nutrients.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.514
So if we make some more...?

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:32.515
[LUIDA]
Mm-hmm.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.434
[ROBERTO]
Can't be that simple.

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:38.729
Like all things, your fancy dome
is powered by plants, huh?

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:41.232
I know we're not
talking one or two.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.235
You see, the flora we're
growing will ultimately

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.070
lessen their load.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:49.198
If you give us enough time,
I promise we'll have this planet

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.324
covered in greenery.

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.493
About how long will that take?

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.788
Years? Maybe a millennium
if we're lucky?

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.790
"How long" is irrelevant.

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:01.043
All that matters is that
I'm following the right path.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:03.421
I don't feel comfortable
justifying wrongdoing

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.923
for my own survival.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:09.427
[ROBERTO] Hah! Now I see
where Vash got it from.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.888
"The right path"? Jeez.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.974
Dog-eat-dog, lady.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:18.144
There's no room for your
shiny morality on this planet.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.272
Be frank, I'm sick
of hearing it.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.774
That said, you're free
to take your path,

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.359
and I'm free to take mine.

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.820
All that I can hope now
is that we're headed

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.239
for the same destination.

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.867
[LUIDA] There's something
I need to tell you.

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.035
What now?

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:35.745
[LUIDA]
There's no smoking on the ship.

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:37.914
[ROBERTO coughs]

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:41.876
[sighs] One cool monologue,
and he blows it immediately.

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.503
[ROBERTO]
C'mon, Meryl!

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.796
Go find somewhere I can smoke!

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.341
Yeah, yeah.
Cause that's in my job de--

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:49.550
Huh?

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:52.220
[squeals]

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.847
Hold on! Did you
just refer to me as "Meryl"

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:57.725
and not "newbie" for the very
first time since we met?!

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.602
[ROBERTO]
Huh? I don't know, did I?

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:00.728
You so did!

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.146
I'm not buying it.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.981
[MERYL] Aw! What do you mean
you're not buying it?!

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.191
--You said it!
--[ROBERTO] I did not.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.943
--[MERYL] Ooh, seriously?!
--[ROBERTO] Did not.

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:10.655
--Did too! Did too! Did too!
--Did not. Did not. Did not.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.865
[WOLFWOOD]
Needle-Noggin...

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.826
Riddle me this
for a moment, will ya?

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.245
[VASH]
Huh?

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:20.206
When you get to Knives, you
aren't stupid enough to think

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:23.084
you two can just talk
this thing out, are you?

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:28.172
Jeez, Blondie!

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.258
--[VASH] I won't kill him.
--Huh?!

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:34.595
[VASH]
I'll never kill. Never again.

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:37.723
I'll figure out a way
to save everyone.

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:42.061
The humans,
the plants, Nai, too.

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:45.523
[WOLFWOOD scoffs]
An empty promise is just a lie.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.317
The day's gonna come
when you have to pick a side.

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:50.611
I hope you pick right.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.363
[BRAD]
I used to be like you.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.364
Huh?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.199
Thinking it's black and white.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:58.828
Thinking that Vash is as
full of crap as any one of us.

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.706
Ask him yourself--
you sound just like me.

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:05.251
All right, grandpa. Sure.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.128
[BRAD]
Vash is a tough kid.

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:11.465
Hang around him long enough,
and you'll see.

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.967
--[gasps]
--[panting]

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:16.804
--[VASH] What's wrong?!
--The Worms were here.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.685
Worms, huh?

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.730
Up there.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.649
[WOLFWOOD]
That's Zazie. No doubt about it.

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:35.197
[groaning]

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:42.538
[MERYL groans]
What the heck? Where are we?

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:47.460
Wake up! You gotta
be okay! Wake up!

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:51.213
[ROBERTO groaning]

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:52.506
Oh...

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.300
Rough night...

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.218
Not hurt, are you?

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.430
Oh. Hey, Newbie. You good?

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:00.931
[groans]

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:04.268
[ROBERTO]
So. Where the hell are we?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.479
[MERYL]
No clue.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.230
Think that they'll
let me smoke here?

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.358
--[laughs]
--Priorities, huh?

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:14.528
[ZAZIE] Welcome to the third
of the seven cities.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.780
[ZAZIE]
JuLai.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.366
Nestled within
a crashed plant carrier.

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:20.576
[MERYL]
Hold on. Have we met?

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:25.581
[ZAZIE] Oh, yeah. I guess you've
never seen me in this outfit.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.458
So, did Knives send you here?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.417
Huh?

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:31.379
[ZAZIE] We have more
interesting things to discuss.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.632
The planet you call Noman's
Land stands at a crossroads.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.134
So I'm trying to find out...

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:43.224
...from your point of view,
who should we Worms side with?

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:46.227
You humans?
Or the plants?

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:47.645
[grunts]

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:50.398
[gasps]

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.149
--[ZAZIE] Nice try...
--Huh?

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.611
...but this body thing is more
for you than it is for me.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.530
[ROBERTO]
You some big shot?

00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.533
Think you get to choose
who wins this war?

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:03.452
[ZAZIE] If the planet's
anyone's, it's ours.

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:06.664
We were here
way before you guys.

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:10.251
And you are repeat offenders.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.044
[MERYL]
Are we?

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:15.005
[WOLFWOOD groaning]

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.841
[growls]

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.262
[ZAZIE] Your home planet
is Earth, right?

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:24.765
I hear you humans all but
burned it to the ground.

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:28.269
That's why you sent colony ships
to this new planet.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.439
No way... It can't be.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.691
[ZAZIE]
Oh, but it can.

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.957
[ZAZIE]
Earth used to be a lush planet.

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.626
It had beauty and
bountiful resources.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:57.089
It was teeming with life,
and not just human.

00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.674
But too bad.

00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:06.599
[ZAZIE] Mankind got a little
too greedy, and-- poof.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.228
[MERYL]
You're lying. That's impossible.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.899
[ZAZIE] Colony ships don't
just fall out of the sky.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.859
The twins crashed them
to stop you.

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:17.902
Slow down, who?

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.570
That's insanity.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.865
You're saying it was
Vash and his brother?

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.201
And they've just been hanging
out for a century and half?

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:26.744
Real likely.

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.162
[ZAZIE laughs]

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:33.042
They're not like you! Centuries
are mere seconds to plants.

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:37.838
[MERYL gasps]

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.848
These are...

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.643
[ZAZIE] Knives has got
quite the collection, huh?

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.394
Yeah, but why?

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:53.771
[CONRAD]
What are you doing?!

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.439
--[gasps]
--[ZAZIE] Huh?

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:58.442
Uh-oh. Daddy's home.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.111
The Beast, of course.

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.988
Why did you bring them here?

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.366
[ZAZIE]
I don't take orders from you.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:08.911
I'm a guest of Knives.
I can do whatever I please.

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.497
[MERYL growls]
I have to know!

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.999
What good are
the red plants to you?

00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:16.001
That's highly confidential.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:19.713
[ZAZIE chuckles]
Oh, I can tell you that,

00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:22.216
but you have to
tell me something.

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:23.551
Ah?

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:26.387
[ZAZIE] Are humans going
to do more for my planet?

00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:28.347
Or are plants?

00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:33.894
Well? Who should I let live?
