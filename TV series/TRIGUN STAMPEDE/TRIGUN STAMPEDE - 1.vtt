Lookin' good, Arthur.

Nice to see you, Kate.
Hi, everybody.

[VASH gasps]
Nai! Rem!

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.381
Wait, what's going on?

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.966
Why's it saying
we're in free fall?

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.720
We're okay. It's overreacting
a little, but we need to move.

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.513
Follow me. This way.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.015

The people still asleep, they're
gonna escape, too, aren't they?

Of course.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.574
All in? Get comfy.

survive for me. Vash? Nai?

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:04.726
Getting to know you two... has
meant the entire world to me!

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.853
[VASH gasps]

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.939

[VASH gasps]
Rem, no!

[MALE RADIO HOST A] Good morning
listeners and thank you

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.471
for choosing November
Public Broadcasting's

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.682
satellite news this sunny
May twenty-fifth.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.018
In recent events, the JuLai
government has announced

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.228
a new most wanted fugitive.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.981
[ROBERTO] And the feds
aren't quick to jump.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.151
Argh!

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.278
I don't know what'll
kill you first, newbie,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.321
your driving or me.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.865
[MERYL] You shouldn't be
drinking on the job anyway,

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.867
and that's just the terrain.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.786
By the way...

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.705
...my name isn't
"newbie," Roberto.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:52.042
[ROBERTO]
Could've sworn it was.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.837
Hmph. I see you graduated
from November University.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.464
Hoity Toity.

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.508
Being a reporter was my dream.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.718
Really shooting
for the stars, eh?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.762
[MERYL] Yup, before long I'll
be behind the news desk--

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:07.557
Wow, they put a rising
star on a gossip piece

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.518
with an old dog like me?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.686
[ROBERTO sneezes]

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.148
And this is exactly why I didn't
wanna babysit a newbie.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.360
[MERYL grunts]
Please, we are on the job,

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.738
and you need to refer
to me by my name.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.989
That's Meryl Stryfe to you.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:27.244
[ROBERTO burps]
Oh, is it now?

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:31.456
Here's my advice,
so listen up, newbie.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.167
Might be hard to tell
from your ivory tower,

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.337
but Noman's Land is
cruel beyond belief.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.965
Dog-eat-dog at its finest.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.138
But you'll find that out soon.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.974
You've got a helluva
lot to learn about

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.227
what it takes to survive on
the ground. Dontcha, newbie?

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.021
So sweet, thanks for the advice!

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.314
[ROBERTO]
Ugh! You're spilling my booze!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.859
[MERYL] Any day now,
I'll get my big scoop!

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.485
[ROBERTO]
Any minute, I'm sure.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.028
[MERYL] I'll be running
the entire bureau

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.863
before you know it!

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.365
[ROBERTO] Then could you
give me a raise, boss?

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.200
[MERYL]
I'm being serious!

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.785
[ROBERTO]
So am I.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.001
[MERYL] I forgot to
charge the battery...

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:21.590
[ROBERTO sighs] Newbie?
This world will eat you alive.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.390
[MERYL]
I'm thirsty.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:33.226
Okay, so I know he's the
"Humanoid Typhoon",

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:36.313
but is he, like, a real guy?

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.691
[ROBERTO grunts]
How have you made it this far?

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.609
[gasps]

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.777
[ROBERTO]
Run into him and it's over.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.741
The man is a walking disaster.
Hence that cute little nickname.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.619
[MERYL]
The Humanoid Typhoon, got it.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.580
[giggles] Real people
aren't such caricatures.

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:55.749
He's a man, not a monster.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.918
That said, I won't
abandon an assignment

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.794
--just because it's silly.
--[ROBERTO] Uh-huh.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.338
[MERYL] If it's the
Typhoon scoop they want,

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.881
then by gosh they'll get it!

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.759
[MERYL grunts]
Rude.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.760
[ROBERTO]
Dead ahead.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.011
[MERYL]
Huh?

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.975
[ROBERTO] Looks like the work
of the Bad Lads Gang.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:19.397
Yeesh, They did a real
number on that poor slob.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.066
[MERYL grunts]

00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:30.450
[VASH]
Need a hand?

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.911
[MERYL yells]

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:42.796
[VASH laughs]

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:43.922
[MERYL]
What a creep.

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.173
Got that right. Let's go.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.175
[VASH]
Don't leave me hanging, friends!

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:51.304
No way. We can't
just leave him here.

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:52.973
[ROBERTO]
Rookie mistake.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.641
[VASH]
Appreciate it.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:08:00.563
Huh... You some kinda gunman?

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:05.610
Huh? Uh... I guess, but I'm
really not much of a fighter.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.529
[MERYL]
Well, that makes sense.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.031
[ROBERTO]
Got some lost tech on ya, huh?

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.282
Huh?

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:17.122
I know that getup.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:20.208
The hell are JuLai military
police doing out here?

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.752
[MERYL gasps]
Police? They might have water!

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.046
--[ROBERTO] Don't!
--Hey, over here!

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.927
[JULAI CAPTAIN A] Oh, good.
Have you seen this man around?

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:32.178
[MERYL]
Huh?

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.726
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
C'mon, lady, it's not complex.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.770
What are you trying
to book him for?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:41.813
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
You're press?

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.982
Then you should know
who we're dealing with.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:46.359
They call him the
Humanoid Typhoon.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.487
He's killed people and
obliterated plants all over.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.365
Got six million double
dollars on his head.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.661
[MALE JULAI CAPTAIN A] Well?
Have you seen the freak or not?

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.456
[MERYL grunts]
I think so!

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.875
I'm pretty sure
he went that way!

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.877
[MALE JULAI CAPTAIN A]
Why didn't you say so sooner?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.923
[VASH gasps]
Gee, thank you!

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.884
[yelps]

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:11.926
[MERYL]
For what?

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:14.679
I'll turn you over as soon as
I get my exclusive interview.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.222
[ROBERTO]
Hey, good job, newbie.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.308
[MERYL]
Good job, Meryl!

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:19.476
And think about it.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.186
If this guy's been
falsely accused,

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.438
it's our duty as the
press to clear his name.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.399
[VASH laughs] You don't find
defenders of justice every day!

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.443
You're a bonafide blessing,
you know!

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:31.154
Journalistic integrity!
Don't flatter me!

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.281
What a load of crap.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.533
Here's an idea.
Let's beat the heat

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.536
and get rolling on that
interview at the diner nearby.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:44.084
Huh? Diner? You doofus,
we should've gone right away!

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.627
Over here?

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.337

Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow!

--Reverse, reverse!
--[MERYL] Wait, so this way?

[VASH]
Uh, no, quite--

[ROBERTO] This clown's
the big, bad Typhoon?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.350

I've heard of this place.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.350
Well, what've we got here.

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:46.104
[MALE BAR CUSTOMER A laughs]
This ain't no place for kids,

Uh, hello?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.193
You'll have to speak up
if you care to be heard.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.155
[VASH]
Yup, I knew we'd find her here!

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:58.032
[ROBERTO]
My newbie needs a shorter leash.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.868
Vash! You're here!

[ROSA]
Looks like it.

[VASH]
Where's hubs?

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.666

I kicked his lazy ass out.

Uh, you two seem pretty close.

Damn right we're pretty close.

Rock's savior.

For real?

planning to do with our Vash?

are two of my best buds!

Then why're you tied up?

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.436
--Ta-da!
--[MERYL, ROBERTO gasp]

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:29.522
Ugh. I trust ya.

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:32.358
I suppose any friend of
Vash's is a friend of mine.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.028
Now that that's settled,
what'll you all be drinking?

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.237
Whiskey for me.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.032
[MERYL] We're on the job.
Three waters, please.

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:41.701
So, did college teach
you to be such a prude?

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.369
What you so crudely
call prudishness

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:46.497
kept me at the top
of my class. So, uh...

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:48.625
[ROBERTO]
Newbie.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:51.085
[MERYL grunts, sighs]

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.548
[gasps]

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.300
[ROSA]
Sorry about that.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.719
Our plant. It's busted somehow.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:02.847
Now we're stuck buying water
off the next town over.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.350
We won't be drinking
clear for a while.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.601
Your plant broke?

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.978
'Fraid so, but since
you three came around,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.773
maybe things are starting
to look up for us.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.816
Come on, give it another look?

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.902
--[MERYL] Huh?
--[ROSA] Please, Vash?

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.281
[ROBERTO] I wouldn't've pegged
you as a plant engineer.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.367
[VASH laughs]
Don't judge a book.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.582
[gasps]

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:39.259
[ROSA] It crapped out on
us a few years ago, too.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.011
Thankfully, Vash swooped
in and fixed it for free.

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.305
[ROBERTO]
And now he's the town's savior.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:49.060
Come on, newbie. You know what
plants are, don't you?

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.437
Top of my class, remember?

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.523
They're biological generators
that can produce

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:57.277
everything mankind needs to
survive on a desert planet.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:13:00.530
They operate on lost technology
from the Spacefaring Age.

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.699
[ROBERTO]
Straight outta the textbook.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.118
Focus on application.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.121
We aren't able to build
these things anymore.

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.038
If you want one,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.375
you can either steal it or you
can pay out your ass for it.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:15.169
That's why towns that have
them keep a tight watch.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.967
[MERYL]
What's wrong with that one.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.219
A red plant, huh?

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.389
[ROSA]
How bad is it?

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:27.348
[VASH]
It's dying.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.891
[ROSA gasps]

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:33.688
[VASH] I know buying a new one
would cost a fortune...

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.692
...but if we don't act now,
things will just get worse.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.818
[ROSA, ROBERTO gasp]

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.069
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
Am I hearing your town's

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.322
in need of some cash?

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:45.950
Lucky for you,
your fortune's right there.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.327
[ROSA]
Military police?

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:49.954
Your pal there has a massive
bounty out on his head

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.290
and whether it's collected
or not is up to you.

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:55.293
[ROSA gasps]
Six million?

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.921
[JULAI CAPTAIN A laughs]
Funny, that's just about enough

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.549
to replace that plant of yours.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:05.219
Hand him over to us and the
town's problems are solved.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.930
I would prefer not to fight
if that's cool with you.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:13.311
Well, sure, I would hate
for anyone to get hurt!

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.354
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
Tie him up!

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:19.400
[grunting]

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.447
[MERYL grunts]
Whoa.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.616
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
Think they'll save you?

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:30.870
They'll take the cash over your
pathetic life, no question!

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:35.041
Ha, ha... How 'bout we settle
this without any bloodshed?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.084
[JULAI OFFICER B]
Good one.

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.419
[JULAI OFFICER C] Thanks, kid,
you made our job easy.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.254
[JULAI OFFICER A]
On your feet!

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:45.259
I'd hate for you boys to do
something you'll regret.

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.135
Careful.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:49.764
This has the potential to make
a great headline, you know.

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.516
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
Don't get any cute ideas.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.602
Just off the top of my head.
What about something like,

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:58.356
"JuLai Military Police Draw
Guns on Unarmed Suspect,

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:01.317
Exposing their Great
Cowardice to the World?"

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:02.944
Huh? Uh. Nice!

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:05.113
I know you're a
spineless coward,

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:07.949
but any real man would
settle this with a duel.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.700
--[VASH] A duel?
--[MERYL] Fun idea!

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:12.078
Your legacy's on the line.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.497
Are you a man or a
yellowbellied baby

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.749
who needs his mo-aw-aw-my?

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:17.917
Stop!

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.669
Hey kids! Don't shoot me!

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.421
I suppose a duel it'll be.

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.089
[JULAI OFFICER A]
Captain? Is he serious?

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.926
[JULAI CAPTAIN A, ROBERTO laugh]

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.219
Hey, so...

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.972
[MALE CIVILIAN A]
Duel time, baby!

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:34.934
[MALE CIVILIAN B]
We're gonna have ourselves

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:39.021
an old fashioned quick draw!
The last slinger standin' wins!

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.189
[MERYL]
Roberto?

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:43.568
I'm not convinced this
was the best idea.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.236
Look at the poor guy.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.114
He's going to get his
spiky head blown off!

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:52.118
[ROBERTO] A duel is about
more than who draws first.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.538
That initial moment is just
one part of the battle.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.874
Keep your eyes on our typhoon.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:00.835
I have a feeling he won't
be as bad as you think.

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.507
Heh!

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:12.805
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
Draw!

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:16.642
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
Draw!

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.102
[VASH]
Nah.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.563
[JULAI CAPTAIN A] Draw, freak!
I won't say it again!

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:22.940
[VASH]
I'm good.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.237
[VASH]
Dontcha think this is dumb?

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:34.327
[chuckles]

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:38.831
[JULAI CAPTAIN A] Now that you
mention it, this <i>is</i> dumb.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.082
[nervously laughs]

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.966
We've got an audience,

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:52.136
we might as well
give them a show!

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.265
[JULAI OFFICER C]
A cluster bomb?

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.141
[JULAI OFFICER B]
But, Captain,

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.477
we're supposed to
bring him back alive!

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.980
Hell, forget the job,
you're risking all our lives!

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.065
[JULAI OFFICER C]
Run! Hurry!

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:05.316
[JULAI OFFICERS yell]

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.944
[laughing]

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:10.655
Since we're here, we might
as well have fun!

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:11.989
Fight me, Humanoid Typhoon!

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.200
And... he's crazy.

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.745
[grunts]
That coward!

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.542
You've nearly died
enough today, newbie.

00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:25.127
Quick tip. The two of
us are just reporters,

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:28.339
not bodyguards, or police,
or anything else.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:29.674
--[MERYL] Yeah, but--
--[ROBERTO] What's more.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.843
It takes a level of experience
that you most certainly do not

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.055
have before you can fling
around the word "coward".

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:37.682
Understand me?

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:40.017
Yes.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.395
[ROSA]
Vash! Get down here, hurry!

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:45.690
Tell everybody to take cover!

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:49.026
[MERYL] He's trying keep
the townsfolk safe.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:52.363
[ROBERTO] At this point,
bravery is plain stupid.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:55.533
He's like you, not long
for this world.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:04.917
[VASH]
Huh?

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.171
[gasps]
What? But I--

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.340
Huh? It's cool, happy thoughts.

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:14.927
Gotta be one somewhere, don't
panic, it's cool, super cool.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.053
[MERYL]
Don't tell me...

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.973
[VASH]
So, uh. I might be out of ammo?

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.266
Holy...

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:23.853
[laughs]
What a moron!

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:26.564
[VASH] Bullets! I could
really use some bullets!

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.900
A few .22 calibers
would be dandy!

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.611
C'mon, guys!

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:34.780
Any time now!

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:37.742
Why isn't anyone helping?

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:38.993
[ROBERTO]
Huh?

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.996
[MERYL]
Huh?

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:46.375
Hurry! Help! Please!

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:49.420
I need ammo!

00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:52.298
[MERYL]
Special delivery!

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.009
[panting]
It's from Rosa!

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.640
[gasps]

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:03.768
--[JULAI CAPTAIN A laughs]
--[MERYL] Dammit!

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.853
[VASH panting]
Come to daddy!

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.368
[VASH]
Gotcha!

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:21.744
Just one, eh?

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.454
--[ROSA chuckles]
--[MERYL] Don't blame me.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:24.830
[VASH]
Much obliged.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.753
I don't think so!

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.174
[VASH]
You're... done!

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.470
[groans]

00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:48.479
[VASH shouts]

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:13.003
[JULAI CAPTAIN A]
Y-You'll pay for this!

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:19.093
[MERYL] Well, you sure know
your way around a gun.

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:22.513
[VASH gasps]
Gosh, I guess you could say so!

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.266
At the very least,
I'm pretty darn lucky.

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:26.350
Huh?

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:28.769
It might be a good day
to hit the casino.

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:29.812
[VASH laughs]

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.605
[MERYL]
Huh?

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.235
You're afraid of something,
aren't you?

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.863
And it's got to do
with that red plant.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.239
[sighs]

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.284
[ROBERTO]
Military police on your ass

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.786
and you don't bat an eye.

00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:49.457
One wonky plant and
you're pissing yourself.

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.542
What're you scared of?

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.754
I have a brother...

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:03.512
[KNIVES laughs]

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:11.479
[KNIVES] I finally did it!
A brilliant success!

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.980
[VASH]
How could you?

00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:14.190
[KNIVES]
Could I what?

00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:16.734
I made sure the plant
ship would survive.

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.820
[VASH]
You killed them, even Rem!

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:23.532
[KNIVES] Don't scold me.
You're my accomplice.

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:24.992
[gasps]

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:30.039
[KNIVES laughs]

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:37.505
Well, aren't you? Vash?

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.819
[VASH]
Millions Knives.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.613
Have you two ever come
across that name before?

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:14.416
[KNIVES] You've found him.
Take me there.

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:17.545
I'll rip him from
those parasites.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:25.594
[KNIVES] And once I have,
I'll exterminate them for good.
