[MERYL gasps]
Huh?

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.870
Undertaker? Where'd Vash go?

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.414
[WOLFWOOD]
Don't know, don't care.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:03.749
[MERYL]
Huh?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.337
[MERYL grunts]
Stop playing around!

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.631
Where is he? I know you know!

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.633
What do you wanna hear?

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:16.511
That his parts are in
Knives's chop shop?

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.598
[MERYL, WOLFWOOD grunt]

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.724
What's your deal?

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.351
I thought more of you.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:27.314
[WOLFWOOD] Oh, yeah? Tsk.
That was your mistake.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.944
[grunts]

[VASH grunting]

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.789
Calm yourself down, brother.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.207
[gasps]

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:56.551
[VASH grunting]

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.306
Good. Now let us begin.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.600
[grunts]

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.689
[CONRAD]
Initial connection complete.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.402
Vitals are stable.
The first phase was a success.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.237
A hundred years
of research.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.948
My life's work finally
bears its fruit.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:26.039
[MERYL] Turn it off.
I'm done playing.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.916
[CONRAD]
You wouldn't shoot me.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.751
[MERYL gasps]

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.670
[CONRAD]
The glass is bulletproof.

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:34.798
Besides, severing the connection
will kill your friend,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.591
not save him.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.762
[gasps]
What's it all for?

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.389
[CONRAD]
Plants are husks.

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.642
Their true being resides
somewhere else.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:49.563
And not anywhere on
this godforsaken planet,

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.441
but in a different
dimension entirely.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.485
A higher plane.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:59.322
That plane is where the energy
we consume originates.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.617
The plants you see make that
transference possible.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.412
It might be helpful to think of
plants as windows that connect

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:07.789
the two dimensions.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.499
Just tell me what it's for!

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.210
[CONRAD] Why is it the
twins are the only ones

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.253
with their own free will?

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.546
[gasps]

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:17.966
[CONRAD] I hypothesize that the
key difference between plants

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:22.471
and Independents is the
presence of a soul.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.223
To grant the plants souls
and give them free will,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.309
we must connect to the core.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.560
Core?

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:31.480
[CONRAD] The manifestation
of beginning and end.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.941
The source of all matter
and energy in this universe.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:39.237
Gain access to the core,
give souls to the plants.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.906
That is my objective.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.825
[MERYL] You're saying all
of the plants out there...

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.036
You wanna make
them Independents?

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.044
[gasps]

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.924
[VASH]
This place.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:02.177
[KNIVES] Fitting this is
the first memory I come to.

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.013
[VASH grunts]
Yeah, and why's that?

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.682
[KNIVES] Remember the
vow I made that day?

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.518
Huh?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:14.147
They'll be free. Paradise is
well within my reach, brother.

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.442
My world of plants isn't
complete without you.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.111
Join me, and we shall
save our kind.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.741
They don't abuse plants
because they want to.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:27.244
It's because they're trapped
on this barren planet.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.496
It's our fault!

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:32.123
[KNIVES]
I see.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.501
Then don your crown of thorns,

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:37.796
and prepare to die in your
precious Sinners' stead.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:41.883
[gasps]

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.931
[MERYL] If all the plants
become Independent,

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:50.267
humanity won't survive!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.185
[CONRAD] We've been in
a spiral of suicide

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.105
long before we arrived here.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:59.317
Plant independence is the
only way to reverse that.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.236
Vash's "window" is special.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.946
He's the only one
that can take from

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:05.282
as well as send to
the higher plane.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.575
[MERYL]
It doesn't matter!

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.493
He would never
agree to help you!

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.121
[CONRAD]
Hence, he will be remade.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.206
Kill him, you mean?

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:15.876
[beeping]

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.086
[CONRAD]
Second connection successful.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:23.008
Using Vash as a window,
all plants are ours to control.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.010
We're past the point of return.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.261
[gasps]

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.141
[MERYL] C'mon, Vash!
Snap out of it!

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:34.102
Wake up!

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.813
[CONRAD] Initializing
assimilation, absorption,

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:39.441
awakening, and memory
manipulation.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.151
Is all of that necessary?

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.402
[CONRAD]
Knives?

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.945
[KNIVES]
It's going well.

[gasps]

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.992
[KNIVES] I'm going to
push even deeper now.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:51.411
You will not recognize anything.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:56.791
Not yourself, nor the
world around you.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.585
And not me.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.924

Owe you one.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:15.143

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.057
Couldn't save him then,
so do it now.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.518
[KNIVES, WOLFWOOD]
Put him out of his misery.

None of it's real, is it?
Just some messed up dream.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.565
It's a lie!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.628
So these are just for show.
To look pretty.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.006
They're like the one in
the plant room, huh?

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:23.386
Good, Nai. Observant as ever.

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.429
[KNIVES]
Hm.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.015
[VASH]
It'd be cooler if it was yummy.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.475
All that you ever think
about is eating.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.728
Well, I'm sorry if that's
all I'm good for.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:33.479
You know I didn't say that.

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.981
--Didn't have to!
--Fool!

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:38.318
Hush, where will
fighting get you? Nai.

00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:40.653
Just because you were born with
powers doesn't mean that you--

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:44.032
Yeah, yeah. Doesn't mean
I should brag, right?

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:44.866
Don't get me wrong.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.784
Your powers are
a beautiful thing.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:50.496
But promise me, once everybody
else wakes up from cold sleep--

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:53.082
I won't show them
to anyone but you.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.959
And even if you don't need to...

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.795
[REM, KNIVES] ...pretend to eat
and drink when others can see.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.630
Trust me, I know.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.591
Huh?

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:03.760
It's him you should
be worried about.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:06.721
At this rate, he'll turn
out as human as you.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:14.312
[REM] That'd be okay.
Comparison is the thief of joy.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.190
You are exactly how
you were meant to be.

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.316
[VASH]
Hm?

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.817
[REM] Come here, Nai.
Bring it in.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.362
[KNIVES]
Uh!

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.155
Powers don't change
a thing to me.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.283
Because at the end of the day,
you're still my perfect boys.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.535
[VASH chuckles]

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.329
I love both of you.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:37.960
[VASH] Did she mean nothing
to you all this time?

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.046
[KNIVES] I can't say
that it stuck out.

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.486
We shouldn't be here.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:07.782
She's hiding something.
You have to be curious, too.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.492
[VASH grunts]

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:13.496

Mm. That's me.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.342
[VASH]
I'm there, too.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.930
What's Project Code "Type T?"

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:35.059
Says another Independent was
born here about 50 years ago.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.727
That's news to me.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.731
They keep the ship's
whole history in here?

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.361
[VASH gasps]

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:48.406

[KNIVES, VASH yell]

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.469
Nai! Vash!

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:16.517
[VASH] I know that humans
did terrible things to her.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:20.271
I can see why you'd hate them.
But even so...

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.773
[KNIVES] Defend their
cruelty all you want.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:26.360
That is but a grain of sand
in their desert of misdeeds.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:30.531
[VASH]
Huh?

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.968
[KNIVES] Humans say that
they despise conflict,

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.596
yet no era has been
free from war.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:57.892
They just repeat the
same tragedies.

00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.810
History is proof.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.482
[VASH]
You love that one, huh?

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.317
Humanity can't learn.

[VASH sighs]

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:12.949
[VASH]
They have learned, Nai.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.702
It's like Rem told me.
The day we were born,

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:20.289
she vowed that we wouldn't
end up as another tragedy.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:23.709
Just try. Try to
have faith in them.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.420
[gasps]

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.264
[KNIVES]
Without any powers,

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.933
you're too weak to
live as a plant.

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:42.812
Hence, you needed the humans
to love and accept you.

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:45.106
They only loved your tricks,

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:49.151
your charm, and the
tightness of your leash.

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:54.282
Misplaced devotion is a trap.
I had to save you from it.

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:55.950
That's why I crashed the ships.

00:17:55.992 --> 00:18:00.580
[VASH gasps]
It was my fault?

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.623
Everything that I
did was for you.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:03.874
[gasps]

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:23.394

And now, the final memory!

We're at 99%.

It is too late.

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:33.571
A hundred and fifty

Well, that doesn't look good.

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:53.758
[CONRAD gasps]
Just a moment longer.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:19:02.933
[KNIVES] The one source of all
your confusion... was her.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:08.898
She sold you on excuses and
disguised them as love.

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:11.525
She's who built your
pathetic fantasy.

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.570
