00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.723
[RELIGIOUS RADIO HOST A] When
the ark fell from the sky all

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:19.102
those years ago, we sinners were
cast upon this desolate land.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:22.147
Now, brothers and
sisters in faith,

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.193
join me in prayer as we
ask God to send His angel

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:28.403
of salvation our way.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.698
Praise the angel.
Honor the angel.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.535
Become the angel's
eyes in this world.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.955
May the lord bless you,
oh, faithful ones.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.374
[ROLLO coughs]

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.839
[ROLLO] Dear God, please let
the wind blow soon.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.343
If it doesn't, then I...

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:32.736
[RELIGIOUS RADIO HOST A] When
the two angels descend upon us,

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.530
a bridge of light
will cross the sky.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.659
That's when we sinners
shall be redeemed,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.119
and the lord will lead
us into His kingdom.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.580
[MERYL grunts]
I'm melting.

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:46.124
Good grief. That's enough
doomsday talk for me now.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.960
[ROBERTO]
Amen.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.672
[grunts]
What was that station anyway?

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:56.635
[grunts] Standard
religious dreck, newbie.

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:58.637
The Church of Plant
Worshippers pumps out

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.223
that kind of propaganda.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:04.893
As far as wack job sects go,
they're fairly up and coming.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.481
[ROBERTO] I hear they've got
a headquarters in JuLai.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.946
[groans]
Agh! I'm dying!

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.115
If I get heat stroke,
I'm blaming you.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.952
[ROBERTO] Long before your time,
the desert didn't look this way.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.621
The sand was the same
color as anywhere else.

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:25.831
[MERYL]
Huh?

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.333
Until out of the shadows,
it appeared!

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:32.963
Nobody had a damn clue
where it came from or why.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.716
Was it man, or was it beast?

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.051
There isn't a soul
who could tell you.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:41.346
Because anyone who laid
eyes on the thing...

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.640
...no longer lives
to tell the tale!

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:46.268
The monster massacred
every last one of them!

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.396
[chuckles nervously]

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:52.190
[ROBERTO] Overnight, the blood
of its victims spilled

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.652
over the desert, staining the
sand that deep crimson color

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.238
you see today.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.534
Eh? You still hot after
my chilling story?

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.703
Hot, and very annoyed.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.038
[MERYL gasps]

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.290
[ROBERTO yelps]

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:16.631
[ROBERTO grunts] Are you
trying to kill us, newbie?

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.091
Over there.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.769
Gonna kill me?
Ack! He's a goner.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.313
[WOLFWOOD] Looks like Wormy took
a fist straight to the skull.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.273
Fist?

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:36.568
Do you think that it
got got by Knives's crew?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.196
It might have been that monster
I told you about earlier.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.198
[MERYL grunts] You're just
hilarious, aren't you?

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.909
The thing has been
dead for a while.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.871
So, even if it was Knives,
our man's long gone now.

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:49.372
Right, Needle?

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.925
What's wrong?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.301
Hey!

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.725
[MERYL, ROBERTO]
Hm?

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.364
[RELIGIOUS RADIO HOST A] Now,
brothers and sisters in faith,

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:26.117
join me in prayer as
we ask God to send his

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.453
angel of salvation our way.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:32.833
[gasps]
Hey, Mama?

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:36.753
When kids get sacrificed,
why does God have to eat them?

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:41.341
[ROLLO'S MOTHER]
To bring blessings, dear.

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:45.220
Yeah, but, are those
blessing worth dying for?

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:46.805
[ROLLO'S MOTHER]
Death is not the end.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.473
It's the beginning.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:52.561
Heaven is a wonderful place,
and dying gets us there.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.065
[ROBERTO] Doesn't look
like anyone's lived here

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:59.025
in a long time.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.069
[MERYL]
Yeah, so quiet it's creepy.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:04.322
Interesting. This town's
rolling without a plant.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.700
Some Nebraska-type got it, huh?

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.369
Nah, just look.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.122
I don't think these folks
needed a plant for power.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.708
[MERYL gasps]
A windmill?

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.543
Not mill-ing.

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:19.087
There ain't any wind, genius.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.173
[WOLFWOOD] So, what happens
if there's never any wind?

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.342
[MERYL] A prolonged
power outage, I suppose.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.429
[WOLFWOOD]
Huh? Stupid plan, if you ask me.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.849
Stupid? That's the way
wind power has always worked.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.642
[WOLFWOOD]
Stupid way.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.618
[grunts]

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.246

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.711
--[MERYL] You okay?
--[VASH] Get back!

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.673
[ROBERTO] When you hear
gunshots, don't jump into them!

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:05.383
[MERYL]
Oopsie.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.931

Vash the Stampede!

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.901
Moron! Get up and do something!

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:25.487
[VASH grunts]
Yeah.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:28.740
Oh, great. The big
fella knows Vash.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.700
How?

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.411
[MONEV]
Vash! Vash...

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:37.874
...The Stampede!

[WOLFWOOD, VASH gasp]

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.380
[MERYL]
What now?

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.967
Hurry and get inside!
He's after me, not you!

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.178
[WOLFWOOD grunts]
Persistent, isn't he?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.223

No!

[VASH gasps]

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.130
[MONEV]
Vash.

[MONEV]
Vash. Vash the Stampede.

[ROLLO grunts]

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.438
[WOMAN A] So, have you
spoken to Rollo yet?

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:45.191
[ROLLO'S MOTHER] I can't.
It hurts to even think about.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.527
[WOMAN B]
I understand that feeling,

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.447
but it's something we
all had to conquer.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.574
[WOMAN C] He was born
on a windless day,

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.076
and now he's finally
getting his blessing!

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.037
[WOMAN A]
It's truly a wonderful thing.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.163
[ROLLO'S MOTHER]
Right.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.499
When he gets home,
I'll tell him everything.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.919
It's great honor to be chosen
as a sacrifice, after all.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.713
[WOMAN B] Absolutely,
he should be thrilled!

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.424
[WOMAN C]
You'll do a fine job!

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.218
[gasps]

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:28.401

Vash the Stampede!

Please be alive.

[groans]

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.134
What a relief.
Glad you're okay.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:00.475
[MONEV]
Vash the Stampede!

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:06.648
Hey, blondie! Wanna live?

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:07.941
Get outta here, now!

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.443
[VASH]
Uh, yeah!

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.446
[grunts]

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:22.038
Hey, so, uh...

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.665
What?

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:27.627
Vash and Wolfwood, do you
think that they're okay?

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:32.382
Yes? No? Don't piss
yourself over it, newbie.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.300
There isn't a damn thing
that either of us can do

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.094
to help them now.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.554
[MERYL sighs]

[MONEV]
Vash the Stampede.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:56.990
[WOLFWOOD sighs]
You're a dumbass, you know.

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.033
This do-gooder
crap's killing me.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:03.371
[VASH sighs] Sorry. I was
scared that ended the big guy.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:06.082
Funny, I was hoping
that it ended you.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.419
[VASH laughs]
You don't pull punches, do ya?

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.588
[WOLFWOOD sighs]
Well?

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.463
[VASH gasps]

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.549
Stop playing dumb.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:18.636
This village, it isn't
your first visit, huh?

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.221
The hell happened here?

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:24.475
[gasps]
I don't know very much.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.977
Only...

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:31.065
[ROLLO pants]

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.576
[whimpers]

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.370
[VASH]
You okay, little man?

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.125
[VASH chuckles]
Maybe you can help me out.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.419
I'm looking for Rollo.

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:52.879
[gasps]

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.552
[VASH] Your mom asked me to come
out here and track you down.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.554
You ran away from home?

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:07.101
[ROLLO]
Not really. It's not like that.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.605
Hey, Mister? You're that
"Vash the Stampede," aren't you?

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.234
[VASH] Huh? You know
about little old me?

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:17.195
Well, yeah. You're super famous.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.072
You're the real-life
Humanoid Typhoon.

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:20.490
Everybody knows you.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.910
[VASH] Everybody, huh?
Well, that's news to me.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.620
[ROLLO]
I heard something else, too.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.830
You're a walking disaster,

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.500
a demon who wreaks havoc
wherever he goes.

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:33.044
[VASH chuckling]
Huh?

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.797
[ROLLO coughs]

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.759
Yeah. I'm not doing good.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.929
I'm gonna die before I
get to grow up, they say.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:47.725
[ROLLO] Maybe the reason God
hasn't saved me is because

That's rough, huh?

Exactly. That's why I'm next.

Yeah, Rollo. She needs you.

If you ever need someone,
remember me!

I'll be right there!

If God won't, I will!
I swear I'll save you!

By the time I got back
here with some medicine,

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.615
there was nothing
I could do.

death is not the end.

I'm real confused.
Are you God, mister?

A fair question.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.460
The one you call
God can't join us.

I am an angel.

Using this drug,

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.914
we'll rebuild your body
at the cellular level.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.792
It'll also work to accelerate
your metabolism.

If your body can tolerate it,

the drug should cure
your illness as well.

That said, side effects
are to be expected.

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:32.557
But at the very least, it won't
be your illness that killed you.

physical capabilities.

Nothing stirs the body

It's a poison so deadly
that the Worm's venom

hardly rivals its potency.
