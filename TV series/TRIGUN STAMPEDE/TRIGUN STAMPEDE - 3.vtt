00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:12.638
[RADIO HOST] Looking at the
forecast for the seven cities.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.932
The sandstorm brewing in the
center of our continent has been

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:18.352
intensified by a pocket
of strong air currents

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.938
and is expected to
reach the west soon.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.606
Residents in this
region are advised

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:25.943
to take shelter immediately.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.778
If you live in a western city...

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.532
[VASH]
Get to the main street! Hurry!

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.534
My boy, where are you?

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.285
--Gofsef? Gofsef!
[VASH] Move!

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:37.037
[RADIO HOST]
Given the conditions...

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.871
[MALE SOLDIER A]
Now what?

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:42.042
[NEBRASKA pants]

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.129
Gone. Poor lad ran for
the hills to protect us.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.839
That sweet soul.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.387
[MALE SOLDIER B, NEBRASKA gasp]

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.389
[VASH gasps]

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.765
Company!

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:57.641
[ROSA]
Lemme get that!

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:58.892
[ROBERTO]
Don't go pressing buttons!

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.394
They're bombs!

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.937
[MALE SOLDIER B]
They're bombs?

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.480
Mama--!

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:05.440
[ROSA]
Tonis!

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.067
[VASH]
I've got ya!

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.446
[VASH]
Aw, jeez. It's stuck!

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.073
Keep your Hands off it!

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:16.827
This design means it must be the
work of that E. G. Bomber guy.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:19.746
Dismantling these damn
things would take a pro.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.623
[VASH]
Huh?

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.459
[MALE SOLDIER B]
Stay back!

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.086
Save this town!

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:30.215
[ALL grunt]

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:39.308
[VASH]
Who's this E. G. Bomber?

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.144
[ROBERTO] His real name is
Ethan Gilbert Hamilton.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.980
Apparently, taking lives
is easy for this sicko.

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:47.107
But he couldn't just call
himself "easy bomber,"

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.109
had to add his stupid autograph.

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:51.361
And why would he
target this town?

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:52.362
Beats me.

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.364
So what are we supposed to do?

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:57.075
We're gonna have to find
the bomber himself.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.244
If these things can
be disabled, he'll know how.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.538
I can capture this guy for you.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.333
In the meantime,
keep your spirits up.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.584
We'll try.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.586
Where is he?

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.130
I've found that freaks
like him get off at seeing

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:11.548
the fruits of their labor.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.469
[grunts] So, he must be
somewhere with a good view.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.142
[grunts]

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.103
[E.G. laughs]

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.606
[NEBRASKA grunts]
Say bye-bye, boomie!

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:28.815
[TOWNSMAN A]
Yeah!

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.154
[VASH gasps]

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:35.739
Mines, too?

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:39.117
[E.G.] More mines than you
could comprehend, little man.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.080
[VASH]
E.G. Bomber.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.790
[E. G.]
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.709
The man who once bore
that name is no more.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:52.547
Thanks to a special someone,
I have been born anew.

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.132
[NEBRASKA, VASH gasp]

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.889
[E.G. laughs]

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.478
E.G. the Mine.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.065
That name's much more fitting,
wouldn't you agree?

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:11.900
[gasps]

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:15.946
Now, then. I heard that you fine
folks have a treasure for me?

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:52.501
Come on. Why don't you point me
in the right direction, huh?

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:57.255
[NEBRASKA, VASH grunt]

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.593
He's after the plant!

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.386
[ALL gasp]

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.016
[VASH grunts]

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.734
[chuckles]

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.531
Bingo, baby!

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:29.746
[gasps]

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.292
[MERYL gasps]
You okay?

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.461
[VASH grunts]

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.505
--Hey.
--[ROBERTO] Now it's clicking.

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.550
After a few short hours hanging
around this fool you're already

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.177
swept up, up and away
into the typhoon.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.470
Damn good nickname.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.514
[MERYL]
What do you mean by that?

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:50.684
--[beeping]
--Whoa, whoa. Stay away.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.644
Unless suicide with
a drunk sounds like

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.062
a grand ol' time to you.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:58.900
Okay, blowing up
is not sui...cide.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.360
There's an idea!

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.114
[MALE SOLDIER C]
Turn around!

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.700
There's bombs all
over the place!

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.410
Hey, you!

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.502
[VASH pants]

[TONIS, ROSA gasp]

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:34.269
You don't need to worry, okay?
Mister Vash is gonna save us.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.943
[E.G.]
Well, well.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.445
[VASH]
Disable the bombs!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.366
[VASH grunts]

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.285
[VASH]
Real original idea, buddy!

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:55.540
[E.G. laughs]

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.385
You already have the plant,
so your business here is done!

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.220
Now tell me how to
shut off all the bombs!

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.306
You don't get it, do you?

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.600
I'm not killing for
a chance to steal.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:16.519
I'm stealing for
a chance to kill!

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:21.441

Now scream for me!

Yeah, if we die,
then you die, too!

[NEBRASKA]
Get out of my way!

You would dare to
protect this maniac?

[VASH] Revenge is pointless,
trust me.

[E.G.] Your power is immense,
Master Knives.

[KNIVES inhales]
Have you ever wondered...

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.531
...what it's like to
speak with a god?

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:08.209
[KNIVES]
Vash... It's been so long.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.920
I see you're still lugging
around that gun.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.422
Why are you here?

[KNIVES laughs]

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.758
For the plant, or...?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.343
[KNIVES]
I'm taking it back.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:22.557
It belongs to me, or rather,
it belongs to us.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.309
[VASH]
I won't let you.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.353
That would be a death sentence
for the entire town!

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:31.149
[KNIVES laughs]
You won't let me?

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.610
Whose side are you on?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.111
It must feel nice.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.614
Stunning the masses
with your tricks,

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.991
collecting their
cries of adoration.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.368
Does their praise cure it?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.578
The loneliness?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.954
Listen to yourself!

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.624
All these years and you're
exactly the same!

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:50.877
[KNIVES]
How amusing.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.923
[KNIVES]
I was thinking the same of you.

control your gate yet?

[NEBRASKA] Are you bomb
boy's big boss? Die!

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:31.251
[gasps]
Nai? Oh, no!

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:36.589
[grunts]
Come out, come out, big cheese.

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:41.052
[NEBRASKA]
Huh?

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:58.987
[NEBRASKA gasps]

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.416
[VASH]
Run, Nebraska!

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:21.301
[NEBRASKA yells]

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.306
[VASH]
You're okay.

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:27.765
We need help!

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.517
Hang in there.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:33.479
Stop this, Nai! Stop this!

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:42.488
[TOWNSPEOPLE chatter]

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.345
[CONRAD]
Up ahead.

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:22.612
[TOWNSWOMEN pant]

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:24.655
You aren't gettin' any closer!

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.038
I'll shoot, y'hear!

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.998
[TOWNSWOMEN gasp]

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:46.052
Step aside. The odds are
not in your favor, ma'am.

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:49.972
[KNIVES]
Doctor. You decided to show up.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:53.309
Good timing.
Recover that which is mine.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:54.560
[CONRAD]
Hm.

00:14:57.188 --> 00:15:00.400
[KNIVES]
I'll take care of <i>this</i>.

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.902
[ROSA grunts]
We'll "take care" of you!

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.327
[TOWNSWOMEN gasp]

[BOTH gasp]

[TOWNSWOMAN A]
Rosa!

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:38.271
[gasps, whimpers]

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.157
[ROSA gasps]

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.166
[KNIVES]
There you are.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:10.595
[ROSA gasps]

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.449
[VASH]
Nai!

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.746
Come here and talk to me!
Put the plant down!

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.916
[chuckles]

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:42.960
You'll have to choose a side
at some point, you know.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.212
[gasps]

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.672
[MERYL] Are you sure we're
going the right way?

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.174
[ROBERTO]
Focus on climbing.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.926
Don't wanna die
by falling, newbie.

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:51.135
Great, so no.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.638
You're totally lost, aren't you?

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.848
Tonis? Whatcha doing here?

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.309
Mama said to
hide out for awhile.

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:00.561
So, she's still in there.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.104
Uh-oh.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.985
How could you?

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.196
[KNIVES] \
Because I'm still me.

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:13.074
And you're still living
off empty words.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.367
[VASH]
Quiet!

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:17.245
[KNIVES]
Just stand back and watch.

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:18.913
Watch them all perish.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.873
[gasps]

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.877
Chance number two.
Put the plant down!

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.671
[KNIVES]
You would shoot me?

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.091
Your own big brother?

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:31.384
[laughs]

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.679

[KNIVES laughs]

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:57.660
[KNIVES] Long ago, God rained
fire onto the city of fools.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:00.871
Destruction was a small price
to pay for their depravity.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.291
[gasps]
Don't, Nai.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:09.547
[KNIVES] God cleansed what man
had sullied, just as I will now.

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:14.594
This world will be
a blank slate.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:18.180
The city... Rosa,
you've gotta get outta here!

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:31.110
[ELENDIRA]
Quickly, now.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.742
[gasps]

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.414
[VASH]
Come on!

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:48.419
[KNIVES laughs]

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:05.019
[VASH gasps]
Why? How could he?

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.117
--[TONIS shouts]
--[MERYL] Tonis, no!

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:29.794
Why here? Why now?
Why do it, Nai? Why?!

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:46.894
[ROBERTO grunts]

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.938
[ROBERTO] Hey, you're tougher
than I thought.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:50.189
[MERYL grunts]

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:54.151
You might look like total hell,
but you're a lucky one.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.654
Congrats. If you want
to be a good journalist,

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.572
dumb luck is a necessity.

00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.157
[MERYL gasps]

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:06.288
[MERYL]
Hey, Vash! Rosa!

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:12.044
[TOWNSPEOPLE sob]

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.298
[MERYL gasps]

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.761
Poor little guy.

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:22.930
[ROSA]
They took everything.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:28.269
Our plant, our people, our town.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.354
Our luck's run out.

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:32.773
[VASH]
Rosa...

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:34.608
He's your brother, yeah?

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.652
You share blood
with that monster?

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:39.321
[gasps]

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:42.032
I promise, I'm gonna bring
that plant back to you!

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.534
Whatever it takes, I'll do it!

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:48.789
Get outta my sight.
And get the hell outta my town.

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:53.002
If you hadn't stumbled
your way into the diner,

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.838
this disaster never
would've happened.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.175
You would be wise not to
show your face here again,

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.677
Humanoid Typhoon.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.389
[VASH sighs]

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.729
[MERYL gasps]

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:18.402
[ROBERTO sighs]

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:26.535
[MERYL pants]
Hey, Vash!

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:29.079
Vash!

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.165
Wait up!

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.792
Come on!

00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:37.797
[MERYL gasps]

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:56.148
[MERYL] Are you okay?
That was a lot just now.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.234
[VASH]
Hm.

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:01.028
[MERYL] I don't get it.
How can you just smile?

00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:04.990
[VASH]
Easy.

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:07.243
Because I don't deserve to cry.

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:11.163
[MERYL]
Where are you going?

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.209
[VASH]
East.

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.920
[MERYL gasps]
East, where?

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:30.641
[VASH] About as far as it gets,
to the third city, JuLai.

00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:32.685
That's where I'll find him.
