That's beside the point.
I won't risk our lives

look for a nearby attendant.

In what?

In following me around.

Don't you have something
that you want to protect

more than anything else too?

[WOLFWOOD groans]
Oh, stuff it, blondie.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.775
The reason you've survived this
long is because there's always

some poor sap there
to die instead.

was talking about at all.

[WOLFWOOD]
I don't believe in gods, so no!

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:39.939
[LEGATO]
What about punishment?

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.359
That will be your role in
Master Knives's noble plan.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:46.863
You will eliminate all
abnormalities in his way.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.241
[LEGATO]
Rebels.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.953
[LEGATO]
Fugitives.

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.291
[LEGATO]
Low-life scum.

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:01.043
[grunts] Yeah, that's gonna
be a pass from me.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.253
[LEGATO]
Surely, you'll enjoy it.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.922
[WOLFWOOD] I'm not working for
you or your freaky-ass cult!

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.716
[LEGATO laughs]

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:11.762
[LEGATO]
You consider him a brother?

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:14.474
[gasps]
Livio!

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.434
[LEGATO] I understand
he volunteered himself

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.019
to follow after you.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.147
The very picture
of fraternal love.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.064
[WOLFWOOD grunts]

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.317
[LEGATO]
If you refuse to join us,

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.986
he says he's willing
to take your place.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:28.696
What'll it be?

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.574
Damn you, you blue-haired
freak of nature!

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:36.621
[gasps, groans]

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.834
[LEGATO] You would be wise not
to insult my appearance again.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:46.422
[WOLFWOOD grunts]

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:49.258
[LEGATO] It's futile.
My power is far beyond

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.094
mere nerve control or
electrical impulses.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:58.518
Livio. Run! Run away!

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:02.271
[LEGATO]
Huh. Love. Attachment.

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:05.775
I don't understand such things.

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:07.985
Emotion is useless.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:11.739
Devote yourself and release
that which weighs you down.

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.741
--Well?
--[WOLFWOOD] Not a chance.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.493
Sorry, blue boy!

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:19.121
[yells]

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:22.583
[LEGATO laughs]

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.043
[CONRAD]
Bluesummers!

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.628
[grunts]

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.630
[LEGATO]
Well, you arrived quickly.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.298
[CONRAD]
Please! Be gentle with him.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.300
He's no more than
your average stray.

00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:36.180
[CONRAD] His chemical aptitude,
it ranks S plus. He is no stray.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:40.351
[LEGATO laughs] I overstepped,
I'm terribly sorry.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:43.729
Forgive me, Priest William.

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:46.649
[CONRAD] You mustn't
defile life in such a way!

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:50.194
The one who needs to
forgive us both is him.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:58.578
[WOLFWOOD]
I'm sorry, Livio.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:06.586
Screw you. I'm gonna be real
pissed if I have to hurt you!

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.302
[VASH pants]

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.178
[SOLDIER C]
There he is! Fire!

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.144
[SOLDIER C]
Fire!

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.360
[SOLDIER D]
He's still standing?

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:32.278
What's going on?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.239
[gasps]

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.325
[WOLFWOOD]
And with no meds?

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:40.661
[SOLDIERS shouting]

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:42.913
[VASH gasps]
Who is that?

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.582
He's none of
your business, okay?

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.626
Now hurry up and hide!
Don't let him find you.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:47.752
He's gonna get somebody
killed out there!

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.962
Just worry about yourself
for once, blondie!

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:51.922
You know him, yeah?
So help the poor guy!

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:56.177
[WOLFWOOD grunts]
It's too late.

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.054
Huh?

00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:59.764
[grunts]

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:03.267
[gunshots]

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.019
Hey! You can't win!

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:07.772
[VASH] Please, stop!
It's me you're after!

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.825
[LIVIO gasps]

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.453
I have to catch up.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.496
[gasps]

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:25.164
[SOLDIER E] Drop your
weapons and surrender!

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:28.250
I told you! You gotta stay back!

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.460
[SOLDIER F]
Engaged on the lower deck.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:30.836
[SOLDIER G]
And we need backup.

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.630
[SOLDIER E]
Reach for the sky!

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.465
[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.884
Stay away if you want to live!

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:38.344
[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:39.845
Be careful!

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:44.183
[VASH, LIVIO grunting]

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.061
[gasps]

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.235
[WOLFWOOD] You're supposed
to be hiding, Needle-Noggin!

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:58.489
There's no way in hell I'm gonna
let you two kill each other!

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:02.284
[ZAZIE laughs]

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:05.162
[ZAZIE] The Punisher's
in a sticky spot, huh?

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:12.753
[LEGATO chuckles] Yes, a
difficult position indeed.

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:16.590
[LEGATO] If his brother dies,
they'll continue to cycle

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.050
through children
at the orphanage

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:20.928
until they find another with
good chemical aptitude.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.140
[ZAZIE] Humans and their
silly priorities.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.601
He needs to learn that he
can't protect everyone.

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:31.564
[grunts]
Damn it!

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:34.150
[LIVIO grunts]

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.318
--Shut up and hide already!
--[VASH] No way!

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.028
Hide, or I'll kill you!

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.697
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER A]
We are assessing the situation

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:40.740
on the lower deck.

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.616
Please follow your
attendant's instructions.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.702
Hurry!

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.999
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER A]
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.833
Your safety...

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:53.252
[LEGATO]
Emotion weighs us down.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:58.090
Love. Attachment.
I don't understand such things.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.763
It has long been time to give
up on your little brother.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:07.141
You must finally learn
to accept reality.

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.444
[MALE WORKER B shouts]

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.114
[WOLFWOOD, VASH gasp]

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:34.543
[gasps] This ain't good.
Ship's off course.

00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:38.714
[PASSENGERS,
shouting, chattering]

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:42.718
[WOOLFWOOD, VASH gasp]

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.262
[BAD LADS laughing, shouting]

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:46.722
[VASH gasps]

00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:58.609
[WOLFWOOD] The Bad Lads Gang?
Of all times, they choose now?

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:05.658
[LEGATO] Well? What's your
next move, Punisher?

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:09.078
[LEGATO]
Who shall you kill?

00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:14.500
[LEGATO]
And who shall you save?

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:15.584
[grunts]

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.878
[grunts]

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.884
[ZAZIE laughs]

00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:27.179
[ZAZIE]
I've got you now.
