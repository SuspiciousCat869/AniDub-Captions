of fresh meat.

[BANDIT B]
Maybe, but before I die,

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.270
I wanna chow down on some
grub made from plants!

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:23.398
[BANDIT C laughing]
And I wanna be king of the sand!

Shut up, or you're gonna get me

Huh? That guy. Y'all see him?

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.497
[BANDIT B] Why is he
wearing a suit out here?

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.332
[BANDIT C]
He's not long for this world.

both of whom have
been identified

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.128
as possible accomplices.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.547
The seven cities' military
police have added the pair

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.675
to their search as
persons of interest.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:56.802
Oh, incredible, so now
we're wanted, too?

Huh? I can't steal his food.

[MERYL gasps]

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.158
[ROBERTO] The hell's running
through that spiky head of his?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.662
Eh, I suppose that's
between him and God.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.834
[ROBERTO]
Hm?

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.839
[MERYL gasps]
A sandstorm?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.759
[ROBERTO] Close, but no cigar.
More like a Worm storm.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:38.969
[MERYL]
Eh...

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.970
Around these parts,

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.806
Worms are considered an
important source of protein.

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.307
If you can stomach
their appearance,

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.851
they make for
pretty decent food.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:49.438
And suddenly, starvation doesn't
sound all that bad to me.

nothing on them.

Into your pearly gates?
Nah, that sounds off.

What's with the cross?

should've asked for my rates

hire anyone,

we had the chance!

detached electrons it holds.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.705
[VASH]
Come on, nobody's dead, okay?

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.665
As soon as we
find them, we'll go.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:52.837
[exhales] Just jumpin' to risk
your life for theirs, huh?

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.172
Huh?

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.716
[WOLFWOOD]
Got a god complex or death wish?

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.968
Heh. Guess time will tell.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:10.355
You only get
one life, you know?

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.815
Self-sacrifice might
satisfy the ego,

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.859
but don't throw your life away.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.402
[VASH gasps]

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.363
[WOLFWOOD]
Survival's everything.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:22.325
[ROBERTO]
Slow your roll, Stampede.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.328
They always take the first
bite to get your guard down,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.872
then lace the rest with poison
before passing it to you,

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.750
the target. It's a textbook
assassination technique.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:31.542
Huh?

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.253
I'm a reporter after all.

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:35.713
And though our agency's not
much to write home about,

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.548
we get decent intel.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.259
I heard something the other day.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.053
Something about folks who can
control the Worms 'round here.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.472
[WOLFWOOD laughs]
You accusing me?

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:48.017
Then allow me to remind you.
I'm trapped in here, too.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.520
[ROBERTO] If you're so innocent,
how about you unwrap

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.982
that precious cross of yours
and let me take a look?

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.192
I'm getting real
tired of this game.

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.986
Based on the way you're
lugging it around,

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:01.447
it's safe to say it's too heavy
to be a standard wooden cross.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.408
Now, give us a little peek,
why don't you?

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:06.619
[WOLFWOOD laughs]
What, are you going to make me?

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:10.832
That derringer's too light to do
much damage, but you can try.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.875
[VASH chuckles nervously] We're
all friends here, aren't we?

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.252
Just trust me with this one.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.255
This guy's the type of killer
that does his work with a smile.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.841
Nah. I think I've gotta
disagree with you there.

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:21.551
And what makes you so sure?

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:25.513
[VASH sighs] Those are
the eyes of a good guy.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:26.764
[gasps]

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.187
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.065
[VASH laughs]
Good guy, see?

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.112
[VASH]
Roberto?

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:50.330
Meryl...? Roberto?

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:53.583
[WOLFWOOD] It's pointless.
They're long digested by now.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:56.544
I don't know. This place is
covered in all sorts of remains.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.047
Worms might not be the
speediest digesters.

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.549
Plus, no reporter-shaped
skeletons.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.426
All that to say...?

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:07.555
That it's way too early
to throw in the ol' towel.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.307
Fine.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:13.686
But wandering in circles
isn't the best strategy.

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:15.855
[VASH gasps]

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:18.232
Maybe they already found
their way outta here.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.525
Maybe we're the lost ones.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:24.530
Hey, hey. No more scaring me,
please and thank you!

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:25.782
[VASH, WOLFWOOD gasp]

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:35.958
[VASH, WOLFWOOD yell]

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.838
[WOLFWOOD] We were in
the damn thing's nose?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.091
[BANDIT A]
Hey, are you guys okay?

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:44.759
[BANDIT C]
That was a Worm spout!

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.053
Hurry up, y'all!
It's behind you!

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.679
[BANDIT B]
I've never seen one so massive!

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.640
[BANDIT C]
Serpentine! Serpentine!

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.101
[BANDIT B]
Run! Don't you wanna live?

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.102
[VASH gasps]

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:57.355
Hey, stop! You won.
Quit while you're ahead!

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.023
[VASH grunts]

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.610
[grunts] There's no guarantee
you're gonna be so lucky

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:03.569
in round two!

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.113
[VASH]
You should go now.

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:07.865
[BANDIT A]
What the hell are you doing?

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.367
[BANDIT C]
This way!

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.827
You fool!

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:27.218
[VASH grunts]

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:38.896
[VASH]
You're alive.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.190
[ZAZIE gasps]

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:47.155
[VASH grunts]
You're all right now.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.533
--[thudding]
--[VASH gasps]

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:55.246
[WOLFWOOD] You've known me for
all of a day, and you've let me

00:15:55.288 --> 00:16:00.751
out of your sight at least
a few dozen times now.

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:03.212
Well, I mean, you haven't
shot me yet, have you?

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.882
Ha, ha.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.425
--[ZAZIE grunts]
--[buzzing]

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:11.679
[VASH] That tiny buzzing sound.
It must be you.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:13.806
You're the one
controlling the Worms.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.725
Whoa. Well, that's weird.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:19.479
Regular old humans shouldn't be
able to hear that sound at all.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.565
Congrats. I guess
you're onto me, huh?

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.400
[VASH]
Did you murder that couple?

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:25.359
[ZAZIE]
It's funny.

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:28.321
Whenever humans see a kid
hanging around grown-ups,

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:30.448
they assume they're a family.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.034
Can you please just tell
me where my friends are?

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.828
You came back for the
girl and the old guy?

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.624
[laughs]

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:42.210
I don't understand you at all.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:47.006
[ZAZIE] You would sacrifice
your life for a tiny chance

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:48.716
to save theirs?

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:56.474
[VASH gasps]

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.476
C'mon, just give 'em back, okay?

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.478
Look, if you're so
certain I have them,

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.439
then why don't you make me?

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:06.526
[VASH grunting]

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:10.279
[WOLFWOOD] And you left
yourself wide open. Again.

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:20.498
[chuckles]
You hungry?

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.171
--[gasps]
--[WOLFWOOD] Then eat this!

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:50.486
[VASH]
Who are you?

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.363
[WOLFWOOD]
Just an undertaker.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.951
Bye, see ya! Well, maybe.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.120
Chances are you won't
even make it out of here.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.288
Real shame, huh?

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:05.459
[laughs]

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.086
[VASH]
Hey! Come back!

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:14.844
[WOLFWOOD] Anyone who tries
to eat me... has hell to pay.

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:23.227
Make sure your dinner
doesn't bite back.

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:46.042
[BANDITS gasp, laugh]

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:52.256
The fresher the better,
that's what I say!

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:53.174
[MERYL groans]

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:55.176
What's wrong?
You still feeling sick?

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:59.221
Oh, no. I'm all good, thank you.

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.681
Though we may have
our differences,

00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:01.641
I appreciate you saving--

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.434
[WOLFWOOD]
Here, dig in.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.310
[MERYL]
I'll have to pass.

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:07.021
[WOLFWOOD] Are any of you
freaks interested in survival?

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:10.066
Come on. Open wide! It's good!

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:11.067
[MERYL]
Hands off me!

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:12.360
[ROBERTO]
What a guy.

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:15.988
His weapon of salvation is a
weapon of mass destruction.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.657
That explains its weight.

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:19.617
[VASH chuckles]

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:22.703
I did try to warn you
that he was bad news.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:25.247
It's thanks to him we're not
melting in a Worm right now.

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.875
You're seriously going to
thank the gun-slinging psycho

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:31.629
for slinging the gun?
Bit too generous, if you ask me.

00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:36.092
[VASH]
Heard that one before.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:40.137
[ROBERTO sighs] Well, then it
might be time to listen.

00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.725
You're going to starve to death.

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:45.726
And that's my choice to make.

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:47.937
It's pretty childish
to be picky.

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.188
Hilarious, coming from you!

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.273
Hey, I ate my dinner.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.195
[MERYL gasps]
Look at you!

00:19:57.238 --> 00:20:02.618
You think I deserve to eat and
laugh and stuff, don't you?

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.580
[chuckles]
The name's Nicholas D. Wolfwood.

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.125
[VASH]
Vash the Stampede.

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.334
[WOLFWOOD]
Needle-Noggin.

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.878
Pardon me?

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.964
[WOLFWOOD]
Well, better get moving.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.966
[MERYL] Huh? You think
you're coming with us?

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:19.343
[WOLFWOOD] With the kind of
folks you all are dealing with,

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.970
you could use an undertaker.

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.179
Gee thanks, but no.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.681
Half off, whaddya say?

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.307
Yeah, no thank you!

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:28.227
You should ask him why he
thinks he can charge us.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.271
Just tell this con
artist to get lost!

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:33.065
[ROBERTO] I've love to, but it's
not like we ever got permission

00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:34.567
to run with the Stampede.

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:36.193
Come on, that isn't
the same at all!

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.570
Damn, grandpa.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:40.364
I wouldn't've pegged you
as the reasonable one.

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:42.408
Ha! Thank ya, sir.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.118
You shouldn't've pegged
me as generous, either.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.911
Yikes, God frowns
on cheapskates.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:48.456
None for you! We can't
afford two smokers!

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:50.166
[VASH] Hey, guys!
Get a look at the sky!

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:52.293
The grownups are talking!

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:56.005
[gasps]

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.631
[MERYL]
It's gorgeous.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:04.138
[ROBERTO] You are aware those
are all Worms, aren't you?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.057
[MERYL] And it's ruined.
Thanks for that.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:14.106
[WOLFWOOD inhales,
exhales deeply]

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:20.863
Talk about overkill.
You nearly got me, too.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.159
[WOLFWOOD]
Zazie the Beast.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.745
Boo-hoo. You made it out
fine and ultimately

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.914
earned their trust, right?

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.124
Now you'll get to
kill some friends!

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:34.794
Your favorite pastime!

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:37.713
Be honest. You couldn't care
less about taking human lives

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:39.632
if you tried, could you?

00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:44.178
[ZAZIE laughs] I can see
it in your eyes, you know.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.764
Ha. It's no biggie.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:53.145
I just keep my head down and
do my job, whatever that may be.

00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:56.607
[snores]

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:59.860
[CONRAD] In that moment,
Vash the Stampede manifested

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:02.279
what must've been the
gate that allows access

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:05.074
to the higher dimension.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:08.577
As far as I can tell,
said gate is still locked.

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:10.955
His morality and ethics
are functioning

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:12.873
as a defensive measure.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.921
Your younger brother is more
human than most anyone.

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:25.594
[KNIVES chuckles]
No fear.

00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:29.431
We will pry it open.

00:22:29.473 --> 00:22:33.435
And if we must, we'll destroy
his very being.
