Of course I don't!

[VASH]
Look around.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.292
The Steamer's made
from Spacefaring parts.

It was used to destroy
asteroids and stuff.

this should be...

you can't stop it?

Well, not this way.

But I guess we can still try
to turn the cannon manually.

Huh? Turn the
spaceship-sized cannon?
