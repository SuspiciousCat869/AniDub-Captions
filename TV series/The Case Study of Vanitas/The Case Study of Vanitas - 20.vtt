[MIKHAIL]
Aw. Has that memory returned?

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
You poor thing.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.328 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] I hate to see you
this way, Mademoiselle.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.553 position:50% align:center
[ringing]

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.929 position:50% align:center
[ORLOK]
Hm?

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:19.723 position:50% align:center
Please, Count Orlok,
we need your help, right now!

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:20.974 position:50% align:center
It's Vanitas!

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
I believe he might be
about to die, sir!

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.729 position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.230 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
He's refused to get up

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.650 position:50% align:center
ever since we returned to Paris
and that was ten days ago!

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
But when I ask him
what the trouble is...

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
The pain is excruciating.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.823 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] He keeps repeating
that over and over!

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:39.743 position:50% align:center
He won't even eat!
I'm so frightened.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.786 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to do.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.996 position:50% align:center
[MURR meowing]

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.956 position:50% align:center
Have you considered
just letting him die?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
Let him speak, Manet.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
After all, we mustn't
dismiss him

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center
until Murr has had
a chance to eat.

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] He refuses to let
a doctor anywhere near him,

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.883 position:50% align:center
and it seems Amelia
has taken the day off

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
to take care of her own affairs.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
You're his last hope!

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Poor baby!

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.680 position:50% align:center
I'd rather die
than have someone

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.974 position:50% align:center
examine my body,
so you can forget that.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.559 position:50% align:center
But, Vanitas...

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
There's no point.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
I know this is no
ordinary sickness.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
I've pored through all of my
medical books, and none of them

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.651 position:50% align:center
can tell me a thing
about what ails me!

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I see, so that's why you
had that big pile of books

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
next to your bed.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
I know what's wrong!

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
Jeanne must have put
some kind of curse upon me!

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
The Hellfire Witch?

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
She cursed you?

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
She drank my blood in Gévaudan,

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
and that was when the symptoms
first began to appear!

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.631 position:50% align:center
Since then, my face
is always flushed

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
and my heart feels like
it's trapped in a vice!

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
It's been beating
out of control!

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ] Wait.
--[MANET] What?

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] And worst of all,
I seem fixated on Jeanne.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how
I try to distract myself!

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
What the devil is this?!

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
It's started to consume
my every waking moment!

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
There was a bizarre
sensation when she bit me.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
It felt so exhilarating,
better than ever before!

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
--[MANET] Oh!
--[NOÉ] Uh...

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt,
whatever she did

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
caused me to fall terribly ill!

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
Maybe her fangs
were dipped in poison!

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
I could die any second!

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
[NOX]
Master Orlok?

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
[ORLOK]
Mm-hm. Get out!

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
No! Have mercy, Count Orlok!

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
At least tell me
what I should do!

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, sir!

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
If you won't help Vanitas,
I'll kick down this door!

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
[MANET] Excuse me,
did you hear what he just

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
threatened to do out there?

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
[NOX] You'd better not
do anything foolish,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
you barbarians!

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
<i>Mon dieu</i> , what's wrong?
I've never had these feelings.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
What am I supposed
to do with them?

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
<i>J'taime, ma cheri!</i>

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
My heart was in such agony
while we were separated!

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
I couldn't think of
anything but your face!

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
That's when it dawned on me.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center
That pain in my chest was my
deep, undying love for you!

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Can you please explain
to me what love is?

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] No. No...
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
This isn't happening!

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
It makes no sense!

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
<i>Pardonnez!</i>

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
[shrieks] Why are you here?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
Ah, it's Vincent!

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
Well, what a surprise. Bonjour!

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
A friend of yours?

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
Let me introduce you, Vincent.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
This gentleman is my
trusted comrade, Olivier.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
Olivier? He's the Obsidian?

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
He looks upset.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
Have you been causing trouble
outside of work, as well?

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
What am I to do with you?

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Vincent and I

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.720 position:50% align:center
had a drinking contest
a while back, but only once!

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
Yes, well, I happen to know

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
that you absorb
liquor like a sponge.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
I pity him.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
I see Roland's done you wrong.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
Please, let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Uh, I dunno,
he seems like he may be

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
in a bit of a hurry.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] Nonsense, I want
to hear about what you do

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
in your personal time,
even if it involves

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
some sort of secret affair.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS gasps]

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.452 position:50% align:center
Affair? Oh, no,
I don't have a lover!

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Not now.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Not <i>now</i> ?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you
were dumped again?

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Mm...

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
And that woman
threw herself at you.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
You're the one
the ladies like most,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
we all know it. You should see.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
He's so popular, the girls
just flock to him in droves!

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm a handsome fellow.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
Not to mention he's humble!

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, you should
inform me ahead of time

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
if you're up to something.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
It'll save me a great deal
of suffering in the long run,

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
even if it's difficult to hear.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
Oh, are you sure?
Your life must be stressful!

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] You're the reason
my life is stressful!

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Um, since you insisted.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
I think I will have a coffee.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
Look at this!

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
They let tourists operate
a small flying machine

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
at the mooring tower. Doesn't
it look like fun, Vincent?

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
Olivier and I tried it
just before we came here,

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
and we got to fly
all over Paris!

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.383 position:50% align:center
You should go before
the exposition starts!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
The lines'll be much shorter!

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Uh... It's been
over 15 minutes now

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
and Vanitas hasn't said
so much as a word to us.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Your coffee. It's getting cold.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Uh--

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
So...?

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.321 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS grumbles]

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND hums]

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Let me ask you--!

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Mm?

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
If I may be so bold...

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
[clears throat, stammers]

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:21.835 position:50% align:center
Do you have much experience
in the ways of romance?

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center
Romance? I don't know.
I can't say much for myself,

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
but I believe Olivier
knows a few things.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.634 position:50% align:center
I certainly do.

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
You see, my friend is having
a bit of a problem.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
Ah? Oh! Right!

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Lately, no matter
how hard I--he tries,

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
he can't stop himself
from thinking about

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
a certain woman in his life.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
His heart aches constantly

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
and he can't even
sleep at night.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
Or, so he tells me.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Oh?

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
How about the lady?
Tell us about her!

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
Er. She's pretty.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
Delicate skin, nice body.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
She sounds lovely.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:03.960 position:50% align:center
Did something happen recently

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
to cause him to think
about her so obsessively?

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Uh, I don't
know. Didn't ask.

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
At the beginning,
he simply enjoyed teasing her.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
He assumed it was
nothing more than that.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.976 position:50% align:center
But then, as they spent
more time together,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
he saw so many different
and beautiful sides of her,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center
he was thrown for a loop.

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
The other day, she advanced
upon him so boldly,

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
as if to demand he become hers.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
Then she kissed him! And then!

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
He saw that woman smile

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
in a way she never had before.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
That's all I know.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
But he explained it
so passionately,

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
the image of her became
seared into my mind, as well.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER laughs, coughs]

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
Olivier.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, but I
was so enthralled

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.638 position:50% align:center
with your friend's story that
I forgot to chew my dessert.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
Her smile shines, right?

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Then you know?

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.102 position:50% align:center
Oh, I understand you perfectly.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
The cause is clear.
It's definitely love!

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.067 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
What's wrong?

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.821 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Love? What a
positively gruesome fate!

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
True love? Oh, no!

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
How do I cure
this awful sickness?

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
I'm used to pain,
but this is too much!

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:22.497 position:50% align:center
Van--

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
I can't take it anymore.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center
It feels like my very identity

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
is being rewritten
from the inside out.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
It's sickening!

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
He's not even trying to pretend

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
this is about a friend anymore.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Please don't
despair, dear Vincent!

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
From what you told me,
it sounds like this young lady

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
returns your affections!

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
That's something to be
happy about, isn't it?

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
<i>Non?</i>

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
There's no way that's the case.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
It couldn't be!

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
<i>Porquoi?</i>

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
She can't!

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
I approached her
with full confidence

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
that she wouldn't
have those feelings!

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
And why's that?

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
Because it's such
a revolting idea!

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
How could it be
possible to love

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
a person like me?

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.175 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that?

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
I knew you were miserable,

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
but you hate yourself
far more than I thought.

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
Do not fear!
After all, you have me!

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
If you don't have the
strength to love yourself.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to double
the warmth and affection

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
I already feel for you!

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center
And the love of God
rains down on each of us.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
You've simply failed
to acknowledge it

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
until this moment!

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
We're made in His image,

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.034 position:50% align:center
so you needn't be
afraid to love!

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
Right now, I'm just
mostly afraid of you!

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone!

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
It was stupid of me
to ask you for advice!

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
You're such an idiot!

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
I don't know why I even thought
talking to you would be useful!

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
Idiot!

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Idiot!

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
Bonjour, Gilbert.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
Go on. You should
probably follow him.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.056 position:50% align:center
Uh... Right!

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
See you later, Roland!

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND laughs]

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
So that's him,

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
the Blue Moon Clan fellow
I've heard talk about.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
Oopsie. The cat's
out of the bag.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ] Uh...
--[VANITAS screams]

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.406 position:50% align:center
That's surprising.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
It's never been like you
to become attached to people.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Oh, really? I seem attached?

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
That's the way it looked
from where I'm sitting.

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] I see.
The thing about Vanitas is,

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
he always seems like he's
hanging on by his last thread.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
Like he would somehow
fall to pieces

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
if I took my eyes off him
for even a moment.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.221 position:50% align:center
And I can't leave him like that.

00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Master Luca.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
I am sincerely sorry for this.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
My actions caused so much
unnecessary trouble.

00:12:57.861 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
My lord uncle ordered it.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
I see no reason you
should apologize for that.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
And anyway, we should just enjoy
our tea before it gets cold.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
And please, tell me all
you can about Gévaudan.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
It must have been
quite an adventure.

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] Oh, dear, that sounds
like a terrible experience.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it isn't my place to
say something like this, but...

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
In the end, I'm happy to hear
that you weren't forced

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
to take the life of
your dear friend.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
After all, I can't stand
the sight of you looking sad.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
That's so kind.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
Anyway, where is this Chloé now?

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:45.116 position:50% align:center
I don't know, I left Gévaudan
as soon as it was over.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
It was left up to
Vanitas after that.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
We decided that it
would be for the best.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
If I'm questioned for
Chloe's whereabouts,

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
there'll be nothing
for me to say.

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Right.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] But still,
I'm sure she'll be fine.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
I know she will.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
Vanitas is kind,
and he would never

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.389 position:50% align:center
let anything dangerous
happen to Chloé.

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:11.726 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] Hm? I have to say
I'm surprised, Jeanne.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
This is a bit out
of character for you.

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:15.897 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize you'd
grown to trust him

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
so much through all of that.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
It's odd, now that
you mention it.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.572 position:50% align:center
Actually, since I came
back from Gévaudan,

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
it's been impossible
for me to get him

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
out of my mind
for even a moment.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
The revulsion I felt
when we first met him

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
has disappeared and I can see a
certain shine in his smile now.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:37.585 position:50% align:center
I know that it's
ridiculous to say,

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
but just the thought of
him makes my heart pound.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
[squeals] Stop it, Jeanne!
That makes no sense!

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
Listen to yourself,
you sound crazy!

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
Come now. There has
to be a mistake.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
Did you fall in love with him?

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:58.398 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Love? Is that it?

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
Do I love Vanitas?

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Oh.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
"Oh"?

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE sighs]

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
[LUCA yelping]

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
You have to help us
at once, Dominique!

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
There is something
terribly wrong

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.510 position:50% align:center
with my sweet precious Jeanne!

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
All right, then, what seems
to be the trouble?

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
Well, you see, Lady Dominique.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.435 position:50% align:center
I have a bit of a problem.

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
Despite all my efforts not to,
I've somehow fallen for Vanitas.

00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE, LUCA scream]

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
I see. Well, let's
talk through it calmly.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.863 position:50% align:center
<i>Bon!</i>

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] First, have you
eaten anything unusual lately?

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps you may have
suffered a serious head injury?

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Maybe someone poisoned you

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
when they drank your
blood or something!

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
Are you sure your eyes
are working properly?

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:57.707 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What?

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
We're trying to
come up with some sort

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
of logical explanation for
why you'd allow yourself

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
to be enamored with a rat!

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
It's insanity!

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
I would understand it
if you had feelings for Noé!

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:06.174 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Huh?

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
After all, he's
strong, handsome,

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:08.510 position:50% align:center
sweet, and wonderful!

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Domi!

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
There's not a woman alive

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
who could resist
his perfect charms!

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
I don't want her
to fall in love with Noé!

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Well, no, neither do I!

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center
My point is that Noé and
Vanitas are polar opposites!

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
Vanitas treated you
terribly, remember?

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
I know, but recently,
he's protected me

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center
and come to my rescue on several
occasions. He is so decent!

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.616 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] So, it's all
or nothing with this girl.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
Talk about emotional whiplash.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
This has made me so happy.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
I always thought it was
impossible for a <i>bourreau</i>

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:42.419 position:50% align:center
like myself to find
love and fulfillment.

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
Lately, my heart's
always racing.

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
I'm shaking. I wouldn't
trade this for anything.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
There's only one thing about
it that has me concerned.

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
Really, just one thing?

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
If all these feelings
for Vanitas continue

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
to grow out of my control,
and I see him again

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
before I find a way
to manage them...

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Grr.

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
Roar.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
I fear that, the moment
our eyes meet,

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
I'll be overcome with
the insatiable urge

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
to consummate our love.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
What's gotten into you?

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
From what I hear,
going all the way too early

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
is a poor strategy.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
Forget strategy!

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
That sort of behavior
is vulgar and crass!

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
What? No.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
Mother made a pass at Father
as soon as they met.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
She said that it worked
wonderfully for them.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
She told you that?

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
Listen, it is not my place
to criticize your parents,

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center
but the fact is, a proper
courtship should start

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
with exchanging letters!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Should it,
Master Luca? Really?

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
The sky's so pretty.

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Master Luca?

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Look what you've done!

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
You shocked him so badly,
he lost touch with reality!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Oh, no!

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:48.401 position:50% align:center
Master Luca, please
snap out of it!

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten
what he said back then?

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
"I simply have no interest
at all in the sort of person

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
who would harbor affection
for me," remember?

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
Falling in love
with a man like that

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
is a complete waste of time!

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're right.
It's a fool's errand.

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:03.291 position:50% align:center
So, I'm going to practice
hiding my emotions

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
so I can speak to him normally!

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.544 position:50% align:center
No, stop, that's not
the point at all!

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
No need to worry,
it won't be an issue!

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
I'll take every precaution
against letting him

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
figure out how I feel.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, I've had plenty
of time to fine-tune

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
my acting abilities during
our previous date!

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE whines]

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Hold on!

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.142 position:50% align:center
So, you've already
been on a date?

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
I'm completely floored.

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
I had no idea Jeanne was
capable of such intensity.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
I've certainly never seen
her smile like that before.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
When she and I first met,

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
I thought life had robbed her
of her confidence forever,

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
that she would always
need me around

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
to protect her from the world.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
But that's not necessary.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if Vanitas
is the cause of it,

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
but she's so much
more expressive now.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
She has me transfixed.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] I can see why
she'd be on Noé's mind.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
To tell the truth,
I'm nothing like her.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Dominique?

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé... Noé...

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
Noé!

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
I know you're busy sulking,
but if you don't

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
come down soon, you're
going to catch a cold.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:20.910 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Quiet.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
And by the way, I just
remembered that when

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
we talked to the Count,
Manet told me something.

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Don't care.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Ever since we left for Gévaudan,

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
there's been a string of vampire
attacks going on in Paris.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
Don't you think there
might be a curse-bearer

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
at the root of it?

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Mm-mm.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Vanitas.
Before we made that trip,

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
I'd never met a vampire
who despised humans

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.399 position:50% align:center
with all their heart.

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
I hated Astolfo for that,
and I hated fighting him,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't bear
to let him win, either.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I started
to wonder something.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
I just thought for all that
you two may have in common,

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
you still took different paths.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I'm sure the
Vampire of the Blue Moon

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
played a significant role.

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
But before all that, your life
could've been totally changed

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
by something as subtle as the
beat of a butterfly's wing.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] It could've been you
I fought in Gévaudan,

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.311 position:50% align:center
or Astolfo I met here in Paris.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.397 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Is there a point to all this?

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What I'm saying is,

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
I'm glad it wasn't a
<i>Chasseur</i> who greeted me

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50% align:center
aboard La Baleine, but a doctor

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:43.159 position:50% align:center
who specializes
in saving vampires.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
In case it wasn't clear,

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
I still dislike you
as much as before.

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I'm happy you're here with
me, exactly the way you are.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'd rather
not have heard it,

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
but I wanted to say
that at least once.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
[footsteps tapping]

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Look at this
great amusement park!

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center
I bet it's fun, maybe
I can go to it someday.

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
[footsteps continue]

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear, Mademoiselle.
Not again!

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
This won't do.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
I instructed you to bring
Monsieur Noé to me.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
Why can't you carry out
this one little request?

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:55.690 position:50% align:center
I must warn you that,
if you fail to comply.

00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
then all that's left
is to use you as bait.

00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, Mademoiselle Domi.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
[slice]
