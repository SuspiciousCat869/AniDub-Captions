00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
Hi there!

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you.
What's your name?

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
I'm Mikhail!

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.073 position:50% align:center
But you can call me
Misha if you want!

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You're not
Mikhail or Misha anymore.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
You're Number 71!

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.833 position:50% align:center
We're nothing but subjects
for Moreau's experiments!

00:00:55.513 --> 00:01:01.061 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL whimpering, screaming]

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.736 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL screaming]

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50% align:center
Please, Doctor.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.739 position:50% align:center
He won't survive
much more of this.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.490 position:50% align:center
The subject is just too young!

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50% align:center
Well, if anything
happens to him,

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
we'll simply move
on to the next one.

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
I'm so close to having
what I've dreamed about!

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.627 position:50% align:center
Soon, I will have
created humans

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:53.715 position:50% align:center
who can serve as a link!

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:55.759 position:50% align:center
No! Please, big brother!

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
I'm scared!

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50% align:center
Please! Don't let them take me!

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Doctor!

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
Let him go, I'll do it.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
Do the procedure on me,
not that feeble little brat!

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
It's just, I think
your work is admirable

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50% align:center
and I want to be a part of it!

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
Ooh! Oh, pinch me,
I must be dreaming.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
Can this really be true?
I don't believe my ears!

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
Has there ever been
a child who's participated

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
in my experiments voluntarily?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
No, of course not!

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
You're more than
welcome, Number 69.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
How could I ever say no?

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
We shall labor hand-in-hand

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
to uncover the great
wisdom of the vampires!

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Um, thank you.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Hey, can I
sleep with you tonight?

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
You're so warm.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
Ta-dah!

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU] It's the final phase
of my grand experiment!

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.763 position:50% align:center
With this machine,
I will connect you both

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
to <i>The Books of Vanitas</i> !

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
You're connecting us with books?

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
Allow me to elaborate,
Number 69!

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
These were created by
the Vampire of the Blue Moon!

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
But as legendary
a being as they were,

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
the tomes before you
are even more special!

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
You see, they're powered
by a unique type of astermite.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Packing sorcery, alchemy,
and other technology into

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
countless tiny machines,
all in the convenient

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
and portable form
of a simple book!

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
And, apparently,
they can even be used

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
to manipulate the World Formula!

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
Such a thing is unfathomable!

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
"Apparently"?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU]
Yes!

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
But I can't open them,
for the life of me!

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
According to my research,
only members

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
of the Blue Moon Clan are able
to access the blasted things!

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
It isn't fair! It isn't right!

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
But fortunately, I soon
had the brilliant idea

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
to transform the two of you into
members of the Blue Moon Clan,

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center
or I suppose "quasi-members"!

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU] I'm going to create
a perfect pair of human proxies,

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
whose only purpose is to
open the <i>Books of Vanitas</i> !

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
You know that funny blue liquid
I've been injecting you with?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Any guess as to what it is?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
Tick, tick, tick.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
Sorry, clock ran out! Aw!

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to
hear the answer?

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
Probably not, but...!

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
It's blood from the actual
Vampire of the Blue Moon!

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:58.983 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU]
What's the matter?

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
Have you been
rendered speechless

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
by this amazing revelation?

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.907 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't blame you!

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
Big brother?

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:10.245 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU] Over time, I've been
gradually injecting this blood

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
into your systems, along with
a bit of special medicine.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, your bodies'
natural rejection response

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
would have killed you!

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
[gags]

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU] Surely, you've
noticed your wounds

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
have been healing
a lot faster recently!

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
Thanks to my ingenious work,
you've been elevated

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
beyond human capability,
you're special, modified beings,

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
the likes of which this
world has never known!

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
That's it, you're dead!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
So, I possess both
<i>Books of Vanitas</i> ,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
and the both of you!

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
Isn't it just perfect?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL screams]

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
Please let go of me!
That hurts! Stop it!

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
You monsters!

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
I'll murder every
last one of you!

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
I swear I will!

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
How dare you?

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
You'll pay for
what you're doing!

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right!

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
There's one more detail!

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
Once the machine starts up,
you boys might become

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
vegetables due to the shock
of linking the two books.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
So let me say this while I can.

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
Thank you, 69 and 71.
You're so brave!

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
I shall never forget the
noble sacrifice you've made.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center

Oh! Goodness me,
what's happening

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
to my precious laboratory?

[grunts]

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
Wha... What's happening?

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
My my, some humans come up with

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
the most ludicrous ideas.
It never ceases to shock me.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:29.634 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, I think I've done
more than enough damage here.

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
I'd better leave before
the <i>Chasseurs</i> arrive

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
to make matters worse.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
No, please don't go away!

Can we come with you?

We need help, please.

Oh, dear.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
I suppose this did happen

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
because of me.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL whimpering]

How could that man be so cruel?

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
And to children, no less.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
Mikhail.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
Now, then, what of you?

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
Will you stay here,
or will you leave with me?

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
Will you come?

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
We've gone far enough.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
We should be safe now.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
What, here?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
That's ridiculous, we're
barely outside of town!

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
The <i>Chasseurs</i> will be here
before you know it!

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
No, they won't.

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
That disturbed scientist--
Moreau, I think it was?

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
His experiments defied
the teachings of the Church.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.331 position:50% align:center
He was a blasphemer.

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
When the <i>Chasseurs</i> arrive
and realize what he's done,

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.504 position:50% align:center
they'll be far less
concerned with finding us

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center
than with controlling
the damage.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
many of the researchers
who worked there

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
have likely been slain.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
By the way, now that we're all

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
safe and sound, I think it would
be wise to introduce ourselves.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
My name is Mikhail,
but you can call me Misha!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:49.065 position:50% align:center
--Don't just blurt it out!
--I'm really happy to meet you!

[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Misha?

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
That's me!

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
I regret to say

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
I have no name
for you to call me.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
Or, perhaps it's
more accurate to say

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
I've yet to find a name
with which I'm satisfied.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
I'm known as the
Vampire of the Blue Moon.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
But if that's too much,

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
there are some who
call me Vanitas.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
So pretty!

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS gasps]

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] That's the
Vampire of the Blue Moon?

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
Brother, no!

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
Ah, you knew to aim for my eyes.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Impressive.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
I take it you're one
of the children

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
the <i>Chasseurs</i> were training.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
Did you take us away so
that you could devour us?

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
Blue blood, like...

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
No, boy.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Then what do you want?

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
Are you hoping to get back
some of that precious blood

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
that they injected into us?

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Not at all.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
I took you away because
you asked for my help.

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
What? But I... didn't...

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
...ask you.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Big brother!

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Oh, my.

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Ah! He's finally waking up now!

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
You'll be safe here.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
This is the home of a human
I've known for some time.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
Friends with a human?
But that's absurd.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
Vampires can't be
friends with humans.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.784 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
You'd be surprised.

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
Alchemists, sorcerers, and their
descendants have always

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
aligned better with vampires
than with the Church.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON] As
soon as you let your guard down,

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
the exhaustion took over.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're used to being on
alert for Misha's protection,

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
but now, all you
must do is rest.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
How about a lullaby?

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
That should help you
to fall asleep.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Ooh, I wanna sing, too!

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
Ah, good.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
Tell me then,
what kinds of songs

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
did your mother sing to you?

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
Mother?

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON] Hm?
Yes. While you were delirious,

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
you called out
for her many times.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
That's a lie.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.378 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
No, it isn't.

00:13:56.461 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.
I couldn't have, because...

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
My mother's been dead
since the day I was born.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
Why would I cry out for her?

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
--[MIKHAIL] Brother...
--[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON] Sh.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
So, before your time at the lab,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
you lived alone
with your father?

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] No, it wasn't just us.
There were others, too.

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Others?

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
My father was
from a good family.

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
He grew up to become a doctor.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
But he fell in love
with my mother.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.861 position:50% align:center
She was in a traveling show
that came into town,

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.696 position:50% align:center
so he left to join them.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON
whistles] He was quite smitten.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] What do you mean,
"traveling show"?

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
It's something like a circus.

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No, it was seedier than that.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
I got the feeling
my father didn't care

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
for those people very much.

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] We traveled
to all sorts of places

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center
with the performers.

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Oh?

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
People would always tell me

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
that I looked a lot
like my mother.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.641 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
I see, then she was a beauty.

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
I think so, too!

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
She died, and it
wouldn't have happened

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
if not for me.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
My father should have
hated me for that, but no.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
When those vampires attacked,
he gave his life to protect me!

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
I thought,

00:15:56.998 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
"Why would he do
such a thing for me?"

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
But he's gone!
So I'll never know!

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
You hate vampires, don't you?

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
I want to wipe them
all out of existence!

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.559 position:50% align:center
That way, this world
can become clean again!

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:20.105 position:50% align:center
So, I dedicated my life
to becoming a <i>Chasseur</i> !

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
I had to!

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.402 position:50% align:center
Moreau used to have vampires

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
brought into the lab for his
experiments all the time.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
Originally, I felt
like they were

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
getting what they deserved.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
But after some time, it became
clear to me that humans

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
are the most vicious
monsters of all.

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
I can only imagine.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
Although, if you
had wanted to escape,

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
I think you could
have managed it.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
Yet you stayed. Why?

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
Well, because Moreau led
the <i>Chasseurs</i> to believe

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
that I had been
killed during battle.

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:04.524 position:50% align:center
He even murdered a stranger
and told them the body was mine.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
Moreau made it clear
that if I left,

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
he would just kidnap
another kid to replace me.

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.408 position:50% align:center
So, I felt like
I had to stay there,

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
to keep it from happening
to someone else.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
I did my best not
to think about it.

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
I didn't understand and it
still doesn't make sense to me.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
How can I move on from that?

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
I've learned something

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
about you, dear.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
Despite all you've faced,
you're a kind child.

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
Ah, but you are.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No, that's not true.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
I'm not. I'm not.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Big brother?

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Forget it!

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.347 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Wipe every word
of it out of your brain!

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
Everything you heard yesterday!
Pretend it never happened!

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.768 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
All of yesterday?

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
Or just, like, a certain part?

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
From the moment
we escaped the lab?

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
Or the part where
you were crying

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
and screaming out "no, no, no"?

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center
Don't you think
I should remember

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:31.820 position:50% align:center
some parts of it, at least?

00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No, you will remember nothing!

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
Ah, so you're awake.
Good timing.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
I just finished
preparing our breakfast.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
Breakfast time?
Yay, I'm starving!

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
Help yourselves!

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
You two need all the
nutrients you can get.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.428 position:50% align:center
I knew it, you really are
trying to kill us, aren't you?

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:58.263 position:50% align:center
I-I'm what?

00:18:58.346 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Why else would you ask us

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
to consume this venomous sludge?

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:03.018 position:50% align:center
It's only soup.

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
I added lots of medicinal
herbs to strengthen you.

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
The milk has been
freshly drawn, as well,

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll
find it delicious.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Drawn from what?
What produces black milk?

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
Not only that,
this room is filthy!

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.032 position:50% align:center
It's full of bugs and rats!

00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
I was too weak to
notice it yesterday,

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
but if you're staying
in someone's house,

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
the least you can do
is keep it clean for them!

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Fine, do everything yourself.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Oh, stop pouting, you big baby!

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
[panting] How's that?

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yummy!

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Hmph.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
You've proven yourself
to be quite a capable child.

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
I have been utterly defeated.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.233 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Can we have some more?

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
I suppose there isn't any point
in concealing the truth.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.868 position:50% align:center
I must admit that the
two of you aren't likely

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
to live for very long.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
It might be a month,
six months.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you'll even
survive five years.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
All I know is that the day
will inevitably come.

Moreau's experiments have

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
forced your bodies beyond
what humans can tolerate.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
And now, you bear a closer
resemblance to vampires.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
You are poised
upon a razor's edge.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
At any point,
the balance could tip,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.403 position:50% align:center
and your existence will be
in unbearable conflict

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
with the natural order.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
As a result of this conflict,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.160 position:50% align:center
your bodies will
begin to break down.

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
Since you've nowhere
else to turn,

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
I ask you to follow me.

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
And together, we will search

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
for a way to save you from
your unthinkable fate.

Father, am I going to die?

Well, dear, there's one course

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
of action I've yet to mention.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
I could make the two of you
into members of my clan.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
But I had hoped
that I would never

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
need to resort
to such a solution.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
Why can't we, Father?
That sounds perfect to me.

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
If we join your clan,
that means the three of us

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
can live together forever. I
don't see any problem with that!

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
Even if I die tomorrow,
I won't join!

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:41.843 position:50% align:center
I want to continue being human
until I draw my final breath.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center
Just let me rot!
It's better that way.

00:21:56.441 --> 00:22:00.278 position:50% align:center
Ah. Hi! You finally
found your way here.

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:01.780 position:50% align:center
Good to see ya!
