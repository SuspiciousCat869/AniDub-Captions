00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.014 position:50% align:center
I got something!

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.056 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Dante.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
I thought Dominique
was with you.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:18.810 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Huh? Domi?

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
Aw, hell. Of course
you were onto us.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
You two are about as subtle

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
as of a pair of wild elephants.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
But never mind that!
I just got a crazy bit of info!

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
Get a load of this!
The Beast of Gévaudan lives!

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
And it's back
to its old business!

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs]
Interesting!

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
Well, tell me everything.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.377 position:50% align:center
Tout suite.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Ooh!

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] We'll take
this train to Gévaudan.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
<i>Pardonnez moi!</i>

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO] Oh, no.
Entirely my fault, monsieur.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
No harm.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé, over here!

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:05.940 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I'll be right there, Vanitas!

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Dearest Teacher, I hope
this letter finds you well.

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center
Vanitas and I are
still traveling together.

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
We've left Paris and journeyed

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
to the distant
region of Gévaudan.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Look at that, Vanitas!

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
There's a village down there!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
That's Saugues, isn't it?
Wow, it's such a gorgeous place!

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure why, but the
sight reminds me of Averoigne.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
That's it.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
Why have you been so
relentlessly obnoxiously chipper

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
since we boarded this wagon?

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] 
Why do you look like

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
you're praying for
an early death?

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
Because I'm freezing cold!

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
Aw. Someone's a big baby.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
<i>Tais-toi!</i>

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50% align:center
Unlike you two imbeciles, I am
a highly sensitive creature!

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
And by the way, why are you two
information hustlers even here?

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
We can do whatever we want to.
What's it to you, buddy?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.809 position:50% align:center
Like always, we're trying to
collect information to sell!

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
Precisely.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
Not to mention, there
was that whole mess

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
with the Chasseurs, as well.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
Those enhanced humans or
whatever they are really did

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
a number on me a while back,
and I won't be satisfied

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center
until I give them the clobbering
they so justly deserve.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
Oh, Dante, it's so sweet
of you to avenge me!

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
You could have just said
you wanted to murder

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
that mad ruffian
who assaulted me,

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
but of course, I know
exactly what you meant!

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I'm sure
gathering intel is one part

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
of why they're here,
but there's probably

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
an ulterior motive, too.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
First, we'll stash our
belongings at the inn,

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
and then we'll head to where
the bodies were found.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
I'd like to search
for signs of the Beast

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
before it gets too dark out.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Here in Gévaudan,
during the 18th century,

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
the monster ripped over 100
women and children apart.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
It had pointed ears,
a large, twisted maw,

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
razor-sharp claws, and red fur.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
It was said to have
resembled a giant wolf.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Do you really
believe such a creature

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
could be lurking here
in the Silver Forest?

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.419 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
It's not just the Beast.

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Apparently, there's a witch

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
dwelling within these woods
who wields unspeakable power.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.384 position:50% align:center
[DANTE, JOHANN groan]

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
A witch?

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center
Vanitas, you suspect
the Beast of Gévaudan

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
might be a curse-bearing
vampire, is that right?

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Based on the legends.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] If that's true, then the
curse-bearer and the witch

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.024 position:50% align:center
are probably connected
in some way.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
The point is that
someone could be cursed,

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
and that's the reason I've come
to this god forsaken place.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center
Oh, my god,
what was that sound?

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
It was super scary.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
It sounded like a bird.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:35.085 position:50% align:center
The smell of the forest air.
It brings back such memories!

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
Domi and I used to play together
in the woods when we were kids!

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Tree nuts, too!

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
Hey! Forget about the nuts!

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
But those are the
kind you can eat!

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
You have to try them, Vanitas!

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ giggles]

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS sighs]

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
You know, you're
enjoying yourself

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
a lot more than
I would've expected.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:53.395 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50% align:center
With that one, I mean.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
Given it's you, I thought
for sure you'd ditch him

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
as soon as he started to
cast the slightest shadow

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
on your nerves.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
Trust me, I tried, but
that hopeless idiot was

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
one step ahead of me,
so we're stuck together!

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
Ooh. I think I get you.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
Into the strong,
protective type, huh?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
You are on thin ice, baldy!

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
Johann! Do not let Noé
out of your sight.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
I know from bitter experience,
he'll disappear on you quick!

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
Ah! You're right, he left
in the blink of an eye!

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
He is slippery!

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
Noé!

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.894 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Ah. There it is!

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
Murr, you bad kitty!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
We have to stay with the others!

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
But they were just here.
What happened?

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
I know I didn't wander
that far away.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.456 position:50% align:center
Maybe the witch cast a spell.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] Oh, dear,
that sweet simple boy

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
is nowhere to be found!

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Huh? Where'd this come from?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
What the hell? I'm freezing!

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] We have
bigger problems, Dante!

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] My word,
he's stiff as a monument!

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Get it together,
you dumb quack!

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
Shh! Someone's coming!

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
[DRAGOON CAPTAIN 13A]
Report.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
[DRAGOON 13A]
Yes, sir.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
The trespasser claims
to be with the Church,

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
but something doesn't
seem right about her.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.839 position:50% align:center
I was just on my way to report
it to Monsieur Antoine.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
[DRAGOON CAPTAIN 13A]
Well, it'll have to wait!

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.426 position:50% align:center
First, we must find the Beast!

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
We'll slaughter
that vicious fiend

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
and present its corpse
to His Majesty!

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Is it me, or are they
dressed kind of old-timey?

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
And did he say "His Majesty?"

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
They're dragoons.

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Huh?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.650 position:50% align:center
Louis the 15th was king
during the 18th-century attacks.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
He ordered his soldiers to
investigate the sightings.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
As I recall,

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
Antoine was the name
of his First Musketeer.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
What? That doesn't
make any sense, though.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
It sounds like
you're trying to say

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.830 position:50% align:center
we traveled back
in time somehow.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
Heh. It would appear
the hand of fate has been

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
less than kind to us today.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
[WOLVES howl]

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.010 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. Do you hear that?

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
Aw, crap! It's here!

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
The Beast of Gévaudan!

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.122 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Nobody told me
it was as big as a building!

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
So, you think that
did anything to it?

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
No, it didn't.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
[howls]

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
[GROUP panting]

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
So, what, guns don't kill it?

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No, it heals too quickly.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:31.946 position:50% align:center
A red-eyed beast.
A witch in the forest.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
Not to mention those
18th-century dragoons we saw.

It's as though we
traveled back in time.

What kind of strange
malnomen is this?

[VANITAS]
Noe! You damned idiot!

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.215 position:50% align:center
Where are you? Of all
times to vanish, why now?

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center
Jeanne, how did...

Oh, hi.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO]
I remember you!

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
We met at the train station
in Paris, <i>n'est ce pas</i> ?

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Who are you?

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
I'm The Twelfth
Paladin, Astolfo,

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.271 position:50% align:center
honored to hold
the title of Garnet.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
Proud member of the Chasseurs.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure to be
acquainted, monsieur.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.613 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Those men were humans.

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
If you're a Chasseur,
why did you murder them?

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO]
That gang of disgusting brutes

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
mistook me for a woman.

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What?

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
Despite my protests,

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't listen
to a word I said.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
I warned them three times

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
not to befoul me
with their wretched hands.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
Anyone would agree
that I acted purely

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
out of self-defense.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO] You seem
to be mistaken, as well.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
You see, it isn't a
Chasseur's responsibility

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.682 position:50% align:center
to protect humans.

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
Our job is to hunt vampires!

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
Have I made myself
clear, monsieur?

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
Eyes of red.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
There's no longer
a doubt in my mind.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
You're a vampire!

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center

What's the matter?

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going to fight back?

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] He enjoys this.
The battle, the bloodshed!

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
One thing's for sure.

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
He's nothing like Roland
or the other <i>Chasseurs</i> !

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
[DRAGOON 13B sputters]

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
He's not dead!

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO]
Honestly.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
Showing up here and
impeding me in my work

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
wasn't enough for you, was it?

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
No, you had to go and
ruin all my fun, as well.

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
That's a mistake of
the highest degree.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
Worthy of 10,000 deaths!

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
What on Earth?

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
Do you just kill for no reason?

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
Are you finally ready to fight?

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
Stop!

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
Now, my faithful
weapon Louisette

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
shall sever your head!

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
Noé!

--Are you all right?
--[JOHANN] Noé!

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
Oh, there you are, thank God!

Jeanne! What are you doing?

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
No, no, don't kill it, stop!

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] I have no choice
but to finish this.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
All those years ago, I failed
to destroy you here in Gévaudan.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
It's over!

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS grunting]

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute.
Why is Jeanne here?

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO] So, I've encountered
the Beast of Gévaudan,

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
as well as a vampire,
and that woman.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
Could she be the
Hellfire Witch?

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Then, this truly
is an auspicious day!

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
I was blessed enough to
bear witness to not only

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
this terrible creature, but Lord
Ruthven's <i>bourreau</i> , as well!

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't move around,
your wounds are still fresh--

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:02.842 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It doesn't matter!

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
I can still fight.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
He killed all those people.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
He has to pay!

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.687 position:50% align:center
Will you calm down?

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:20.985 position:50% align:center
The runt's formidable,
is that right?

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
Even more so than Roland?

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.322 position:50% align:center
No way in hell!

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
Roland was a whole lot stronger!

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
And scarier!

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
There's no contest!

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Then why are you
wounded so badly, Noé?

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
Did you expect this
opponent to listen to reason

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
and cast his weapon aside,
the same way Roland did?

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
Or did you
subconsciously hold back

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
because he resembles
a delicate young girl?

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:45.760 position:50% align:center
Either way, Noé,
you've clearly let yourself

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
become overwhelmed
by your emotions,

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
and it's keeping you from
fighting at full capacity.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
I'm the man for the job.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
Let me show you the proper
way to handle this foe!

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
What? Did you say there's a
<i>Chasseur</i> paladin after us?

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.660 position:50% align:center
Oh, I sure hope it isn't
the vicious warrior

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center
named Roland the Jasper!

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.872 position:50% align:center
He's so scary!

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
What? It's not?

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
Astolfo the Garnet, you say?

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who is that?

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
Probably just some
harmless nobody, right?

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center
Ah! This is such a relief!

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
We would have been dead
men walking if we'd had

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
the misfortune of meeting Roland
the Jasper way out here!

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
But I'm certain
we'll be just fine

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
against a wimpy little girl!

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
Wow, we really are lucky, huh?

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
Hold on, so that tiny figure
belongs to a grown man?

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
But no man is so cute!

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
You're a brazen fool!

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
Are you honestly
suggesting that Roland

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
is somehow more of
a threat than I am?

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.201 position:50% align:center
Got him.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Um, Vanitas?

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
Didn't I tell you I was
the man for the job?

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
Don't let Jeanne kill it.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
If the Beast truly is a
curse-bearer who transformed,

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
then its malnomen is one
that's yet to be discovered.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
That's why we can't afford
to let anyone kill it,

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
be they a <i>bourreau</i>
or a <i>Chasseur</i> .

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
I don't know about you,

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
but I came to save a vampire,
and that's what I'll do!

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
The same goes for me.
I'll stop her!

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Chloé!

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center

still you in there!

This time, I swear
I will annihilate you!

You mustn't.

I know you're angry, Jeanne,

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
but you can't slay that
thing, at least not yet!

Vanitas can do.

[NOÉ] If you give him a
chance,then he may be able

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
to save that
curse-bearer's life.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Save her?

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
I refuse to allow that!

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
I am a <i>bourreau</i> , it's my duty to
put an end to all curse-bearers!

Get in my way,
I'll end you, as well!

I must!

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Is that the best you can do?

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
The <i>Chasseurs</i> must really be
shorthanded if a pitiful klutz

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
like you managed
to make the cut!

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
But you skipped the application
process, didn't you?
