[VANITAS pants]

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
Vanitas. Um, listen.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
I hate to ask, but...

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
Since we only have one
blanket to keep us warm,

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
don't you think it would
be better to lie down?

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
We can keep each other warm.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.668 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't.

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:47.005 position:50% align:center
Jeanne, I'm already at
my limit in so many ways.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
Limit?

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.235 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
There you are at last, Jeanne.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.203 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.374 position:50% align:center
You are wounded.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.920 position:50% align:center
Have you been poisoned?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50% align:center
I need to suck the toxin out!

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] No, it's already
been dealt with.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.384 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
But, Vanitas, I only want--!

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.596 position:50% align:center
Leave me be.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.350 position:50% align:center
You came here to hunt down
the Beast, didn't you?

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
So just get going,
forget about me.

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
[growls] Do you honestly expect
me to leave you in this state?

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
Almost there,
should be up ahead.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Wait here.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
I'll get a fire started.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
This was the worst
possible outcome.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
Wretched brat.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
Next time we meet,
I'll slit his throat.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
I swear!

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Well, now
we're getting somewhere.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center
At the very least, we'll be
able to warm ourselves.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
You! Sit up!

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center
And take your clothes off.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
<i>Pas d'arguments!</i>

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
Look at your clothes,
they're completely soaked

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
and frozen from the snow.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
You can't stay in these--

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
you'll never warm up
if you leave them on!

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.963 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] What? So, you're
asking me to strip naked?

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.215 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Of course! You don't
mind if I help, do you?

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Yes, I do!

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
Let's get this straight.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
You are suggesting that
we get warm by disrobing

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
and lying down together?

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Goodness me, Jeanne!

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
Surely you wouldn't be so--

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
Have a little modesty, woman,

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
this isn't the sweet, innocent
young maiden I remember!

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
That's enough yapping!
Lives are on the line here!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
Now take them off or else!

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
I, uh... Yes, ma'am.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Huh? Vanitas?

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] He's got scars
all over his body.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
Not the glove.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
Please leave that on,
I don't care if it's wet.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
I hope you can forgive me.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
If not for me, that would
not have happened.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Are you referring to my injury?

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
Or do you mean the altercation
with the Beast of Gévaudan?

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
All of it.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Who is this Chloé?

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
Let me guess.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
You know the Beast's
identity, don't you?

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE sighs]

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.877 position:50% align:center
My parents knew Ruthven.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
They were students of his
when I was a just little girl.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
They loved him dearly.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
We used to go on trips together

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
to all sorts of new
and exciting places.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
But one time,

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
they decided they would leave me
with Marquis d'Apchier instead.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
So, I stayed at his castle
in Gévaudan for a while.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to make your
acquaintance, Jeanne.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
My name is--

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
You're like a doll that's alive!

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ giggles]

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Huh?

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
That's where she resides,
the vampire whom

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
the Marquis hid away from
the world, Chloe d'Apchier.

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
So, although she was a vampire,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
she was able to keep it secret
and live among humankind.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] She appeared to be
quite young, but she'd actually

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
lived a long time, even
longer than Lord Ruthven.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
She taught me many things.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
We did lessons together,
played games.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
It was almost like
having a big sister.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
With her there,
the days were so bright.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
[crying] It's not fair!
I don't wanna leave yet!

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
Please, come visit me
in Gévaudan again.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
I look forward
to meeting the woman

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.093 position:50% align:center
I know you'll become
one day, Jeanne.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.603 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] But the next time
we saw one another,

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
I had become a <i>bourreau</i>

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
and my purpose in coming
to Gévaudan was to slay her.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
<i>Bourreau</i> are but tools,

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
and we need only
to follow orders.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
It felt so monstrously unfair.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
Of all the people I
could've been sent to kill.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
Those feelings caused
me to hesitate.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
And in the end, I wasn't able
to carry out my assignment.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
And so...

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] I beg you to let
me return, Lord Ruthven.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
If our Chloé is truly
the Beast of Gévaudan,

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
then it's my duty.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
Next time I see her,
I will not fail.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
Whatever it takes.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
I'll put an end to this!

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
So that's what you
came here after.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
Vanitas?

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] It isn't because you
harbor any ill will towards her.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]
A fever!

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Hold on, I'll get some water!

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I see.
It wasn't hatred at all.

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
No, in fact...

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.268 position:50% align:center
...I...

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
Here you go!

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Lou...

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Lou? Who's that?

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
What could he be talking about?

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Vanitas.
You should drink some water.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
You won't get better
if you don't stay hydrated.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Why help me?

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
Your goal is to slay
the Beast of Gévaudan,

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50% align:center
and mine is to try and save it.

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
We both can't get what we want,
which makes us foes.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
your smartest move is
to kill me right now.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]
Don't be ridiculous!

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
You almost died protecting me.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
How could I do
something that cruel?

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
You're so naive, Jeanne!

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
And Noe has the same problem!
That's why you're both--!

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
That's quite enough.

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
If you're so desperate
to be killed by me,

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
then you'd better rest before
this fever beats me to it.

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
Hey--!

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
It's morning.

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]
Vanitas!

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] Yes, but what
if something unspeakable's

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
happened to Dante?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Calm yourself.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.249 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
How can I be calm?!

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:15.342 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] I've seen him before.
He was with Vanitas.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.804 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
This means...

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
He's well enough to be
up and about again!

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
That's wonderful!

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
I'm so relieved--!

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE groans]

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What was I thinking?

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
Even if I only intended
to warm his body,

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
the fact remains
that I was naked

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
next to Vanitas last night!

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
What's worse, I made him
get naked, too!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
And drink water from my mouth!

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
There's only one word for
someone who behaves that way!

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
Pervert! But no,
my intentions were pure!

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm the reason
he was poisoned to begin with!

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
I owe you my life, Vanitas.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
Stop it, Jeanne!

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:04.766 position:50% align:center
I can never be
indebted to a man!

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
What happened yesterday
was strictly platonic!

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
So, there's nothing
to be ashamed of!

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
Still...

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] I've never seen Vanitas
with an expression like that.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
He looked so dismayed.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
He's usually extremely
arrogant, so seeing

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
his vulnerability was
refreshing for some reason.

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
Dare I admit
it was kind of cute?

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What's wrong with you, Jeanne?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.505 position:50% align:center
This is the perfect chance!

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
If he had it his way,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
Vanitas would never be caught
dead looking so helpless!

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
Having seen that side of him,
he is at my mercy!

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Therefore, it's time
for me to turn the tide!

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
Once I remind you of how
you let your guard down

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
with me, you'll really get
your knickers in a knot!

00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Vanitas!
Feeling better after last night?

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're up.
Took you long enough.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
[stammering]

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50% align:center
Something got your
knickers in a knot?

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] He's even more
nonchalant than usual!

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
It's like it never happened
in the first place!

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
Last night? Whatever
does she mean?

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.847 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to talk about.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Who are you? Are you a human?

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
No, you're a vampire.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.398 position:50% align:center
Neither, I'm a dham.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I beg your pardon.

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
I've been out of sorts ever
since my partner went missing.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
[DANTE yelping]
Johann!

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center
There you are, Dante!
Thank heavens!

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
I don't know how I ever
would've explained it to Riche

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
if something had
happened to you!

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I'm surprised
you found us here, baldy.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Oh, yeah, the chimney
smoke was a dead giveaway.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
That just leaves Noé.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
Where'd that blundering
fool wander off to?

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
He got taken away.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
I think it was
the Silver Witch.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Once <i>The Book</i>
<i>of Vanitas</i> went flying...

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] I followed them
as far as I could, but, sorry.

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I see.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.917 position:50% align:center
So those thieves have
made off with my book.

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Wait, that's what
you're worried about?

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Why waste my energy
worrying about him?

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
Noé's nothing if not sturdy.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
Trust me, he will
not die so easily.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
I hope you're right.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
Captain Astolfo!

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness you're all right!

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.447 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO]
Marco?

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.200 position:50% align:center
I've been looking all over
the place for you, sir!

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
Oh! This is precisely
why I begged you

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
not to act on your own!

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
Captain? Where are you off to?

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
What? Are you a complete idiot?

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
Do you think I came to this
wretched place for fun?

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
I have a job to do, you know!

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
Now, let's get going.
To the witch's castle!

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.682 position:50% align:center
So, what's next?

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
You ready to track them down?

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
Yes. But before
we go anywhere...

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I want you to share everything

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
you've been hiding
from me, now!

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
Look. I paid for what
you claimed to be

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
all the information available
regarding the Beast of Gévaudan.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
But if I discover
that you've withheld

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
even a single detail from me,

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
I am severing our
business relationship.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
Now tell me, and don't lie.

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
Vampires, the Church, even you,

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
what do all of you actually
want with the Beast?

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
What are you... saying?

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
I have told you
everything already.

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
That the Beast is a
curse-bearing vampire.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:21.856 position:50% align:center
It's Chloé, she's killed
numerous people.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
That's why Lord Ruthven
and the Church want her head.

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
She's incredibly dangerous.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
Is there anything more?

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
Well? <i>Is</i> that all
there is to know?

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
Wait, let's all take
a deep breath here!

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] Boy. You lay a finger
on someone I care about...

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
...I will kill you.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
Go on and try it.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
Then there'll be
two dimwitted dhampir

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
lying lifeless in the snow.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN growls]

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS growls]

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
What's with you?!

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
I said calm down and wait a sec!

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
You, too, Johann!

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
What'd I do?

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:01.813 position:50% align:center
Easy there, just relax.
I'll tell you.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
Perfect. Oh, and Jeanne.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
Do you think your Chloé
and the Silver Witch

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.405 position:50% align:center
that Dante mentioned might
be one and the same?

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:14.367 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE sighs]
Yes, I believe so.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] In that case,
do you have any guess

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.495 position:50% align:center
as to where they took Noé?

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
If so, I'd like you
to show us the way.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You and I may be
at cross-purposes, but surely

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:28.256 position:50% align:center
Dante's story has pricked up
your ears a little, oui?

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE 14A]
<i>Bourreau</i> are but tools.

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE 14B]
We need only to follow orders.

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
I... I can help.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
Wait, why does
the Hellfire Witch

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.893 position:50% align:center
know where that
creepy girl lives?

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Less talking, more walking.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
You jerk!

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You can ask
your questions on the way.

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.192 position:50% align:center
Who put a bug up your butt?

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I'm not annoyed
in the slightest.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
It's just, we can't
afford to waste time.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Ah, I get it.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
If he's that worried
about his partner,

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
why doesn't he just say so?

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] The human heart
is such a mystery.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Who is that?

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:33.905 position:50% align:center
It's illegal to drink
someone's blood by force!

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
Look at that.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
You've finally awakened.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
I want some more.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Hey, hold on a second!

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
My pillow! Give that
back to me right now!

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
<i>Your</i> pillow?

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
Young man, I'm afraid
this pillow belongs to me.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
Look, you know what I mean!
Just give it back please!

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
Don't be greedy.
I'm not asking for much,

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
only the tiniest
mouthful of your blood.

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
That's my point! You can't
take it without my--

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
You noisy child. Settle down.

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.479 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I'm so weak, I can't fight back.

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
How much did she drink?

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I'm scared.
I don't know what to do!

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
Chloé.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
You know as well as I do
that it isn't right

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
for you to drink from
an unwilling vessel.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Who's that?

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
You know what,
I don't care who he is!

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
I'm saved!

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
What I mean is, it isn't
right for you to drink

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
the blood of any
man who isn't me.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
It's forbidden!

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
In fact, I'm so overcome with
jealousy that I'm fighting back

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
the urge to strangle the very
individual I just saved!

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
Jean-Jacques!

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
You always say the
most adorable things

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
when you're seething with envy!

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
It's quite charming.

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
Be honest. How was it, Chloé?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Hm?

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
It pains me to ask you,
but I need to know,

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:57.530 position:50% align:center
was this man's blood
more delicious than mine?

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
Silly boy!

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
Obviously, yours is the best.
You have nothing to worry about!

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Huh?

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
I see. Then all is well.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. You're so ridiculous.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
[MURR meows]

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.296 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Murr?

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
I'm assuming the cat is yours?

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
We found it wandering
around on the mountain,

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
so we brought it back with us.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Huh?

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES] Your clothes
are mended, please put them on.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
Come down as soon
as you've dressed.

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What a nice man!

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
So, they're Chloé
and Jean-Jacques.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
Wait, if that's true...

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
Chloé!

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:44.244 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Does that mean she's the Beast?

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I hope Vanitas
and the others are safe.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:57.507 position:50% align:center
For now, I should probably hear
what these people have to say.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
Then I can look for them.

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Wow...

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
[music plays]

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
<i>Pardonnez-moi!</i>

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Automatons?

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
Or self-playing instruments?

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
Ah, bonjour.

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
You've arrived.

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:43.011 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
I'll introduce you, Herman.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:46.973 position:50% align:center
The boy's name is Noé.

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
We brought him home
after we found him

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
lost and unconscious
in that terrible blizzard.

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:56.900 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Pardón, but how
do you know my name?

00:21:56.983 --> 00:22:00.278 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] Our friend here
told me, of course.

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
Now, you must
be ravenous, Noé.

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:05.784 position:50% align:center
Why don't we dine together?
