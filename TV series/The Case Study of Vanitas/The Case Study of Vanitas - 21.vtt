00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.099 position:50% align:center
Bonjour?

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
A letter. For you, Monsieur Noé.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.478 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Did you see who brought it?

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.438 position:50% align:center
No, sir.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.481 position:50% align:center
It was left at the front desk.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA gasps]

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Mademoiselle
Domi and I are waiting!

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.009 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Let me introduce you all.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:17.762 position:50% align:center
Noe. These two are my
beloved grandchildren.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.265 position:50% align:center
Louis and his little
sister, Dominique.

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50% align:center
Um, hello there,
it's nice to meet you.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.706 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] I need to ask
a favor, Dominique.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.835 position:50% align:center
Will you please give this box
to Noé when the time comes?

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Louis?

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.465 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Look at you, Domi.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
You really are just like me.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.347 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Domi?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
--[DOMINIQUE] Noé!
--Hey. What is--?

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Mina's in danger!

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50% align:center
She's to be killed.
Tomorrow, isn't that right?

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
But she didn't do anything!

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
She didn't have to do anything.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
She's a curse-bearer.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
That's how it is.

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
All curse-bearers get
beheaded by a <i>Bourreau</i> .

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé, I want to save Mina, too.

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
Maybe we can help her
escape the village!

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
[MINA panting]

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
[MINA growling]

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.633 position:50% align:center
Mina.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
Both of you are safe.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
I want blood now!

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center
No, I need it!
More blood! More blood!

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
Domi, get out of here!

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
Louis! Snap out of it!

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Are you angry with me?

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:08.581 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS grunts] I'm begging
you for this one favor.

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.168 position:50% align:center
The way I see it,
if I'm doomed to die,

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
then I want you to be
the one to kill me!

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
Say you will!

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
But, Louis. I can't.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
This is for you.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
My brother said that
he wanted you to have it

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.573 position:50% align:center
whenever the time came.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
He told me to
keep it until then.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
Noé!

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Please forgive
me for all of this.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Grandfather says it's probably

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
a psychological condition.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50% align:center
How do I help him?

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
Poor Noé.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
For the past two days, he hasn't
so much as opened his eyes!

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
What am I going to do
if he never opens them again?

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
I can't bear it!

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
This is my fault.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
If only I hadn't gone running
to tell him the news that day.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
If I had handled
things on my own.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
If I had been willing
to let Mina go, then...

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
All that bloodshed
could've been avoided.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] At the very least,
he wouldn't have witnessed

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
Louis's beheading, and he would
be conscious right now.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
Domi, dear.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Veronica, it's you!

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
I waited for so long,
and you never came home.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:03.530 position:50% align:center
So, I had to travel all
this way to fetch you.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
Honestly, this place is always
filthy and full of dust!

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
Come now, it's time to leave.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center
I'm staying here!

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] It's my fault
that he ended up this way.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
I have to do everything
I can for him!

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
Louis is dead.
We've lost our brother.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
Don't you feel anything
at all, Veronica?

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
That's where
you're wrong, dear.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
I never had a brother
to begin with.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
If you ask me,
it would've been better

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
if that creature had been
slain the day he was born.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
You ought to be thankful
he was permitted

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
to live for as long as he did.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.
What are you saying?

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA]
What? Dear sister.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is rich!
Did you really not know?

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
All this time,
did you honestly believe

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
Louis was hidden away
because he was ill?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
Oh, you poor, precious child.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
You're even more of a
fool than I thought!

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
Want to know the real reason?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
You and Louis were twins
all along, silly girl!

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
What? Twins?

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
They really never told you!

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Louis was my twin brother?

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA]
Twins are said to rob the womb

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
of far more life
than a single child.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
They're a symbol of bad luck
in the vampire world.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
But I always thought

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
he was a year older than me.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] The good name of
House de Sade would've been

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
tarnished if word got out that
your mother had borne twins!

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
So, they were
forced to choose!

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
Keep you, or Louis!

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
It was originally decided that

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.842 position:50% align:center
one of you would be
killed upon birth.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
But then, Grandfather
said "Nonsense!

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
Such a thing would be wasteful!
Let me care for the boy myself."

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.184 position:50% align:center
Whenever Grandfather
makes a demand,

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
even Father is powerless
to get in the way of it.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
Oh, and he mentioned

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
wanting to try something,
but I couldn't say what.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.527 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Why?

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why they
spared me and not him.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] Neither do I. Knowing
Father, I'm sure he decided

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
based on how he felt
in the moment.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
But then, what does it matter?

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
After all, it's a waste of
precious time to wonder aloud

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
over a brother I never had.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
Then again, if Louis
had been chosen over you,

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center
I can't help but wonder if he
would've done a better job

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.805 position:50% align:center
at living up to
our expectations!

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA laughs]

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Louis.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
Did they tell you the truth
about us being twins?

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
Louis.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:46.901 position:50% align:center
It would be nice

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50% align:center
if I could live with you
two all the time.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
Do you know how much I envy you?

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.077 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE gasps]

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
How awful. I can't believe

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
I said something
so cruel to him!

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.795 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Noé! You're awake!

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
Do you know who I am?

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
--Noé!
--[NOÉ gasps]

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
Noé!

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
Louis!

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:21.478 position:50% align:center
I had this terrible dream where
you died right in front of me.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
Oh, Louis. I'm so happy.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.194 position:50% align:center
It was just a nightmare.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
Do you wish they'd
chosen him, too?

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Would you prefer if
Louis had lived instead of me?

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.110 position:50% align:center
Aw, how terrible.

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.654 position:50% align:center
We might as well
call off the search.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
I think I'll keep
looking for a while.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
'Kay, but, I don't see
why you're concerned

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
about the Hellfire Witch,
or what she's up to.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
I mean, if she and Vanitas
were to become an item,

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
wouldn't that just make
things easier for you?

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
Uh-- What are you talking about?

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.968 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! Are you hurt?

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Well, I'll see you
around, Mademoiselle Dominique.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Oh, so your
name's Dominique, is it?

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
My name's Mikhail!

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:52.861 position:50% align:center
<i>Enchante</i> , maybe we
can become friends!

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute. Do I see
tears in your eyes?

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
You poor thing.

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
I feel bad for you.
You're in pain.

[DOMINIQUE]
I wish it was I who'd suffered

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
the fate of a curse-bearer.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] I wish I had been
beheaded instead of Louis.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:26.603 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] I wish he could be
the one who's now at Noé's side.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Why did things
have to turn out that way?

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
Why wasn't I killed?

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
Because, if it had
been me instead...

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, Noé.

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] There, there.
Don't cry, mademoiselle.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center

[NOÉ]
An automaton?

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
It said Mikhail?

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose there's any way
you might've misread it.

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
He's alive.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, no!

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
We hadn't even
introduced ourselves yet.

A blue leather cover.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.847 position:50% align:center
Pages black as night.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
A clockwork grimoire,
linked to a silver chain.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we should try again.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
You may call me Mikhail.

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:37.776 position:50% align:center
This book was passed down to me
by the Vampire of the Blue Moon.

Yet I am but a human!

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Is there another
<i>Book of Vanitas</i> ?

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'll stop.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
I was imitating my big brother!

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes! I should
probably specify.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Though, I'm sure you know
who I'm talking about,

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
right, Monsieur Noé?

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
I mean the person
you call Vanitas.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.390 position:50% align:center
You told Mademoiselle Domi
what Vanitas said.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
And then, when I met
Mademoiselle Domi,

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
she repeated everything
to me, as well.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
So, this was so easy!

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
All this formality,
I'd rather drop the titles,

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
if we can. So, tell me, Noé.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
Has he ever mentioned me
during your time together?

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:25.365 position:50% align:center
Even like, "I have the most
adorable little brother"?

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
Or, perhaps he
spoke of Number 71?

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
How's dear old Number 71
been doing recently?

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
You're 71?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
Precisely!

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
I came here to ask
a favor of you.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
Domi!

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
A fall from that height
would kill her,

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
and she will jump if anyone
so much as touches me,

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
so you'd better be careful.

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Why is he doing this?

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you wouldn't want that,
and honestly, neither would I.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
No.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.814 position:50% align:center
She's obviously a very
kind person, so it would be

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
a shame to see her broken
and splattered on the ground.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.861 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Did he tamper
with her true name?

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
Now, Noé.

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
Go find Vanitas
and drink his blood.

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
Let me explain.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
There's a question I
desperately need answered.

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.958 position:50% align:center
I wanna understand why
Vanitas killed Father that day.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
But every time I've asked him,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
he's refused to give
me a real answer.

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Which is why I'd like you

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
to take a peek and
find out for me.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
That's what you're good at,
isn't that right, Noé?

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.434 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] All you have to do
is sink your fangs

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
into that pale,
delicate skin of his.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
Lay bare the dark memory I seek.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
What? Dominique is missing?

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 21A]
Yes, sir.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
It seems she failed to report
for duty at the castle.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
A messenger has been
dispatched to de Sade Manor.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
But it's been three days
since anyone saw her

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center
at the main estate or the villa.

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Hm...

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 21A] Given that
she's of the House de Sade,

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
it would be unwise to rule out
capriciousness on her part.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
Dominique would never
do such a thing,

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
de Sade or not! She would
never be so careless

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
as to run away from her duties!

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Three days ago.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:13.973 position:50% align:center
That was when
she and I last spoke.

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
What could've happened to her?

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Jeanne?

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
Would it be all right if I
asked you for a favor?

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Wait a minute.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:30.448 position:50% align:center
This person you
called "Father"--

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:32.617 position:50% align:center
you're saying that
they were murdered.

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
And that Vanitas--
Vanitas was somehow

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
responsible for what happened?

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
Wait, so you--you don't know.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL giggles]
Sorry, Noé.

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
That's not what
I expected at all!

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
I suppose I shouldn't
have assumed.

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
After all this time together,

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
you still don't know
a thing about him!

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center
You'll have to
catch up, won't you?

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
Now it all makes sense.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
I must've really taken you
by surprise when I asked you

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
to drink my brother's
blood, huh?

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I know!

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
Forget him for the moment

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
and help yourself
to my blood instead.

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
Wha...?

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] That's the easiest
way for me to bring you

Get on with it.

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
If you don't hurry up,
I'll catch a cold.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center

Domi, wait.

When did you cut off
all of your hair?

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
And why?

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
Oh, this?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
It was getting in
my way, that's all.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
I think it suits me. Don't you?

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I'll do everything
I can to protect Domi.

She or, I suppose, he,

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
is the child who survived?

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
[CHASSEUR 21B]
Yes. The Church took him in

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
after he was found
hiding under a bed.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
The way that he's dressed,
and his hair is--

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Why would a mother
do such a thing?

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
[CHASSEUR 21B]
She was a prostitute.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
Apparently, she used
to offer the child

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
to her preferred customers.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
You have no business in there.
It's like a scary maze.

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.795 position:50% align:center
Once you reach
the underground part,

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:33.381 position:50% align:center
you won't be able to find
your way out again.

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:57.697 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Huh?

00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
From what they tell me,
there are several children

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.784 position:50% align:center
your age living there already,

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure you'll find
a lot of friends to play with.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
What kind of place is it?

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
You'll see soon!

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Monsieur?

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.128 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Yes?

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
Do you know why they
had to kill the vampire?

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
Because that terrible creature

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
murdered your poor
mother, of course!

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Mm. No. That's not
true. In fact, he saved her!

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
Mama wasn't well,
and she used to make

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center
a really scary face when she
would get mad and hit me.

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
But I understood
the reason she did it.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
There was a demon inside her,
and when the demon

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
was being bad, she would
start acting mean.

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
And when the vampire was there,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
she was like that
the entire time.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
Till the end.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
And then, after a while,
her face went back to normal!

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
I saw my mother being
her beautiful self again!

00:20:57.674 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
I don't know what that
vampire did to her,

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
but I think he caused the demon
in her to go away forever!

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Dear God.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Did I
say something bad?

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
You poor, misguided soul!

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
Clearly, those wretched vampires
have already led you astray!

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
O Lord!

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
Pray, forgive this child,
for he knows not what he says!

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
I beseech thee!

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
Roland!

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
I thought I told you
to stay in bed

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center
and rest until you heal!

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Wait! I was ministering

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.957 position:50% align:center
to that poor, lost lamb!

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.420 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU]
Yes, I realize that,

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
but the child you
procured for me

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
last time broke
almost immediately!

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
How fortunate that I would
find a replacement

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
in such a convenient place!

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
And not a moment
too soon, either!

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
The authorities are
occupied trying to solve

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.060 position:50% align:center
that prostitute's murder!

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:53.813 position:50% align:center
I assure you, gentlemen,
they'll never be the wiser!

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.191 position:50% align:center
If a child goes missing
from their care,

00:21:56.274 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
they'll assume the little rodent
ran away and leave it at that!

00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:03.865 position:50% align:center
And our captive's awakened!

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
Come over here and meet
the new blood, my boy!

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
Now then, Number 69.

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:12.916 position:50% align:center
Would you mind looking
out for this one?
