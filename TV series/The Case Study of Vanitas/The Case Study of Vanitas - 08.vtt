00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] You wouldn't
believe it, Teacher.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
We're actually here inside
Castle Carbunculus!

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
And somewhere within
these hallowed halls

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.901 position:50% align:center
is Her Majesty,
the Queen herself!

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.616 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] Technically,
this place is my office,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.077 position:50% align:center
but I'd say that it's
more of a hobby room.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
Do make yourselves at home.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.332 position:50% align:center
Oh? Something troubling you?

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
U-Um, no. Forgive me.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
Before I came here,

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
Domi and I had been
discussing just how little

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.174 position:50% align:center
I know about you.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, please don't let
that bother you one bit.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
When I discovered that you were
the child of the Shapeless One,

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.682 position:50% align:center
everything made perfect sense.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.934 position:50% align:center
And truth be told,

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
your teacher despises me
with the utmost passion.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.401 position:50% align:center
The man hated for my name
to so much as pass his lips!

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.696 position:50% align:center
I'd wager he erased all traces
of it from your surroundings

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.531 position:50% align:center
in an effort to
hide it from you.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.742 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.285 position:50% align:center
That does kind of
sound like him.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.663 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN laughs]
It sure does, doesn't it?

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.710 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] Uh, does that machine
spark your interest?

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:26.795 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
It's a difference engine

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.881 position:50% align:center
given to me by Marquis Machina.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.592 position:50% align:center
And that's a lamp that's
powered by astermite.

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:33.718 position:50% align:center
Over there--

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.053 position:50% align:center
Lord Ruthven,

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.972 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to interrupt
all the fun, but...

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
Could we cut to
the chase, please?

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Noé, Vanitas.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
First, I would like to thank you
for your heroic actions.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
Lucius has made me
aware of everything.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
Thanks to you,
our brethren's casualties

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
at the masquerade ball
were kept to a minimum.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
And we still don't know
what all the fuss was about.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
What are your thoughts?

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] Well, we know
Charlatan's to blame.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50% align:center
In the past, I had thought
they were hallucinations

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
that only curse-
bearers could see.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.512 position:50% align:center
However, I now believe
that what occurred

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
at the <i>bal masque</i> was a clear
attempt to assassinate Lucius.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
I concur.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] The chaos created
by the curse-bearers was

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
most likely intended to
distract the Queen's Fangs.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
If that black shadow, Naenia,
is the one who steals

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
true names, it's no surprise
there were so many

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
curse-bearers in
attendance that night.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
Um, when you say Lucius,
you do mean Luca, right?

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
What reason could anyone have
for wanting to kill him?

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You still haven't
put two and two together?

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
That boy has rank and power
second only to the queen.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
There must be countless nobles
who want him out of the way.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Luca?

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
Or should I say, Lucius,
Grand Duke Oriflamme.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
Grand Duke? Really? [gasps]

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
The Grand Duke is
Her Majesty's close advisor!

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
That's amazing!

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I wouldn't
call it amazing.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
Since Lord Uncle is my guardian,

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
he handles all my duties
as the Grand Duke in my stead.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
As a result, my
succession to the office

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
hasn't been made official yet.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
My blood ran cold when
I got word that you had ventured

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
into the mortal world without
asking my permission.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
I strongly encourage you to be
more mindful of your position.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
I will. I'm sorry.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
Oh, I meant to ask.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50% align:center
When I met you,
weren't you seeking

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> so that
you could rescue your brother?

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
You can't help! Because
my big brother's curse

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
comes from the vampire
of the blue moon!

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
Whatever happened
to your brother, Luca?

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
Ah, there's no need
for us to discuss that.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
If you've any good sense at all,

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
you won't mention
his brother again.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Salvation takes many forms.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.720 position:50% align:center
In other words, breaking his
curse is not necessarily

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
in that young man's
best interest.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
But enough about that.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
You're here to ask me about
curse-bearers in general,

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
isn't that right?

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center
I, in turn, have many
questions to ask you

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
in regards to the
Blue Moon Clan.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
Also, the Vampire
of the Blue Moon,

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> , and,
perhaps you could tell me

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
a bit about yourself.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Yes, indeed.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You're right,
let's devote our time

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
to more fruitful discussions.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
I have a little request
I'd like to make of you,

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.177 position:50% align:center
if you don't mind.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
All right. What is it you want?

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I'm not asking much.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
Just an audience
with your queen!

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50% align:center
Do I need to dumb it down?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you to take me
to see Her Majesty, <i>tout suite</i> .

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
For what purpose?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Oh, it's simple,
really, shouldn't take long.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
You see, I believe she
gives rise to curse-bearers

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
and I would like to
confirm it for myself!

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
How dare you make
such a suggestion!

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Why such a reaction?

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
Just let me see her.

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
--[growls]
--[VANITAS] I merely wish

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:05.050 position:50% align:center
to conduct an examination
of your queen's entire body.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
Insolent fool!

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.345 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Well, Ruthven? What say you?

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't be a problem
if I have the approval

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
of the Grand Duke,
now, should it?

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
How long has it been
since Her Majesty

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
was seen in public?

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
Why has she gone
so deep into hiding?

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
--Vanitas--
--[VANITAS laughs]

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.404 position:50% align:center
--It begs the question.
--[LUCA] Uncle?

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
Is your queen
even alive anymore?

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE groans]

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
Lord Uncle.
Please don't hurt him!

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.683 position:50% align:center
Let him go!

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
I want you out of here
immediately, human.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
You malign the good
name of our queen

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:02.607 position:50% align:center
with every careless
word you speak!

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS sputters]

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] You are forbidden
from setting foot

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.570 position:50% align:center
in this castle again!

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
After that little altercation,

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
they booted the two of us
across the barrier.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.453 position:50% align:center
It's been about a week or so

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
since we returned
to the human world.

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:21.501 position:50% align:center
Ugh. My whole body's sore,
so I've been mostly sleeping.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] They sent Murr
back to us later on.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.465 position:50% align:center
Well, that's the story!

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
Blasted fools!

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
You would dare to behave
that way toward the queen?

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
--But it's in the past!
--[MANET] Try to stay calm, sir!

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
You want to fight?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
If you think you can take me,
then let's do this.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Perfect.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
I got the exact piece of
information I wanted most.

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
He played us for fools.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
That human wasn't
interested in me at all.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50% align:center
He was watching you.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
Most vampires fly
into a blind rage

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
whenever someone dares
insult Her Majesty.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
You should have done
the same thing,

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
but you failed to.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Instead, you showed dismay.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
You may as well have confirmed
his words right then and there.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] Your Majesty.
What am I going to do?

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Anyway, until the dust settles,

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
I plan to continue
curing curse-bearers,

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
the same as I've been doing.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
But I need some infor--

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
[ORLOK]
You impudent human!

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:45.627 position:50% align:center
Master Orlok has no time
for you and your nonsense!

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Another incident?

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
It says vampires
have been disappearing.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
Three of them gone
in one week? That's a lot.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
Those files aren't for you!

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
Get out of here, now!

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Hello, quack.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Ah, Dante!

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
Aren't you a sight for sore--

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.359 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Oh, dear. What happened?

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:10.860 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Don't ask.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
I've got some juicy
new information.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
Something I think
you might really like.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, we had
finally pinned down

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
the location of
a curse-bearer who'd

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:25.875 position:50% align:center
slipped into Paris
a while ago, and then...

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 08A screams]

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Someone showed up
and kidnapped her

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
right before our eyes.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] But like an idiot,
Riche tried to stop it!

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
So, I got dragged in
and beat up, too.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
[RICHE] For the record,
I didn't ask you to save me.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I already regret it!

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Well, you're fat!

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] Now, now, children,
no need to fight.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
[RICHE]
No wonder the attacker got away

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
from your big, slow butt!

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] You got pretty
beat up yourself...

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] I was walking alone
and then some dastardly ruffian

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
mistook me for a vampire
and nearly ran off with me!

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
But they fled the
moment they realized

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
I was a dham.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
Oh, how easily
we submit to fear.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
A dham?

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
As in "dhampir."

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
Half-vampire and half-human.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
That's what all three
of us are, actually.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
Ah, dear, never seen
a dhampir before?

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
--Well, no.
--[DANTE] Hey, quack.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
Check that out.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
Tore it off the abductor's coat.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
The emblem looks like
a sword that has six wings.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
I know who's behind all
the vampire disappearances,

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
and who old man Orlok's after.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
The Church's anti-vampire
unit: the <i>Chasseurs</i> .

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
Captain, sir,
have you heard yet?

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
There's news about that human.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm aware.
Vanitas, I think it was?

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
Not only was he made
kin of the Blue Moon Clan,

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
but they say vampires
are swarming around him

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
to try and make use
of his great power.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
He seems like such a--
such a--a poor, lost child!

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50% align:center
So, no matter what it might
take, we must bring him

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
into the fold and save him,
in the name of the Lord!

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.240 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
The Catacombs of Paris.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
An old stone quarry

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
that was later converted
into a vast ossuary.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] "Halt. The Empire
of the Dead lies ahead."

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
I knew that Paris had an
ossuary underground, but...

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
...it's much more
of a tourist trap

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
than I thought it would be.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
It's not bad. It's just curious.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
I know! Actually,
the ossuary is only

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.602 position:50% align:center
a small part of
the network of tunnels

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
that runs underneath Paris.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] So, Vanitas.
Dante saw the <i>Chasseurs</i>

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
heading down here,
but do you really think

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.866 position:50% align:center
we'll find them somewhere
in this labyrinth of bones?

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Who knows?
That said, they did establish

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
a base down here
after they wiped out

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
the vampires who were infesting
these tunnels during the war.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
And there's a rumor
that the Chasseurs

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
still inhabit the
place to this day.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Dante thinks
there's a secret passage

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:20.258 position:50% align:center
down here that leads
to their hideout.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
Okay, but to learn more
about the disappearances,

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.763 position:50% align:center
wouldn't it be smarter
if we called upon

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
Count Orlok for help?

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] Heavens no!
That simply wouldn't do!

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
<i>Chasseurs</i> and vampires
still harbor quite a bit

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
of "bad blood," for
lack of a better term.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
One false move and, well...

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.737 position:50% align:center
We could easily have another
nasty war on our hands.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
Meaning the count has
to be extremely careful.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
Now you've got it.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
--[DANTE growling]
--Not this again, Dante!

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
Can we go anywhere
without you showing everyone

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
your hot little temper!

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
Quiet! I'm not leaving

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
until I give 'em a beating
as brutal as I got!

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY GUARD 08A]
You there! What are you doing?

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY GUARD 08B]
Get down!

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.675 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Damn it all!

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.219 position:50% align:center
Where the hell is that cloaked
bastard from yesterday?

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
[RICHE]
Just let it go.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center
We probably wouldn't have found

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
anything good down
there, anyway!

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] It was beyond stupid
to think the <i>Chasseurs</i> ' base

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
would be in that tourist trap.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:15.605 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Hey! The best hiding
spot is right under your nose!

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
Everybody knows that, stupid!

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center
--Baldy! Baldy! Baldy! Baldy!
--[DANTE] Stupid! Stupid!

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.656 position:50% align:center
Concerned for our
partner, are we?

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
I suppose so.

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
I can't help but notice that
he's been acting... normal.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
And, well, normal isn't
really normal for him.

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
Hm?

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.541 position:50% align:center
What took you so long?

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:19.044 position:50% align:center
I almost had time to finish
reading this entire book.

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.670 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I don't know where we're
going tonight, but don't worry.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
I took a nice catnap
before we left!

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less!

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Are you headed off to
investigate the disappearances?

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
None of your business.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Do you really
believe the <i>Chasseurs</i>

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:36.811 position:50% align:center
are responsible for all this?

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Stop following me.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I'm not following, I'm joining.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
See? Side by side.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Suit yourself.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Why, thank you, I plan to.

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé, this way.

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
Are you really breaking in?

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
[CHASSEUR 08A] Hey! What are
you two doing over there?

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Ooh, deus ex machina!

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.602 position:50% align:center
[CHASSEURS groaning]

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] There. One can
always rely on the Church

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
to provide what's
needed, eh, Noé?

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Let's see.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
It should be around here.

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Where does that passage lead?

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
The catacombs.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
You mean...?

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Not the same ones we saw today.

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
This is something secret.

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
somewhere only those in
the know are able to reach.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
The lair of the <i>Chasseurs</i> .

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] But, Vanitas, how do
you know about this place?

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
You move with such confidence.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.532 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling you've
been here before.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Vanitas.
Tell me honestly.

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
You already know
the truth, don't you?

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.416 position:50% align:center
All these vampire abductions.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
Who's responsible for them.

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:26.004 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
<i>Chasseurs</i> .

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
Although, you can't call these
people <i>Chasseurs</i> , really.

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I follow.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Listen, Noé. If we run
into any of them down here

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
and it comes to a fight,
the first thing they'll do

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
is go for your eyes.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
You underestimate
a human foe, you're dead.

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
This place is different

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center
from the areas
we've already seen.

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
Are these remains supposed
to be special or something?

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No. I think--

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
Inside this room,

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
all of the bones
are from vampires!

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
See that one?
If you look closely,

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
you'll notice that it
still has the fangs.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
Even in death, the bodies
of high-ranking vampires

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
retain such vestiges
of the Formulaic World.

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
All the bones that you
see here in this chamber

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
are from vampires
that were killed

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:32.612 position:50% align:center
by our predecessors in
the underground labyrinth.

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
The slayer's name is
mounted above each one.

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
Those called to
the noblest cause,

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
vying to be deemed
mightiest of all.

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Um, and you are?

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
Where are my manners?
I'm Roland Fortis.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
The Sixth Paladin, blessed with
the honor of the Jasper Gem.

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
Paladin?

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
You mean to say you're one of
the <i>Chasseurs</i> 12 captains?

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
Aw, cut it out!

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
I wasn't promoted to captain
until recently, so I can't brag!

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
And I haven't been working
this district for very long.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
I still need to
memorize the map.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
Which is why I decided
I should go out for a walk!

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
So? Who are you two guys?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
What could possibly bring
you down into the labyrinth

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
at such a late hour?

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
Um, please excuse us!

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
My name is Vincent,
and my companion is Gilbert.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
We happened to discover a secret
passage in the church building.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
We should've simply
reported it, but instead,

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
we ventured inside
to investigate.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
Then we ended up getting
lost for several hours.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.841 position:50% align:center
Wh-- Did you say <i>you're</i> lost?

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
That's funny, I'm lost as well!

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I-I'm sorry.
You're lost, Sir Roland?

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
Even though you work here?

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'm afraid so!

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
I have no idea how I'm supposed
to navigate these halls.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND laughs]

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
But then, we mustn't forget
that the Lord's hand

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
is in all things. How else
could I have stumbled across

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
you two kind gentlemen after
losing my way so hopelessly?

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Now, let us
go forth without fear!

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
My trusty subordinates
are certain

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
to be searching
everywhere for me!

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
Come along!

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Noé. Things could
get terribly ugly

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:17.967 position:50% align:center
if we end up back at the
<i>Chasseurs</i> ' guard post.

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
Do you think there's
any possible way

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
we can subdue this guy?

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
Not at all, at least,
no way that I can think of.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
All this was below us?

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Oh, my.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Vincent, come here!

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
I want you to look at something!

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Uh-- Sure.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] I think there's
some writing on this wall.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:45.704 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Where?

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Hey!

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
Close your eyes! Now!

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
A flash grenade?

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What's happening to my eyes?

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.728 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ groans]

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
Ah, I thought so.
So, you really are a vampire.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
It's painful, isn't it?

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
That light that just assaulted
your vision has the power

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
to render your eyes
completely useless.

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] The real world
and the formulaic world

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
are blurring together.

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ coughs]

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.419 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé!

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] You're wearing clothing
that doesn't belong to you.

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
Where might the owners be?
Have you murdered them?

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ grunts]
No.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] I don't know why
you've come to the catacombs,

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
but I can say for certain that
no vampire who sets foot in here

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:55.523 position:50% align:center
ever leaves alive.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
We are the <i>Chasseurs</i> .

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:04.115 position:50% align:center
You crimson-eyed heretics
known as the vampires...

00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:06.534 position:50% align:center
...are our prey!

00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:09.371 position:50% align:center
And our blade sweeps eternal!

00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
So saith the Lord God!
