00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
Right. You!

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.416 position:50% align:center
It was all you!

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It's your fault!

[NOÉ gasps]

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA] Ah! I thought
you looked familiar to me,

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't
place it! Now I know!

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
I saw you before, long ago,

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
but it was through
the eyes of another.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.481 position:50% align:center
What was that boy's name again--
could it have been...

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
Louis!

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.816 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.337 position:50% align:center
Let me introduce you.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.173 position:50% align:center
Noé. These are my grandchildren:

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
Louis and his little
sister, Dominique.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:59.179 position:50% align:center
Ah, it's wonderful
that you could be here

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.014 position:50% align:center
while Dominique is visiting!

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I have to rush
off again, but these two will

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
show you around the castle,
so ask them anything you'd like.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you, Noé.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
Hi. Um. It's nice to meet you.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you. <i>Bonjour.</i>

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Huh? You were
really raised by humans?

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Yes.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Hmm. And you've lived

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
in their world this whole time?

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Right.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Where are your parents?

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
But my grandma and grandpa
told me that I was crying

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.925 position:50% align:center
all by myself in the snow
on the day they found me.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
You're a dummy, you know that?

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't just believe
everything a human tells you.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Louis...

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
For all you know, those
monsters only abducted you

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center
so they could raise you as
their own until you grew up

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
big enough to eat for dinner!

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
<i>Non!</i> My grandma and grandpa

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
were good people, I know it!

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
So, don't talk like that.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
Oh, fine.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.178 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ sobbing]

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Noé.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ sobs]

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
There, there, don't cry!

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
Everything's all right!

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] So, after your
grandma and grandpa died,

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
you were taken
away by kidnappers?

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Mm-hm. Exactly. They took
me to a whole bunch of places.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
And then after a while,
Teacher finally bought me.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
<i>Bonsoir!</i> Sleep well, then.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
So why do you
call him "Teacher?"

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
Well, I called him Master once,

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
but then he told me I should
call him Teacher instead.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
Noé... Must have
been hard for you.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
Hard? Now that I'm
in Teacher's care,

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
I get three square meals a day,
and he's even letting me

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
visit the world of vampires!

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.187 position:50% align:center
It's just like one
great big vacation!

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center
You must be the biggest
weirdo I've ever met!

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.114 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Huh?

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS, NOÉ laughing]

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Aw, come on,
it isn't that funny!

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Louis and Domi were the
very first friends I ever had.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
You must be the people who live

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
in that big castle
deep in the forest!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50% align:center
Call me Fred!

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
I'm Gilles!

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
I'm Fanny!

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
Let's all play together!

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] We befriended
the village children.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center
We even had our own hideout.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Every day was special and fun.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
What? Is that true?

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
So when you drink someone's
blood, you learn about them?

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
See their memories?

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
Yep! These weird pictures

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
rush into my head
like whoosh, it's crazy!

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.451 position:50% align:center
That sounds incredible!
Try it on me!

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.703 position:50% align:center
You're okay with me
drinking your blood?

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
Wow, thank you!

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
Uh. I just saw myself
a bunch of times.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.547 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
Ooh, then it does work.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'll just take
your word for it.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
Get him, Noé!

--[NOÉ] Hup!
--[LOUIS yelps]

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
Well? What do you see?

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
Noé?

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I saw Louis, all alone,
surrounded by darkness.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] The sight of it
made me painfully sad.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
If only my power
as an Archiviste

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
had been greater back then.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
If only I could have
looked at his past.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Domi came to visit us
every month from the far-off

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
manor of the de Sade family.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
But Louis spent his days
at Teacher's castle.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] I was diagnosed
with a sickness

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
not long after I was born.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
They moved me out here
to Grandfather's castle

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
so I could get better.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
Get better? Better from what?

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
I don't know.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
Do you ever miss
your mother and father?

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
Why would I? They never miss me.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
I am dead to the
House of de Sade.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center

Louis? Are you still awake?

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Um, is it okay
if I sleep with you tonight?

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
You mind?

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
I suppose you can. Come on in.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Okay, then I'll join you!

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
I didn't even know
you were back there.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
Ugh. It's so crowded.
What's the matter, Noé?

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.936 position:50% align:center
You're not afraid of the
thunder, too, are you?

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
He's asleep.

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center

Brings back memories.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
The three of us always
used to sleep together.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
I know, but we're not
little children anymore.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
It would be nice if I could
live with you two all the time.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
When I'm at home--

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.168 position:50% align:center
all I get to do is study
and attend my lessons.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.003 position:50% align:center
I have so much more
fun when I'm here,

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
playing out in the
forest with everybody.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't say
those things, Domi.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center
You don't understand yet.
You don't know how the world is.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
When you get older...

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
...you'll see it more clearly.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
You'll know...
how precious you are.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center

vampire who makes

so merry at the sight
of the blue moon.

Hm?

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] Can you tell me
what a curse-bearer is?

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] I noticed there were a
bunch of documents about me

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
in your collection room earlier.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Oh, my goodness.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to leave
those things lying around.

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50% align:center
Don't say that.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
We both know you left them out
on purpose for me to find.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
Here, Domi. I have
something for you!

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] It's because I'm
a curse-bearer, isn't it?

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
Did my mother and
father have Domi

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
because they wanted
to forget about me?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
And if that's true,
then what am I to do about it?

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:43.411 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] My dear child,
you've got it all wrong.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:47.707 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying to persuade you
to do anything in particular.

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
You are free.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
And as such, you are welcome
to behave as you please.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
As for me, all that
I wish to do is observe

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
your free will in action
and take note of the results.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS sighs]

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
About what I expected.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
Nobody gets the whole
story here, do they?

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Hey, Louis.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
What is it you're making, there?

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
Not telling.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.376 position:50% align:center
Aw, come on! Tell me
what you're making.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
No way, it's a secret.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ grumbles]

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be a special
present from me to you.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I can't wait
to see it then!

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Well, you'll have to.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
Special present! Just for me!

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Looking back,
I think it was then

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
that Louis' behavior
began to change.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Wait. Are you
making another one now?

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
Yes. I messed up
on the other one.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
Louis. If there's something
wrong, please tell me!

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
I'd do anything in
the world to help you!

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
Noé. I'm a... a...

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Louis! Noé!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
Domi? What's wrong?

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
Noé! It's terrible!

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
I just overheard something
the maids said and I--!

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
And what?

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:45.492 position:50% align:center
It's Mina.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:48.703 position:50% align:center
She's to be killed.
Tomorrow, isn't that right?

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Mina's going to
be executed tomorrow?

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
But why? She hasn't
done anything wrong!

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
She didn't have to do anything.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
She's a curse-bearer.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] Any vampire found
to be a curse-bearer

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
is beheaded by a <i>bourreau</i> .

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
Mina is cursed?
How do you know that?

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
Well, then we have
to protect her somehow!

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:24.572 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
What are you, a fool? How?

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
What can you do?

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
Can you lift the curse
of the blue moon?

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
Obviously you can't.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
She's beyond anyone's
power to save.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
Shut up! How can you be so cold?

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
I'm just trying to be
honest with you, Noé.

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
But don't you think
we should at least try?

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
You think you can save her?
Fine! Go and try!

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
Louis.

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Listen to me.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
There's no way
you can protect her.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:59.816 position:50% align:center
There's nothing you can do.
Accept the truth!

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center
You don't know that!

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé!

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé. I want to save Mina, too.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
Maybe we can help her
escape the village!

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
[MINA panting]

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.394 position:50% align:center

Mina? What's the matter?

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:42.692 position:50% align:center
[MINA gasping]

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
Mina?

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
Can we do anything?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
Mina. Please, no!

Both of you are safe.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness
I wasn't too late.

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center

How could you do that?

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
I want blood now!

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
No, I need it!
More blood! More blood!

Noé?

More.

Domi, go!

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
Louis! Snap out of it!

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Are you angry with me?

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
Is it because I didn't
listen to you?

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
Look, it's my fault, okay?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.674 position:50% align:center
I'll gladly take
the blame for this!

00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center

come back Louis! Please!

Please, Noe.
I want you to kill me.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
Do it.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS groans] I'm begging you
for this one favor.

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
I can never return
to what I once was.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
It won't be long before
a <i>bourreau</i> comes for my head.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
The way I see it,

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
if I'm doomed to die,

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
then I want you
to be the one to kill me!

But, Louis... I can't.

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
I don't think
I could ever do that.

[NOÉ]
Louis. Louis. Louis.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
You can be harsh sometimes,

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
but you're really smart,
and you're kind.

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center

You're my most precious friend.

My brother said that
he wanted you to have it

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
whenever the time came.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center

keep it until then.

Not telling.

It's gonna be a special

[NOÉ] Louis, what could
you have felt inside

while you made these?

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
I want you to be
the one to kill me.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center

pick up that stake

I couldn't save you
from the curse.

one thing in exchange.
