00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:18.101 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
My vision. It's all a blur.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center
I feel sick.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé, be careful!

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
Don't try to fight
him like that!

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What? I have to!

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.741 position:50% align:center
There's no way
I'm leaving you here!

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
You are in no shape
to fret over me!

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you pay attention
to my warning, you idiot?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
Every time you open your mouth,

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
you say something
incomprehensible!

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50% align:center
It's maddening!

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.294 position:50% align:center
Why must you be
like this, Vanitas?

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] I'm sorry.
What did you just say?

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Vanitas?

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
That raven hair,
those sapphire eyes.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.684 position:50% align:center
Can it be true?

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS] What?
--[ROLAND] My word!

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.438 position:50% align:center
Vanitas, as I live and breathe!

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I'd like to breathe, too!

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.692 position:50% align:center
[yelping]

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.027 position:50% align:center
Dear God!

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.155 position:50% align:center
O mighty Lord, I thank you
for the divine guidance

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.949 position:50% align:center
of your holy hand!

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.037 position:50% align:center
I never thought you would bring
our paths together so soon!

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.663 position:50% align:center
So, the rumors about
you being used

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
by the vampires were true!

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:23.833 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Huh?!

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Did they coerce
you into cooperating?

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.588 position:50% align:center
Perhaps they're holding
your loved ones hostage?

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS] Stop!
--Oh, you poor, pitiful soul.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:36.137 position:50% align:center
Being forced to dwell among
vampires and the Blue Moon Clan.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.098 position:50% align:center
I can hardly imagine.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
You sniveling <i>Chasseurs</i>
just never change, do you?

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.981 position:50% align:center
Always looking down on everyone,

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.526 position:50% align:center
casting your pity
where it's not wanted!

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.902 position:50% align:center
Listen here!

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.529 position:50% align:center
No matter what
I do in this life,

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.489 position:50% align:center
it's always my own decision!

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:58.493 position:50% align:center
<i>I</i> consort with vampires.
<i>I</i> snuck into your lair.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:01.996 position:50% align:center
And <i>I</i> just raked your face.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.708 position:50% align:center
And I did it all
of my own free will!

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:09.671 position:50% align:center
You fools may be slaves to this
god of yours, but I won't be!

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.973 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Oh, you poor thing!

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
O Lord.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
Please have mercy upon
this lost soul!

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
He knows not the foolishness
of the blasphemous words

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
that he speaks against
your holy name!

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
You must open your eyes,
Dear Vanitas!

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
If you turn your back upon
the saving grace of the Lord,

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
then you'll never be able
to open your heart

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
to the healing power
of his almighty word!

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
Forget your god for
two seconds, would you?

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
Here. Look into my eyes!

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
The best way to witness
the Savior's love is to behold

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
the way his light
shines through me!

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] There is nothing for
you to fear, little lost lamb!

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
Though you may have gone astray,
the Lord won't abandon you!

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
His arms are open!

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
I promise you.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
I'll save you from the clutches
of the vampires, come what may!

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
This is nauseating!

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] My vision is
starting to come back.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
Now I can do something!

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
Very well, Durandal!

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
Noé!

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
He's fast!

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
<i>Chasseurs</i> are more than human!

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
They use drugs to enhance
their fighting prowess!

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot!

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
You could've told me
that earlier!

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
Great.

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Impressive. I've never
seen a vampire's mobility

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
return so promptly after being
incapacitated by that light.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Please, hold on!

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
If you'd just listen
to me, I could--

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
As I said.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
Every vampire who sets foot
in these catacombs is killed--

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
not one of them ever
leaves here alive!

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center
So, the humans here are
just like the vampires!

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
None of you bother
to listen to anyone at all!

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
I didn't notice a lever.

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
That means the only
way out must be...

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. In there!

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I'm at a disadvantage.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
I'll keep my distance and wait
for my strength to come back.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Trying to escape? You coward!

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
You're not going anywhere!

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
Not today!

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND gasps]

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Let's see how good
you are without your weapon.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ grunts]

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What in the world was that?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
You're finished!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
Owie.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Aw, they got away.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
Captain!

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
Ah. Maria, Georges, <i>bonsoir</i> !

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Your head
is bleeding, sir!

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad to see you!

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
I lost my way and
had an altercation

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
with a couple of infiltrators.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.607 position:50% align:center
One of them turned out
to be a vampire.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.405 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Now then. Time to hunt.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Oh, Vanitas! Where are you?

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
The Light is calling!

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
Captain, please!

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
Don't you think you
should lower your voice?

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Don't be silly!

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.503 position:50% align:center
If he hears me calling for him,
then he might respond!

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
I don't think he will.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Vanitas!

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
Sir, that's enough!

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.968 position:50% align:center
Ugh! That guy's so creepy!

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center
There's something
very off about him.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
Did you notice his eyes?
All pure and full of goodwill?

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
He's the worst
kind of person, Noé!

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
I despise sanctimonious
fools who look malice

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
clear in the face and
pretend it's something else!

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
They're willing
to twist any reality

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
to suit their own
ridiculous narratives;

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.362 position:50% align:center
it's absolutely infuriating!

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
Sorry for laughing.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
I never imagined
you'd meet your match,

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
but I guess the day
had to come eventually.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
He isn't so bad, though.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
You know, I think he might
even be growing on me.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center
That's great. Go bother him,
why don't you?

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
How do your eyes feel?

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
They seem to be
better now, thank you.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
But the two worlds are
still a mixed-up blur,

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
so that's making me
feel kind of nauseous.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
If that light badly
distorts your vision,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
then you can't modify
the World Formula.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.524 position:50% align:center
So you can't use
the battle techniques

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
that you're accustomed to.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center
I know you enhance
your body during combat.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
What else can you
do by tampering

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
with the World Formula?

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Uh... If I try, I can
stand on walls or ceilings.

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
Do you think
you can defeat him?

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure, but...

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
I know we can together.

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé. The truth is,

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
I came here looking for someone.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
His name is Moreau.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
He used to be a <i>Chasseur</i> , until
his obsessive vampire research

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
took a turn for madness
and got him expelled.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
Look at this.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the same button
that Dante took off

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
one of the kidnappers?

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Look at the other side.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
There's a number.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
"128."

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
It's a production number.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
All these kidnappings.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
They weren't committed
by <i>Chasseurs</i> --

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
not normal ones, anyway.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
They're enhanced humans,

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
the result of unorthodox
experimentation,

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.693 position:50% align:center
the work of Moreau.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU]
Hm... Hm!

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:19.077 position:50% align:center
Why, whom do we have here?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
Is it me, or does the ponytailed
lad seem a trifle familiar?

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
Hm... Hm...

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
Vanitas? The Vampire
of the Blue Moon?

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
That blue-eyed fellow
from so long ago

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:36.136 position:50% align:center
called himself by
that very same name.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Eureka! By George,
<i>sacre bleu</i> , <i>et voila</i> !

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
It is him! The same
lad I once knew!

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
Welcome home!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:49.774 position:50% align:center
Finally, my precious test
subject has returned!

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
The Vampire of the Blue Moon
may have taken you away from me,

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
but there's not
a force in this world

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
that could keep
us apart forever!

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
All right, well, let's go.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] I repeat,
there are two intruders.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
A light-haired vampire
and a raven-haired human.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
Careful. I require the human

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
be kept alive at any cost.
You must not kill him.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
To think two trespassers

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
would be such trouble.
Olivier will have my head.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
Sir, I hate to overstep my
position by asking this, but,

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
shouldn't we have said it was
Vanitas of the Blue Moon?

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
Oh, you think?

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
What?!

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
I'll submit a full report later.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
Now. Let's hunt!

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center
They can't hide from us
in our own territory.

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:53.171 position:50% align:center
I hope you're ready to join
your brethren on the shelf,

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
you miserable vampire!

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
The automatons.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
They're turning against us?

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
The astermite inside
is glowing bright red!

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've
seen that before.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
Speak to me.

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
What happened here?

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
Captain.

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
Those intruders,
don't let them fool you!

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
It sounds crazy,
but I get the feeling

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.445 position:50% align:center
they have this whole
labyrinth memorized!

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
We were on their trail,

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
but then they circled around
behind us like shadows!

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
They jumped us!

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
And then we were blinded
by an eldritch light.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center
That was when I understood
that the hunters

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
had become the hunted.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
You mean <i>The Book of Vanitas</i>

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
can even manipulate machines?

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Not exactly,
but it did allow me to tamper

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
with the astermite that
powers the automatons.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
And I'm sure you're smart
enough to put together

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
why that's possible, right, Noé?

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Don't tell me.
Did you rewrite the formula?

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Precisely.
That stone has a conduit

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
to the World Formula,
just as vampires do,

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
so I put it to use.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
Pity. I thought we
might reach our goal

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
without tangling
with the <i>Chasseurs</i> .

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50% align:center
Things never go as planned.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I have so many other questions.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
How do you know this place
well enough to out-navigate

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
Roland and his subordinates?

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
What is this Moreau
trying to achieve?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
What sort of connection
do you have with him?

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
And why is it that
at times like these...

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
...you always make that face?

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Hey. Can you not make that face?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?
This is how I look!

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
That must be rough.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Both of my parents
were killed by a vampire.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.704 position:50% align:center
And then, because the <i>Chasseurs</i> ,

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
in their infinite righteousness,
came along and rescued me

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
from suffering the same fate,

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.920 position:50% align:center
I was trained by the Church
as one of their recruits.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
But before I was ready
to join the ranks,

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
Moreau took a liking to me and
made me his guinea pig instead.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
End of story.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
End of story? That's it?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.935 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Hm? Oh, and I spent
several years down here,

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
so I know my way around.
That explains everything, right?

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Well, sort of, but...

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
He said all those things

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
like they happened
to someone else.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Despite that, you don't
hold a grudge against vampires?

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
As far as I'm concerned,

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
there's very little that
separates humans from vampires.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
A monster is a monster.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
They're all equally
selfish and cruel.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
That face again! I'm sick of it!

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
Lower your voice, would you?

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
I can't stand it
when you look like that!

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
It makes me so angry!

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Well, this is
what I look like,

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.144 position:50% align:center
so get used to it!

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
Don't lie to me, I know
something's wrong!

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
Quiet!

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
Ah, finally! There you are!

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
Noé! Try not to look!

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
The gate closed!

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
[SQUAD MEMBERS groaning]

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
We'll catch them! To the bypass!

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:15.874 position:50% align:center
Wait, Maria!

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
No good. The controls
have gone down.

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS pants]

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé, no more fighting.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
We have to beat Roland without
risking a pitched battle.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Are you serious?

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Yes. He's a formidable foe.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.478 position:50% align:center
Perhaps one of the mightiest
of the <i>Chasseurs</i> .

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
If we fight, we won't
come out unscathed.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
We must remain
focused on our goal.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
Reaching Moreau and the enhanced
humans he's taken such pains

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
to create. And if they yet live,
the abducted vampires, as well.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
We can't risk any wounds
that will slow us down.

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50% align:center
One way or another,
this ends now.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
[MARIA groans]

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.548 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] That's no way
to treat a young lady!

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
A tasty fly caught in our web.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
We are taking this
young lady hostage!

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
No. Overruled.

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
I overrule your overruling.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
Must you be so difficult?

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
Trust me, this is
the easiest way

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
to deal with so-called
men of honor.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm against it.

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
We'll just anger him more
and dash any hope we have

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
of a peaceful resolution.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Haven't you
been paying attention?

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
There is no peaceful
resolution with him!

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
You do not know that!

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
If we just explain
the situation,

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll see that we--

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
This is exactly what
makes you people so weak!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
You have such great power,

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
yet you dig your own graves
by shackling yourselves.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
That's what you think?

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
Enough! This
conversation is over.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
If you don't like
my way of doing things,

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
by all means, go it alone.

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
I'll be better off.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
Working with a
naive fool like you

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
will probably be the
death of me someday.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sure Roland
and his preachy pals

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
will welcome you, so run along,
you candy-brained bloodsucker!

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
Message received, Vanitas,

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
and I take back
what I said before.

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
We are going to take
a hostage after all.

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Dear Vanitas!

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
Remain right where you are.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
One false move and I'll
happily snap his neck in two

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
without a moment's hesitation.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
No stealing my lines.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
Come up with your own,
you cheater.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Unclean devil!

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
How can you stoop so low?

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
[GEORGES]
Please calm yourself, Captain.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
It may very well be a trap.

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Yes, but if it's not...

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
[whispering] What are you
thinking, you idiot?

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
He'll see through this
ridiculous act of yours.

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Act? You say the
silliest things, Vanitas.

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
Did I not tell you before?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
We can handle it
if we work together, no?

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Your eyes are terrifying.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ laughs]
--[VANITAS] Help me, Roland!

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ laughs]
--He's a total maniac!

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.836 position:50% align:center
Don't just stand there,
do something!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
Please, I'm too young to die!

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] You really think
this is all a ruse, Georges?

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
Well, it is rather convincing.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
I will admit, There is
one thing you said earlier

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.265 position:50% align:center
in which I can see the wisdom.

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Huh?

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] A protracted battle
won't turn out in our favor.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
With that in mind...

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
What are you doing--

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Oh, no!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Pardon me!

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
Pleased to meet you, Roland!

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Huh?

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Noé.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
I came with Vanitas to
investigate an incident.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé, you utter imbecile.

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.769 position:50% align:center
What are you hoping
to accomplish here?

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
First, I must apologize

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
for entering your
domain without leave.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
It was quite
inconsiderate of us.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
However, you have my word
we did not kill the men

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
we took these clothes from,

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
nor did we cause
them undue harm.

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
So please, hear us out.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't have come down
here without good reason.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:26.207 position:50% align:center
You know something, vampire?
You are very strange.

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
To the captain!

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
Doctor Moreau is still alive!

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS sighs] Now do you think
you're ready to listen?

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
[GEORGES] That is shocking
news, assuming it's true.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.518 position:50% align:center
To think Doctor Moreau could be
operating right under our noses

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
after we cast him
out, the villain.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
[MARIA] And he's the one behind
the vampire abductions?

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a Tall Tale to me.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree, Captain?

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
No. It actually does make sense

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
and there are no
inconsistencies in his story.

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:01.576 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
But, sir...

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.286 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what about
that stunt you pulled?

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
You threw me!

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
Wha-- I was careful to make sure
you didn't break anything.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
I think you may be
missing the point.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
So, are you absolutely
sure you're a vampire?

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just, you're
quite a bit different

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
from any vampire I've
ever encountered before.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
Obviously, given that
you're a <i>Chasseur</i> captain.

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
You people only hunt
the violent ones

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
who go on rampages
in the human world.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.
That's a good point.

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
You certainly are
an intriguing intruder.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.192 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.777 position:50% align:center
It's decided!

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
Noé, you and I shall be
the best of friends.

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
I want to learn every last thing
there is to know about you.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Okay!

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.249 position:50% align:center
We have a common foe, it seems.

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
Let's set aside our
differences and work together.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
What? No!

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:56.381 position:50% align:center
You don't really mean to join
forces with him, do you?

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
Why not? This news concerning
Moreau's activities

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
is something we <i>Chasseurs</i>
must investigate at once.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:02.470 position:50% align:center
[GEORGES] We should
inform our superiors...

00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
I'd rather drop dead

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
than team up with
you holy-rollers!

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.891 position:50% align:center
Don't dare try to follow us!

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
This is great.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
As soon as we discussed
the situation, he understood.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:14.024 position:50% align:center
It worked out. I'm so glad!

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
But, I'm curious.
Why all the fuss?

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
If you'd explained
yourselves sooner,

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
there would have been
no need for the fisticuffs.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
[BOTH scream]

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
Vanitas--

00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
This is it. We're here.

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:49.726 position:50% align:center
<i>Bienvenue!</i>

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
I'm so pleased
to welcome you home!

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
You're back! My number 69! Hah!

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:59.235 position:50% align:center
Tell me honestly!
You remember me, don't you?

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
It's your old friend
Doctor Moreau!

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:05.658 position:50% align:center
Vanitas?

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:07.702 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU] Someone come over and
take a <i>darguerreotype</i> of us!

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.874 position:50% align:center
Doctor! Bonjour!
