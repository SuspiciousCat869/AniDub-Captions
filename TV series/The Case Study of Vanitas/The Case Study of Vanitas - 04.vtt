[TEACHER]
The World Formula Theory,

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
an idea first proposed by
the great alchemist Paracelsus.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.899 position:50% align:center
It claims that,
just beyond the human domain,

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
there lies another realm,
wherein the entire mortal world

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.906 position:50% align:center
has been replaced with formulas.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
Paracelsus believed
that if one could

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
rewrite the world's
constitutive formulas at will,

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
it would be possible to
rid existence of its ills

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.668 position:50% align:center
and steer humanity
toward total happiness.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.005 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
He immersed himself in his work,

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:49.049 position:50% align:center
and eventually
performed an experiment

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
that meddled with the
World Formula itself.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
His actions brought
about something

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:57.015 position:50% align:center
known as the Babel incident.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] Babel visited
all manner of calamities

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.567 position:50% align:center
upon humankind. And afterward,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
the people noticed things
that hadn't existed before.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
Such as flowers that glowed
with their own light.

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
Minerals with a blue radiance.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center
And the emergence
of humanoid beings

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.540 position:50% align:center
with crimson-colored eyes.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
They were anomalies,
mutations of ordinary things.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.837 position:50% align:center
The disruption of
the World Formula

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.215 position:50% align:center
had caused them to change.

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
And so, today,

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.762 position:50% align:center
we have airships equipped with
aerodynamic lift generators,

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:40.058 position:50% align:center
steam locomotives, streetlights,
and many other innovations.

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.727 position:50% align:center
All powered by
astermite, a mineral

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.940 position:50% align:center
created by rewriting the
constitutive formula for coal.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.983 position:50% align:center
And vampires came
to be when Babel

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.570 position:50% align:center
rewrote the constitutive
formula for humans.

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.864 position:50% align:center
It created a brand-new species.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.200 position:50% align:center
Does that mean us, too?

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.785 position:50% align:center
Indeed it does.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] I'm sure few,
if any of humanity's children

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
know the truth regarding
the World Formula.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:11.047 position:50% align:center
But, we must never forget it.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.675 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] You seem to be
enjoying this, Teacher.

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.845 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Hm? Ah, yes, I am.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.346 position:50% align:center
Quite a lot.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.600 position:50% align:center
In fact, I expect I'll enjoy it
even more as time goes by.

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
And all because I know
I'll have you to accompany me.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:30.984 position:50% align:center
My darling little
kitten. <i>Mon Chaton.</i>

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Isn't this carriage a bit much?

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] I told you,
we're going to a ball.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:17.007 position:50% align:center
You're not planning to wear
those dowdy clothes, are you?

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
If you're about to change,

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
can you please
take off my collar?

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
So I can go wait with Vanitas?

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
Domi, listen.
Is something wrong?

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Did I make a mistake
by bringing Vanitas with us?

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
I figured it would be a good
idea to have him around

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
if our intention was to learn
more about curse-bearers.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
But I should've considered
how that might make you feel.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Domi.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE sighs]

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
I'm just worried, that's all.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
I know he has <i>The Book of</i>
<i>Vanitas</i> and you came here

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
because of my
grandfather's instructions.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
But still, you're
getting involved

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.305 position:50% align:center
with curse-bearers
directly, too.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
And I worry that it's because

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
you've convinced
yourself that what happened

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
years ago was your fault.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Domi...

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
You smell so good.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE chuckles] You haven't
dropped a hint like that

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
in a long time.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] But hints won't do.
You must tell me what you want.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
Well, Noé? Do you
crave my blood?

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
I do, Domi.
Please let me have it.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
All right.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
My blood is all yours,
then, <i>mon chéri</i> .

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Hm? What? Do you feel unwell?

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Masks. Jesters.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
I can't help thinking
about what I saw.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
A flower for you, <i>cher</i> .

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.961 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful!

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
Did you see that, <i>Maman</i> ?

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
[CATHERINE'S MOTHER]
<i>Oui, tres bon, Catherine!</i>

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
[CATHERINE'S SISTER]
You are so lucky!

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS groans]

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Would you please
stop fooling around?

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Me "fooling around"?

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
What about your little dalliance

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
while I was sitting
right outside the door?

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] My little what?
What are you...?

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
I told you,
Domi's my dear friend.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
Don't say things that could
be taken the wrong way.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
It could invite trouble for her.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Huh. You vampires
have an interesting way

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
of expressing friendship.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
You mean our little exchange

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:35.121 position:50% align:center
in the carriage before, yes?

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
Noé had a thirst,
and he wanted my blood

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
simply because it wasn't
the first time he's tasted it.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center
When an Archiviste
drinks from a new source,

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
they see that person's memories.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
But Noé's never been
comfortable doing so

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.387 position:50% align:center
unless the other party is
in agreement first, you see.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.596 position:50% align:center
That's why--

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
Wait, where did he go?

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Perhaps you should've
left the collar on him.

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
No matter. Come in here.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
Scream and cry all you want,

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
no one is coming
to rescue you.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
Look at that!
They have automatons here!

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
But I heard that vampires mostly
disliked human technology.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
Domi, what's tonight's
host gonna b--

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
Domi?

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
Hold on, did I lose them,
or did they lose me?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] Do you mean to say that
my uncle still hasn't arrived?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.805 position:50% align:center
And he hasn't sent any
word or message at all?

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 04A]
None.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Hm. I hope nothing's happened.

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
Just in case, please
inform Marquis Machina

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
of the situation.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.773 position:50% align:center
For now, I suppose I'll
have to take it upon myself

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
to continue looking for--

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
[LUCA grunts]

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, what
are you doing here?

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me...
you followed us!

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
Of course not! I was--

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE 04A]
Master Lucius. Who is this man?

00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Lucius?

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
He's, well...

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
He's an acquaintance of mine,
if you must know!

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
--Come!
--[NOÉ] U-Uh...

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Hurry up!

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.133 position:50% align:center
There's something very
important we must discuss!

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE panting]

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
Please, no. Not right now. No!

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
Answer me, human.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
Why choose Noé?
What is it you're after?

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
[huffs] Who knows?

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] I won't try
to stop Noé from simply

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
spending his time with you.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
If it's what he wants,
I'll even help,

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
where I can.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
But, if you're trying to use

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.046 position:50% align:center
his unique abilities for
your own selfish purposes...

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] This "childhood
friend" routine is precious.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
But we both know
men only pay attention

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
to women like you when
it's convenient for them.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Listen, human.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:14.239 position:50% align:center
I do not deny that the Vampire
of the Blue Moon exists.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
And if Noé believes it,
then I am prepared to continue

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.495 position:50% align:center
under the assumption that both
you and <i>The Book of Vanitas</i>

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
are as genuine as
you are formidable.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
What I don't understand
is why you,

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.169 position:50% align:center
the bearer of the
blue moon's power,

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
keep babbling on
about saving us,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
the Vampires of
the Crimson Moon.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
It defies all reason.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
Vanitas bears a deep and
well-documented grudge

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
against all of us.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he sent you to kill us.
How are we to trust in you?

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
We are not fools!

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
After all, you did assume
the name of Vanitas!

Is that alone not proof
that you worship

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
the Vampire of the Blue Moon?

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
I worship him?

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
Where would you get
such an outrageous idea?

[VANITAS laughs]

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Interesting.
You do have a point there.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
All the vampires I've
encountered thus far

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
have only thought in
terms of whether or not

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> was real.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
Well, that's because they
were fools, every one of them!

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
But now I see.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
I've been going
about this backward!

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center
My first step

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
should have been
burning my existence

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
into your feeble little
brains forever!

[inhales]

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Attention, all vampires!

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
I am called Vanitas!

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
The Vampire of the Blue Moon
left to me his name

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
as well as his famed grimoire.

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
Yet, I am but a human!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.059 position:50% align:center
The devil is he doing up there?

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] First, I intend
to remove any and all doubt

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
that I number among
the Clan of the Blue Moon.

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
And this will be my proof.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
[GUEST 04C]
It's the mark!

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.910 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I trust that everyone
in attendance understands

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
who this marking represents.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center
And I'm sure your
instincts can tell you

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
what sort of power has been
bestowed upon me as a result.

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
[GUEST 04C]
Kill that man!

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Tear him limb from limb
before it's too late!

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.009 position:50% align:center
[GUESTS grunt]

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.475 position:50% align:center
Take a good look.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.894 position:50% align:center
For this is <i>The Book of Vanitas</i> .

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
It's able to corrupt your
true names with ease,

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
plunging you into a despair
worse than death--

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
a truly accursed tome!

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
But I can assure you that
you have nothing to fear.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
You should all count
yourselves fortunate!

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
I, the present-day
Vanitas, am your savior!

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
And you will soon
find yourselves redeemed

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
by the very book that
was meant to condemn you

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
from here to eternity!

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
You need only sit by,
trembling with humiliation

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
while you are saved by my hand!

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
[GUESTS gasp]

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] What, you object?
I don't give a damn!

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
It's happening,
no matter what you say!

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
Because that will be my revenge!

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
My ultimate retribution
upon Vanitas!

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
I will save the vampires,
and no one will stop me!

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] So that's it. That's why
you're so determined.

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
And there you have it!

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
If there are any
curse-bearers in attendance,

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
please don't hesitate
to step forward!

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
As a doctor
specializing in vampires,

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
I give you my
professional guarantee

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center

Me?

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
[GUEST 04H] The Clan of the
Blue Moon will save us, huh?

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
They're the reason
we have curse-bearers!

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center

you're talking about?

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center

Foul creature!

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
What does that fool
think he's doing?

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
I couldn't say.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.917 position:50% align:center
And why do it here

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:37.377 position:50% align:center
Not a clue.

is what all the fuss is about!

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] What on earth is
that dreadful man doing here?

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
Ugh, his human stench is
enough to turn my stomach.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
Gah! My sister Veronica!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center
I didn't even think
she was coming!

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center

Just as our forebears did,
we'll track down

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center
and slay this filthy beast
before he can harm us,

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center

the bane of our kind!

suddenly decided to help him?

[LUCA] I told her I wished
to see you two again,

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center

I wasn't thinking clearly,

to pick and choose.

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
The sweet scent of fresh blood.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What's gotten into you?

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
My fangs could kill you or
fill your body with poison.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why you're
willing to let me bite you.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to do?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I don't know.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] At the moment, I guess
I don't care what happens.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
No, wait. That's not it.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
[GANO gasps]

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
[GANO grunts]

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I'm intrigued.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
If you were to drink my blood,

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
what would such
a thing feel like?

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
That's right.

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
No matter what happens, the
fact is, I'm in love with you.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
Now, drink of me, Jeanne.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
No. I can't.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
I don't want it
to be your blood.

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
Here, Jeanne! It's for you!

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
[heartbeats]

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS grunts]

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Now I get it.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. Jeanne, this isn't bad.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:48.933 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
In fact...

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I'll ask you once more.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.690 position:50% align:center
Who are you? Tell me!

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
[MONSIEUR SPIDER]
Charlatan.

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA laughs]

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:06.785 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
That's right. We are Charlatan.
