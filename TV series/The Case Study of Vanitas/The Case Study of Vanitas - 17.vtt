[NAENIA]
What's this?

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA screaming]

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
She's using the
Alteration Engine

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.378 position:50% align:center
to generate a physical
form for Naenia!

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] I've wrestled with this
dilemma for such a long time.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
I searched for a means to
end this eternal nightmare.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:58.808 position:50% align:center
For some way to lay my hands
upon this ethereal thing.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.023 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Finally.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
Now I will be able to slay you.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] My father told me
something before he died.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.533 position:50% align:center
He said, "Those born into
nobility are honor-bound

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.577 position:50% align:center
to protect their fief's people.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
And the d'Apchier family
is proud to do so."

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.209 position:50% align:center
Which is why, no matter
how they mistreat me

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
or how desperately
I wish to kill them,

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.673 position:50% align:center
I can't possibly hate the people
of the d'Apchier fiefdom!

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
No, I love them!

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
It's the sworn duty
of every d'Apchier!

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.514 position:50% align:center
I can forgive what they've
done, but I can't

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:41.768 position:50% align:center
give you the same grace, for you
dared to lay your filthy hands

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.186 position:50% align:center
upon my one and only.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
You stole Jean-Jacques's
true name.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.900 position:50% align:center
And for that, you will pay.

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.819 position:50% align:center
After all.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:54.948 position:50% align:center
I warned you before that
I'm a terribly jealous woman.

What the devil is that noise?

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
Sir! We have a problem!

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
I hate to say it,
but I believe that somebody

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
might've just
activated the engine!

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
I'm detecting incredible
amounts of energy

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center
from inside the castle!

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO]
Come, Marco!

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Wait, where are you going?

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Whatever's going on in there,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
something tells
me it's not good.

Hey!

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
What is that thing? Naenia?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
You're harder to kill
than I imagined you'd be.

[NAENIA screaming]

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? It hurts?

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
Good, I want you to feel
every last bit of my rage.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No, don't.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
Vanitas!

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Stop it!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
You mustn't provoke
her any further!

Oh, the pain!

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
It's excruciating!

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts,
it hurts, it hurts,

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50% align:center

Release her from
that bodily form!

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
Do it right now!

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.608 position:50% align:center
You mustn't let Naenia
remember who she really is!

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.818 position:50% align:center
You will not be
able to kill her!

Don't be afraid, Luca.

[LOKI laughs]

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
We tried so very hard to destroy
that woman's body for good,

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
but it seems some of her remains

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
may have been left
scattered about.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
It won't let me defy this
all-powerful presence

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center

Vanitas. I don't understand.

Who is that? Is it still Naenia?

00:06:55.874 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
It's her. She's a malnomen.
Death's Keeper.

And its vessel
is Queen Faustina,

Huh? Ah, yes.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center

He can't be saved.
All has been lost.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center

Curse that wretched Naenia!

She couldn't just quietly
disappear, could she?

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center
Why is evil so loud?

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
Listen, Noé.

Chloé d'Apchier's

a protective field around her.

it begins to cover a larger

every living thing in its path.

If you knew that this
whole time, don't you think

it would have been smart
to at least mention it to me?

And I don't just
mean Chloé's thing!

But about Naenia, too!

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center

that part till now!

Actually, yes!

What?!

If you'd said something,

then maybe all this would
have turned out differently!

there's no way to know!

No, of course not!

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center

A pack of wolves?

[NOÉ] If I let Vanitas
handle this, I can--

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
No, I'd better not.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Those aren't just
ordinary wolves.

We're out of time!

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
What can I do?

Here we go, Durendal.

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
We meet again.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
Somehow, I knew the two of you
were at the heart of this.

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
I'm ever grateful
for God's guiding light.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center

[VANITAS squeaks]

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
It's a fleet!

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
Sorry, friend!

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
But those Orcas are
<i>Chasseur</i> vessels,

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
so it's best if I make sure
they don't notice you!

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't believe
the time we've had!

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
We were on our way to Saugues
when a blizzard kicked up

00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
out of nowhere!

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
Next thing we knew,
the mountains had crumbled,

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
and wolves were attacking!

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
One thing's for sure,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
this is the work of
the Beast of Gévaudan.

[NOÉ]
Oh, no.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
He wants to slay the Beast, too?

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
A-Actually...

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
So! What's our strategy?

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
If the two of you are here,
then it's safe to assume

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
that there's a curse-bearing
vampire involved.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
That's your area
of expertise, <i>non</i> ?

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
I want this conflict
resolved peacefully.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:27.849 position:50% align:center
So just tell me
what I need to do.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
Roland, you fool!
Where did you go?

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
How dare you disappear
and leave us in the lurch?

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.405 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Hold on, are you saying
you wanna help us?

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:43.615 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
Don't be absurd! Come now!

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
I thought it was quite obvious

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center
how terribly fond
I am of you both!

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:53.458 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Roland!
You're very kind!

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
I'm fond of you, too!

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.379 position:50% align:center
<i>Merci beaucoup</i> , gentlemen!

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
Hey, Noé doesn't speak for me!

[growls]

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Fulfilling her
purpose as a d'Apchier

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
gives meaning to Chloé's life.

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
That's why it's of
the utmost importance

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
that we not let the people
of Gévaudan perish.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
If Chloe were to lose
control and kill even

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
one denizen of this
region by accident,

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't be able to bring
her out of her rampage.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
Even if we saved her,

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.905 position:50% align:center
there'd be no
salvation for her soul.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of it!

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
That said, the fact
remains that I'm here

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
as a paladin of the <i>Chasseurs</i> .

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
If things escalate further,

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
I have no problem with beheading
vampires as I see fit.

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.883 position:50% align:center
Don't force me to slay
the beast, for I will.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Now that
we've got that settled,

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
it's time to get to work!

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
You two go ahead and do
what only you can do!

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Careful there.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
Hauteclaire's going
to get broken again

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
if you don't learn
a little restraint.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND laughs]
You've always had a penchant

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.203 position:50% align:center
for swinging that thing
around like mad.

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
Hold your tongue!

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50% align:center
Where on earth have you been?

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
Ah, right.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
I'm so very glad
you asked, Olivier.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind,
I need a favor.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
The answer is no.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Ah, <i>merci</i> !

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
I knew you'd cooperate!

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
I only need about half
an hour of your time.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.805 position:50% align:center
Get ready to embark on
a rescue mission with me!

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
I told you no!

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] But I know you
disagree with our orders.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.019 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Oh, for the love of--

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.104 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] We were told to kill
every vampire we encounter

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.607 position:50% align:center
in Gévaudan, don't you remember?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center
But we're not at war.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
If we kill vampires who don't
have anything to do with this,

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
it's only going to
make things worse.

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
So why give us
those instructions?

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
It's almost as though the Church
is trying to cover something up.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
It simply doesn't
feel right to me.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND chuckles]

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] My intention is
to have a conversation

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
with the curse-bearer inside
that castle without killing her.

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] You want to speak
to the curse-bearer?

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
Wait. Those two men.

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
They're here, aren't they?

defeat this monster!

is the rescue effort!

[RUTHVEN] You will now
enter a long slumber,

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
not to awaken until
the war has ended.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
When vampires and humans will
live together in harmony.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, your body
and mind can heal.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
That's right.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
I was asleep for
such a long time

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
that I must've
forgotten my purpose.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to be
a mere puppet, a tool,

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
with no will of
my own whatsoever.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:25.618 position:50% align:center
This time, I can't fail.
I have to end Chloé's life.

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] But Chloé d'Apchier
isn't the Beast,

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:30.915 position:50% align:center
you saw it with your own eyes.

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] It doesn't matter. Lord
Ruthven ordered me to put a stop

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
to the devastation in Gévaudan.

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] That may be true, but
he didn't tell you to kill her.

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:42.552 position:50% align:center
The Beast murdered
all those innocent people,

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
and Chloé was directly involved.

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
I have no other option.

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.936 position:50% align:center
And either way, she's
still a curse-bearer.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
<i>Bourreau</i> kill curse-bearers
who lose control.

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:58.735 position:50% align:center
It's our job.

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
She's beyond help now.
It's all over. That's why.

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:05.742 position:50% align:center
--I must--
--[VANITAS] You're wrong!

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
