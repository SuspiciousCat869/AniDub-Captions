[VANITAS sobbing]

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
What's wrong with me?

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
Why can't I kill you?

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
I just can't!

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.777 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Damn it!

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.112 position:50% align:center
Why? Why?

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I'm sorry, Vanitas.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Forgive me.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:47.273 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS sighs]

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
Wait, Vanitas!
Please don't die on me!

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:55.115 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Hurry up! Kill him!

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.783 position:50% align:center
What are you waiting for?

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
You said you'd kill anyone
who drank your blood!

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.871 position:50% align:center
So do it already!

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.915 position:50% align:center
I told you before, big brother,

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one you need!

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.836 position:50% align:center
Who cares if he dies?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
Is that what this is?

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.134 position:50% align:center
You were trying to get me
to drink Vanitas's blood

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.178 position:50% align:center
because you knew it would
drive him to kill me?

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.848 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] I miss Father.
I wish the three of us

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.433 position:50% align:center
could be together again.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
That was all I wanted!

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.648 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] But you just couldn't
do that one little thing for me.

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
Which means, now,
she has to die.

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:44.956 position:50% align:center
Let me go.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
No, I won't.

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.752 position:50% align:center
But Misha wants for me to jump.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
I have to pay the price because
Noé didn't do what he was told.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.590 position:50% align:center
I won't let you.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
You agreed to it.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
You can't just go back
on what you said,

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.804 position:50% align:center
and Noé would be
better off without--

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.640 position:50% align:center
The answer is no!

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I've come
to despise myself

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.728 position:50% align:center
more than anything.

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
I'm too weak to make a choice,
much less follow through!

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
But, as cowardly as I may be,

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
I still draw the
line at one thing.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
I won't forgive
anyone who hurts Noé.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
I saw the look of helpless
rage on his face

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
when I was plunging
toward the ground!

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.624 position:50% align:center
If my death causes him pain,
then I will not die!

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
But I have no choice.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
Misha said he wants
me to, remember?

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
When someone gives me an order,
I'm supposed to obey it!

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
Certainly, you must realize.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
That's you, the real you,
that you've kept tucked away

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
in the shadows for so long now.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
--[DOMINIQUE] Too late...
--[DOMINIQUE] I'm sorry, Jeanne.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.353 position:50% align:center
--I hate her.
--Please don't hate Noé...

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
--No. Why? I don't understand.
--Oh, Louis.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
...can you forgive me?

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
Mikhail used that book
to find the most vulnerable

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
part of your mind
and use it against you,

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
but he has no real
power over you.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
Our true names are untouched.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS, MIKHAIL] They haven't
been defiled in the least.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
You're still alive! Why?

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you doing
what I asked of you?

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50% align:center
[panting] I guess
I'll just have to take

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
whatever I can get, then.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] I want you to
kill everyone in sight.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRES hiss]

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
Kill them all!

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
Kill them all! Kill them all!

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
What's happening to me?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL screams]

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
You know this is all
your fault, big brother!

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
It looks like
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i>

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
is devouring Mikhail alive!

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé. Forget about me,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
you have to get out of here.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
He's interfered
with the astermite

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
in the amusement park so much
that it sent the book

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
spiraling out of control.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
But...

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] If everything explodes
at the same time, it's over.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
I'm not leaving!

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center
Vanitas! Noé!

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.156 position:50% align:center
Lady Dominique? How did you...?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
It's all right now.

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
From this moment on,
you and I will do

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
all we can to look out
for each other.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
Now, let's take up our swords
and defend the ones we love.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Kill them, Mademoiselle!

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
Do as I command you!

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
I want everyone who stands
against us to drop dead!

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRES roaring]

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
She's so strong.
So very beautiful.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
There, it's done.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
Domi? Domi!

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
Noé, you're safe.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:19.773 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL grunting]

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
Help me! Please, big brother!

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
I'm stuck. I can't
get my arm free!

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
[sobbing] Big brother!

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Save me!

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
[screams] It hurts!

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
It hurts, it hurts,
it hurts, it hurts!

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
How could you do such
a terrible thing to me?

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
Why, big brother? It hurts!

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS groans]

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Hey!

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center
Vanitas? Say something!

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
My, how marvelous.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] Part of me thought I
should have stopped you sooner,

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
but now I'm glad I let things
play out for a little while.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
What an inspiring sight.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:52.323 position:50% align:center
And I have you to thank
for showing it to me.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
It's a treat to see you again

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
after such a long time, my
darling kittens, Mes Chatons.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE, NOÉ gasp]

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50% align:center
What? Grandfather, it's you?
But how can that be?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] It's a pleasure to
meet the famed Hellfire Witch,

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
and of course, a member
of the Blue Moon Clan.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, I don't
believe you've seen me

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
in this form before.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] He's the Shapeless One,
the former Marquis de Sade.

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] It appears my
precious kittens owe you

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.790 position:50% align:center
a significant debt for
the things you've done.

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] His voice is so kind,
and his smile so gentle.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.170 position:50% align:center
The most fearsome
thing about him

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
is that I feel no fear at all!

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.257 position:50% align:center
This makes no sense.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
Teacher, are you and Mikhail
connected somehow?

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] I need your help,
Monsieur le Comte!

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
Please, it hurts so bad!

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50% align:center
I can't stand it!

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
But I was lucky.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
I got rescued by a
really kind person!

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
So, you were the one who saved
Mikhail's life that day.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
You never said anything!

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
What have you done?

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
Did you convince him
there was a way to bring

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
the Vampire of the Blue Moon
back from the dead?

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.917 position:50% align:center
Tell me the truth, Teacher!

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I did.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.966 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Liar! You said
that we've probably

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
never met you
in your current form?

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
If that's true, where
have I seen you before?

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
Does the name "Comte de
Saint Germain" ring a bell?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
That's the moniker
I'm using these days.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
Do try to remember it
for next time.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] The Kingdom
of Dreams is destroyed.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
Whether it's a sweet reverie,
cradling you as you sleep,

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
or a nightmare that casts
you out in the cold,

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
a dream is merely a dream.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center
At some point, it must end,

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
and we shall all wake
to face reality.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
That time is fast approaching.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:17.218 position:50% align:center
I look forward to seeing you
when it comes, Mon Chaton.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
And you, as well.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.139 position:50% align:center
I'm honored to meet
the human heir to Blue,

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.850 position:50% align:center
the fairest creature
who ever lived.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS] Wait, careful!
--[NOÉ] Come back here!

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé!

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Vanitas!

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
Well then, little one, <i>bonsoir</i> .

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
[MURR meows]

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA] Ah! I see you're
awake now, good morning!

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mademoiselle Amelia.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA] Yes, I'm here
to look after you.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
Don't worry, everyone's safe.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
I'm so relieved.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
You gave us a terrible
scare, Monsieur.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Sorry about that.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help.
I'm glad you were here for me.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA] Now then! You'll feel
better if you eat something.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
I'll fetch you a light
meal and some water.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:13:00.030 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Oh, no, that's all right,
I can get it myse--

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
Mm-mm.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
Please, sir.

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
Lady Dominique and
Mademoiselle Jeanne are talking

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
in the dining room
at the moment.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50% align:center
And I'd like to give
them some privacy,

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
if that's all right with you.

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.544 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Huh?

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:18.173 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA chuckles]
Don't fret, he's up there.

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
Wait just a moment, and I'll
prepare a meal for two.

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Um. Your injuries...
Are they serious?

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
That was a stupid thing
to ask, wasn't it?

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It's really cold.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer it if
we could talk inside.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
Or, um...

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:22.278 position:50% align:center
If I'm getting on your nerves,

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
you can just tell me
to leave you alone.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
I came up here to wait.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
I knew he'd come.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
You don't need to do anything.
Just stay right there.

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Listen.

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:05.780 position:50% align:center
There was something I wanted to
ask yesterday, but I couldn't.

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
Maybe, I could try again today.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] When Father was
murdered, was it my fault?

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
All I remember about that day
is that Father died

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.303 position:50% align:center
and I lost my arm.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.847 position:50% align:center
So was it me?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
Am I to blame for--?

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS] No.
--[MIKHAIL gasps]

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
<i>I</i> killed Father, Mikhail.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Luna's true name
was stolen that day,

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
and the person you loved
was about to be transformed

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:50.116 position:50% align:center
into a terrible monster.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
There wasn't much time to think,

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.663 position:50% align:center
so I did what
I thought was best.

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
I joined the Blue Moon Clan
and destroyed Luna

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.418 position:50% align:center
with their own power.

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
Now you know the truth.

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
That's why I cure curse-bearers.

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center
I want to know who or what
took Luna's true name.

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
With each case,
I'm hoping for more clues.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
I can never forgive the
Vampire of the Blue Moon.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
So, I'll do all I can
to remove every trace

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
of that entity from existence.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
I'll resort to any measures
I deem necessary.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
Only that will set things right.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] That's the reason
I can't go with you.

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] But I still don't
understand, big brother.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
If we really could bring
Father back to life,

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
then we'd all be
together again. And I--

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
No one comes back
from the dead.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
Even if the body could
walk and talk again,

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
--the soul inside wouldn't--
--[MIKHAIL] Stop it!

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
We have something no one
else does, remember?

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
The more we use our books,

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
the more they rewrite
our existence!

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.524 position:50% align:center
We become less and less
human every time!

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
Our old selves are wearing away!

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.193 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
You saw the incredible things

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
I was able to do
yesterday, didn't you?

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.658 position:50% align:center
The more we change, the more
powerful we'll become!

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
I know it's painful,

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.871 position:50% align:center
but aren't you glad you have
someone who understands?

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
I remember what
you said back then.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
That even if it meant
dying immediately,

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.419 position:50% align:center
you'd rather stay human
until your last breath!

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
So if you ever start
to become a monster,

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
then I promise, I'll kill you!

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
We do share the
same fate, don't we?

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
Will you come with me? Please?

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No. I don't need your help.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center
If I'm going to die...

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
...then I only have one wish.

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:59.245 position:50% align:center
To die at the hand of Noé.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Fine, if you won't come,

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to bring
Father back on my own.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
And what about Saint Germain?

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
Do you know what it is
the Shapeless One

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
is trying to accomplish?

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
I don't and I don't care.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving now, but I
should probably tell you.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
Mademoiselle Domi
never killed anyone.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Those vampires were
unstable because I used the book

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
to tamper with them, but all
she did was prevent them

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
from harming any humans.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
Make sure you tell that
to the authorities

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.454 position:50% align:center
so they don't punish
her too harshly, okay?

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.583 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Why such concern for her now?

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Because she was
nothing but nice to me.

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
I guess I have a bit of
a soft spot for kind people.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're heavy.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It's only for a minute, I swear.

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
I'm actually surprised
you didn't try to stop him.

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
You must have about 1,000
questions you want to ask.

00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Of course I do,
but they can wait till later.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
Right now, I just
wanna talk to you.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Noé.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] There were times
when I acted too rashly,

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
and then there were times
when I hesitated too long,

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
or didn't do enough, so...

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, I'm not used
to you being genuine.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
How do I respond to that?

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.019 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Oh, ha, ha, very funny!

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
I give up.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
Pardon?

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
I've given up, all right?

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
There's no use in struggling
to get you to do what I want!

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ giggles]

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Knock it off!

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
<i>D'accord.</i> So, what now?

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
First, to investigate the
Comte de Saint Germain.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:56.923 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:20:57.007 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
But, other than that,
nothing else needs to change.

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
I'm a doctor,
and my patients need me.

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
I'll keep doing as I please,
claiming my vengeance

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center
by saving curse-bearers.

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
Well, then I'll
keep helping you.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:19.696 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Hey, quack!

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
I see you finally decided
to join the living!

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what the hell

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
we went through
because of what you did?

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, Count Orlok
was practically

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
foaming at the mouth!

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
He wants to see you
immediately, by the way.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, Orlok?

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
Oh, perfect.

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] I want an apology
for the beating I took, too!

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS] Sorry.
--[DANTE] That's it?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA] The sun is starting
to come out, Monsieurs!

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:44.888 position:50% align:center
Isn't it a beautiful sight?

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:54.856 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas, are you ready to go?
