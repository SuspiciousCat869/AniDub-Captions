[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
What a cruel thing to do

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
to such an innocent child.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:29.487 position:50% align:center
Well, it's your choice.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Do you wish to come along

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
with me as well, little one?

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50% align:center
Doctor! Bonjour!

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.801 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] It's an honor
to see you again!

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center
I knew, if you were
still in Paris,

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:17.887 position:50% align:center
this is where I'd find you.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.014 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU]
Oui, oui!

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.473 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed that
you remembered

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:24.561 position:50% align:center
how to find the
place, Number 69!

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.397 position:50% align:center
Oh. And who are these
people with you?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.399 position:50% align:center
Why, they're armed to the teeth!

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.443 position:50% align:center
Friends of yours?

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
Actually, Doctor,
these are friends of yours!

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.405 position:50% align:center
[MARIA, GEORGES]
Huh?!

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] As we journeyed
through the catacombs,

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:42.495 position:50% align:center
I explained the glory of
your magnificent experiments!

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.707 position:50% align:center
Naturally, they were quite
moved by your genius,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.669 position:50% align:center
and vowed to assist with your
endeavors in any way they could.

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.463 position:50% align:center
As you may have noticed,
they all happen

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:54.591 position:50% align:center
to be Chasseurs, which means
they'll be extremely useful,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
not only as your assistants,
but bodyguards as well!

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU]
Oh, that's... incredible!

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
I applaud your ambition,
my dear boy!

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.193 position:50% align:center
And I must say, I'm relieved!

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
If you had been a band of
evildoers come to capture me,

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.407 position:50% align:center
I'd have had to
kill you on the spot!

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
Come, come,
my faithful servants!

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
We must prepare to
entertain our guests!

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
Vanitas, what was that?

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
Believe me, flattery
is the quickest way

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
to get what you want
out of Doctor Moreau.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.963 position:50% align:center
He'll probably answer questions
we haven't even asked yet.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
Where are the abducted vampires?

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
Is he the only one
behind the kidnappings?

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
We'll know all that and
more before this is over.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
Then, we can simply
let the Chasseurs do

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
as they see fit with him.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps I might
reserve the pleasure

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.814 position:50% align:center
of killing him for myself.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello. Thank you.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Are these the enhanced
humans Vanitas mentioned?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
Ah! I should introduce
myself formally!

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
<i>Bon! Je m'appelle Moreau!</i>

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Number 69 already
told you about me, but...

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
This is my lab,
where I research vampires!

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
I have a question, doctor!

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
If I may be so bold.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
I heard that you experiment
on vampires here.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
Why would you do
such a crazy thing?

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
<i>--Pardonnez moi?</i>
--[VANITAS] He means,

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
you're doing great work,

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
and he wants to hear about it
straight from the source!

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see!

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
Well, my, isn't that
a commendable attitude?

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
[clears throat]

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
I've always hoped

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
that perhaps I could become
a vampire myself one day!

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.364 position:50% align:center
When the Church sought
my help years ago,

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
I agreed to assist them
with their vampire research

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
out of a simple
intellectual curiosity.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
But the more I
learned about those

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
fascinating creatures,
the more fixated I became

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
on a single thought.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
And that thought,
is that vampires

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
are a new human species,
the very apex of evolution,

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
walking side-by-side
with mankind!

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
When I learned this,
I knew I must become

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
one of that great
species posthaste!

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
But no! Those fools
in the Church

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
responded as though
I were some lunatic!

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
And so, countless hours
of my precious time

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
and effort were wasted!

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
Not fair!

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how difficult
my life has been since then!

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
Don't you see?

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
After the Vampire of the Blue
Moon attacked my laboratory

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
and stole you children away,
things were never the same.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
There was more than one?

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU] All of my
creations were destroyed,

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
I lost everything I had!

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
And then, just to top it off,
the incident brought

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
my experiments to the
attention of the Church,

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
and I was nearly
executed for it!

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
It was an awful day!
No, the worst of days!

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a mess.
I do apologize, Doctor.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, my goodness!

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
No, please don't think
that I'm angry at you!

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50% align:center
Dear Number 69, you were
an outstanding specimen,

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
I would never dare
say otherwise!

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
You gladly cooperated with
each and every experiment!

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
You were sliced and diced
to the brink of death,

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
and yet you never breathed a
word of complaint against me!

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
Child, I'm so delighted
to see that you've returned

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
to the laboratory
where you belong!

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
You're here to assist me with my
experiments again, aren't you?

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
How could I do otherwise?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
As soon as I heard about the
disappearing vampires in Paris,

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
I rushed right over here.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
I knew in my bones that
it must have been you,

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
fighting valiantly to complete
your important work.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
But, Doctor, you're housed
inside the Chasseurs' den.

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
Hasn't it been a hindrance to be
alone among the very people

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
who exiled you
in the first place?

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You would
think so, but it hasn't!

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm not truly alone.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
I have an exalted
personage on my side.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Is that so?

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center
Indeed!

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
A fabulous kindred spirit
who understands me

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
and supports the great
research that I do!

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.180 position:50% align:center
It was thanks to
this benevolent savior

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
that I was able to return
to my good old laboratory!

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
How fortunate. And who
is this benefactor?

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU immtates buzzer]

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I can't speak
of that, not even to you.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
Anyway, take a look
at these beauties!

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
[MARIA, GEORGES gag]

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
A whole jarful
of freshly harvested

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
vampire eyeballs!

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
Before the owners died
and turned to dust,

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
I salvaged the parts I
needed for my experiments.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hm...

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:40.877 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
Let me take a closer look.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.465 position:50% align:center
Call me crazy, but I'd say
your eyes have changed color

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
since the last time we met!

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
Where once they were
dark blue, they're much

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.848 position:50% align:center
lighter now, like a
copper sulfate solution.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
Could this bizarre
development be related

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50% align:center
to the power possessed by
the Vampire of the Blue Moon?

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
Tell me everything!

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Fascinating.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
Ooh, it's all so
very fascinating!

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
Please, 69! Give me an eye!

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.826 position:50% align:center
You can keep the other,
I just need one!

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
Come, now--!

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
Easy there.
Careful what you say.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
Don't do this.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
I have no choice, I've got to.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
Doctor Moreau.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
I've been holding my tongue
through this whole discussion

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
but the way you keep
saying "Number 69."

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
You can't just refer
to people as numbers!

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
It's not right!

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU]
Oh, my!

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
Your eyes are red!
You're a vampire?

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
Well, Noé, it's about time.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.238 position:50% align:center
If you'd waited any
longer to make a move,

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
I would've slaughtered this
obnoxious villain myself!

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
Forget the plan, then!

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
Hold him still,
I wanna question him!

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
Okay, I can do that--

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
Spit it out, you freak!

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
Who is this "exalted personage"
you mentioned earlier?

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
I have a question, too!

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
Who is this specimen?
He's lovely!

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
May I dissect him?

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
All right, fine, I take it back,
please don't hurt me!

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.932 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.979 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
You again!

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
Ah, Monsieur Spider!
Thank you for rescuing me!

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
[MONSIEUR SPIDER]
That does it, Doctor.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.112 position:50% align:center
I'm destroying your laboratory.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
That's not fair!

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
Hold on. That means...

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Charlatan, Naenia,
this man, Doctor Moreau...

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center
They're all connected somehow.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear, seems my little
friend is awake.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] The curse-bearer
Dante's group was after.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
Could it have
manifested already?

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Not so fast!

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU]
Ah, yes. Before I forget.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.854 position:50% align:center
How's dear old Number 71
been doing recently?

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
The two of you were
practically inseparable.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
[MOREAU] The Vampire of the Blue
Moon took both of you from me

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
that horrible day so long ago.

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.619 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you
aren't together.

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Big Brother.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
Why must you despise
Father so much?

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center
Father was the only one
kind enough to save us both

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
from Doctor Moreau's lab...

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
Give Father back.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
--Give Father back.
--Give my father back to me!

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas! What is it?

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.264 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
Pay attention!

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:50.442 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
What on earth is that thing?

00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
Help us fight or
stay out of the way!

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] What? You can't
just bark orders at me!

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
Well then quit spacing out!

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.256 position:50% align:center
And tell me what
we're dealing with!

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
It's the malnomen,
Prédateur, or "the shadow."

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] It ravenously devours
any and all life in its path.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
Inverse operations won't
do us any good this time!

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
The only solution is to get the
curse-bearer out of it somehow!

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
Understood?

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
Wait, what--we can do that?

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
You're such a silly fool.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
Come now.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
Why do you continue
to put yourself in danger

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
to help the vampires
of the crimson moon?

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
Especially after they
exiled our dear father?

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
You already know
you're too late.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
So, you might as well
just tell them.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
After all, you don't
want anyone else's blood

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
on your hands, do you?

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
Can you hear me?

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
You have to stand up!
Please, Vanitas!

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
[MARIA yelps]

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Noé, get Roland
and his people out of here.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
The shadow will vanish

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
after it consumes
the curse-bearer.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:51.021 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, as long
as we lock it up in here,

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
it can't harm anyone else.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
That'll end it.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
Are you saying
the host will die?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:01.573 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I fear it's too late now.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.950 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to pry a
curse-bearer out of a shadow,

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
so there's nothing
more that I can do.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
We can't quit! I refuse!

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
I'm not ready to give up!

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
What's on your mind?

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
What do you suppose
it might be like

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
in the maw of that monster?

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
If we can't defeat
it from out here,

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.019 position:50% align:center
we'll just have to go inside!

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50% align:center
We'll never survive that!

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] If you're too scared,
then you can stay here,

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
but I've decided I'm going
in with or without you.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.405 position:50% align:center
What the--?
Don't just walk away!

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
Vanitas. Do you
remember what you are?

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
What it is you do?

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.790 position:50% align:center
And the reason you came here?

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'm a...

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.544 position:50% align:center
You're a fool.

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:59.381 position:50% align:center
Do you even know
why you're doing this?

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Enough!

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Why am I here? That's easy!

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.601 position:50% align:center
I'm a doctor and it's my
duty to save that vampire!

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
Now, Roland! Lend me a hand!

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
Maria! Georges, bring it down!

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
There he is, the curse-bearer

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
who manifested this monster.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
Don't be afraid.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.725 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Hm?

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
We can do this.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
If we work together, right?

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
What the--? I thought
we were goners!

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.737 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have been
so cocky before.

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
I clearly underestimated
the enemy.

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
You see? I told you.

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs]

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:01.711 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I have no idea
how we're still alive.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
It makes no sense.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs]

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
We saved the curse-bearer
and that's what matters,

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you say?

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Moreau slipped
through our fingers, though.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Well, I suppose that's true.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
Run for it!

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:38.873 position:50% align:center
[ALL panting]

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Why did the whole
place explode like that?

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] He must have set
some trigger to destroy the lab

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:50.301 position:50% align:center
and all the materials inside,
in case of "emergency."

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Noé, these children

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
are some of the vampires
he kidnapped, yes?

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Please allow me to see
that they're taken care of.

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
The vampires had
no part in this incident.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
If anything, we Chasseurs
made a mess of it.

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we should be the ones
to bring them to Count Orlok.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
I promise you,
I will fix everything.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
For now, the two of you
need to depart

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
the catacombs at once.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
It won't matter to them
why you came down here.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
Since you entered the
domain of the Chasseurs

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
without their permission,
they will take you into custody.

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
Get out of here, quickly.

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
You're just letting them go?

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS, NOÉ grunt]

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
You can leave everything
else to my group, all right?

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
Now, go, before it's too late.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
We will, Roland. Thank you!

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Next time, may we
meet beneath the sunlight.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
Georges, Maria.
The captives are in your care.

00:17:58.328 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
[MARIA, GEORGES]
Sir!

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Roland!

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
Bonjour, Olivier!

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
Your hair's looking
silky-smooth, as always!

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] This is hardly
the time for your absurdity!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
What caused that tremor?

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
What fresh hell have you
brought us today?

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] I'll file
a detailed report later.

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
For now, this is
much more important!

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
You won't believe it,

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
but I've become friends
with a vampire!

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] Here comes
another Roland migraine.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. What's the matter?

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
Shall I go fetch your medicine?

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
You're the matter,
you great moron!

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
Listen. Do you know
what you've done?

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
If the other Chasseurs
heard about this, then you--

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Let me guess.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
I'd find I'm no longer
welcome here, right?

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I saw
something spectacular today.

00:18:54.009 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS, NOÉ laughing]

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
A human and a vampire
sharing a laugh together!

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center
They seemed to be truly happy!

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
My whole life I was taught
that humans and vampires

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
would never
understand each other.

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
It never occurred to me that
something I had accepted

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
as common sense could
be overturned so easily,

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
and all within a single day!

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
What am I to do?

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
It feels like my heart's going
to beat right out of my chest!

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
Captain, sir!

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
What is it?

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
That dimwit really is asking
for trouble, and he'll get it.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
[BOTH panting]

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
We finally made it out.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Was it wrong of us to just go?

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
We sure left a mess for Roland
to clean up back there.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Who cares?

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
There aren't any more
curse-bearers involved,

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:12.128 position:50% align:center
so I've lost interest
in the entire affair.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Knowing Vanitas,
he probably never wanted

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
to be a part of this
in the first place.

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] And yet he chose to be
because of the curse-bearers.

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Was it his sense
of duty as a doctor?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
I am so tired.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Yeah, I know.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
I feel the same way.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
No, that wasn't it.

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
That was only a crutch
that he was leaning on.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
It matters not who disagrees!

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
I will save the vampires!

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I wonder.

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
The one who seeks
salvation most of all,

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
who prays for redemption.

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it's Vanitas, himself.

00:23:23.862 --> 00:23:25.488 position:50% align:center
[MONSIEUR SPIDER]
Doctor Moreau is despondent

00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:28.450 position:50% align:center
after losing his laboratory.

00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:31.411 position:50% align:center
He's of no use to us for now.

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
Curse that vampire,
it's all his fault!

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:40.086 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Noé Archiviste.

00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:45.800 position:50% align:center
This time, he'll be
dealing with me.
