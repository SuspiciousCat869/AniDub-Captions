This time I can't fail.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
I have to end Chloé's life.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] But Chloé d'Apchier
isn't the Beast.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.732 position:50% align:center
You saw it with your own eyes.

[JEANNE]
It doesn't matter.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
Lord Ruthven ordered me
to put a stop

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center
to the devastation in Gévaudan.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:33.116 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] That may be true, but
he didn't tell you to kill her.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
The Beast murdered all
those innocent people,

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
and Chloé was directly involved.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
I have no other option.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
And either way, she's
still a curse-bearer.

It's our job.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.803 position:50% align:center
She's beyond help now.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
It's all over.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.682 position:50% align:center
That's why. I must--

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
You're wrong!

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
Chloé d'Apchier can
still be saved.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.402 position:50% align:center
We can do it.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
It's up to us.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.199 position:50% align:center
So, I'm asking you,
Jeanne; help me.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Chloé hasn't killed
a single denizen of Gévaudan,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.501 position:50% align:center
not now or in the past.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
That's the one thing
I know for sure.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.548 position:50% align:center
She was framed. Chloé was
never the real monster.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:33.301 position:50% align:center
How can that be? I thought...

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:36.888 position:50% align:center
You'll have to ask her that
for yourself when you see her.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
Listen. I need to
talk to you again

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:43.812 position:50% align:center
about what you said
at the cabin.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.648 position:50% align:center
Do you intend to slay
Chloé d'Apchier?

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:49.192 position:50% align:center
Is that truly what you wish for
in your heart of hearts?

[JEANNE gasps]

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.365 position:50% align:center
Wish? No.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.575 position:50% align:center
I mustn't dare to
wish for anything,

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.328 position:50% align:center
or to pray for anything!

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:01.454 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:05.250 position:50% align:center
I don't know, but if
I fail to obey...!

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.502 position:50% align:center
Someone I love will
end up getting beheaded

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:11.756 position:50% align:center
in my place, again!
What if it's you?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.677 position:50% align:center

[JEANNE gasps]

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to die.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.517 position:50% align:center
I have to live at least
as long as you, Jeanne!

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.146 position:50% align:center
I promised I would kill you
if you ever lost control.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I love you, ma chére.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.403 position:50% align:center
I have to be the one
to make your wish come true,

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.155 position:50% align:center
whatever that wish is.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.615 position:50% align:center
So, go on. Tell me.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.992 position:50% align:center
What is it you want?

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
I don't care if it's
something paltry or spiteful.

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.580 position:50% align:center
Whether it makes
you seem wicked.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.291 position:50% align:center
Or even the cruelest of curses!

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.084 position:50% align:center
I'll see it done!

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
I... need your help.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
That is my wish.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.053 position:50% align:center
Please help!

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
I've suffered for so long,
carrying this burden by myself!

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.476 position:50% align:center
It's too much.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
So, help me.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.856 position:50% align:center
Help Chloé.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.608 position:50% align:center
Please, Vanitas!

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me.

Are you all right? Wake up!

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50% align:center
This is all your fault!

We can't quit! I refuse!

I'm not ready to give up!

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Because of you,

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
I spoke too soon and made a
promise I'm not sure I can keep!

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
That sort of thing
is against my principles!

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
And all because you
wanted to be noble!

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
It's pathetic, I tell you!
<i>Tres pathétique!</i>

We don't have much time,
so listen up.

to exact her vengeance.

[VANITAS] If there's to be
any hope of saving her,

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
I'll need <i>The Book of Vanitas</i> .

of House Granatum,

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center

Just because you're
hesitant to hurt someone,

it doesn't mean
that you're a coward.

[JEAN-JACQUES]
In this secluded world,

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
they always come
to assassinate Chloé.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
Not only the dragoons,
the villagers,

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
<i>Chasseurs</i> , that <i>bourreau</i> .

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
No matter how completely
I eradicate them,

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
they still return.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50% align:center
I must have slain them hundreds,
even thousands, of times.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
My wish was to protect you.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
And yet, you wanted this
all along, didn't you?

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] This world must be
destroyed and I must go with it.

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
I need to hurry!

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] I have to set
you free, Jean-Jacques! Now!

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, my sweet Chloé,
what a fool you are.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand?

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
All these long years,
and you don't know

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
the first thing about me!

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
What's the use of being free
if you aren't with me?

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
If you wanted me to,

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
I'd plunge into the
pits of hell with you.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.117 position:50% align:center
I'd go anywhere, do anything,
as long as you were by my side.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
Anything at all.

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
But if I don't have you, why?

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES] There's no
happiness for me without you.

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:39.215 position:50% align:center
Please don't go!

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
Stay. I'm begging you. Chloé.

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
Please, you can't leave me
alone in this world!

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.113 position:50% align:center
