[MIKHAIL]
Why are you upset?

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
All I did was let him
peek at my memories.

[NOÉ grunts]

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.196 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
I was surprised.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
Turns out, he didn't
know a thing about us!

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
I figured it was only fair to
prepare him, since he's really

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
going to see something when
he drinks some of your blood.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
My blood, you say?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50% align:center

[MIKHAIL]
Aw, come on, it's Misha!

[VANITAS] You don't
remember at all, do you?

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
You've completely
forgotten everything

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
that happened to us that day.

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:05.148 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
then you don't know

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:09.277 position:50% align:center
why I had to kill the
Vampire of the Blue Moon.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.279 position:50% align:center
Why Luna is dead.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.459 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Right. I understand.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Yeah! Exactly!

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:52.756 position:50% align:center
It's only natural for me
to want to know, isn't it?

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.343 position:50% align:center
But hey, that wasn't the
only reason I showed up here.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
It's been so long!

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
I've come to get you,
big brother!

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.891 position:50% align:center
I bet you thought
I was dead, huh?

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
Well, so did I!

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
My memory is really fuzzy,

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
so I'm not really sure
what happened to me.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
All I know is I felt
cold and bitter,

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.944 position:50% align:center
and I was in a lot of pain.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
And then, guess what?

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
I suddenly got rescued just in
time by a really kind person!

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
And do you wanna know
what they told me?

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
That there's a way for us to
bring our father back to life!

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
That made me so happy!

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
The three of us can be together
again, just like before!

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
Who cares about your
dumb revenge, big brother?

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
This is much better!
Will you come?

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
I'm surprised.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
You've never been the
type to carry a gun.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
You want to bring
that monster back?

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
Are you insane?

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.734 position:50% align:center
Do you know how hard I tried
to wipe every trace

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
of that vampire from existence?

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.279 position:50% align:center
Forget it!

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
Stop! Don't shoot him!

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
If Mikhail gets injured,
that means Domi jumps!

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
Please don't!

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Get out of the way.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
I'm doing what needs
to be done here.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
No, Vanitas, I won't!

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand?
You can't hurt him!

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:26.141 position:50% align:center
He's using some kind of mind
control to hold Domi hostage!

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
I think he used that book
of his to manipulate her--

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
Why should I care?

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
She hasn't a thing
to do with me.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.109 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's true.

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
But she means something to me!

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center
Please, I'm begging you!

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
Just tell me what happened
to you two that day!

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.331 position:50% align:center
I assume you must have your
reasons for doing all this.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
But I don't want
to simply go along

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
with what Mikhail's
asking of me!

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
All you have to do
is tell me yoursel--

[NOÉ gasps]

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
I said no.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
You seem to have misinterpreted
our relationship, vampire.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
The two of us have only
been working together

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
up until this point because
our ambitions coincide.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center

from you and leave.

it won't work!

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
I have to protect Domi!

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
I let Louis slip away, and I
can't let that happen with her!

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
I won't!

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center

older brother.

when they were kids,

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
until Domi and Noé had
to watch him get beheaded

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
for being a curse-bearer!

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
And, boy, she cried for so long!

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center

she could've been born

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center

of her brother.

instead of me," she'd say,

you've cut your hair,

are you keeping it short?

that I dislike it.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center
I think it suits you, actually.

it looked nice.

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
So, if I grew it out,
you'd still like it?

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center

wounds all you want!

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
As long as you
leave me out of it!

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.069 position:50% align:center
I told you before!

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
If you try to drink
my blood, you're dead!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
Out of my sight, vampire,
if you know what's good for you!

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
Or, if you prefer
to be difficult about it,

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
I suppose I might as well
finish her off myself!

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.125 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on. If she
were out of the way,

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.668 position:50% align:center
it would set you free!

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't have to be her
loyal little plaything anymore,

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center

obvious call, don't you?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
[RICHE] Yes, but, even though
Noé's only able to use one arm,

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
he's still a much stronger
fighter than Vanitas is.

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
So it probably won't
get too ugly, right?

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
Don't be so sure.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
They're quite different. Noé's
never killed anyone, has he?

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.206 position:50% align:center
He knows his own strength,
so he thinks he can

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
afford to keep his hands
clean and still win.

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50% align:center
Noé doesn't care for violence,
but he's always ready

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
to use it to his advantage,
if necessary.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ growls]

00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
Hypocrite.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ panting]

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] The bullet only
grazed my eyelid.

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
It's not hindering me,
so why am I struggling?

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
I'm stronger and
faster than he is,

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
but he keeps slipping past me!

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
It's almost like he's
predicting my every move.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] If I don't hurry,
Domi's going to jump!

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ grunts]

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.501 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
He's coming this way!

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
There's no way he'll survive
if I land a direct hit...

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
No! No!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
...but it's too late
to change course!

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
Stop this now!

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
Some refuse to kill
an opponent because

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
they're too strong to
resort to such brutality.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
And others are so weak that
they're prepared to employ

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
any means necessary
to survive a battle.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
But before long, one of them
recognizes that disparity.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:09.247 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS wheezing]

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What now?

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't been holding myself
back, he would already be dead.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Wait a minute, I see.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
He's coming at me
with no hesitation,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
because he's aware that
I don't wanna kill him.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
He knows me so well by now,
he can probably see

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.538 position:50% align:center
attack patterns that I
don't even realize I have.

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
I need a new plan!

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
Damn you!

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
Look! He said that
I didn't know you,

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
and maybe he was right!

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
And then he laughed
at me, Vanitas!

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] You always wear
this smug expression,

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
like you know everything and
I'm just a clueless idiot!

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
The only reason
I don't know things

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
is because you don't tell me!

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
You've treated the
people I care about

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
with such hatred and spite!
It makes me sick!

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
And you refuse to listen
to me about anything!

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
You turn your back on
whatever you don't like.

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
You'd rather pretend
it isn't real,

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
or that your past
never happened!

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
If you have anything
to say to that,

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
I'd love to hear it!

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center
Or are you just
gonna stand there?

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
Don't waste your breath.

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
There's no changing his mind.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
Now he's under a
self-induced hypnosis.

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.774 position:50% align:center
Which means, if anyone
tries to force his memories

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
from him, he won't be able to
stop himself from killing them.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] No matter who
it is, he will kill them.

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
But don't worry.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
Everything'll be fine,
big brother,

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
because, even if you do
murder Noé and you miss him

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
so badly that it leaves
a big hole in your heart,

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
I'll be by your side
forever and ever,

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
so you won't be lonely.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
I'm the only person
who won't abandon you.

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL laughs]

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
He's suffering so badly.
If I could just do something.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
That won't work.

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
The alarm on Misha's watch
is supposed to sound

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
any second, remember?

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
And as soon as I hear it ring,

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
then I'm going to jump from
the top of the Ferris wheel.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
Yes, I know,
I have no choice.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] But despite that,
I can't bear the thought

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
of standing here doing
nothing while Noé gets hurt.

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
It's too painful!

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
And if I ever lost him,

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stand
to go on living!

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
All right, in that case...

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] You'll just
have to stop the fight

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
and obey Misha's
command, somehow.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
Surely there's some way
that you can do both.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:37.247 position:50% align:center
Exactly. I know.

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] I'm sick of it.
I won't let Noé get hurt

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
because of me anymore.

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] All I want
is to keep him from crying

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
the way he did that day.

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] That's silly.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
Are you doing it for Noé?
I'm not so sure.

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
Domi!

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:12.532 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.203 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
Who's that?

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
It's all right! I've got you!

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
Are you injured, Lady Dominique?

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Jeanne!

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Noé! What is all this about?

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
Why are you and
Vanitas fighting--?

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Jeanne. Please go away.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
This doesn't concern you.

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
I don't want you
anywhere near me!

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone!

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
I hate you!

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
No, hold on!

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
That's not what I--
I wanted to say.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
<i>Oui</i> , Mademoiselle.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
Anyone who would stand
in our way is a villain

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
who must be slain.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.788 position:50% align:center
Now, help me take care of her.

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
So, you are the one
responsible for this?

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Stay away, Jeanne!

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
He's dangerous!

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
No! I was sent to this place

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
to rescue Lady Dominique,
and I never disobey my master!

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
That's my vow!

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
So, you keep an eye on Vanitas!

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
No matter what!

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:22.310 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What? Keep an eye on Vanitas?

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
I don't need her
to tell me that.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
There, that's better.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
Now you can't use your big
scary weapon for a moment.

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Did he alter the astermite?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.474 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Is that me?

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
Is this what I've
always looked like?

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
What about him?

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I can't even remember his face.

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You two can
lick each other's wounds

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
all you want!

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
As long as you
leave me out of it!

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I can't recall what I saw.

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
Out of my sight, vampire,
if you know what's good for you!

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
Or, if you prefer
to be difficult about it,

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
I suppose I might as well
finish her off myself!

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Mikhail was right,
I don't know anything

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
about Vanitas's past.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Even so.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
Ever since we met...

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
...I've watched him.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
And I've seen what
kind of man he is.

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Vanitas,
we need to end this now.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
We could go back,
back to the way it was, <i>non</i> ?

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS growls]

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] He's contrary, always
determined to do what he wants.

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas!

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] He never concerns himself
with whether he may get hurt,

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
but he hates for anyone else
to be hurt because of him.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas!

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.092 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] He isolates himself
by pushing away

If she were out of the way,
it would set you free!

I see now.

To Vanitas, freedom
means being alone.

I swear, whatever it takes.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
I will kill that vampire
with my own two hands!

Stop calling me "vampire"!

Listen to me, Vanitas.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
No matter what, I'm never going
to give you what you want!

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
I will not leave you!

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:52.395 position:50% align:center
I won't set you free!
