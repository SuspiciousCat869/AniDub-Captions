As one of the Queen's Fangs,
you should know better

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:44.704 position:50% align:center
than to unleash such an
unbecoming display of power.

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
Tch. Lord Ruthven.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Ruthven? I've
heard that name before.

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] I see that you've
arrived late this evening.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Indeed. My carriage was attacked

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
by unknown assailants.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
There was a bit of a delay
in finding another.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
Now then, what has
transpired here?

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
[VERONICA] Quite simply, this
abhorrent piece of human trash

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
is a member of the
Clan of the Blue Moon.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
We all saw their foul
mark on his arm.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Once he revealed it,
those curse-bearers

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
came out of the woodwork.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
It's my belief that he
used <i>The Book of Vanitas</i>

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
to spread the foul Curse
of the Blue Moon.

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
--No!
--[bang]

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
Would you say she's telling
the truth, young man?

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
You reduced that child
to a pile of ash, didn't you?

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS chuckles]
That's correct.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
I was the one who
murdered that little girl.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
Stand back! Don't touch him!

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
I'm warning you!

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.035 position:50% align:center
Do not presume to pass
judgement upon this man--

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
he is not your problem!

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
He's mine!

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50% align:center
I was in the middle
of speaking to him!

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.417 position:50% align:center
And then you show up
out of nowhere.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
Who do you think you are?

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
Don't jump to conclusions
when you don't have

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
all the information! I won't
allow you to pin the blame

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
on him based on a limited
understanding of--

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Wait a minute.
Am I any different?

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN chuckles]

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Uh...

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
My apologies, good sir.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
It is as you say.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
I was indeed lacking
in my manners.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
My name is Ruthven,
a humble member of the senate,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
and servant of Her
Gracious Majesty, the Queen.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
Of The Senate?

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uncle!

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] Lucius.
I'm glad you're unharmed.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Likewise, sir!

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
I was so afraid that something
terrible had happened to you!

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
Luca? What?

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
Oh, steady there.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Stay back!

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
There's no need to fear.
I merely wish to melt the ice.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] Lord Uncle, what are
you going to do with them?

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] I think I'll
give them my protection.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
At least for a while.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] As you are no doubt
aware, anyone who dares

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
bring harm to a guest of mine
is asking for unspeakable peril.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
After all, such an act
would be considered

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
a personal attack against me.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.769 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.113 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas...

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
I think I owe you...

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
...an apology.

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] An apology?
Why would that be necessary?

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
Teacher? You're here?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.841 position:50% align:center
The truth is...

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
I wanted Vanitas to share all
the same hopes and ideals as I.

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
And...

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
...even though he never broke
his word to me even once,

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
I had my expectations,
and then I wound up

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
feeling betrayed in the end.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:47.864 position:50% align:center
I was so naive. So selfish.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] I see. He didn't
live up to your hopes,

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
and as punishment for that,
you rejected him.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
<i>Mon Chaton.</i>

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
When I told you to
assess the true nature

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
of <i>The Book of Vanitas</i> ,
my intention wasn't

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
for you to determine whether or
not it was a threat to vampires.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
I believe you might've
misunderstood me.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] My wish was for
you to engage with those

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
whose paths cross the book's.
Become a part of their stories.

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
After you've done so, how will
you characterize the grimoire?

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
What will it be in your eyes?

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
Those are the questions
to which I seek answers.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Ah.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
You really do like
heights, don't you?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
What happened after
I lost consciousness?

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
Oh, you didn't miss much.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
Lord Ruthven took
charge of the situation

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
and dispersed the whole crowd.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
The official story
is that we're here

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
as "guests of His Lordship."

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] So the room I was in.
That was him, too?

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Yes.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ] Hey.
--[VANITAS] Huh?

00:17:57.994 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What's the matter?

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
What do you mean?

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
You're mad about something.

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.291 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Ugh.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Or maybe you're just pouting.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Don't be stupid.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It's painfully obvious

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
that you want to
tell me something.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS] Nope.
--[NOÉ] Don't lie to me.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
At the masquerade ball,

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:22.018 position:50% align:center
you said that you're doing all
this as an act of vengeance.

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
And?

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
It's just that...

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
You didn't really explain
what you meant--

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
That was a lie.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It was?

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
That's right.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
I didn't think those vampires
would pay me any mind

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
unless I said something
grand and dramatic.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
Heh. And you fell
for it, you idiot!

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
I think you might be
lying right now.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
Lying about lying.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] What, you object?
I don't give a damn!

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center
It's happening,
no matter what you say!

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
Because that will be my revenge!

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
My ultimate retribution
against Vanitas!

00:18:57.137 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] When you said those words,
I finally understood.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
That's why you get
that look sometimes.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:04.978 position:50% align:center
It's as if there's
some part of you

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
that you've already given up on.

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Stop trying to paint
me with your silly assumptions!

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
Just shut up! You're a fool!

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
And I hardly have time to
play games with a simpleton!

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
I don't want anything further
to do with you, is that clear?

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
So get out of my face!

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
What? This is backwards.

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
The question is,
why do <i>I</i> bother with <i>you</i> ?

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
I have no intention
of following your orders

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
or assisting you with
your mission in any way.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
Because, perhaps
you've forgotten this

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
since the last time
I said it, Vanitas,

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
but the fact of the matter is,
I don't like you!

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
And I'm saying that is
perfectly fine with me!

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
[bell tolls]

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Just when I
thought he was angry,

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
he starts sulking
like a little child.

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
It really is impossible for me
to tell what he's thinking.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
He talks about salvation.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
But what does that
word mean to him?

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
I want to know.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
I must!

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Honestly, human,
despite everything,

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
I find you quite intriguing.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.823 position:50% align:center
I want to watch this
mission of yours

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
and see where your
efforts take you.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
But you should know,
it matters not if you disagree.

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
Refuse me or don't.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
I'll do as I please.

00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
I will remain by your side,
Vanitas, like it or not.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.482 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs]

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I couldn't care less.

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
To this day, I still remember

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
the color of the
sunrise that morning.

However, thoughts

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
tend to bring memories

[NOÉ] Memories of the things
that slipped from my grasp.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
Of the people
I failed to protect.

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
The day I reached for your
hand and couldn't clutch it.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.936 position:50% align:center

I'm sorry, by the way.

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:05.784 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
About what?

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:08.828 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Nothing. I just
wanted to say it.
