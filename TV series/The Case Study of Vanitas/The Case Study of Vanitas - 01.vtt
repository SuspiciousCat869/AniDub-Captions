"The Vampire of the Blue Moon."

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.063 position:50% align:center
There once was a vampire
known as Vanitas,

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
who was deeply reviled by
the others of his own kind.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.194 position:50% align:center
While all other vampires
were born on the night

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
of the crimson moon,
he came into the world

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
under the blue moon's light.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
Such a phenomenon
was unheard of,

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
and therefore, was considered
a sign of ill omen.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
His brethren feared Vanitas
and drove him from the village.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
Wandering alone in the
woods, he was forced

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
to brave the terrors of darkness

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.177 position:50% align:center
and the freezing
clutches of snow.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
And so, he made a solemn vow.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center
He would have his vengeance
upon those vampires

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
born under the crimson moon.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You fools will rue
the day you persecuted me!

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.942 position:50% align:center
Opening this grimoire will cause
you to be stricken with a curse

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
more terrible than death!

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.907 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] His special creation
was a sinister tome,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
one that he had imbued
with an unholy power:

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.954 position:50% align:center
to corrupt the true
name of a vampire.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.832 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Those who take
this book in hand shall find

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.294 position:50% align:center
their eyes shining with
the same blue light as mine

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:30.965 position:50% align:center
and will become bringers of
death upon all vampire kind.

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
[LADY 01A] Oh, look here!
They say a vampire's appeared.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
[LADY 01B]
Really? How terrible!

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
[LADY 01A]
But that can't possibly be!

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
I thought those abominations
were wiped out centuries ago

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
during the war with humankind.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
[LADY 01B] Does this mean
that some of them survived?

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50% align:center
[LADY 01A] Maybe they've come
back to get their revenge on us!

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
[GENTLEMAN 01A] Nonsense,
vampires are only a folktale!

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
[GENTLEMAN 01B]
Perhaps not.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
My great-grandfather swears
to have seen one.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
[GENTLEMAN 01A] Please, it's
nothing but a ghost story.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
[GENTLEMAN 01C]
Not to worry.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
The Church and its Chasseurs
will deal with the monster.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
I'm so cold.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Are you sure you're
feeling all right now?

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.044 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to escort you
to the infirmary.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
I'm fine.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
I just felt a little anemic
for a moment, that's all.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
Anemic? You do
look awfully pale.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.220 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
After this, I swear
I'll visit my doctor.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
He's the only person
I'll allow to examine me.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
Still, though...

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the concern.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Stop it, Murr!

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
He's very warm!

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
Oh, and...

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
My name is Amelia, by the way.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
Could I trouble you for
an introduction, as well?

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center
This cranky little
fellow's called Murr.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
Careful, he's
somewhat excitable.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I wasn't
talking about him.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 01A] All passengers,
your attention please.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center

in Paris momentarily.

Please enjoy the remainder

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
of your voyage through the sky.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Paris!

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
Where's Paris,
Mademoiselle Amelia?

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
I can't see it anywhere!

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
I don't think we can
make it out from here.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
Aw! Oh, dear, I suppose not.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
That's most unfortunate.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.085 position:50% align:center
To think that something
of such enormous weight

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
could be made to float
through the air like this!

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
The power of astermite
is truly awe-inspiring!

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA giggles] Can I assume
that this is your first time

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
on an airship, sir?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Yes.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
How lovely!

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
Do you plan to see the sights?

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] No, I've come
to retrieve something.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
May I ask what?

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> .

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.861 position:50% align:center
You may have heard
of it, actually.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
It appears in a folktale called
"The Vampire of the Blue Moon."

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.159 position:50% align:center
It's an accursed grimoire.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
[bell tolls]

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Seems I lost track of time.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
It's been a nice chat,
but we should probably

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
get ready to disembark.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
So cold.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Hey, are you really
going through with this?

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.351 position:50% align:center
[MAN]
Of course I am.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
[MAN]
I happen to know without a doubt

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
that my target is
inside this airship.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 01A]
Attention, please.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
The ship's passenger facilities
are no longer available.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
We respectfully request that any
passengers who have not yet...

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
About what you said.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
I don't mean any disrespect
to you, monsieur,

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
but do you truly believe
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> is real?

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.961 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I don't know.

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
But I did receive a letter
stating that the book

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
had been sighted here.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
So, I shall let
that guide my way.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
I believe what it says.
It's from my former teacher.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Mon Chaton, my dearest kitten.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
It is imperative that you
locate <i>The Book of Vanitas</i>

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
and determine its authenticity.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
So, you see, this trip to
Paris is more of a necessity.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Huh? Mademoiselle!

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
Don't touch me!

I've got you now!

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
Or at least,
I thought I had you.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
And who the devil are you?

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
I might ask you the same.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
[MAN]
My business is with the lady.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
Here's some friendly advice:
get out of my way.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
Now.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
Or you're in for
a world of pain.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
That's not happening.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center

It seems I took him too lightly.
That crimson-eyed beast.

Apparently he is
a vampire, as well!

Let's move.

My teacher told me all about it!

A true name is a
vampire's life itself.

It's the formula
that constitutes

their entire existence!

That's why no one
must ever take it away!

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
And you reclaimed it
for her, didn't you?

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
That's incredible! Phenomenal!

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
This means that

been stolen by maladies.

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
If nothing is done
to find the root cause,

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
then it won't be long before
vampires go extinct altogether.

[bell tolls]

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
That was the way it all began.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] This is the tale
of how I met Vanitas,

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
and the path we traveled,
what we gained,

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
and what we lost.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
And then,

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
at the conclusion
of our journey...

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] ...how this Vanitas would
meet his end by my own hand.

00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:02.590 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I won't stop asking, Noé!

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:03.967 position:50% align:center
Lend me your strength!

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:04.968 position:50% align:center

Huh! Now that I think
about it, I'm famished!

00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:19.733 position:50% align:center
