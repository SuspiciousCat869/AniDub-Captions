[VANITAS sighs]
And you're certain

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.434 position:50% align:center
you can't go on without them?

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Lady Dominique
chose that hat and parasol

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
especially for me!

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Well, you'll have
to forget your trinkets.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
The <i>Chasseurs</i> are probably
hot on our trail by now.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.367 position:50% align:center
But--Bu--Bu--
I can't just leave them.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Come on,
I'll escort you to the barrier.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.246 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Hm?

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
Ah, what's that face?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.461 position:50% align:center
Were you hoping to stay
with me until the morning?

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You brute!

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.214 position:50% align:center
I simply wanted to
remain here in town

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
until I'd completed
my original objective!

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
Your original objective?

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
Oh, I remember now,
you were trying to determine

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
whether your feelings for me
constitute true love.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center
Well, I would say
all signs point to yes!

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:00.310 position:50% align:center
It's not up to you!

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.811 position:50% align:center
This entire thing was a ploy

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
so that I wouldn't have
to put up with you anymore!

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
I worked so hard to pull off
everything perfectly!

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:09.027 position:50% align:center
I suffered through
unbearable humiliation!

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
And all to pretend
that I was in love with--

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Oh, no, Jeanne, you
fool, you've said too much!

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Yes, indeed.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.878 position:50% align:center
I did find that side of you
quite lovely today.

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.214 position:50% align:center
But this is the version
I like the best.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.799 position:50% align:center
Don't ever change.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
Huh? Huh?!

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:39.099 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Still, I'm surprised
the grand duke permitted you

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:42.560 position:50% align:center
to spend an entire day
gallivanting around with me.

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:43.603 position:50% align:center
What did he say?

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.355 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Hmph.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.857 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I see, so he doesn't know.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.028 position:50% align:center
I wasn't needed.
He's with his elder brother.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
His brother, you say?

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:57.617 position:50% align:center
Right, of course. You're
speaking of Beastia Loki.

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Mm-hm. That was why
I was told to take the day off.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.208 position:50% align:center
And I was given permission
to spend it with you.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.878 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Permission? From whom?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.423 position:50% align:center
Was it Lord Ruthven?

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.301 position:50% align:center
Yes. Why?

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.059 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS gasps]

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:25.937 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Vanitas?

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50% align:center
Noé!

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone. I'm tired.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
Listen well.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
I want you to swear that,
upon an occasion of my choosing,

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
no matter what I may
require of you,

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
you will obey my request.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.331 position:50% align:center
Swear it.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Swear it!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course. I swear it.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
I will obey, at the
moment of your choosing.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
Whatever you may command of me,
I will do with no hesitation.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
I swear to you.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear it.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
[MONSIEUR SPIDER]
Why didn't you kill him?

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
I changed my mind.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
His Teacher concerns me.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
It's important that we discover
why the Shapeless One

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
is keeping an Archiviste
in his pocket, don't you agree?

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
And in the meantime,
we may find it helpful

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
to have the lad as a pawn.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] He's but a child.
We can slay him anytime we wish.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
You have potential, my dear boy.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
But you'd best remember your vow
to me when the moment arrives.

through the whole day?

[VANITAS groans]

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's the matter
with you, Vanitas?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
Why do you sound
so out of breath?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
[sniffs] Wait, what is that,
have you gotten hurt?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
Forget it!

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Why did Vanitas
run off so suddenly?

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
In any case, he's been
gone for a while now.

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I should leave.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
Bonjour, Jeanne.

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Professor Ruthven,
what are you doing here?

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
There was a matter

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.827 position:50% align:center
that needed to be
dealt with quickly.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.289 position:50% align:center
I heard that a vampire had
caused trouble on Montmartre,

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
so I came to investigate.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
Am I to assume it was
your doing, Jeanne?

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
Please, allow me
to explain myself!

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:06.051 position:50% align:center
I can assure you that there
were no humans harmed at all!

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:08.386 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, I suppose
I did bite this one human,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
but that was a special case!

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
It was all consensual,
I give you my word!

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Then there shall be no issue.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
I must tell you, Jeanne.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
How beautiful you look.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
A pity Éric and Louise
weren't fortunate enough

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50% align:center
to see you this way.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
Professor.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
The night grows cold.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
Let us return home now.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Well? Any luck?

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
Nope, no sign of 'em yet.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.511 position:50% align:center
We might as well
call off the search.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
I mean, hey.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
They obviously made
a clean escape, right?

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
True, but Jeanne was definitely

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
acting strange before.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
I think I'll keep
looking for a while.

[OLIVIER]
Roland!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
Bonjour, Olivier!

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.453 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
you found me here.

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Rumor has it you've been

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
snooping around for something.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Aw, you needn't
say it like that!

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.671 position:50% align:center
I simply wanted to brush up on
my history a bit, nothing more.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
History?

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
That's right!

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
It's only some human
and vampire stuff.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER sputters]

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
No need to look so angry.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
I promise, I haven't
touched any forbidden tomes.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
Good to know. But why
the sudden interest?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50% align:center
Because I thought I might
discover something

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
that I didn't have
the heart to see before.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
Until recently,
I had always considered

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
the vampires to be
purely evil creatures.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50% align:center
There wasn't a doubt in my mind.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
I never had a single reason
to question the idea.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
But now, my eyes
have been opened!

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
I can see!

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50% align:center
[GEORGES] There is no cause
for concern, monsieur.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
Captain Roland is righteous
and faithful to a fault.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
Surely he would never go so far
as to betray the church.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
You don't understand
at all, Georges.

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
Roland is a fervent believer,

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
but his faith
doesn't lie in God.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
He believes in himself
as God's servant.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:32.947 position:50% align:center
Idiot! Don't you realize?
You are a <i>Chasseur</i> !

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
Your job is to hunt vampires
in the name of the Lord!

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
If our superiors learn
of the things you've said,

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
they'll mark you as dangerous!

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.790 position:50% align:center
If that happens, Roland,

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
your parents and siblings may
very well be put in harm's way!

he would be willing to fight me?

You understand, right, Olivier?

[ROLAND] I can only put
my heart into something

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
if I firmly believe
it to be true.

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER sighs]
Honestly.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
What's this?

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
I got something!

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Dante, I thought
Dominique was with you.

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Huh? Domi?

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Aw, hell.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
Of course, you were onto us.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
You two were about as subtle

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
as a pair of wild elephants.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Fair enough.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Hm?

00:10:56.489 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
But never mind that!
I just got a crazy bit of info!

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
Get a load of this!

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
The Beast of Gevaudan lives!

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
And it's back to
its old business!

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
Gévau-- What?

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs]
Interesting!

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
Well, tell me everything.
Tout suite.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
This legendary creature

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
was said to look like
an enormous wolf.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
Depictions of the beast's
appearance typically

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
included pointed ears, a large,
twisted maw, razor-sharp claws,

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
a massive body, covered in fur,

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center
and several black stripes
covering its back.

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
Some years ago,
in Auvergne and Gévaudan,

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
the bodies of over 100 women
and children were found,

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
brutally mauled.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Known as the Beast of Gévaudan,

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
this creature inspired
terror far and wide.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Even today, people
have all sorts of theories

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
as to what the
Beast actually was.

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
But back then, both the Church

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
and vampires agreed
on one thing.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
That The Beast of Gévaudan
was not only a vampire,

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
but also a curse-bearer.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] So, what's this about
the Beast of Gévaudan

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
rearing its ugly head?

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
Is it one and the same
as the killer of legend?

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I can't
say either way yet.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
But I can tell you that
five bodies have already

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
turned up this month alone.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
And all different, too.
Some of them had their entrails

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
ripped out, some were
missing heads, you name it.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Exactly like the original. Huh.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and we've even got some

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
eyewitness accounts
of the Beast.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
All right, so, what do
you propose we do first?

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
I'll learn for myself whether
that monster's a curse-bearer.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:04.200 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Well, Noé? What will you do?

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Me?

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
Right. Let me think.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:14.419 position:50% align:center
I... um...

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
I think... it sounds
terribly delicious.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS gasps]
--[DANTE] Eh?

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you want to
eat the Beast of Gévaudan?

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
I must say,

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
you're a uniquely
surprising individual, Noé.

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
Is this a food fetish
of some sort?

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Oh, god.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
What was the question?

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
Vanitas's blood smells
so intoxicating,

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
it's impossible to concentrate
on anything else!

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
But why now?

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:43.948 position:50% align:center
I already knew it smelled good,

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
so it's not like that's
new information!

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center
Why can't I resist?

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
Wait, I get it!

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.750 position:50% align:center
I spent the entire
day sleeping, right?

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
Which means!

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
I haven't eaten yet!

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
Which means!

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
I'm completely ravenous!

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.132 position:50% align:center
That's the only logical answer!

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
And when I'm hungry,
it always makes me thirsty, too!

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
It's because I slept too much.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
I do feel pretty lethargic.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
--[heartbeats]
--[gasps]

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Damn.

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.649 position:50% align:center
It seems like my sense of smell
is only getting stronger!

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
His blood smells delectable,
I have to taste it!

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
Maybe I can stave off the
craving with a piece of bread.

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
Need blood!

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
But we're having an
important discussion.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
Wait, is it all right for me
to drink blood from a human

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
who's been marked
by someone else?

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
Just a taste.
It smells so sweet.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
He must let me try.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
What's with him?

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS grunts]

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.261 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] It's like when I drank
the blood of that child

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
from the village just for fun.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Listen carefully, Mon Chaton.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
You have a special ability:
to see people's memories

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
whenever you drink
of their blood,

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
which means that you have
to be more responsible

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
than other vampires.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Like how?

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
What he's saying

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
is that it's a form
of communication

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
that requires agency.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
So, if you thirst
for someone's blood,

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
then you're supposed to persuade
them into letting you take it.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]
Persuade them?

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
What did he mean?
How would I do that?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé, what's--?

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Vanitas! Given your
intolerable personality,

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.848 position:50% align:center
one would think this
should be impossible,

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
but the fact is, your
blood has a divine aroma

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
that I find irresistible.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Wh--? Was that an insult?

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
No, it was a compliment!

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
O-Oh.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.234 position:50% align:center
Anyway.

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say
to you is that...

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
All I'm asking for is just
the smallest taste of--

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Archiviste!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
Listen well, because I'll
only say this once.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.418 position:50% align:center
If you make any attempts
to drink my blood

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
and thereby peer
into my memories,

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
I will not merely resist.
I'll kill you.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
Are we quite clear?

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
Of course. Forget I said it. I--

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Well, that went terribly.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
You have it all wrong.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
It wasn't because I wanted to
see into your memories, Vanitas.

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Then again, maybe I did.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Perhaps I'm wrong.

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I--

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.896 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS sighs]

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Just stop it already!

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
You're making me crazy.

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
If you've got something
to say to me, then say it!

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Sorry. No. It's nothing.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
Listen, what happened yesterday,

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
that was all my
fault, all right?

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
To be honest,

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
there's a part of me
that wants to blame you

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
for putting off such a scent.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:52.507 position:50% align:center
Around a vampire, it's not smart
to smell so sickeningly sweet.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Hey!

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
But all things considered,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
I have to admit, it's possible
that drinking your blood

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
was no more than a pretext
born of my desire

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
to find out more
about your past.

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Why even bother
looking into my past, Noé?

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
What could you possibly
hope to gain from that?

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what I might gain,
but I do find you intriguing.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
I told you that before.
Have you forgotten?

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Does that
Archiviste power of yours

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
work on blood you
consume from anywhere?

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
Or must it come
straight from the vein?

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
Well, um, it's just like
draining their life energy.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
If you wanna see
someone's memories,

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
then through the vein
is the only way.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
You need to drink the
blood from the source.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
Occasionally,
consuming it indirectly

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
will let me view fragments of
a person's emotions, though.

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
In that case, the
next time I get injured,

lick the blood off my clothes.

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
But that's a one-time
offer, understand?

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Ah! You mean it?

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
Just kidding.

[VANITAS laughing]

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
Now then. Shall we, Noe?

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:21.388 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ sighs]

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] We'll take
this train to Gévaudan.

[NOÉ]
Really?

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:40.323 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ yelping]

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
<i>Pardonnez moi!</i>

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO]
Oh, no.

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
Entirely my fault, monsieur.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
No harm.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé, over here!

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'll be right
there, Vanitas!

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I'm so sleepy.

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
Haven't you gotten a moment
of sleep this whole time?

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:07.267 position:50% align:center
Well, I wanted to,
but I was afraid that,

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
if I closed my eyes, you
would use that opportunity

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:10.812 position:50% align:center
to sneak away from me

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
and I would lose
sight of you forever.

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:15.483 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
It's a long journey.

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
You'd better get some
shuteye while you can.

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
And if I fall asleep,
you won't leave me?

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
You'll be here when I wake up?

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Do you promise?

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
I'll wake you
when we get there.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
Now get some rest.

00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:34.914 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
At last, the time has come.

00:23:34.998 --> 00:23:37.834 position:50% align:center
And now, here in Gévaudan,

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:41.629 position:50% align:center
I will make my song of vengeance
echo out across the land.
