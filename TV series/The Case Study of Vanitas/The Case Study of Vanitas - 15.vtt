00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center
Naenia! Get away from Chloé!

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.560 position:50% align:center
I'm warning you!

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
Naenia? I see.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're
calling yourself?

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.235 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA] It is simply
what others call me.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.654 position:50% align:center
Oh? Really?

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:36.244 position:50% align:center
Well never mind all that;
our meal has arrived. Sit.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It's her. She's the one who...

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
No, that's the <i>thing</i> .

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
That killed Louis!

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Tell me.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50% align:center
Mademoiselle Chloé, are you
the Beast of Gévaudan?

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center
There's a rumor that the Beast

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
is actually a
curse-bearing vampire.

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
If it's you, then
Naenia's the one who

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:12.322 position:50% align:center
took your true name
away from you.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.656 position:50% align:center
I don't understand--

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
how can you sit next to
that monster so casually?

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.704 position:50% align:center
Because I was
given what I wanted.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
Becoming a curse-bearer
was my own decision.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.964 position:50% align:center
It was the price I paid
to make my wish come true.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
Your wish?

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.470 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
Precisely.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:38.556 position:50% align:center
There are some names that
I covet more than others,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.686 position:50% align:center
but when they're held by
vampires as powerful as Chloé,

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
it's not possible
to take them by force.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.899 position:50% align:center
That's why I ask them politely.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.652 position:50% align:center
"May I have your
true name?" I say.

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.572 position:50% align:center
"I'll happily grant you a wish
in return, if you like."

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.657 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.284 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
And you are no exception, Noé.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
I've tried and failed
so many times to obtain

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.540 position:50% align:center
your true name for myself.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:07.544 position:50% align:center
You're a slippery one!

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.797 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'm going
to ask you once again.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.133 position:50% align:center
Think carefully, my dear.

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
Surely you must have one wish

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
that's worth surrendering
your true name to me?

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.516 position:50% align:center
I see now.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.020 position:50% align:center
You made the same offer
when you took Louis.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
Louis. If there's something
wrong, please tell me!

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.986 position:50% align:center
I'd do anything in
the world to help you!

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
Noé. I'm a-- a--

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA cackles]

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.830 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.709 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you?

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
What do you want?

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:52.339 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
What could you stand to gain

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.966 position:50% align:center
from stealing vampires'
true names?!

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.844 position:50% align:center
I refuse to let you
take anyone else away!

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.680 position:50% align:center
Give him back to me!

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.140 position:50% align:center
And to Domi!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
Let Louis go,
or I will kill you!

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] Listen well.
I have little patience

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
for children who waste food.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Why did you have to do that?

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
Ugh... sorry.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
She can be scary when she's mad.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
Remember that.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
Where is she right now?

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Still with her shadowy friend.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
I would suggest leaving them be.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
We can't!

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
Naenia's too dangerous,

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
it's not safe to leave
them alone togeth--

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
You throw food all over
the room like a child,

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
and yet your stomach
growls for more?

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
I can't exactly stop it.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
There was some left,

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center
I suppose you can
help clean it up.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
This is delicious.
You made it yourself?

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Of course.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
And my clothes--you're the one
who mended them, right?

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
--[JEAN-JACQUES] Yes.
--That's great!

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
You're amazing, Jean-Jacques.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
There's nothing you
can't do, is there?

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I can't get over
how tasty your cooking is!

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
U-Uh-- Huh?

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
special about it!

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:05.782 position:50% align:center
I've just had so many
years of practice

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
taking care of Chloé,
that's all.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I can't cook or
sew for the life of me.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
You should be proud!

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
Listen, I want you to
know how grateful I am

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
for all that you've done.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
Even though you
saved Murr and me,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center
I never had the chance
to say thank you.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll forgive me.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:28.138 position:50% align:center
I'd like to introduce
myself properly this time.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you. I'm Noé.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
What is that for?

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
If you want more soup,
you can serve yourself.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, no, I'm trying
to shake your hand.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
No one's ever asked
to shake my hand.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] How much do you know
about House d'Apchier?

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I looked at
the dossier you gave me,

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
but that's about it.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
I know their family
line died out

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
shortly after the
Beast's rampage.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but there's
a lot more to it.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
The d'Apchiers had been
conducting research

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
on the World Formula,
something which the Church

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
had expressly forbidden.

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
They built the
Alteration Engine,

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
something that could
change the formula.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
They say that's what created
the Beast of Gévaudan

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
in the first place.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I assume both vampires
and humans are getting

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
involved in this matter
in hopes of gaining control

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
of that device, right?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
Most likely.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] So, where did you
get this information, Dante?

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
Who's the one giving
you your orders?

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That'd be
Sir Francis Varney,

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.842 position:50% align:center
the Clockwork Fiend
Marquis Machina.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:49.511 position:50% align:center
That's good to know.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] The Marquis's
objective here is threefold.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
For one thing, I'm supposed
to make sure you're a part

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
of all this, since you're a
member of the Blue Moon Clan.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
Secondly, he wants
to know whether

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:05.026 position:50% align:center
the Alteration Engine actually
exists, and if possible,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to find it
and bring it to him.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES] Herman d'Apchier,
the last head of the family.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center
His wife, their children,
and his siblings...

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center
All of them are dead.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
The only member of the d'Apchier
family who remains is Chloé.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
Are you saying that--
how long has she been here?

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
She was always here.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
Long before the
Beast of Gévaudan

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
began its murderous reign.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
Chloé diligently watched
over each generation

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
of the d'Apchier line.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
Now tell me. What business
do you have with her?

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
Do you mean to harm her?

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
Chloé's not my enemy.
I just want Naenia.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50% align:center
Yet it seems to me that
you seek to separate her

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center
from that shadow that
she holds so dear.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course!

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
If we don't do something,

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
who knows what awful danger
could befall Mademoiselle Chloé?

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
Vani--or, I should say,
my traveling companion

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
might have what it takes to
give Chloé back her true name.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
I'm going to bring him
here so that he can--

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.306 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Can do what?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA] Are you sure it's
a good idea to leave Noé

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
and that boy alone together?

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] I am. This is
a rare opportunity.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
I think it's about
time Jean-Jacques

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
had a friend or two.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
Hm...

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Chloé said that she surrendered

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
her true name voluntarily.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
Before that shadow came,
she used to cry every day.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
It broke my heart, but there
was nothing I could do.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.878 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA] Personally,
I get positively furious

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
when someone touches what's
mine without permission.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
You're quite mature, aren't you?

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ giggles]
Well, I wouldn't say that.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES] I decided,
if that's what she truly wishes,

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
and if it keeps her from crying,

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
that I would make
my peace with it.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50% align:center
Even if it means
my own oblivion.

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
I will be with her
until the end.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
You may not realize it,

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
but I can be a terribly
jealous woman.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] It took until the latter
half of the 16th century

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
to start healing from Babel.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
Chloé, listen, you must hide
that you're a vampire.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
No one outside these castle
walls can ever know the truth.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Yes, sir.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] I awoke as a vampire
when I was a young child.

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
Apparently, Babel had not only
rendered the World Formula

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
unstable, but the effects
had rippled into this world.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
I promise, my dear, I will
make you human once again.

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:03.288 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Thank you, Father.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] After I turned 11,
my body didn't age anymore.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.255 position:50% align:center
My family hid me away
from the world.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
People were led to believe
that Chloé d'Apchier

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
had fallen ill and died.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
My father, determined
to find a solution

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center
for my condition, gathered mages
and alchemists, bringing them

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
to our castle in the mountains
to study the World Formula.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
We'll make it right.
Please trust me. Chloé.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
[CHLOEÉ'S FATHER]
You'll get your life back.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
You have my word.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.584 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] Restore Chloé
d'Apchier's humanity.

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:53.088 position:50% align:center
That was my father's
last wish, but over time,

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center
that ambition evolved into
something else entirely.

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.719 position:50% align:center
Unlocking the mysteries
of the World Formula,

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
obtaining the power that once
belonged to God alone.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
That was the new objective
of House d'Apchier.

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, I watched over them,
bearing witness to everything.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
I observed my family
for generations.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] I take it you're
the legendary Chloé d'Apchier?

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
And are you a vampi--

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] In this day and age,
it's unwise to let that word

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
pass your lips so
freely, mademoiselle.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
Ah, forgive me.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
I suppose you're a bit
old to be referred to

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
by that title any longer.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Madam, it is.

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
He told me his name was August.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
It was the first time
in my long life

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
I'd ever met another vampire.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.645 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] When researching
the World Formula,

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
it is imperative to
select a worthy medium

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
with which to manipulate it.

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
The d'Apchier family decided
it would be prudent

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
to work with sound.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Fascinating.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] You came here
without knowing that?

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
It seems your ignorance
knows no bounds, young man.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear, I apologize.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
Would it have been
more appropriate of me

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
to address you as monsieur?

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Nicely done, Chloé!

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
I'm certain you and I
will be great friends!

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
Friends, you say?

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
If it's possible
for us to construct

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
an Alteration Engine
and make changes

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
to the World Formula,
we could turn this world

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
toward a brighter
future for all people!

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] Before that, this castle
was the whole world to me.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
I knew nothing of what
lay beyond the mountains

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
of Gévaudan and I had never
cared to consider it.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
Outside your castle,
vampires are at war with humans,

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
or perhaps more accurately,
with the Church.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.418 position:50% align:center
Our kind are being
hunted and killed

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
throughout the land.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
Even humans have been
tortured to death

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
over the mere suspicion
of affiliation with us.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
Vampires are an abomination
in the eyes of the Church,

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
fit only for death.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] So, do you side
with the vampires?

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
Surely not with the humans.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
No, I side with neither.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth, Chloé,

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
I love my own kind, but I find
I love human beings no less.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
Therefore,

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
I seek to establish
peace between the two.

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
That is my greatest wish.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] He always expressed
himself plainly and honestly.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.169 position:50% align:center
I admired and envied that.

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:41.381 position:50% align:center
Eventually, my friend went
away and I found myself

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
anxiously awaiting his return.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
It's lovely to meet you!
I'd like you to call me Jeanne!

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
Her parents are going
to be accompanying me

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.725 position:50% align:center
to an important assembly.

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
So, until I return,
she's in your care.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE laughing]

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
Please don't wander off!

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
Stay by me.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
We're not supposed to be out.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] There's this
place that looks fun.

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
I spotted it from my window!

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you and I
go there together?

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
Ah-- No, wait.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
Jeanne, which way did you go?

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Gotcha!

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE laughing]

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] It was the first time
I ignored my father's bidding,

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
and let the beauty
of nature embrace me.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
The sky had never
looked so big and blue

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
through my window.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
Everything seemed so new
and exciting to me.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
It overwhelmed my senses.

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE sobbing]

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
meeting the woman

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
I know you'll become
one day, Jeanne.

00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
And so, we said our goodbyes,

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
and August took Jeanne away
to reunite with her parents.

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
I never saw her again.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] I couldn't help but
worry that she had met with some

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
terrible fate, but I couldn't
leave the castle to find out.

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] Whatever happens,
I can't abandon my family.

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA] Despite the fact that
humankind may abandon you?

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Chloé.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
August!

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] How has your
research been developing?

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Huh?

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] Have you completed
the Alteration Engine?

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] I thought there was
a way to reason with them,

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
to bridge the divide between
vampires and humans,

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
but they won't listen.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
I was wrong about everything
from the beginning.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:44.981 position:50% align:center
So now, it falls to me
to set things right,

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
but to do that, Chloé, I'm going
to need your family's research!

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
August, I cannot give it to you.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ gasps]

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
No! Stop! Let me go!

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare do this, August!

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
Swear to me.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.975 position:50% align:center
Swear you will use your power
and the d'Apchiers' knowledge

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
to carry out the
command I give you!

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN grunts]

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
Be gone, August! Forever!

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
Every head of my family
has devoted his life

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
to this research!

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.243 position:50% align:center
It's the only reason
I'm still here

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
after all these years!

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to say.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] That day, my very first
friend walked out of my life,

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
never to return.

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
Later, I received
a letter from someone

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
claiming to be
acquainted with August.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
That was when I learned
that the war between

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
humans and vampires was over.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] Apparently,
the main catalyst for peace

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
was August himself.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:24.456 position:50% align:center
He had done everything
in his power

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
to earn a place in the Senate.

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] I see you achieved your
greatest wish, old friend.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] And so, for countless
decades after that,

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:36.634 position:50% align:center
I continued to do
my research alone.

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Jeanne is all right.

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] This won't do.
I can't just lie here.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
I must complete
the Alteration Engine.

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
Then again, why do I bother?
What is there to gain?

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
Such a lonely girl.

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
You would do anything
to escape from your solitude,

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you, dear?

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
You would have been
better off if you'd never

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
experienced the outside world,
seen the beautiful blue sky.

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
That way you would have
no idea how alone you truly are.

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
Surely you realize,
Gévaudan is a cage

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
designed to contain you.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
If you wish to end your
solitude, you must destroy it.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
Be quiet.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA] Bare your fangs,
not your wings.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
I said stop!

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
You've been a bird too long.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
It's time to become a beast.

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
No, no!

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ gasps]
Jeanne?

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA cackles]

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 15A] What a tragedy,
it happened near Les Hubac.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
A young maiden was
brutally murdered.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 15B]
That's right,

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:56.881 position:50% align:center
I heard the girl's
name was Jeanne.

00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:58.258 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 15A] Her entrails
had been devoured,

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
so it was probably a wolf
or some other beast.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
No.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
It wasn't real. It was
some kind of nightmare.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
Which is the nightmare?

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
Me? Or this wretched world
you're living in?

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA] Poor little Chloé,
tell me what you most desire.

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
You lonely soul.
What are you going to do?

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Be quiet.

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:30.999 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
What is your wish?

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna talk to you!

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
Reveal what's in your heart!

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
At last, it's
finally happening.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:42.552 position:50% align:center
I'll get my wish.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
The one thing that I prayed for.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:56.941 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Uh--

00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
I see.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
So, you really mean
to go through with this.

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:02.280 position:50% align:center
Oh, Chloé.

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.494 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
What the hell is that?

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
There you are, Chloé d'Apchier.
