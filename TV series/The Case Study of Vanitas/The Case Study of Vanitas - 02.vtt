00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle
[LOUIS] Ever heard of
a curse-bearer, Noé?

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.732 align:middle
[NOÉ]
Hm?

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.608 align:middle
[LOUIS] That's what they call
the vampires who suddenly

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.902 align:middle
lose their minds
one day, go berserk,

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle
and start killing people.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.657 align:middle
My grandfather
told me about them.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.161 align:middle
There's a curse?
Whose is it?

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.412 align:middle
Who else's?

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle
The Vampire of the
Blue Moon's of course.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.752 align:middle
Hey, are you okay?

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.684 align:middle
[MINA]
Noé! Come play with us!

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.561 align:middle
[LOUIS]
So, tell me.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:05.398 align:middle
Even if there was a curse-bearer
right in front of you,

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle
would it change how you
think of the blue moon?

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:12.405 align:middle
Or would it still be
beautiful in your eyes?

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.258 align:middle
Hey, Vanitas?

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle
Noé?

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.345 align:middle
Would you care to explain
what we're doing

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle
locked inside a prison cell?

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.141 align:middle
[VANITAS] Hm. That's an
excellent question!

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.935 align:middle
About ten hours ago,
when Eglantine's poison

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.355 align:middle
was causing you to
carry on like a lunatic,

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.774 align:middle
you passed out in the street,
and you've been sleeping

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.152 align:middle
in here, as peaceful as
a newborn babe, ever since.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.529 align:middle
That's about it. Satisfied?

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.405 align:middle
Not at all.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.032 align:middle
Well, that's a shame.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.659 align:middle
You were the one who
stole onboard the airship!

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.286 align:middle
I was just an
innocent bystander,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.163 align:middle
so why am I in prison, too?

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.664 align:middle
Because I told the police

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:30.585 align:middle
that you were my ride-or-die
partner in crime! Obviously!

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle
My wallet's gone!

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.255 align:middle
Oh, right, they confiscated
all our belongings.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.383 align:middle
[NOÉ]
What? The book, too?

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.801 align:middle
I did say "all."

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.512 align:middle
[NOÉ] How can you remain
so calm at a time like this?

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:43.014 align:middle
Hold on. Were you planning
on stealing my book?

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.475 align:middle
Stealing it?! Of course not!

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.019 align:middle
My teacher requested that
I investigate its true nature.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.604 align:middle
He said nothing of theft.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.232 align:middle
Indeed. "Investigate
it's nature."

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.943 align:middle
Such a peculiar choice
of words, don't you think?

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.736 align:middle
I wonder why he'd say that.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.697 align:middle
[NOÉ]
That's true.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.491 align:middle
He didn't ask me
to steal or destroy it.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle
So what does my teacher want
me to do with that grimoire?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle
Back to business!

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.581 align:middle
Uh, what?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:09.916 align:middle
If you're after
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> ,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.251 align:middle
then you should join me,

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.337 align:middle
and yet you continue
refusing to do so.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.257 align:middle
Working together is the
only logical choice here.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.469 align:middle
You're right, it is!

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:22.762 align:middle
Well, then?

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.897 align:middle
[NOÉ gasps]
I think I understand now!

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.441 align:middle
I said no

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.527 align:middle
simply because I personally
don't care for you very much!

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.029 align:middle
[VANITAS]
Hm?

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle
What am I to do?

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.491 align:middle
For my teacher's sake, I suppose
I should do what you say.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle
But agreeing with the wishes
of someone I dislike

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle
could be a detriment
to my mental and emotional

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:51.291 align:middle
well-being in the long run.
In fact, I don't think I can!

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:54.669 align:middle
O... kay. So what now, then?

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.254 align:middle
[keys rattle]

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.298 align:middle
[POLICE OFFICER 02A]
Get out.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.507 align:middle
We don't have the authority

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.011 align:middle
to detain the two of
you here any longer.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:06.806 align:middle
Count Orlok sent an invitation.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.477 align:middle
[VANITAS grunts]

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.479 align:middle
The vampires probably
made an arrangement

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:13.438 align:middle
with the humans.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.814 align:middle
[NOÉ]
Huh?

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.275 align:middle
[VANITAS] Come along.
I'll show you the way.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.945 align:middle
[NOÉ] Uh-- Thank you.
This is my first time in Paris.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle
[VANITAS]
I see.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:41.049 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.763 align:middle
<i>Bienvenu.</i> The City
of Flowers awaits you.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.784 align:middle
[VANITAS]
The invitation from the Count

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle
said we needed to go
and retrieve our things.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.455 align:middle
Both what the police took
and anything that was left

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle
on the airship during
all the chaos.

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.627 align:middle
[panting]

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.505 align:middle
Why is it that you seem
so out of breath, Vanitas?

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.841 align:middle
Because a certain someone
keeps wandering away

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.467 align:middle
when I'm not looking.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:31.474 align:middle
[VANITAS]
We're here. Galerie Valentine.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.727 align:middle
[NOÉ] And this is where
we'll find the Count?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.936 align:middle
[VANITAS]
That's right.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.022 align:middle
After the war with mankind,

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.941 align:middle
vampires were forbidden
from attacking humans.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle
And before long, most of them
vanished beyond the barrier.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.281 align:middle
Most, but not all.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle
Many remain on this side,
blending into human society.

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.454 align:middle
The queen has appointed
a vampire to help

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:55.165 align:middle
maintain the delicate balance
between the two races here

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:58.084 align:middle
in Paris, and it's that
illustrious personage

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.377 align:middle
we've come to see.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.255 align:middle
The Lord of Altus, Parks Orlok.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.884 align:middle
[NOX, MANET]
Don't move.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.053 align:middle
That's how you greet
invited guests?

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:09.763 align:middle
Can't say I feel very welcome.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.181 align:middle
Silence, lout.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.308 align:middle
You failed to knock,
which makes you and your

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.478 align:middle
companion no better
than trespassers.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.525 align:middle
I've been curious
to meet the human

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:25.945 align:middle
who has so brazenly taken
up the name of Vanitas.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.158 align:middle
[meows]

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.117 align:middle
Aw, Murr!

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.411 align:middle
I'm so relieved, I could cry!

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.414 align:middle
[MANET]
Your possessions, human.

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.833 align:middle
I seem to be
missing something.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.132 align:middle
Let's cut to the
chase, shall we?

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.551 align:middle
I want both <i>The Book</i>
<i>of Vanitas</i> and Amelia Ruth

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle
returned to me at once.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle
[NOÉ] But, Vanitas, Mademoiselle
Amelia is out of danger,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.392 align:middle
so why do you need to--

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.686 align:middle
[ORLOK] We will take it upon
ourselves to eliminate her.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.562 align:middle
Curse-bearers are
a plague on the world

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.648 align:middle
and cannot be allowed to live.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.693 align:middle
Please have mercy, Count Orlok!

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.195 align:middle
Mademoiselle Amelia's
curse has been cured.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:08.697 align:middle
Using this book?

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.407 align:middle
Is that what you would
lead me to believe?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.158 align:middle
Yes, that's right. Truly.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:14.202 align:middle
I saw him use it
with my own eyes.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle
The book's power restored
her to her former state.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.081 align:middle
Therefore--

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:18.915 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.834 align:middle
You credulous fool.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.669 align:middle
Have you actually bought
into the nonsense

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.713 align:middle
this idiot insists on peddling?

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:27.799 align:middle
Cursed grimoires are the stuff
of children's fairytales.

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:30.427 align:middle
Call it whatever you will,
this is nothing but rubbish.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.054 align:middle
[laughs]

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.806 align:middle
Perhaps you're the fool
for stealing something

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.099 align:middle
you don't know how to use.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.851 align:middle
I expect you can't even open it,

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.353 align:middle
and that's why you were
so quick to summon me here.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.689 align:middle
It's quite hilarious, really.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.357 align:middle
If you're that desperate
for my knowledge,

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:48.236 align:middle
you could just ask nicely.
It isn't too hard, is it?

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.113 align:middle
You couldn't be more mistaken.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.656 align:middle
I didn't bring you here
to entertain us

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.159 align:middle
with your ridiculous claims
about this "grimoire,"

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.535 align:middle
but to squeeze you like a grape

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.495 align:middle
until you tell me
what you're planning.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.122 align:middle
Nothing sinister, I swear.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.749 align:middle
I'm simply trying
to save vampire kind

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:01.666 align:middle
from total annihilation.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.251 align:middle
What do you know
of vampire kind?

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.795 align:middle
You presume too much,
filthy human!

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.089 align:middle
[VANITAS] Are you so loathe
to admit <i>The Book of Vanitas</i>

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.383 align:middle
and its power are real?

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle
Amelia's return to sanity should
be proof enough for anyone.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.139 align:middle
[ORLOK] The woman
remains a curse-bearer.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.724 align:middle
Her fate is sealed.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.143 align:middle
All of her kind must be
beheaded by the <i>bourreaux</i> .

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.228 align:middle
I don't care if you do
claim to have cured her.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.147 align:middle
[NOÉ] Mina is to be
executed tomorrow?

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.024 align:middle
Why are you so surprised?

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.901 align:middle
Any vampire discovered
to be a curse-bearer

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.861 align:middle
must be beheaded by a <i>bourreau</i> .

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:31.821 align:middle
--That's the rule.
--[NOÉ] We have to save her!

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:35.325 align:middle
[LOUIS] How? Can you lift
the curse of the blue moon?

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:39.162 align:middle
No, you can't.
She is beyond saving, Noé!

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.789 align:middle
Listen well, human!

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.999 align:middle
Once a vampire's name
has been defiled,

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle
they can never again return
to the person they were.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.671 align:middle
[VANITAS] Nothing will ever
change as long as you senile

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.715 align:middle
old codgers cling to your
antiquated traditions.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.384 align:middle
--You wretch!
--[LOUIS] It's hopeless.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.053 align:middle
There is nothing
that you can do.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.304 align:middle
[NOÉ gasps]

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:07.816 align:middle
I have a suggestion.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle
The vampire attacks sowing
chaos throughout Paris

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:14.739 align:middle
are the work of a
curse-bearer, are they not?

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle
Then here is what I propose.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.495 align:middle
We will hunt down and
capture the one responsible.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.622 align:middle
And when we've returned
here with the fiend,

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:25.208 align:middle
then Vanitas will demonstrate
the book's power.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.626 align:middle
You'll see for yourself.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.631 align:middle
The grimoire is indeed capable
of curing the afflicted.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.842 align:middle
So be it then.

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.595 align:middle
I will allow you a single day.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.556 align:middle
[NOÉ]
We appreciate it.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle
[VANITAS grunts]

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.019 align:middle
[NOÉ]
There's no time to waste!

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle
So you will help me!

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.147 align:middle
I knew you'd come
around eventually.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.566 align:middle
Let's make one thing
abundantly clear.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle
I'm not helping you,
<i>you're</i> helping <i>me</i> !

00:10:56.865 --> 00:11:03.163 align:middle
[VANITAS laughs]

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:06.124 align:middle
[VANITAS] The longer I know you,
the more amusing you are.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.502 align:middle
[LOUIS]
It's hopeless.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle
There is nothing
that you can do.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.965 align:middle
[NOÉ]
It'll be different this time.

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:16.092 align:middle
I'll save her, no matter what.

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:22.432 align:middle
[VANITAS] Hey, Noé,
maybe slow down a second.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.767 align:middle
Do you have any idea
where to start

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle
searching for this vampire?

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.437 align:middle
Not the foggiest.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.565 align:middle
Hey, Vanitas, how's it going?
You need a hand?

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:31.691 align:middle
[VANITAS]
Dante!

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:32.567 align:middle
[DANTE]
Yeah.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle
[VANITAS]
Heartless cad!

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.821 align:middle
You left Amelia Ruth behind
to save your own worthless skin!

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:38.698 align:middle
[DANTE] You and I had
a very specific agreement

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.742 align:middle
and at no point was
there any stipulation

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.118 align:middle
about protecting the target.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.703 align:middle
You don't get what
you don't pay for!

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:44.829 align:middle
[VANITAS]
Heartless and greedy!

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.581 align:middle
[DANTE]
Shut your mouth, you quack!

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:47.874 align:middle
Excuse me.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.668 align:middle
[DANTE] Huh! Wanna tell
me what you're doing

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.461 align:middle
with the stiff from the airship?

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.463 align:middle
Allow me to introduce
this ruffian.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.714 align:middle
His name is Dante.

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:57.884 align:middle
Officially, he deals in
information, but really,

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle
I've found he'll do just
about anything for money.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.972 align:middle
He's the one you called baldy.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.307 align:middle
I am not bald!

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle
Where does this even come from?

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle
Well. I don't know
why you're here, Dante,

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.562 align:middle
and I don't care,
because you're too late.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.482 align:middle
As you can see, I have already
found the ultimate partner.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle
Hold on, your "partner"?
Talking about this guy?

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:17.153 align:middle
Um, no.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle
[VANITAS] I hate to break it
to you, my friend, but it seems

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:21.241 align:middle
you'll have to look elsewhere
for your allowance.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.494 align:middle
[DANTE]
Oh, yeah? That's too bad.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.955 align:middle
And just when I'd located
that nine-fold murderer

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle
and came here to track you down.
What unfortunate timing.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.836 align:middle
[VANITAS]
O, Dante, how I love thee!

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:36.506 align:middle
[VANITAS]
Honestly, baldy.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.591 align:middle
This is highway
robbery, I tell you!

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.720 align:middle
[DANTE] Hey, old man Orlok
doesn't even know!

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.514 align:middle
Information like this doesn't
come cheap, all right?

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.811 align:middle
So, following this bat will
get us where we need to go?

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.022 align:middle
[DANTE] Exactly. It'll
lead you to my comrade,

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.774 align:middle
who's tailing the killer
you're after even as we speak.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:03.366 align:middle
[VANITAS yelps]

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.202 align:middle
Okay. That was
strangely gratifying.

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:09.456 align:middle
[JOHANN]
Oh, my, was that <i>the</i> Vanitas?

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.208 align:middle
He's got the most
adorable face, doesn't he?

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.961 align:middle
Ugh. What'd you do,
follow me here, Johann?

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.755 align:middle
Of course. I have
something special

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:20.258 align:middle
to tell you, and it's only
polite if I say it in person.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:22.135 align:middle
You see, Lord Ruthven's
<i>bourreau</i> is here

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle
in Paris right now.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.929 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.265 align:middle
In search of <i>The Book</i>
<i>of Vanitas</i> , no doubt.

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:28.933 align:middle
Which means, if your
little friend doesn't

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:32.729 align:middle
watch himself, he may
well end up dead.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.735 align:middle
[VANITAS]
Thomas Berneux.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.278 align:middle
[NOÉ]
What?

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.238 align:middle
[VANITAS] He's the vampire who
emerged from beyond the barrier

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:43.531 align:middle
two months ago.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:47.744 align:middle
He killed nine people
by draining their blood.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.205 align:middle
I had been pursuing Berneux
right up until the point

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:53.083 align:middle
at which I received that
letter from Amelia Ruth.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.377 align:middle
So I already knew some
things about him.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.212 align:middle
Wait a minute, do you
mean you're the doctor

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.506 align:middle
that Mademoiselle Amelia
was talking about?

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.299 align:middle
<i>Mais Oui.</i>

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:02.467 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.389 align:middle
[yelps]

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:11.976 align:middle
[THOMAS growling]

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.853 align:middle
That's him. I'm sure of it.

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.397 align:middle
Thomas Berneux.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.439 align:middle
Go and stop him!

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.775 align:middle
Oh, I think I have an idea.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.318 align:middle
[screams]

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle
[gasps]

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.406 align:middle
[growls]

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.449 align:middle
But don't use me!

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.035 align:middle
[THOMAS growling]

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle
[VANITAS] I paralyzed him,
but it's only temporary.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.823 align:middle
We should restrain him
while we have the upper hand

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.908 align:middle
and take him back
to Orlok's place.

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:11.703 align:middle
[panting]

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.541 align:middle
[LUCA]
Amazing.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:21.296 align:middle
You incapacitated a
curse-bearer so swiftly!

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:24.132 align:middle
I take it you are Vanitas?

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle
I am Luca.

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.719 align:middle
And this is Jeanne.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.348 align:middle
[VANITAS]
Are you humans or vampires?

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.683 align:middle
[LUCA]
Right, of course.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.477 align:middle
We are vampires.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.104 align:middle
[LUCA]
Monsieur Vanitas.

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:42.067 align:middle
It may be rude, but I
have a favor to ask.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.277 align:middle
That grimoire you
hold in your hand.

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.614 align:middle
I apologize, but I must insist
that you give it to me!

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.076 align:middle
Forget it!

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.203 align:middle
This book isn't a toy, so why
don't you try asking again

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.497 align:middle
when you're a couple
feet taller, shorty?

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.715 align:middle
[VANITAS] What do you
want it for, anyway?

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.175 align:middle
[LUCA]
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> can corrupt

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.135 align:middle
the true name of a vampire.

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.805 align:middle
That's why it's come to be
known as an analytical engine

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.723 align:middle
in the form of a grimoire.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.685 align:middle
That book is the infernal
device that creates

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.728 align:middle
these curse-bearers
to begin with!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.272 align:middle
[NOÉ gasps]

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.066 align:middle
[VANITAS] Are you trying
to suggest that I'm using

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.444 align:middle
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> to spread
the curse even more?

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:29.114 align:middle
[LUCA] That's right, but I'm
going to save the curse-bearers

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:32.701 align:middle
by disposing of that wretched
monstrosity, once and for all!

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:34.994 align:middle
And since you're the one who
wields it, I imagine you'll

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:37.372 align:middle
be severely punished
for what you've done.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.582 align:middle
I refuse to allow you
to have that book!

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.334 align:middle
--[VANITAS] Yay!
--However, you're welcome to do

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.086 align:middle
as you see fit with
Vanitas himself.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.087 align:middle
Boo!

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.922 align:middle
Either way, we must make haste.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.174 align:middle
Please forgive me.
We can discuss another--

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.969 align:middle
I don't have time
to spare either!

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.221 align:middle
There's someone very dear
to me who's suffering badly

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:55.348 align:middle
from the curse,
and I have to stop it.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:56.474 align:middle
I have to!

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle
Honestly, who put
all of that nonsense

00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:02.439 align:middle
into your head, anyway?

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.733 align:middle
Listen. I'm a doctor.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:09.154 align:middle
I'm using the power of <i>The Book</i>
<i>of Vanitas</i> to heal vampires.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:11.072 align:middle
If you wish to save
this person,

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle
I can go and perform
an examination.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:14.909 align:middle
You can't help!

00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:16.453 align:middle
Because my big brother's
curse comes from

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.205 align:middle
the vampire of the blue moon!

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.541 align:middle
So for you to suggest that
I take you to examine him

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.084 align:middle
is foolish in every
sense of the word!

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:24.044 align:middle
Master Luca.

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:26.212 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.632 align:middle
Ah. So your brother is the
curse-bearer in question.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:37.515 align:middle
[JEANNE]
Master Luca.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.976 align:middle
I see no further
point in talking.

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:01.581 align:middle
[JEANNE] Please command
me as you see fit.

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.584 align:middle
[LUCA] Monsieur Vanitas,
will nothing convince you

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle
to hand over that book?

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.174 align:middle
Please, Jeanne.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.967 align:middle
Understood, sir.

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:15.679 align:middle
I'll do my best
to take him alive.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.599 align:middle
Do as you must.

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.644 align:middle
We will not leave here
without <i>The Book of Vanitas</i> !

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.188 align:middle
<i>Oui. Votre Altesse.</i>

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.816 align:middle
<i>Mon Dieu</i> ,
the Crimson Gauntlet!

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.656 align:middle
[VANITAS] Run, Noe, that woman
is Lord Ruthven's <i>bourreau</i> !

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.199 align:middle
Who?

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.993 align:middle
[VANITAS] I swear, your
ignorance knows no bounds!

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.705 align:middle
Let me explain!

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:45.125 align:middle
Many years ago, over 1,000
vampires betrayed their own kind

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.836 align:middle
to side with humanity
in the war, but it's said

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.713 align:middle
a single <i>bourreau</i> slew them all!

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.464 align:middle
It was she who wields
the Crimson Gauntlet

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.008 align:middle
known as Carpe Diem!

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:56.261 align:middle
The bearer of a saintly name
who massacred her own people!

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.933 align:middle
[VANITAS]
The Hellfire Witch, Jeanne!

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:08.565 align:middle
[NOÉ gasps]

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle
[VANITAS yelps] Trust me,
she has no intention

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:15.989 align:middle
of taking me alive!

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:19.826 align:middle
Well, I can't let you die yet!

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:22.328 align:middle
[grunts]

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.044 align:middle
We're in trouble!

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:49.147 align:middle
[LUCA]
Jeanne!

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.273 align:middle
[JEANNE]
Master Luca?

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:51.358 align:middle
It's too dangerous here,

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.027 align:middle
you must go and find
a place to hide!

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.946 align:middle
Listen, Jeanne!
You are not to kill him!

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.199 align:middle
You're not a <i>bourreau</i> now,
you're my knight!

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.201 align:middle
My <i>chevalier</i> , remember?

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.875 align:middle
[JEANNE]
Forgive me, Master Luca.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.049 align:middle
[VANITAS panting]

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:20.428 align:middle
[NOÉ panting]

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:22.347 align:middle
They're all such
terrible listeners.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.557 align:middle
Both that Count Orlok
and every vampire

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:26.935 align:middle
we've encountered in this city.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.561 align:middle
[VANITAS]
Makes sense.

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:32.315 align:middle
All vampire-kind is afraid of
the Vampire of the Blue Moon.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.402 align:middle
It's something that's
etched into their minds.

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.321 align:middle
Also, that kid was
running his mouth,

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.407 align:middle
but he wasn't entirely wrong.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.119 align:middle
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> can corrupt
a vampire's true name.

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:46.079 align:middle
That much is accurate.

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle
A corrupted name
causes a malnomen.

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:51.334 align:middle
My treatment consists
of restoring that name

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.003 align:middle
to its true state.

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.755 align:middle
Basically, a matter
of application.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle
So, it's really
no wonder that vampires

00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:00.427 align:middle
are afraid of this old grimoire.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.887 align:middle
Yes, but...
Power to do something,

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:06.391 align:middle
and actually doing it are
still two different things!

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle
Even if <i>The Book of Vanitas</i>
was originally created

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:12.397 align:middle
to exterminate vampires,
there's no denying

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.817 align:middle
that you used its power
to save Mademoiselle Amelia.

00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:19.738 align:middle
Thank you!

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:22.574 align:middle
If you ask me, what you
did for her that day

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:24.951 align:middle
was as righteous as it was kind!

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:32.292 align:middle
[NOÉ] That's why I wish
to return immediately,

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.794 align:middle
so we can rescue her!

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:36.504 align:middle
[laughs]

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:37.422 align:middle
Uh?

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:40.216 align:middle
[VANITAS muffled laughter]

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.344 align:middle
[NOÉ] Keep it down
before she finds us!

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.805 align:middle
Oh, Noé.

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:50.018 align:middle
You really are quite amusing,
do you know that?

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:51.436 align:middle
I am?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.439 align:middle
[VANITAS]
All right!

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.524 align:middle
I believe I've
steeled myself now.

00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:57.776 align:middle
[NOÉ]
Uh...

00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:59.402 align:middle
[VANITAS] I'm not sure
whether this will work,

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.988 align:middle
but it's our only hope
for a swift return.

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:04.407 align:middle
[NOÉ]
What do you me--

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.743 align:middle
I've found one way.

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:09.871 align:middle
One way for us to defeat
the Hellfire Witch.
