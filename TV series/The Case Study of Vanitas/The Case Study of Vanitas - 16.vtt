[DRAGOON CAPTAIN 13A]
Well, it'll have to wait!

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.354 position:50% align:center
First, we must find the Beast!

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:22.522 position:50% align:center
We're going to smite that

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.899 position:50% align:center
ferocious mongrel
and present its body

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
to His Majesty!

Whoa, something
doesn't smell right!

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
The Beast killed those soldiers
yesterday. We saw it, remember?

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
What is happening?

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
I can guess.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
And I know the malnomen, too.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
This is a time loop.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
We've been trapped
inside an enclosed world

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50% align:center

I'll find you.

Get off me!

No, you're not,

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
because I'm saving
the curse-bearer.

[JEANNE] I repaid my debt

[VANITAS] Tell me, Jeanne,
is this what you want?

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
It's my job. I have to.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.333 position:50% align:center
Besides, I refuse to create
any further trouble

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:25.835 position:50% align:center

All right.

It's finally starting to work.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
Did you put something

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
If you continue to interfere

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50% align:center
with Chloé's ambitions,
then it's more than likely

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
I will make an
attempt on your life.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
That's why I suggest
you sleep it off here

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
until things calm down.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
She told me about you.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
That as an Archiviste, you
can see a person's memories

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
by drinking their blood.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
When I heard that,
an idea came to me.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
Or a wish, if you will.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
After we're both gone,

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
I want there to be at least
one person who remembers us.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
No. Please, don't.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

Huh. Now bring me a drink!

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center

But I was wondering, are you,

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
by any chance, the one
they call the Silver Witch?

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.838 position:50% align:center
I remember my
grandma and grandpa

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
would tell me stories about you.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
They said that you're
a mysterious witch

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
with silver hair who sometimes
appears in the forest!

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
Could it really be you?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center

are you a vampire?

Wait, you're a--

[VILLAGER 16A]
There's been another victim?

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 16B] It's awful!
There've been dozens of deaths!

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 16C] I heard someone
saw an enormous beast.

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:38.755 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 16D]
And there's another rumor.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
Apparently, Marquis d'Apchier's
been involved in some kind of

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
suspicious research
for a long time.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 16E]
It's true!

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Whatever he's up to,
I hear his work is to blame

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
for the Silver Witch who
haunts the woods nearby.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 16F] Right, and
the Beast is her familiar!

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER 16G]
It's worse than that,

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
I believe the Beast of Gévaudan
is the Silver Witch!

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
No, you're wrong!
It's not Chloé!

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.611 position:50% align:center
She wants to protect you all.

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.699 position:50% align:center
That's why she's trying to
figure out the Beast's identity!

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] The marquis and his son
were both slain by the Beast.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
The marquis's wife
was so distraught

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
that it drove her to suicide.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50% align:center
They're dead,

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
and their blood is on my hands.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
All because House d'Apchier
sheltered a vampire.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
So, it's true.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
I really am an awful monster.

Please don't cry, Chloé.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
Yet, both humans and vampires
have cast you aside

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
like worthless trash.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that make you sad?

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
Angry? Bitter?

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
If I were you, I would have
my vengeance upon Gévaudan.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
Yes, yes.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
I can never forgive what
has been done to me.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
I will have my vengeance!

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
Commencing, calculation.

[JEAN-JACQUES]
Say, Chloé, I have a theory.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
Hear me out--what if
the Beast of Gévaudan

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
was never even real?

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
And that would mean

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
that everyone's terrified
for no good reason.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
The hunt will never end

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
until they have
the Beast's corpse.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
That's why, I'm going
to become the quarry

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
they want so desperately!

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES] Now!
Come and slay me if you can!

00:12:56.401 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
Before every last one of you
succumb to my fangs!

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Father?

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
It was bad enough
just having a damned

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
vampire for a son, and now
I find out you're the Beast!

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50% align:center
Although, if I can kill you,

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
then I'll get to bring home
a generous reward.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
I guess you proved
yourself useful in the end!

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
'Bout time, Jean-Jacques!

[JEAN-JACQUES, NOÉ]
Somebody, help me.

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
Please, please!

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Well,

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
can't take my eye off
of you for a second, can I?

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.711 position:50% align:center
Noé?

00:13:56.795 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
It's you. Vanitas.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
Wait, where was I?
What's happening?

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Does that hurt?

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Yes.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Congratulations, you're back.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Yes, thanks.

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] What the devil
did they do to you?

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
Slip you some
questionable medicine?

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Looks like that's
exactly what happened.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear, I meant
that as a joke.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Did Dante and
Jeanne come with you?

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Oui.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ] Everyone's safe?
--[VANITAS] Oui.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Thank goodness.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
I was really worried.

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
<i>You</i> were worried?

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.540 position:50% align:center
How do you think I fe--?

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS] Never mind!
--What?

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I said never mind!

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
More importantly.

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:43.717 position:50% align:center
Tell me you at least
learned something useful.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Ow!

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] According to Jeanne,
Chloé d'Apchier is the Beast.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Actually, no! It's not her.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:03.945 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I see.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
So, the man you
call Jean-Jacques

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
is the real Beast of Gévaudan.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
And Chloé is a vampire
who was transformed

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
into a curse-bearer
of her own volition.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Right. So, it would seem.

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:16.791 position:50% align:center
But as far as I know, neither
one of them has killed a soul.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS sighs] Then this
has all been for nothing.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.215 position:50% align:center
She did it to seek
her vengeance?

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:26.593 position:50% align:center
Well, if she accepted
the curse willingly,

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
then I see no point
in attempting to treat her.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Do you mean leave her?

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
But that wouldn't be right!

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Why not?

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
Pursuing revenge isn't
a worthy use of her time?

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
She'll only end up
causing more pain?

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
Is that it?

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Retribution!

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
No!

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
That's not what
I was going to say!

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
I still don't understand

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
what's going through
Chloé's mind.

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
I don't know if what
she's seeking is salvation

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
or what salvation would
even be for those two.

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
But until I figure
out the answer,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
I'm not leaving!

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.134 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Fine, I suppose
I do still need to recover

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:10.428 position:50% align:center
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> .

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Uh--

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] So, I'm with you,
at least till then.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
What, you don't get it?

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
What I'm saying is,

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
I'm willing to stay
long enough to help you

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
complete your little mission.

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
But if you want me to treat
those curse-bearers,

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
do try and be more convincing.

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll do my best!

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Settle down!

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I don't get it, if
Jean-Jacques became the Beast

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
to clear Chloe's name,
then who--or what--

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
murdered all those
people before that?

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Well, the locals
still have all kinds

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:49.926 position:50% align:center
of differing superstitions.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
Not to mention religious sects.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
And, unsurprisingly,
vampires are despised:

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
just abominations
to be exterminated.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Exterminated?

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
You mean through
vampire hunting?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
Actually, because the
war between vampires

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:06.860 position:50% align:center
and humankind had ended,
vampire hunting

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
was no longer
officially sanctioned.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
As a result, there was
need for a scapegoat.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:18.413 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] So, if a wild animal
conveniently came to devour

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
the bodies of those rejected
by the Church, then...

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] You think they
started the rumor?

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I'm merely speculating.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
However, the bishop at
the time did call the Beast

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
a "servant of God," so take
from that what you will.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
Huh. If you're right, then not
only did the Church fabricate

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
the legend of the Beast,
but they're responsible

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:38.641 position:50% align:center
for all the carnage in Gévaudan?

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
That's so evil!

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO]
Look who it is!

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
It would appear that
you survived as well.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
How very disappointing.

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.192 position:50% align:center
Astolfo!

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
Speak of the devil!

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
You've come here to destroy
the 100 year old evidence,

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
I assume?

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
You go ahead, Vanitas.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of this one.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.086 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
Fine, just give him a good one

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
right here for me,
would you?

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
[organ music playing]

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
[clapping]

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Interesting.

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:32.612 position:50% align:center
So that organ must control
all the devices in the engine.

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
And you must be
Chloé d'Apchier.

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
Can I help you?

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
You may call me Vanitas.

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:42.414 position:50% align:center
A doctor for vampires like you.

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
Do not fear.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
I've come to heal you
of your affliction,

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
if you'll allow me to.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
But first...

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
I demand that you return
my book immediately!

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
What book?

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
What do you mean "what book"?!

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
It's the one with black pages
and the sparkly blue cover!

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Ah, yes, of course.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's around
here somewhere.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
Pardón?

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
Well, I vaguely recall
Jean-Jacques putting it away

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
once I'd lost interest.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center
The jewel on the cover
had captured my attention,

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
but try as I might,
I wasn't able to remove it,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
so I eventually gave up

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
and simply tossed it
somewhere on the floor.

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.616 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS growling]

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
You idiotic vampires would
forget your own heads

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
if they weren't attached!

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
I didn't lose it,
I just forgot where it went!

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
I'm curious.

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
You mentioned something
about healing me.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
How do you stand
to gain from that?

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
In other words,
are you friend or foe?

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
I can answer.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
This man is your enemy.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
And I hate him more
than you can imagine.

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
Take heed, he is
not to be trusted.

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
Hah! To be quite honest,
I'm no one's friend.

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
Since he's in league
with the boy,

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
I'll let you deal with him.

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:56.905 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA cackles]
My pleasure!

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
Tell me the truth, Chloé!

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
It's clear that you're seeking
vengeance for something.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
What are you going to rewrite?

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Analysis complete.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
Coordinates selected.

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA giggles] Any moment now,
she's going to wipe Gévaudan

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
from the face of the earth!

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
Eradicate it completely.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
Flora, fauna,
humans, everything!

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
The entire place
will be cast into oblivion,

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
as though it were never here!

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I wonder
what's in store.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
It's all so exciting!

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
She's not just tampering

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
with the World Formula.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
She's erasing part of it!

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
Removing a large area
like Gévaudan

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
will have massive repercussions!

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
I'm warning you, Chloé!

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
Stop now!

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:02.470 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No, wait.

00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
What is she <i>really</i> after?

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.602 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] Alter definitions,
change phenomena.

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Don't activate
that machine!

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
Bring forth existence.

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
What's this?

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:39.257 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA screaming]

00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:41.593 position:50% align:center
She's using the
Alteration Engine to generate

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
a physical form for Naenia!

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] I've wrestled with this
dilemma for such a long time.

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
I searched for a means to
end this eternal nightmare.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
For some way to lay my hands
upon this ethereal thing.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
Finally.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
Now I will be able to slay you.
