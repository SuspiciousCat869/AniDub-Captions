[VANITAS humming]

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:20.270 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
And there she is.

[VANITAS]
Bonjour, Jeanne.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:26.735 position:50% align:center
I must say, I was surprised to
get another invitation from you.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I'm glad, though.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Vanitas.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
I'd like for us to go on a date.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.095 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.180 position:50% align:center
I'm very sorry to
bother you, Monsieur.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.850 position:50% align:center
I came to deliver
a card addressed to you.

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.853 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Pardón, Amelia.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.147 position:50% align:center
Might you be able to describe
the person who gave you this?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
Forgive me.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.774 position:50% align:center
The hotel asked me
to pass it along,

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:32.277 position:50% align:center
but I didn't see
who the sender was.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.614 position:50% align:center
My goodness!

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.575 position:50% align:center
Get ahold of yourself.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Hm? What's happening?

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
Vanitas? Are you
going out somewhere?

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
It's a secret.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:57.135 position:50% align:center
On a date? The two of us?

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50% align:center
Oh, Jeanne. You must've
lost your marbles.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
When I think back to
the evening that we met,

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
I realize that I was the one
who delivered the first blow.

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have blamed
you if you had decided

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
to kill me for what I did,
but you chose not to.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
It was the same
at the <i>bal masque</i> .

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.738 position:50% align:center
You helped me rescue
my dear Master Luca.

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
And though the other vampires
heaped their scorn upon you

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:24.079 position:50% align:center
for doing so, you saved
the curse-bearers, as well.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center
When I realized the power
that you hold over me.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
I should've run from you
as fast as I could.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
But ever since,
each day and night,

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
my mind has been tortured
with thoughts of only you!

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
And so, I fear...

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
Much as it pains me to say so,

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.222 position:50% align:center
I believe that I may
have fallen for you!

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
I must know whether
these feelings that dwell

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
within my heart can
truly be called love!

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
So please, do not forsake me!

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
There it is!

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
Exactly the reaction I need!

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.823 position:50% align:center
I knew this was going to be the
right way to take care of it!

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Hm? You want me to tell you

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
how to make Vanitas hate you?

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
Correct! I have no
patience for that man!

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
But the more I reject him,

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
the more gleefully he
insults me with his closeness.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
It's too much,

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
I can't bear to have him toy
with me for a moment longer!

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
Please, Lady Dominique,
you must know of a way

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
that I can rectify
this terrible dilemma.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
I beg you to lend
me your advice!

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Well, how am I supposed to know?

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Ah, but she's
so cute when she's desperate!

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
Surely there's something
I can do for her!

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Come to think of it,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.527 position:50% align:center
Noé did tell me something
potentially illuminating.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
He remembers Vanitas saying
that he had no interest

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
in the sort of person
who could love him back,

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
or something like that.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
Meaning: all you
have to do is pretend

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
to fall madly in love
with that imbecile!

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
He'll be so disgusted,
he'll leave you alone!

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
Why, it's absolutely foolproof!

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Today I force myself
to love you, body and soul,

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
that you may come
to utterly despise me!

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:11.019 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] It'll only work if
I can manage to seem genuine.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS chuckles]

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
You caught me off guard there.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
But then, how could I refuse
an invitation from you?

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
I've made my
feelings very clear.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
Besides,

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.535 position:50% align:center
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't intrigued by this

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
sudden change, and I would
like to see where it leads.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
I'm so very glad!

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Enjoy this
while you can, Vanitas!

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
You may think you hold
the power, but soon,

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
I'll have you in
the palm of my hand!

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.300 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I must say, Jeanne,

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
that dress is
simply breathtaking.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]
Isn't it?

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
Lady Dominique gave it to me,
along with the accessories!

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
And what's more, she picked out

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.730 position:50% align:center
this entire ensemble
just especially for me!

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand, Jeanne?

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
When I compliment your outfit,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.363 position:50% align:center
what I'm really telling you
is that you're beautiful.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
Let's be off, shall we?

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What was that?

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
Did I just react to his words

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.046 position:50% align:center
as though I were
truly in love with him?

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Huh?! The quack
and the Hellfire Witch?

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
There's definitely something
wrong with my eyesight!

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.436 position:50% align:center
You're Dominique de Sade!

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. You're
that dham I met.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
Um, what are you doing?

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
I am tailing these idiots.
Can't you tell?

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
Uh, why?

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Oh, no, Jeanne!

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
Not to worry. You're safe.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Forgive me! I was...!

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
It's all right as long as
you didn't get hurt.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
Just be careful.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
This is stupid.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Jeanne is a lot
softer than I thought.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure how well
this plan will play out.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Ah-- No, uh...

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughing]

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
Why is this happening
and why do we care?

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ grunts]

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] You have quite
a unique way of sleeping.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
Lord Ruthven?

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
And bonjour to you, my boy.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.929 position:50% align:center
Were you having
a pleasant dream?

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.188 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] Heh, apologies for
the sudden intrusion.

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
No, please.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] This venerable
café's been operating

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.777 position:50% align:center
since the 17th century.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
It's one of my favorite places
to dine in the mortal world.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I don't mean to be rude,
but if it's so popular,

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
why is no one else here?

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] I had them
reserve it just for us.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ chokes]

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
I was hoping we could have
a leisurely chat together.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
Really? With me?

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
Instead of Vanitas?

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
Well, there are
numerous questions

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
I could ask him if
I'd brought him along.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
However, he probably would've
hijacked the whole discussion,

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
don't you agree?

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
Just like last time.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
He got every bit of information
he wanted out of me,

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
but he didn't allow me a chance
to ask a single question of him.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
That's true.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
I don't know anything about
Vanitas's past, either.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
But you must know
something about

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
what kind of person
he is, at least.

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.414 position:50% align:center
And, your connection
to Vanitas aside,

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
you're also the
Shapeless One's child.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
That in itself is enough reason
for me to take interest in you.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
I had no idea that my
Teacher was so interesting.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN sputters, laughs]

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
Impressive.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50% align:center
To think there's a
vampire who can treat

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
your Teacher so casually.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.644 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
he's more interesting

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
than any of us know.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ gasps]
--[RUTHVEN laughs]

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
I don't understand.

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.702 position:50% align:center
When I first
encountered this man,

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
I despised him with
every ounce of my being.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
But now, my heart is racing
with unbridled passion.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center

It's too late.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.257 position:50% align:center
I am the one who
instigated this affair,

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
and it's my duty to watch
over them to the end!

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
I'm going to stick to those
two lovebirds like glue.

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
That's so idiotic.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
No one asked you!

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind,
it's probably safe

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
to let go of my hand now.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
But you're such a
reckless walker, dear.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
I'll stop!

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
I just want my parasol!

What is this?

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
I barely recognize him!

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
Where's that selfish,
egotistical brute I met before?

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
This is so different.
It's driving me mad!

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Well, Jeanne.

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
Is there somewhere special
you'd like to go today?

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Actually, I was hoping
to see more of the city.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
That's odd, it's not as if

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
it's your first
time in Paris.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
I know that, but...

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
Whenever I'm here
with Master Luca,

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
I have to keep close
watch over him.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
I can't afford to look
around and enjoy the view.

Well then,

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:59.325 position:50% align:center
now's your chance to
experience it to the fullest.

[JEANNE]
What's that?

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] The Palais Garnier,
an opera house.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
And that?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Le Grand Magasin.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
And that?

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
The Arc de Triomphe.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
And those?

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Relax, darling, those are cats.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
Aw! Oh?

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
Ah, so the whale
swims again today.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
How grand!

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
This world's Paris is so very
different from Altus Paris!

[BOTH laugh]

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Why am I enjoying this?

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] You mustn't forget
your objective, Jeanne!

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
This date is meant to sever
all ties with Vanitas,

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
now and forever!

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs] Jeanne,
would you care for a crepe?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
<i>S'il vous plait!</i>

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
I hate this.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but, it's sort of turning
into a regular old date now,

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be on my way.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
Don't be stupid!

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
You've come this far,
so let's see it through!

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
[bell tolls]

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
A lovely view, non?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
Montmartre is actually the
highest hill in all of Paris.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
That tower.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
That's the Sun Tower,

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:46.141 position:50% align:center
the star of the next
Exposition Universelle.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
A tasteless thing,
if you ask me.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
I was sure they would adopt
Gustave Eiffel's proposal,

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
but <i>c'est la vie</i> .

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.610 position:50% align:center
So vain, just like Babel.

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
Now then, I'm going to
step away for a moment.

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
What? But why?

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
Nature calls.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.373 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
I expect to hear your
answer upon my return.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
Give it some thought, would you?

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it?

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
It's nothing, I'm sorry, sir.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50% align:center
Don't be so bashful.
What's on your mind?

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
It's just that,
when I speak with you,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
it's a little like I'm attending
my old lessons all over again.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
What is it? The way
that you speak?

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
Something about you reminds me
so much of my Teacher.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:46.451 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's because
conversing with you is fun.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center
It's silly, right?

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
Since, other than that, you two
are very different people.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
Long ago,

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
I used to work as
an instructor of sorts.

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.134 position:50% align:center
This was when it was common
for humans and vampires

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
to hate and slaughter
one another.

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
I had many faithful
students gather at my side.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
They adored me.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
I strove not only
to impart knowledge,

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
but to challenge their
way of thinking.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
I wanted them to join me in
creating a brighter future.

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center
That sounds wonderful.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.529 position:50% align:center
Have they kept in touch?

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
They're dead now.

[NOÉ gasps]

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.867 position:50% align:center
It's true. They were all killed.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, sir, I had no idea.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me
for bringing it up.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
You know, if I had students now,

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
I would want them
to be like you.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
Then my days would be
filled with joy.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Mm?

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:49.055 position:50% align:center
But you do cause me concern.

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
What if someone were to come
along and take advantage

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
of that pure and generous
heart of yours, Noé?

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
Are you referring
to Vanitas, sir?

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
He won't. I mean,
it's complicated.

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
He'll try to use almost anyone,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
and yet he can't
bear the thought

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
of someone getting
hurt because of him.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
The man is a
walking contradiction.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
He told me he believes that

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
vampires and humans
are the same.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
That deep inside, both
groups are equally selfish

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
and monstrous creatures.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
His words annoyed me, but also,

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
I sensed such a
loneliness in him.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
What do you think, Noé?

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
What is vampirekind to you?

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
And what about the humans?

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
Huh?

This absurd charade
is almost over.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:51.076 position:50% align:center
All I have to do is convey
that I'm in love with him.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
Now I'll just practice
my confession speech!

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Vanitas,
I had so much fun today.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
It was a joy to see
so many new sides of you.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
I'm truly grateful.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
I think I would like
the opportunity

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
to learn even more about you.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.184 position:50% align:center

It's just as I had feared.

What's changed?

[JEANNE screams]

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center

your feelings for me out loud.

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
What does he mean?

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I don't
think I understand.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN] Well, you were
taken in and raised by humans

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
when you were young,
isn't that right?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.207 position:50% align:center
So, what I want to know is...

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
...do you stand on the
side of the vampires?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
Or should I call you our enemy?

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's neither.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
If you're asking me to describe
what an "enemy" is in my view,

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
it's anybody who sets out to
harm the people I care about.

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
Whether human or vampire,

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
that's got nothing to do with
a person's character, sir.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
I like vampires and humans.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
People are people.

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
That's the way it should be.

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
[RUTHVEN]
All right, I think I understand.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
You failed the test.

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with me?

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
Lord Ruthven. I--

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.346 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE panting]

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
That's better, non?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Listen.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
I have to ask again: are you
a curse-bearer, or not?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
Do you recall any
encounters with Charlatan?

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
Do you suffer from
any other symptoms

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
aside from the desire
to consume blood?

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I-- I--!

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
Relax.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
If someone's forbidden
you to speak of it,

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
you can start by saying that.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
[gasps, pants]

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Vanitas. Listen.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
You should know something.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
I've kept my promise.

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
I haven't taken
anyone else's blood.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
Just as you asked!

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
Well, then. I suppose
that's worthy of a reward.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.579 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS grunts]

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
[moans]

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
More.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Jeanne.

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
More!

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
More!

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What shall I do?

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
I feel my sanity
slowly slipping away.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
Eventually, I fear I may
not be myself anymore.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center
What if I cause harm
to Master Luca someday?

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center
What if I...

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:42.802 position:50% align:center
Look, Jeanne.

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:45.972 position:50% align:center
As it stands, I don't have
enough information to confirm

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
whether you're a
curse-bearer or not,

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
which means I can't
promise I'll cure you.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
Even so, there's hope.
All is not lost.

00:21:57.442 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
If I have to, I promise
I will kill you.

00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:07.327 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. You have my word.
