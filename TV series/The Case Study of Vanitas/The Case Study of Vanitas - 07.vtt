[NOÉ]
I am so naive.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] There's so much
that I don't know.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
So very much I need to learn.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas,

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
would you permit me
to ask you a question?

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
All right, out with it, then.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
Can you please explain
to me what love is?

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:13.466 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]
It's <i>Tarte Tatin</i> !

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:19.264 position:50% align:center
I didn't anticipate that
he'd be this excited!

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:21.057 position:50% align:center
Noé adores <i>Tarte Tatin</i> .

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.018 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's his
greatest weakness!

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.061 position:50% align:center
That's very useful
information to have.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.022 position:50% align:center
<i>Merci beaucoup</i> , Dominique!

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm happy
to be of service.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.234 position:50% align:center
It's perfect. Perfect!

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50% align:center
So, um, can I eat it now?

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.700 position:50% align:center
Of course, please go ahead.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center
It's delicious!

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Teacher used to bring
this stuff home as a gift

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
when he would go on trips
to the human world.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
But I never thought
I would get the opportunity

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
to enjoy some
here in Altus Paris!

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
The recipe was first
brought into our world

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
by a vampire who loved it.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe someone could
like it more than you do though!

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:08.813 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] I'd be willing to
bet the vampire in question

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
was none other than
my grandfather.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] This is such a
magnificent restaurant.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
Thank you for bringing
us here, Luca.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] Oh, no thanks necessary!
You came all this way to visit.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
I apologize for
my uncle's absence.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It's all right.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.209 position:50% align:center
We'll have plenty of time

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
for a meeting with
him tomorrow, anyway.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know what
happened after the ball.

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
I have so very many questions.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50% align:center
Noé. I can't express
how grateful I am

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
for what you did last night.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
Your actions were
brave and selfless.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
If not for you,
my life and the lives

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
of many vampires would
have been lost.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. It was nothing.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
I agree, Noé. Let us
bid you thanks. Please.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
In spite of my absence,

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
you managed to
protect Master Luca.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center
I'm truly grateful.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
But, I...

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
You have the wrong idea!

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
I wasn't the one who put
a stop to all that chaos,

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
that was Vanitas' doing!

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
Obviously. I'm aware
that no curse-bearers

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
met their end at the
hands of a <i>bourreau</i> .

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center
That's thanks to him.
Though I hate to admit it.

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.364 position:50% align:center
That said, Vanitas!

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
Before I can
convey my gratitude,

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:46.411 position:50% align:center
I must insist that you
apologize for the other day!

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Apologize? For what?

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
The way in which you
behaved toward Jeanne

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
upon being introduced!
You, um...

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
Well, you were quite forward
with your advances!

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
Ah, you mean our kiss!

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
So I think perhaps
you had better begin

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
by apologizing for that.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50% align:center
Whoopsie!

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
"Whoopsie"? Is that
all you've got?

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.187 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You're a real
thorn in my side, kid.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
Who am I supposed to be
apologizing to, anyway?

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
To Jeanne, or is it to you?

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
What kind of question is that?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
To Jeanne, obviously!

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I see. Well,
in that case, there's no need.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
For Jeanne and I have
fallen madly in love.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:32.040 position:50% align:center
Keep your fantasies to yourself.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS chuckles]
It's more real than you think.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
See? The proof's right here.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
Jeanne and I already have
quite an intimate relationship.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
He's marked?

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
Is that Jeanne's?

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
The symbol left behind
when vampires partake

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
of a person's blood
and imbue the victim

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
with a bit of their power.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.275 position:50% align:center
It's not true!

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
I have absolutely
no memory of doing that!

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
Come now, don't you
at least recognize

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
your own mark? Well,
I suppose you were being

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
quite rough in the moment,
so perhaps that explains

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
why your memory
is a trifle spotty.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS sighs]
You fed so greedily.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
It was like you
were in a trance.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
Was my blood really
so delicious to you, Jeanne?

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
So much so that you left
your very mark upon me?

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
[stammering]

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
Please tell me there's
been some kind of mistake!

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
Master, I--!

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
Is this really the sort of
man that interests you?

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
Where did that come from, sir?

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
Oh no, it's true, isn't it?

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
How could you go and leave
your mark on a member

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.404 position:50% align:center
of the Blue Moon Clan,
of all the lousy people?

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
It's like you're a wolf claiming
a piece of meat for your dinner!

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
Master Luca! I'm sorry.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
Hah! All right, all right!

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
I took my little jest too far!

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
What?

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Luca, this certainly
is Jeanne's mark upon me,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
but I assure you she didn't
leave it on purpose.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] Are you implying
that you forced her somehow?

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.351 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Oh, nothing of the sort!

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
Calm down!

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
She wasn't in her right mind
during the incident.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
Those curse-bearers were
tearing the place apart.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
We all heard their
voices, remember?

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
The sound of it
made everyone go mad,

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
and that momentary loss of
control is what caused Jeanne

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
to attack and drink my blood.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
Is that what happened, Jeanne?

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
Yes. Master Luca. I'm sorry
I kept it from you.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
It was a shameful matter.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center
I see! So that's all it was!

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
Well, this is a relief!
Now it makes sense!

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm sure you'd
have had to be completely

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
out of your mind to leave your
mark on a worthless, foolish,

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
ugly piece of garbage like him,

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center
so that was the only
possible explanation!

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.271 position:50% align:center
Why, Luca, if I
didn't know better,

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.774 position:50% align:center
I'd say you
absolutely despise me.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.570 position:50% align:center
The important thing is
you're all right. I'm glad!

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Master Luca!

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
I need to borrow him for a bit.
I'll be right back!

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
But, Jeanne--!

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
I should go after them!

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.191 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] Noé? Don't they
realize there's a door?

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.366 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Why did you tell that lie?

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Oh? Should I have
told them the truth instead?

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
Your bloodlust was unstoppable,
and it seemed like

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
you didn't want young
Luca to know that,

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.795 position:50% align:center
so I simply decided
to make something up.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
Quite clever, if I do say so.

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
I've asked you before, Jeanne.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
You're a curse-bearer,
aren't you?

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
But you won't say
it out loud. Fine.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
It doesn't happen
that way every time.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] I can suppress
my thirst for blood

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
as long as I take my medicine.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
But yesterday, its effects
wore off too quickly.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:40.163 position:50% align:center
Medicine for curse-bearers?
How fascinating.

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Do not speak
a word of this to anyone.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
You can't. I beg you.
It would destroy me.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs]

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Have no fear, Jeanne.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
I'm not the kind of man
who would reveal the secrets

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.067 position:50% align:center
of the woman I love.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
But I do have two
conditions for you!

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
Conditions?

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.329 position:50% align:center
I promise I won't tell
anyone your little secret.

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
And, in exchange...

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
[BATS shriek]

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
...the blood you drink
has to be mine and mine alone.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What?

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:40.557 position:50% align:center
You're insane! What kind
of condition is that?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
Is it really so much to ask?

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
The sensation of you drinking
my blood was simply heavenly!

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Wait! What? Why?

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Last night was the first time

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
having my blood fed upon
ever rocked me to my core.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
And I found it
truly indescribable.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
The pleasurable
effect that occurs

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
from a vampire's bite
is a direct result

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
of the substance
emitted by their fangs

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.621 position:50% align:center
upon contact that
resembles an aphrodisiac.

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
However, the efficacy of
said substance may differ

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
according to the vampire's power
and personal compatibility

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.960 position:50% align:center
with the individual whose
blood is being drunk.

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
[speeding up] The purpose of
injecting this component

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
is to keep the target still
while the blood is withdrawn.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
Some vampire bites will induce
sleep, temporary paralysis,

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
or other undesirable conditions,
however, there is still

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
very little conclusive research
regarding the effects

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
of vampire bites on the body,
especially as it pertains

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
to long-term health
and wellness--

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
What I'm saying is
you and I have undeniable

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
physical chemistry, my dear!

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
You lowlife! Stop saying things

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
that would sound so
untoward out of context!

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Oh, Jeanne!

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center
Being around you just
sets my heart all aflutter!

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE growls]

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
Anytime you have the thirst
for blood, I'll be here.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
Just say the word and
have your fill of me.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
No. Don't think about it!

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
[heartbeats]

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] His blood did
taste so very sweet.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
[panting] Tell me.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Hm?

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] You said there
were two conditions.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
What's the second one?

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:17.612 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, of course.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
You've been calling me
"human" since we met.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
From now on,

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
I want you to use my name.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Vanitas!

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE moans]

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Noé? It looks like they're back.

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
Yes. I just saw them.

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
What is it, Mon Chéri?
You look close to tears.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. It's just...

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
Ever since I first
found out about Jeanne

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
drinking Vanitas's blood,

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
I've been harboring this
agonizing feeling in my chest.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I've given a lot of
thought as to why that might be.

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
And this is what I found.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
I realized that...

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.132 position:50% align:center
...I was angry because
Jeanne got to taste it

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
before I could!

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
What?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
I secretly noticed a while
ago that Vanitas's blood

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
had a certain
appetizing aroma to it.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
If I had imagined something
like this would happen,

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
I would have tried to get
a taste of it sooner!

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
But Jeanne already marked
that high-quality blood source

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
to have all to herself!

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
Just imagine how
scrumptious it must be!

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE sighs] Oh, Noé.
You really are a rarity.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
What's with you?

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE growls]

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Domi, what are you doing?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Hush!
Don't you know men like you

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.835 position:50% align:center
deserve to be gnawed on
by women like me?

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
Hey! Stop it, that tickles!

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.927 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
You don't know how I feel.

00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ bites]

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I knew it.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
Your blood is so good.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
You're such a fool, Noé.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] This place really
comes to life after sunset.

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ] May I?
--[DOMINIQUE] Jeanne!

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.389 position:50% align:center
Come dance with me!

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
I can't resist teasing
him just a little bit.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.398 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
But, Mademoiselle Dominique.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50% align:center
Certainly you must know
of my reputation.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
If anyone were to see
you dancing out here

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
with a <i>bourreau</i>
such as myself...

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Have you no concern
of what damage

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
it could do to your good name?

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center
[sighs] My goodness,
what a sweet girl you are.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE] Acts of pleasure
must always come

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
first and foremost, before
all one's other passions.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
That's what my father would say.

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
So despite what it could mean

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
for any future pursuits,
I see a flower here now.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
And I plan to enjoy it
while I can.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you
haven't invited Jeanne

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
to dance with you yet.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Sadly, I am not
a very good dancer.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
And I simply couldn't
bear the thought

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
of accidentally
stepping on her foot.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Well, if you want
a lesson, I'm here.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I suppose we could try.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] Master Luca!
Is everything all right?

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
[LUCA]
No fair.

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
I can't wait till I grow up.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
Not bad.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
So you can dance, after all!

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.788 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I never said I couldn't.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.502 position:50% align:center
Vanitas,

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
would you permit me
to ask you a question?

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
All right, out with it, then.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
Can you please explain
to me what love is?

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
You obviously had
something on your mind,

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
so that ham-fisted invitation
to dance was just

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
so you could ask me some
ridiculous question about love?

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
And yet, whenever I see Jeanne,

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:42.580 position:50% align:center
my heart starts to race,
and I can't stop trembling.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
Call it what you will.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
I choose to define that
nebulous feeling as love.

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
Makes everything
more interesting.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
So a racing heartbeat
and a trembling body.

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
It sounds as if you've
come down with a cold.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
You're not wrong.

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
It is like catching a cold.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
Vanitas.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
What is it that you
like most about her?

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Hm... She's strong
and delicate at the same time.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
Awkward and beautiful
all at once.

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
She has an ample bosom.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
She's fun to tease.

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
And what else? Let's see.

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling that
she'll never love me in return.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
Huh? I don't understand.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
When you're in love
with someone,

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center
don't you want that
person to love you back?

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:59.366 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs]
No, that's not what I'm after.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:03.286 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Despite how
deeply I love Jeanne,

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
there's no need for
her to feel the same.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
It may sound absurd to you,
but I simply have

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:13.380 position:50% align:center
no interest at all
in the sort of person

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
who would harbor
affection for me.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] There's still so much
that I don't understand.

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Why? Why does my
heart flutter this way?

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
My ignorance abounds.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
--[VANITAS] Ow!
--[NOÉ] Oh, forgive me.

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] "Oh, forgive me."
Is that all you can say?

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
It wasn't on purpose.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Oh, Noé.

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
Visiting Lord Ruthven though
you know nothing about him

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
is a bit reckless.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Well, I do know that
he's a member of the Senate.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
He's far more than that!

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
Lord Ruthven is
incredibly influential!

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
He's a moderate who
helped bring an end

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
to the war between
vampires and humans.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
In other words,
he's known as a peacemaker.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
To this day, there are still
many who praise him as a hero.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
That's amazing!

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
And Master Lucius, you
probably don't know anything

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
about him either, do you?

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
Never mind.

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he would rather
tell you on his own, anyway.

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
Perhaps I had better go, too.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
You can't, Domi.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
There was that urgent summons
from the House of de Sade.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Noé.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
I swear, I had good intentions
when I brought you to Altus.

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
But then I ended up getting you
involved in such a ghastly mess.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
Please, Domi, don't apologize.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
You never fail to let me know
how much you care about me.

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center
And that makes me happy.
You need never be sorry.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:59.069 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
May we meet again, Mon Chéri.
