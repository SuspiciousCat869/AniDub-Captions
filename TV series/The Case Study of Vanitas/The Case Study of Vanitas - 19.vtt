[JEAN-JACQUES] There's no
happiness for me without you.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.397 position:50% align:center
Please don't go!

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
Stay. I'm begging you.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
Chloé.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.450 position:50% align:center
Please, you can't leave me
alone in this world!

[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Malnomen Millie,

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
theater of Ice and Snow.

[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Those who suffer this malady

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.908 position:50% align:center
are trapped in a secluded world,

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.870 position:50% align:center
a frozen land shaped
by their own memories.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.498 position:50% align:center
Forced to watch their
experiences play out

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.625 position:50% align:center
over and over again,

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50% align:center
their souls slowly
erode to nothing.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:31.299 position:50% align:center
This malnomen is
uniquely intractable.

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:34.052 position:50% align:center
An inverse operation alone
is not sufficient

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:37.180 position:50% align:center
to rectify it and
cure the afflicted.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.724 position:50% align:center
Unless the subject
rejects the icy prison

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:42.852 position:50% align:center
of their own volition,
there is no escape.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.979 position:50% align:center
They will remain
bound to that world

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:48.525 position:50% align:center
until they vanish along with it.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.735 position:50% align:center
Listen to me, Chloé!
You can vanish

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.447 position:50% align:center
with this wicked world of yours
or go back to your sad life!

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.782 position:50% align:center
Whatever you decide!

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.158 position:50% align:center

Even if you survive this,

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:01.371 position:50% align:center
your good name is
already long-destroyed!

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.873 position:50% align:center
The Church will refuse to
admit the mistake they made,

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50% align:center
and they will continue to hunt
you as the Beast of Gévaudan!

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
Vanitas!

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:12.048 position:50% align:center
Either way will be hell!
Even so, it's up to you!

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.596 position:50% align:center

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.392 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.854 position:50% align:center
All this is my fault.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.230 position:50% align:center
No!

[VANITAS]
Jeanne, hurry!

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.579 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] I would give anything
to turn back time now.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.167 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
If only I hadn't hesitated.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.170 position:50% align:center
I should've reached out
my hand and saved you then!

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Roland.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
It's only right that I warn you,

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
I may soon be forced to harm
one of your brethren.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
I take it you're referring

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
to the paladin Astolfo?

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
So, he's at the castle.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND] Astolfo's entire family
was killed by vampires.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Enough!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ gasps]

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
My apologies, then.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
I suppose I won't try to prevent
you from confronting him.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure why I brought
it up, but it needed

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
to be said at least once before
you make your decision, Noé.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
That poor boy...
He was far too kind.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
I swear! I'll kill you vampires!

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Each one of you!

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
He's injected more
than he can handle!

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
Please, Captain Astolfo!

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
Your body's gone
beyond its limit!

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
No! I can't dodge it!

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:38.713 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Now what?

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
Should I fall back?

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Don't hesitate.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
Do not attempt to find
some kind of justification

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center
for Astolfo's hatred.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
Humans and vampires.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
We all act upon our
own sense of justice.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
What's right for one man
is another's wrong.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
In your case,

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
your sense of justice
makes you stronger.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center
But don't let that righteous
anger turn to violent malice.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center
Keep that rage
flickering deep inside.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
Use it as a tool, a warm
candle to guide your path,

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
not a wildfire
burning unchecked.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
Eh...

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
In other words, don't
overthink it, okay, Noé?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50% align:center
Forget about what's
morally right.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
Just try to make a decision
you can live with.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
If you do that,
we'll be all right.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Here I go. I'm not turning back!

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center

[NOÉ] I want to save

No matter who stands
against me, I won't fail!

[MARCO]
Oh, dear! Young Master Astolfo!

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
All these years.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
I wanted to return
to being human.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
How could I not?

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
That was my father's dying wish.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
Father dedicated his life
to his research.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
He was desperate to restore
my humanity at any cost.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
I was so happy to know that.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
I saw his persistence as
an expression of love for me.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] But then I
realized it was a lie,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
I'd always been lonely,
even before that.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
After all, I wasn't human,
so I wasn't really myself.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
In the end, I was wrong
about everything.

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
The engine is at its limit!

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.406 position:50% align:center
Chloé's form can't be sustained!

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] No time for
an inverse operation!

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ] I wanted to be accepted
as my father's daughter

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
and as a member of
the d'Apchier family.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.170 position:50% align:center
It was such a simple wish.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES, JEANNE]
Chloé!

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
To be loved for who I am,

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
to be cared for and protected.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
It's up to you!

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center
Damn it! I have no choice!
Lend me your strength, Luna!

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful. So many stars.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
Ah, now I see.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
So, that was your
true name all along.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
Huh. The one called Canorus,

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
"she who makes music
with snow flowers."

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
What just happened?

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
It's warmer now.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
Snow.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
No, wait, these
are flower petals!

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
Can we assume it's all over?

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
Good work, you two.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
You did it.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.234 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] It hurts so much
worse than I thought!

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
Oh, god, it hurts so much
worse than I thought!

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
Here it is!

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
At least it didn't get left
in Forever Frozenville!

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, you don't look so good.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
I think I'm going to cry.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
I wonder if we can
put it back on again?

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
Probably?

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
After all, it's not like
it got burned to ashes.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
I'm not an expert,
though. Sorry.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.218 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Wait a minute,
where did all those

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
astérisque flowers come from?

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
They're said to bloom in areas

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
where the World Formula's
been tampered with.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.310 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you
don't know that.

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
Then again, maybe it's not true.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
I'm not an expert
on that, either.

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
How is that guy
still standing?

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
Wretched vampire.
I told you, your head is mine!

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
It's not over yet!

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
[ASTOLFO]
I'll slaughter you all!

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:48.667 position:50% align:center
[ROLAND]
Astolfo.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
I beg you. Sir Paladin, help us.

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Please do something
or my sister's going to die.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
There's not much time!

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
Save her life.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
I don't care what
might become of me!

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
If it hadn't been for me,
none of this would've happened!

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
All of it was my fault!

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
It's all right, Astolfo.

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
It's done. Come with me, my son.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
Young Master.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
Captain Astolfo, I'm so sorry.

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Chloé! Say something!

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
Are you hurt?

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.350 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear, please tell me
you're all right!

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
Answer me!

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES groans]

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
Ugh! You simpleton!

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:40.195 position:50% align:center
I never gave you my permission
to get injured so badly!

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
Did it never once occur to you
that you could've ended up dead?

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50% align:center
That I could've--?

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.076 position:50% align:center
I could say the same thing
about you, Chloé!

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
Planning your own death
without even telling me?

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
You could've at least considered
how that would've made me feel!

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
Show some respect!

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
How dare you talk back
to me in this way?!

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center
Curse you, Jean-Jacques,
I hate you!

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
Moron! Fool! Imbecile!

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ gasping]

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Chloé?

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:53.184 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
I've broken my promise.

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
Back when I decided
to exact my revenge.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
I vowed I'd never cry again.

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.027 position:50% align:center
But I'm a fool, aren't I?

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.779 position:50% align:center
The time I gazed up at
the sky with you, Jeanne.

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:07.115 position:50% align:center
I remember telling myself
that I'd be satisfied

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
with dying that very day.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
But I think...

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
...that my wish has
somehow changed.

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
What I really want
is to continue living!

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
[CHLOÉ]
I've been selfish and so unfair.

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
Oh, Chloé. What's
wrong with that?

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
I don't mind.

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
Both of us should
live. Together.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
If you are by my side,

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
I'm happy and I'll never
need anything else.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Vanitas.
Where is he?

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
It's really starting to spread.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
I am so cold.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Vanitas!

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Jeanne!
It seems you're all right!

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE] You saved her, Vanitas!
Thank you so much!

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
You were right, there was
a way for Chloé to survive!

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful!

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
Hold on there.

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
It's a little early
for celebrating.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
I have yet to figure out
what Lord Ruthven's

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
plotting, but I highly
doubt the Senate

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
would let Chloé d'Apchier be.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
And of course,
there's sure to be

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
some sort of punishment
for you, too.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
Don't you think that's
occurred to me?

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
But despite all that,
I'm still so happy!

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Okay.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
I can't help myself!

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:02.897 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Yes, I see.

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
Vanitas. You were there for me.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
If it hadn't been for your help,
then I would have...

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:17.370 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.884 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Wait, Jeanne!
What's gotten into you?

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
It's true.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
I did offer my blood
to you, but, Jeanne,

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
this is neither the time,
nor the place!

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Remember your promise, Vanitas.

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
The day may come
when I'm no longer myself,

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:29.275 position:50% align:center
when I've become
something else entirely.

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
If that ever happens,

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
you must take my
life, understand?

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Jeanne!

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
Listen, child.

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
We are all alone.

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
Whether human or vampire,
that one fact remains.

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
It's impossible to understand
another completely.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
In fact, many live
their entire lives

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
without ever
understanding themselves.

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
But, because that's true,

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
living things have always
sought companions

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
to share in their warmth.

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
My deepest hope for you,

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
is that some time after I
have departed this world,

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
you will find refuge
in the arms of someone,

00:19:56.738 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
just as we're embracing
each other now.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
In fact, there will
be such a one,

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
so long as your heart isn't
closed when they appear.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
If you open your heart.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
you'll never be lonely,
even when you're alone.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
As it is for me because
I have the two of you.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Vanitas!

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
Um, are you okay?

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS sobs]

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRE OF THE BLUE MOON]
You always complained

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
about the cold, my child,
but one day,

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
I know you'll have
someone to warm you.

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:50.959 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Are you sure about this?

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
[JEAN-JACQUES]
Yes. All I ever wanted

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
was to be strong enough
to protect my precious Chloé.

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
But if my having that power

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
is only going to harm her,
then I don't need it.

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
Because I realize that
I need to be enough.

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
That's how I can protect her!

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
If that's what you wish.

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
<i>Oui, d'accord.</i>

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
Your true name
is quite fitting for you.

[VANITAS] Aprix: "He who
nestles up to the last snows."

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] And so Gévaudan
was finally freed

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:56.024 position:50% align:center
of the Beast and its curse.

00:21:57.901 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center

and some were not.

[JOHANN]
There it is, that's it!

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:07.744 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] But the scars will
remain with us all.
