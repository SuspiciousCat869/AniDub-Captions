[JOHANN]
Riche!

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
--[RICHE] Johann! Dante!
--I'm so glad you're safe!

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Yup, there's
the quack. But who's that?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
[DANTE]
The Hellfire Witch?!

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.705 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
I'm prepared to let you live,

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
but only if you give me
<i>The Book of Vanitas</i> .

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.544 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] An order from
your little master Luca?

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.673 position:50% align:center
How disappointing.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.385 position:50% align:center
The young warrior maiden who
dashed across the battlefield,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
laying waste to countless
members of her own kind.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
The Vampire of the Blue Moon

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
said the beauty of it
made him shudder.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:03.355 position:50% align:center
But I never would have imagined
that you could've fallen so far.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
Do you have a point?

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center
My point is that I'm starting to
get tired of playing with you.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.071 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Oh, right.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
I've yet to introduce myself.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
I am called Vanitas!

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
The Vampire of the Blue Moon
left to me his name

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:23.291 position:50% align:center
as well as his famed grimoire.
Yet, I am but a human!

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.672 position:50% align:center
That same vampire once
feasted upon my blood.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.966 position:50% align:center
And so, I was counted among
the Clan of the Blue Moon,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.761 position:50% align:center
and that power is now mine!

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.763 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE gasps]

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.556 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I was hoping
I wouldn't have to unleash

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.059 position:50% align:center
my worst on you, but...

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.936 position:50% align:center
There's no choice left.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.813 position:50% align:center
I shall make an exception.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.857 position:50% align:center
I shall reveal my true
form to you, witch!

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What devilry is this?

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.205 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.970 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
I should have guessed.

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:20.140 position:50% align:center
After all, it takes a monster
to fight a monster!

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
[DANTE] Letting go of the book
was only a bluff, then.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
He was trying to buy some
time until Thomas Berneux

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
was free of his paralysis.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50% align:center
So, he used a curse-bearer as a
mere chess piece, and then...?

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
Gut-punched a woman
without even so much

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
as a moment's
hesitation? Yeah.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What a jerk.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE grunts]

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
I can't move a muscle.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just stay put
for a while, o fallen witch?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
Now, as for our
nine-fold murderer.

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
I know who you are.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
You take the form of a wolf
and haunt moonlit nights,

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
seeking the life-blood
of young women.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
Your malnomen is "wolf who
hunts crimson," Loup-Garou.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
Now then.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
I shall restore your true name!

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
So that's your name.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
"He who composes
idylls: Bucolicus."

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center
--Astounding.
--[JOHANN] Ooh!

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
[mocking] "Ooh."

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50% align:center
Agh! That's right!

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
I forgot, the whole point
of this was to cure him

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.210 position:50% align:center
in front of Orlok, wasn't it?

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
[MANET]
Not to worry.

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
We'll tell him everything.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
After this night, he will
know of the book's power.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
[armor clanking]

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.556 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE grunts]

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
What in all creation?

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
I paralyzed you,
and the Loup-Garou poison

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
should yet remain!

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
I'm not done!

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. I will
keep on fighting!

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Noé, bring him out!

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
[LUCA muffled grunting]

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50% align:center
Master Luca!

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
Well, Hellfire Witch?

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
Do you understand
the mess you're in?

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
If you make one false move,

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.429 position:50% align:center
my associate will happily
snap the child in two,

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
without a moment's hesitation!

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
Did I say "jerk"?
'Cause I meant "sociopath."

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:41.443 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] I can't hear a word
they're saying from over here.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Kidnap the kid? But what for?

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] While you keep
Little Lord Fancy Hat

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
from interfering
with the action,

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
I'll use <i>The Book of Vanitas</i>
to create a field

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
that incapacitates vampires.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
Then, I can reason
with the witch.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.043 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Really? You can do that?

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Indeed. But such power

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.298 position:50% align:center
can take a massive toll
on a child's body.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
You'll have to hold
him back from the area.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Oh, and cover his mouth like
it's a real hostage deal!

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
Keep your distance,
but don't stray too far.

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
I do want the boy to bear
witness to our little parley.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
Think you can handle that?

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.565 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] He says he can stop the
Hellfire Witch without a fight,

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
and I'm inclined to believe it!

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
After him!

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
Please, don't, sir!
I beg of you!

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
I shall hinder you no further.
And now that you've defeated me,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
you can do with me as you
see fit. Just one thing.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.839 position:50% align:center
Please. I ask that
you spare my Master!

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
I beg you, sir!

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS laughs]

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I knew the child
must be your weakness!

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
Where have those
tears come from?

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
You're acting so feeble!

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
Such softness can only signify
a deep need to protect.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
But... I like it.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
Huh?

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I take back
what I said, Hellfire Witch.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
It's true that you've
grown weak, but somehow,

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
that weakness makes you appear

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
all the more
beautiful in my eyes.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
What? My strength is gone!

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
My sweet witch. My Jeanne.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.773 position:50% align:center
I find myself hopelessly
enraptured with you.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[LUCA] Uh...

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE pants]

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] Hm... That look only
makes me want you even more.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] How magnificent!
You are a marvel, Jeanne!

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
What is this strange
pounding in my chest?

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] You're intoxicating.
I can't take my eyes off you!

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
And now I wish to witness
every facet of your being!

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
[JEANNE]
U-Uh...

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
<i>Mais non! C'est ne pas possiblé!</i>

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
This must be...

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
<i>Amour!</i>

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50% align:center
I have fallen for you, Jeanne!

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:55.220 position:50% align:center
I swear that I shall adore you
for the rest of my days!

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
Please make me the
happiest man on earth.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
Only say that you will
be my blushing bride!

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
[LUCA] What are you doing to my
Jeanne, you insolent scoundrel?

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
You step away from her, now!

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Uh-oh.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.530 position:50% align:center
Master!

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.657 position:50% align:center
[LUCA growling]

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
We'll have to fall
back this time.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
But remember this!

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center
Our paths will cross again, and
when they do, I will kill you!

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
Ah! So I'll get to see
your lovely face again?

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
I hope it's soon, <i>ma cher</i> !

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
Unhand me, Jeanne, that madman
deserves to die for his words!

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
Let me at him!

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
Master, please calm yourself!

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center

[VANITAS laughs]

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Looks like things are finally

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
about to get interesting, Noé!

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:01.995 position:50% align:center
About to? I'm still stuck
on the first few things.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
He's been killed.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
Who do you think
could've done it?

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
[NAENIA]
And after I went to the trouble

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
of corrupting his
name so nicely.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
No matter.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:32.275 position:50% align:center
Now, whose name
shall I tarnish next?

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center
Gather 'round, everyone!

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
The delightful Parade of
Charlatan is about to begin!

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
Mademoiselle!

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
You've returned!

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
--[NOÉ laughing]
--[AMELIA squealing]

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
Satisfied now?

00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not as though
I believe every word

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
of your nonsense, but
I'm willing to postpone

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.601 position:50% align:center
the young lady's execution
for the time being, at least.

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
Still, she must remain where
I can keep a close eye on her.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
I will arrange her
employment as a live-in maid

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
at Hôtel Chouchou.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
I'll be watching you, as well!

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Hm?

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
I will admit, this
dubious book of yours

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
has some power, but still--

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
I have no intention of
letting you do as you please!

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
So, you heard Berneux was dead.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] And you haven't
the foggiest idea

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
who killed him, have you?

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
But, what you have learned
from all this is that

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
my little book and I can be
very useful, isn't that right?

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
Fine, then. Use me
as you see fit.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
You'll be able to
swiftly take care

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
of any incidents
involving curse-bearers.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
And I won't be forced
to spend precious time

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
locating new patients.

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
Give this to the front
desk at Hôtel Chouchou.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
I'd like you gentlemen
to continue to use

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
your quarters there for the
duration of your stay in Paris.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
You'd "like"? Or we must?

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second.
Do you mean both of us?

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
Well, certainly!

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
I assumed you were that human's
"caretaker," isn't that right?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
No, it isn't!

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
Exactly! If anything, it's more
like I'm his caretaker!

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.805 position:50% align:center
Would you please just
stop saying things?

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Now...

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
I'm going to cut
right to the chase.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
Amelia?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA]
Yes?

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
Tell me. Did you see Charlatan?

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:41.154 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Charlatan?

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS] I've learned
something interesting

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
from some of the
vampires I've treated.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
You see, in the moments
before they realized

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
they had become curse-bearers,
they all witnessed

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
a very similar phenomenon.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
They suddenly found
themselves in a thick fog.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
And there, they witnessed
the Parade of Charlatan.

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
A thick fog? And a parade?

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
It sounds familiar.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center
Part of me feels like
I may have seen it, but I...

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I just
can't remember!

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
No dice, eh?

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
[ORLOK] Why don't you take
a look, Noé Archiviste?

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] You know who I am?
I never told you.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
[ORLOK] I received a letter
from your teacher.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
[ORLOK] He mentioned your name
and humbly requested

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
that I provide assistance
with everyday affairs

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
during your stay in Paris.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
An Archiviste.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
The Fangs That Lay Bare Blood.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Well, Noé?

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
Would you like
to drink my blood?

00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
There's no need to fear.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
Even if you choose to drink it,

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
you've seen all of me
there is to see.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
[MANET]
Hey, Sis, what's Archiviste?

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
It's an ancient vampire clan.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.708 position:50% align:center
They were able to
read people's memories

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
by drinking their blood.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.421 position:50% align:center
But I heard that they all
died out a long time ago.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
Monsieur, if there's
a way for you

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
to examine my memories,
then I think it would

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.553 position:50% align:center
only be proper of me
to let you try it.

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
I want to help.

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you'll learn
something useful!

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
If you insist.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center

Monsieur. <i>Pardonnez moi--</i>

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
I must look deeper.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
To lay bare that memory--

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
the one that even
she's forgotten.

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
There. I think I've found it!

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
What is this place? How strange.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center
I thought I was just
on my way home.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center

What an accursed thing!

If I let it catch me,
I'm done for!

[AMELIA panting]

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center

There you are.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
Now, I want you to reveal
your true name to me!

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
[AMELIA, NOÉ] I'll be defiled!
I'll be destroyed!

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
My life will be--!

Monsieur!

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
What did you see?

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
So that's what it was like.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
Her true name was stolen,

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
and that wretched thing
is the one who took it!

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
[panting] I saw it--
I saw Charlatan.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure
whether it was real.

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
But that was the
thing that corrupted

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
Mademoiselle Amelia's
name. I know it was.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.887 position:50% align:center
And if that dark being
really is creating

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50% align:center
all those curse-bearers,
then mark my words, it will pay!

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE giggles]

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
I have heard the tale

[GROUP]
Uh--

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
Noé! I bid thee bonjour!

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
How I've missed my dear fiancé!

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
Who?!

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
Pardon?

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
That is not true.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
Come on now!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
You could've let them wonder
for a minute or two! [laughs]

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
This is Dominique de Sade.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
We're not betrothed, she's
just my childhood friend.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
That machine on the floor
is her attendant, Kreisler.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
An automated bed of roses!
Where do I get one?

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center
Hello there, Murr!
I've missed you, as well!

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Dominique de Sade.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
She's a daughter of
the Marquis de Sade,

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.695 position:50% align:center
a Lord of the other world.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:17.032 position:50% align:center
Didn't realize you had friends
among the upper crust, Noé.

00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
Well yes, her grandfather
happens to be my teacher.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:21.161 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
Ah, Count Orlok.

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
Do forgive me for barging in
without proper warning.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That's quite all right.

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
The House of de Sade was
well known for rudeness

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
long before your generation.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
Great, I suppose if
I'm already being rude.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
I'm just gonna borrow
Noé for a short while.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
Wait, Domi, where are you
dragging me off to now? Domi!

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
I have received an invite
to a <i>bal masque</i> ,

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
and I would like
you to escort me.

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ] Why me? Can't
you take someone else?

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIQUE]
I was worried about you!

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
Lord Ruthven's going
to be there tonight.

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
According to rumor,
he's been conducting

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
some independent
research on the subject

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
of curse-bearers of late.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
You were discussing
Charlatan, yes?

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you'll learn more
about that, as well.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
[NOÉ]
The barrier.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:34.109 position:50% align:center
They say it's the product of
an experiment gone wrong.

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
A spatial distortion linking
this realm to Altus,

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
the world of vampires.

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.240 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
Noé!

Hah!

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
Have you completely
lost your mind?!

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
Humans aren't supposed
to cross the barr--!

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.810 position:50% align:center
Oh, this isn't my first
time visiting Altus.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
I discovered a while back
that I can cross over

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
as long as I'm
touching a vampire.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
And, look here.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
You've got quite a tight
grip on my wrist, Noé.

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
So you see, here we are.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center
Noé.

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
We'd better get on our
way, or we'll be late.

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
Now, why did you
follow us here, human?

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
[VANITAS]
Because it was painfully obvious

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
you wanted to separate
Noé from me.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
Well, you've got that right.

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:40.050 position:50% align:center
You are an interesting
one, aren't you?

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:02.781 position:50% align:center
Sheesh, you're just amazed
by everything, aren't you?

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
Funny.

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
As often as I come,
it's always the same.

00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:10.497 position:50% align:center
Altus Paris.
