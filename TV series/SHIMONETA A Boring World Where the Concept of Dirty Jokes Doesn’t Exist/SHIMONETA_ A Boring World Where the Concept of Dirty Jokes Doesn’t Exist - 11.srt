Watch out!

What was that?

[COP A]
Blue Snow's out of the bus!

[COP B]
Get her!

00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,333
[TANUKICHI]
Kosuri, no. Don't do this to us.

10
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,541
[KOSURI]
Cram it, "Big Brother."

11
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,083
I'm done with you
limp-noodle clowns.

12
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,500
There'll be consequences if
you don't get out of my sight.

13
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,666
Now. Get off.

14
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,708
[TANUKICHI]
Stupid traitor!

15
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,166
[COP C]
That's Blue Snow's accomplice!

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,375
[COP D]
Get him!

17
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,583
[COP E]
Freeze, creep!

18
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,958
[WHITE PEAK] Thanks for
the assist. I owe you.

19
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,333
[KOSURI]
Oh, don't worry about it!

20
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:56,250
I'm just happy to be a
part of Gathered Fabric.

21
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,166
[KOSURI] The Decency Squad's got
their hands full chasing SOX,

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,916
and we've still
got all our guns.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,916
This is our chance
to change the world.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,625
Let the Revolution begin.

25
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,291
[chuckles]

26
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,750
[WHITE PEAK] Yes. Let's
take this bus for a spin.

27
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,750
Next stop: Zoshigaoka Academy!

28
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:19,083
Well, it'll work out somehow.

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,875
Guess I'm in the clear for now.

30
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,041
But still, how am I gonna
get home dressed like this?

31
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,041
[HYOKA]
Good evening, Mister Okuma.

32
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,166
What the hell are you doing,
Fuwa? Why're you in the bushes?

33
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,208
The Decency Squad
stationed me out here

34
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,958
to spy on any hijacked
buses that drove past.

35
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,375
Oh, right.

36
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,958
Ayame said you were
helping determine

37
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,916
which of Gathered
Fabric's guns are fake.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,125
That's the current
state of affairs.

39
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,000
But I'd hoped things would go
better than they have been

40
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,541
and I'd be home now.

41
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,458
The situation's grown more dire.

42
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,041
Than it already is?

43
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,291
I take it then your wanderings

44
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,416
have kept you from
seeing the news.

45
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,666
[ANCHOR A] The terror of this
morning's Gathered Fabric-led

46
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,958
bus hijackings continues
deep into the night.

47
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,875
The terrorist group has
re-routed the 39 captured buses

48
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,583
to the prestigious
Zoshigaoka Academy.

49
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,541
Decency Squad sources tell
us that Gathered Fabric...

50
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,083
Fuwa, I can't stay here.

51
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,291
I gotta find Ayame now!

52
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,666
[SQUAD BOSS C] Has Gathered
Fabric issued any new demands?

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,000
[UNDERLING A]
Yes.

54
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,208
They're demanding food and
drink for their hostages

55
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,833
as well as a massive
shipment of new panties.

56
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,541
[SQUAD BOSS C]
New Panties? That's odd.

57
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:48,166
Isn't the group's M.O. normally
about stealing used panties?

58
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,041
[UNDERLING A]
Wait, sir.

59
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,875
They've just sent an image.

60
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:51,750
My god.

61
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,125
What's wrong?

62
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,166
"If you don't meet our
demands for the new panties,

63
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,458
we'll take pictures of our
hostages wearing panties

64
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,291
on their heads and send them
through the PM network."

65
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,958
How vile! Most of those students
have promising futures!

66
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,083
[SQUAD BOSS A]
Uh!

67
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,291
If they want bushels
of new panties...

68
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,291
Oh, god, I hope I'm wrong.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,083
[TERRORIST A] Just take them
off and put them in the basket,

70
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,500
then take one of the brand new
pairs provided and put them on.

71
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,208
[TERRORIST A] We'll be
back in about three hours

72
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,541
to collect those.

73
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,625
So make sure you stink
'em up real good, ladies!

74
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,416
[STUDENT C]
This is so humiliating.

75
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,541
[STUDENT B] Yeah, they're
not even bikini cut.

76
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,750
[breathing heavily]

77
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,875
Hurry and put them on! Oh!

78
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,416
Please stop doing that.

79
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,416
Can you just put on
your own fresh panties,

80
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,208
and leave me alone?

81
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,583
[OTOME]
Oh, god. Yes!

82
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,166
They're so cold!

83
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,958
[OTOME]
Why does this excite me so much?

84
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:49,666
Huh?

85
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,833
No, my sweet pencil!

86
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,416
[TANUKICHI]
Sorry, Kajo.

87
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,916
I'm moving through
town as fast as I can,

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,458
but it's hard dressed like this.

89
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,416
[AYAME] Oh, I get it.
I'm in the same boat.

90
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,833
[TANUKICHI]
Hear about Kosuri?

91
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,375
[AYAME] Yes, I know.
But did you see the news?

92
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,583
Yeah.

93
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,541
I'm worried this may
be checkmate for SOX.

94
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,291
[AYAME] The hostage
thing will resolve itself

95
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,916
sooner rather than later.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,541
The real question is
what happens after that.

97
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,416
The media will still
report that this incident

98
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,666
was supported by SOX.

99
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
We're guilty by association.

100
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, and it gets worse.

101
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,250
With Kosuri in custody,
the career of her father,

102
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,458
Keisuke Onigashira,
will be ruined.

103
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,791
And when that happens,

104
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,333
all the erotic terror
groups he backs will fall.

105
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,583
The whole country's gonna
think we're violent criminals.

106
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,125
They'll use it as
an excuse for why

107
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,958
we need the X Prohibition Law.

108
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,500
[TANUKICHI] But come on, there
has to be something we can do.

109
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,750
[AYAME]
In a perfect world,

110
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,708
we would storm the
Academy ourselves

111
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,041
and take down Gathered Fabric
before the Decency Squad does.

112
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,208
Great! Then let's meet
up and attack them!

113
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,208
I would, but SOX doesn't
have the manpower.

114
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,750
There're 39 of them.

115
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,916
And now they're probably armed

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
with Kosuri's air
guns and stun guns.

117
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,083
Thanks to Gathered Fabric, the
Decency Squad finally has us

118
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,958
right where they
always wanted us.

119
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,083
Desperate and powerless.

120
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:14,208
This reminds me of something
my dad once said.

121
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,208
"No matter how hard you try,
it's impossible to defeat a fool

122
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,125
who's certain of his
own righteousness."

123
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,416
[HYOKA] I disagree with
that so-called wisdom.

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,833
[TANUKICHI]
Fuwa!

125
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,125
[HYOKA] I have proof what
your father said is wrong.

126
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,458
Because fools end
up getting drunk

127
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,125
on their own righteousness.

128
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,458
Then fall into a
form of insanity.

129
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,166
I know someone like this.

130
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,083
Wait, do you mean?

131
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,500
Yes. I mean Anna Nishikinomiya.

132
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,208
She has been
brainwashed to the point

133
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,416
that she would do anything

134
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
as long as she believed
it to be righteous.

135
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,958
If you told her it was
the right thing to do,

136
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,916
she would even commit murder.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,166
And she'd do it with
a smile on her face.

138
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,375
A person who thinks like that

139
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,041
will never see victory
in the long run.

140
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,083
Anna's failure is inevitable.

141
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,666
[TANUKICHI]
She's so far gone.

142
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,625
Or is she?

143
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,833
Hold on a sec.

144
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,416
[HYOKA]
Uh?

145
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,791
[AYAME]
What is it, Tanukichi.

146
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,666
[TANUKICHI]
I have an idea.

147
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,958
One that can bring hope
to our hopeless situation.

148
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,208
Sure, there's a good chance
it'll be a miserable failure,

149
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,791
and it's incredibly humiliating
the more I think about it,

150
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,541
but still.

151
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,375
I... will defile myself.

152
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,458
[HYOKA]
Don't worry about it.

153
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,875
We've already seen
you defiled repeatedly.

154
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,916
In yaoi manga with Raiki.

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,416
In the latest one, he gives
your rear input a real workout.

156
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,875
Kajo, I have a proposal.

157
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,416
[KOSURI]
This is so cool.

158
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,583
You've done more in one day
than SOX has in a whole year.

159
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,000
Mister Peak?

160
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,333
I have some ideas for what
the next scheme should be.

161
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,750
[WHITE PEAK]
Next scheme?

162
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,250
We'll use the hostages as
leverage to escape Japan,

163
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,791
go overseas and win allies,

164
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,958
and then return and liberate
the country from the prudes.

165
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,583
[WHITE PEAK]
Are you actually so foolish

166
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,875
you believe we can
accomplish all of that?

[TERRORIST A]
Commander White Peak.

169
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,750
We present you with the day's
second White Offering!

170
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,041
Good, I've been waiting. Savior!

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,416

172
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:17,541
Oh, yes! What an
intoxicating aroma that is.

173
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:23,083
[KOSURI] So, um, Mister White
Peak, sir, as I was saying.

174
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:28,041
Yes, what? What's so important
that you interrupt my rolling?

175
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,375
[KOSURI] Well, if we stay here,
it's only a matter of time

176
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,041
before the Decency
Squad catches us.

177
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,000
True. And that's why I'm
going to enjoy every last

178
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,458
musky undergarment that
this paradise has to offer.

179
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,375
What about the
revolution you promised?

180
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,458
[WHITE PEAK]
That was mere sophistry.

181
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,708
Escape from the country?
A guerrilla war?

182
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't you see that those
efforts would be pointless?

183
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,625
Nothing would change.

184
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,791
You should be embarrassed
by your foolishness.

185
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,333
You're a loser,
White Peak! A fraud!

186
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,541
And I'm gonna feed you something

187
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,375
other than your
precious panties!

188

How... did you?

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,583
[WHITE PEAK]
Silly little girl.

192
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,583
When an electrical weapon
hits a wet target,

193
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,333
the shock only travels around
the outside of the object.

194
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,833
And, since my body is wrapped in
these beautiful white panties,

195
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,625
soaked with wine, I'm simply
too moist to be shocked.

196
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,833
I... I can't...

[SQUAD BOSS C]
Status report!

199
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
[SQUAD UNDERLING A] Things seem
to have calmed down, for now.

200
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,416
We just carried in the third
delivery of meals and underwear.

201
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,083
Our analysis shows that their
weapons are non-lethal.

202
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,791
They simply don't have the
strength to defend the Academy.

203
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,458
Then we shall attack at once.

204
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,625
[MATSUKAGE]
No. It's too soon.

[SQUAD BOSS C]
Matsukage? Sophia!

206
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,333
Why do you suggest we hold off?

207
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,625
[MATSUKAGE] Crushing them
now would be too easy.

208
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,458
And the hostages aren't
in any immediate danger.

209
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,125
But no one else knows that.

210
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,291
Let White Peak play
devil for the public.

211
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,000
"Play Devil"?

212
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,583
The longer this
panty farce goes on,

213
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,333
the more freakish they seem.

214
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,958
And the more the public
will support our cause.

215
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,416
Passage of the X
Prohibition Law.

216
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,083
That's right,

217
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,583
just like what happened with
Zenjuro Okuma ten years ago.

218
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,333
[TANUKICHI] According to
the blueprints Kosuri made,

219
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,833
there's a secret entrance
to the Zoshigaoka campus

220
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,333
via the mountains
directly behind it.

221
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,666
Yeah, that's perfect.

222
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,833
We use that entrance
and slip past the media,

the Decency Squad,
and Gathered Fabric,

224

and right into the
school's juicy bits!

Kajo, now's not
the time for that!

226
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,541
The hard part is finding where
they've locked up the hostages.

227
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,083
And finding Takuma Ichinose
and our former friend, Kosuri.

Yep!

232
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,625
I tricked White Peak's goons

233
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,333
by drawing some good
old-fashioned healthy pictures.

[TERRORIST B]
Hmph.

235

the hostages on the third floor.

236
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,375
And I'm pretty sure
I overheard them say

237
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,500
that all panty deliveries
are to go to White Peak

238
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,125
in the school
principal's office.

Comrades, let me know
when you're set to attack,

help you from the inside.

tell us Gathered Fabric...

A dangerous pervert's holding
half our student body hostage

265

are still M.I.A.

When you're depressed
about life,

nothing beats thinking of
Mister Okuma in the shower

and letting your
Love Nectar flow.

Yup.

This is my risky,
dirty plan in action.

manpower from the establishment.

the manly scent of Mister Okuma?

to become a dirty joke.

Why? Because our society
scorns their very existence,

and calls them "evil"
and "unnatural."

to exist and be heard.

And I have a right
to aspire to be one.

of contemporary society,

everything we erotic

we'll become no different

of making jokes at all

469
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,333
if they have to be clean?

470
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,166
Jokes appeal to us because
they can be so wrong.

471
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,250
Jokes get us excited
because we don't know

472
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,875
how people will react to them.

473
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,500
It's because they're
devilish they can seduce us.

474
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,666
Because they're twisted
they can make us laugh.

475
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,875
I became the devil
because I believe

476
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,958
that laughing at what's sick
can make society healthy.

477
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:59,791
To destroy this boring world
where dirty jokes do not exist!

478
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,083
Now, go fuck yourselves!

479
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,458
Heh. I didn't think our society

480
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,416
could still produce
someone with real guts.

481
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,958
Darling, what're you saying?

482
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,250
[UNDERLING A gasps]
What is that thing?!

483
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,500
[AYAME]
Ta-ta! Bye-bye! Dick-dick!

484
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,458
Didn't think we'd tie up all
the loose ends that quickly,

485
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,333
but here we are!

486
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,208
What's wrong?

487
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,458
Nothing. Just surprised is all.

488
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,666
That speech was the most
serious you've ever been.

489
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,875
[AYAME]
How rude!

490
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,583
Everything I've told
you since the day we met

491
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,583
has been deadly serious!

492
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,583
But I admit, I can also be
stubborn and single-minded.

493
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,208
And I'm glad that you're not.

494
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,458
I'm mean it.

495
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,458
Thank you for being
you, Tanukichi.

496
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,833
[TANUKICHI]
Why are you saying this?

497
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,541
[AYAME]
You're a fully realized person,

498
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,291
and when your soul's
laid bare, buck naked...

499
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,291
...you can be twisted and fun.

500
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,541
It's like you're a dirty joke.

501
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,833
I am?

502
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,500
And I love you
as much as balls.

503
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,333
[TANUKICHI]
Um... Kajo?

504
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,375
[AYAME]
What?

505
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,291
Who is this guy you love?

506
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,250
I don't see him like you do.

507
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,958
You can't decide that based
only on what someone else says.

508
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,416
At the end of the day,
who you are's up to you.

509
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,083
The choice must
come from within.

510
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,958
You know, if your
head was a pussy,

511
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,375
and my finger was a Johnson,

512
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,333
I just gave you three orgasms
with only three pokes.

513
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,791
We're perverts in love!

514
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,041
Perverts in love!

515
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,125
Kajo, there's no
one better than you

516
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,666
at making a tender moment
really disgusting.

517
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,625
Got that right. Well, let's go!

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,916
[AYAME laughing]

519
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,750
So, everything's over. Why're
you still hanging out with us?

520
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,833
Oh, I told you I was sorry!

521
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,791
Please don't look at me like I'm
an extra, superfluous nipple.

522
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,291
Love you. Love.

523
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,666
All right, that's enough.
You're weirding me out.

524
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,125
Do you have to
suck up so much?

525
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,541
[KOSURI]
Of course.

526
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,750
To make up for turning traitor,
I will be Ayame's slave.

527
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,458
I'm gonna be on her like
glue until one of us dies!

528
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,583
[beeping]

529
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,166
Hello? What's up?
Is something wrong?

530
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,000
What'd you say?

531
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,958
