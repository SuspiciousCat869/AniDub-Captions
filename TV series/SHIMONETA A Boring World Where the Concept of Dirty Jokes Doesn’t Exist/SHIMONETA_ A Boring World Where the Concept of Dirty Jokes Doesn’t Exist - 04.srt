1
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,333
[AYAME] Can you believe
you ended up in the hospital

2
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,208
after defending the honor
of the girl you love?

3
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,291
That's basically the situation
every boy dreams of.

4
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,583
"The only way I can thank
you for saving my life

5
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,375
is to bend over and
let you take a bite

6
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,208
out of my tight, round apple.

7
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,875
There's one big seed
deep in that fruit

8
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,916
that I need you to get
out with your tongue."

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,333
[RAIKI]
There.

10
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,625
Spread out just for you.

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,125
I like Home Ec.

12

[NARRATOR]
The future. Japan.

13
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,708
For decades, "The Law for
Public Order and Morals

14
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,000
in Healthy Child-Raising"
has banned all sexual content.

15
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,625
This law against libidinous
language, in combination

16
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,791
with the Peacemaker
surveillance technology,

17
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,666
has turned what used
to be an island nation

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,541
of anything-goes sexual
deviancy into the country

19
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:01,125
with the healthiest
public morality on Earth.

20
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,916
But, among the douched masses,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,833
are subversives who would dare
oppose this brave new world

22
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,125
free of naughty thoughts.

23
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,458
This is the story of
these sick miscreants!

24
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,375
[AYAME]
Cock and balls!

25
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,000
[HYOKA] I believe an apple
was the forbidden fruit

26
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,583
that tempted Adam and Eve,

27
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,791
although technically the Bible's
vague on this exact detail. Oof!

28
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,458
What? Hyoka! Why're you here!

29
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,208
A strange question.

30
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,708
To see how you're recuperating,
isn't that obvious?

31
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,083
Then why not come through
the door like a normal person?

32
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,583
I'm afraid that's an
entrance I can't come in.

33
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,750
All the hospitals, labs,
and lab supply houses

34
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,375
in the tri-prefecture area
have blacklisted me.

35
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,750
Wait, so it's not just
the gynecologists?

36
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,041
I had to give you this.

37
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,291
What is it?

38
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,750
A special present.

39
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,666
I trust that he'll live a
long life under your care.

40
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,000
But I'm perplexed.

41
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,791
I thought Mister Goriki
was of the belief

42
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,750
you were lower than pond scum.

43
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,666
But now he's cutting your fruit
into delicate bite-sized pieces.

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,250
It's quite unusual.

45
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,333
Side question:

46
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,000
Can babies be created by one man

47
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,166
thrusting his meat pickle into
another man's exhaust passage?

48
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,041
Why would you ask me something
like that while I'm eating?

49
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,416
[HYOKA]
I have my reasons.

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,833
Goriki's new
feelings towards you

51
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,625
have me questioning
all my assumptions

52
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:51,500
about what constitutes "normal"
bodymelding. I'm very confused.

53
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,541
Well, it's not
about meat pickles.

54
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,208
Since I saved Anna
from those stalkers,

55
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,625
he's just finally realized
I'm on his side, is all.

56
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,166
[HYOKA] We'll return to the
question of man love later.

57
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,625
For now, I'd like
to focus on waiting

58
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,166
for the council
President to arrive,

59
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,208
so that I may discuss with her
a most pertinent matter.

60
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,250
[TANUKICHI groans]

61
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,291
Have I struck a nerve?

62
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,833
[TANUKICHI]
Anna doesn't come here.

63
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,666
She hasn't even visited me once.

64
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,875
How rude.

65
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,708
What about a "Thank You" card?

66
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,333
You were injured
protecting her honor.

67
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,250
[TANUKICHI]
Even though it was an accident,

68
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,333
I'm pretty sure she's mad
at me for kissing her.

69
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,041
The only explanation
I can think of

70
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,708
is that she hates
you, Tanukichi.

71
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,625
Stop it! Stop shoving
reality in my face!

72
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,291
Wait, did you say you also came
here hoping to find Anna?

73
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,166
Yes.

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,583
The Student Council's crackdown

75
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,666
on inappropriate culture
has ratcheted up in intensity.

76
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,708
Unlawful detentions.
Surprise locker inspections.

77
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,583
Teacher-administered
body cavity searches.

78
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,250
You're positive this is
all on Anna's orders?

79
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,916
Anna's entire life
has been driven

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,250
by a burning desire to suppress
all forms of lewdness.

81
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,416
But this is the first time

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,125
I've ever observed her
to be so forceful.

83
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,500
That's why I was hoping to
intercept and probe her here

84
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,708
to learn why this desire's
grown even hotter, lately.

85
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,125
Smut in the school. Takes
more than that to stop me.

86
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,125
[OTOME breathing heavily]

87
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,166
I went ahead and told
Saotome the truth about me.

88
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,125
It really got her
juices flowing.

89
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,958
I'm surprised she's
come around so quickly.

90
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,166
It wasn't long ago she
was trying to kill you.

91
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,666
[AYAME]
I know! Now we're best buds.

92
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,166
Saving Anna must've
made her realize

93
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,708
that we're on the same side.

94
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,916
But, wait, if you've got her
drawing dirty pictures for you

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,333
while she's wearing her PM,
won't she get arrested?

96
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,916
[AYAME] The PM bracelets only
track hand movements.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,666
There are other ways the girl
can hold a shaft, Tanukichi.

98
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,000
She could draw with her feet,

99
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,833
or she could just stick
the pencil up her hoo-ha.

100
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
How far are you
gonna have her go!

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,541
Well, that's pretty advanced
stuff and will take some time.

102
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,500
For now, I'm getting her
up to speed on the basics,

103
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,458
hopefully learning about
sex will snap her out of

104
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,500
her creative slump, molding
her into the dirtiest artist

105
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,791
the world's ever
rubbed it out to!

106
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:56,583

I am only able to draw things
I see before my own eyes!

Show me a real example
of physical love!

112
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,166
[TANUKICHI] Anna never came
to visit me even once.

113
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,000
Come on, it's not so bad.

114
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,625
After all, I have come
here to visit you.

115
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,416
But I thought you
were bringing Ayame.

116
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,916
Ayame says she's
booked this afternoon.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Something about having to meet
with another terror group

118
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,416
to do some networking.

119
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,250
SOX isn't the only terror group?

120
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:33,125
So it would seem. That's all I
really know about the subject.

121
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,333
Is it just me or are
you actually happy?

122
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,916
Yes, it's because
I'm getting close

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,916
to breaking out of
my creative slump!

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,708
So, I guess being around
Ayame's paying off, huh?

125
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,333
No, I owe it all to Anna.

126
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,375
Wait, Anna?

127
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,875
That's right.

128
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,291
Anna insisted I come up with
some way she could thank me.

129
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,583
So in our spare time,

130
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,583
I have been drawing full
body sketches of her

in various erotic poses!

132

Wait a second, detailed
full body sketches?

133

Oh my god, is the reason
Anna never came to visit me

136
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,791
because you've had her tied up
in some twisted art dungeon?

137
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,750
That's not why.

138
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:12,000
Out of curiosity, I did ask
her why she hasn't come.

139
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,041
Anna, are you sure you need not
visit Okuma in the hospital?

140
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,458
I shall not.

141
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,791
[OTOME] I'd never seen
such a cold-blooded look

142
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,166
on her face before.

143
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,833
It gave me goose bumps.

144
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,750
She hates me now.

145
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,541
My sweet angel won't forgive
me for that one mistaken kiss.

Anna's alpha-lady
gravitas on full display

really enlivened my pen!

00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,916
Then, when I factor in
all of the dirty knowledge

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,250
that Ayame has bestowed upon me,

151
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,583
I get the sensation that
a huge creative gusher

[TANUKICHI] She hasn't said
a word since I got back.

158
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,416
She won't even look at me.

159
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I was right. She thinks
I'm a total creep.

160
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,208
[RAIKI]
Hey, Okuma.

161
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,833
Tanukichi!

162
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,583
What's up?

163
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,166
You okay? Ya seem tired.

164
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,916
You just got back.
Go home and rest up.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,666
We need you to be
strong and firm.

166
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,791
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

167
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,708
Ayame never made it to
school today, did she?

168
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,250
[RAIKI]
No.

169
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,708
She said she had to take off
for a couple important errands.

170
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,166
As if what we do isn't
important. The nerve.

171
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,416
[BOTH gasp]

172
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,458
[TANUKICHI]
And the avoiding continues.

173
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,541
[gasps]

174
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,708
Who's there?

175
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,458
[beeping]

176
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,125
[AYAME]
Throbbing news, Tanukichi.

177
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,625
--Yeah, what is it?
--[AYAME] It's too big

178
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,000
to tell you on the phone.
Gotta tell it to you in person.

179
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,833
So put your lotion away,
pull up your pants,

180
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,416
and meet at the coffee shop
in 20, 'kay? Cock-suck!

181
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,791
Hey, wait!

182
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,541
[AYAME] Tanukichi! Hey, Buddy,
glad you're feeling better!

183
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,875
I'm feeling great!

184
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,916
I'm as excited as a
middle age house-wife

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,041
sitting on a washing machine
during the spin cycle!

186
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,791
All right. I get it.

187
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,500
What's wrong, Tanukichi?
Why so flaccid?

188
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,625
He's probably depressed because
Anna's been ignoring him.

189
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,958
Tanukichi, is it possible
you did something to her

190
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,000
when you had her on the ground?
Maybe you unknowingly

191
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,125
twiddled her nips or pressed
your crotch against hers?

192
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,958
Of course not!

193
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,250
Just tell me what's so important
I have to come to the diner

194
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,666
in the middle of the night.

195
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,625
So grand is my surprise,
it shall make your dick rise!

196
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,125
[TANUKICHI] Can't you just talk
like a normal human being?

197
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,375
Behold!

198
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,125
I've learned of a secret
deep in Yatsuga Forest.

199
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,916
A treasure trove of
erotic literature,

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,250
featuring sex scenes so
hardcore, you won't be able to

201
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,791
get up from the couch
because you'll be stuck to it!

202
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,125
Seriously?

203
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,791
I thought the government
had destroyed

204
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,041
all of the unhealthy media that
included scenes of docking.

205
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,250
This erotica is so old,

206
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,666
it falls into kind of
a legal "gray area."

207
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,875
There's every genre, from
romance to rough stuff,

208
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,541
school girls to MILFS,
small boobs to big boobs,

209
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,375
S and M, anal, handjobs,
homoeroticism,

210
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,041
hermaphrodites, tentacle play.

211
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,000
It's a treasure trove
of perversions!

212
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,375
Okay, let's says you
find this porn gusher,

213
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,791
drill it dry and cart it off.

214
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,750
Won't the Decency
Squad find out?

215
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,458
And if the stash is
as big as you say,

216
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,875
how can you be sure they haven't
already found it and burned it?

217
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:22,791
[chuckles]

218
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,083
All good points,

219
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,875
but this case has a few
special circumstances.

220
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,708
And those would be...?

221
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,083
[AYAME] Yatsuga Forest, my
friends, is private property.

222
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,125
Years ago, it was owned by
the author, Danroku Onigashira

223
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,250
He got rich off
vampire bondage stories.

224
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,541
Anyway, he accidentally
starved to death

225
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,000
in his real life sex dungeon,

226
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,625
so now it's in a trust,
run by his grandson, Keisuke,

227
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,000
who recently found his
grandpa's original will.

228
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,708
This will laid out
specific instructions

229
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,833
for the erotica collection,

230
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,750
which Keisuke was
happy to follow.

231
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,291
These included using the books

232
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,583
to supply the various dirty
joke terrorist organizations.

233
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,833
By now, Keisuke should've
divided the smut evenly

234
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,541
between all the
different groups.

235
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,541
But somehow, word of this
got out to the government,

236
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,375
and when they came
tromping onto the property,

237
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,791
Keisuke had to scramble.

238
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,333
He made up some story

239
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,541
about the land being a private
sanctuary for a rare plant.

240
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,250
"If you trample the
forest's undergrowth,

241
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,958
you'll ruin the matsutake
mushroom harvest this fall."

242
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,416
Such a clever man.

243
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,666
My ears are bleeding.

244
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,541
Know what I'd say
if it was me, though?

245
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,833
"If you steal my porn,

246
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,041
my crotch-mushrooms
will shrivel up and die!"

247
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,333
That's snappier, right?

248
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,458
Yeah, if you wanted
to get arrested!

249
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,166
Back to the story, the search
is delayed three weeks.

250
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,375
In the meantime, the
Decency Squad's beefed up

251
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,750
their surveillance
of the Forest

252
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,250
to the point a single sperm
couldn't get in there.

253
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,416
So, what does all
of that mean for us?

254
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,333
It means in three
weeks we go to war!

255
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,125
In three weeks the forest
will be free from tyranny!

256
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,166
Now if he opts to give up the
stash, obviously we won't go in.

257
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,666
But if he doesn't,

258
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,541
then you're going in the same
time as the decency squad.

259
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,291
That's right. And
terror groups like SOX

260
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,375
are no match for the
government on our own.

261
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,333
We're outnumbered. They'd
easily round us up for arrest.

262
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,875
And those of us
with prior records

263
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,541
will receive severe sentences.

264
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,541
But there's a... but!

265
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,375
[BOTH]
Uh?

266
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,791
What if there were students,

267
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,458
with no experience in joke
terrorism, virgins, okay?

268
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,833
But virgins who nevertheless
had an interest in the craft

269
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,375
of dirty jokes and thoughts.

270
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,625
And what if they were to storm
the forest in such numbers,

271
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,041
they overwhelmed the Decency
Squad three weeks from today,

272
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,375
and they recovered the
erotic books instead.

273
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,416
Unless I'm mishearing
things, it sounds like

274
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,625
you wanna use innocent Tokioka
students as cannon fodder.

275
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Stop the clock, Ayame.

276
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,041
We can't do that.

277
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,708
I think we can.

278
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,250
But first, we need
to light the fuses

279
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,541
of their subconscious
curiosity for adventure.

280
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,791
For the next three weeks,
we'll convince the school

281
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,958
there's treasure to be
found in Yatsuga Forest!

282
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,958
Uh?

283
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,333
[AYAME] So, were you
able to hide that stack

284
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,000
of Yatsuga Forest
maps around school?

285
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,666
Has the seed been planted in
their fertile minds, Tanukichi?

286
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,791
[TANUKICHI]
Um. Well, no.

287
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,583
And why not? I better not
find them in a dumpster.

288
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,958
I ordered you to
get them out there

289
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,375
before Anna's mom's
big speech today.

290
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,708
Yeah, I know, but...

291
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,083
I don't think it's a good idea

292
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,541
for me to be sneaking
around like that right now.

293
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,583
[AYAME]
Hm?

294
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,916
All these letters.

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,208
So I guess this means
you have a stalker, too.

296
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,875
Here's the most recent one
I found on my desk this morning.

297
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,166
[gasps]

298
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,666
What is this?

299
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,958
Makes Anna's stalkers look
like old-fashioned romantics.

300
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:22,875
So gross.

301
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,500
So what do I do?

302
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,375
Since the creep factor on
this is through the roof,

303
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,791
I'd lay low.

304
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,166
Besides, the Decency Squad
will be here soon anyway.

305
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,291
[TANUKICHI] What's with
all the armed guards?

306
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,166
[AYAME] Sophia's speech
isn't just for us.

307
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,458
It's being simulcast to
educators around the country

308
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,125
at all the top-ranked
morality schools.

309
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,208
[applause]

310
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,625
So that's Sophia
Nishikinomiya, huh?

311
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,125
Anna's mom.

312
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,708
Japan likes to boast

313
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,000
that we are the undisputed
worldwide leader

314
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,208
in public health and
morally clean living.

315
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,791
But is that really true?

316
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,625
What if the Law for Public
Morals and Healthy Child-Raising

317
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,958
was not nearly as
effective as we all think?

318
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,375
You kids remain
psychologically immature.

319
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,750
More than ever,
your heads are filled

320
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,541
with dirty thoughts
and bad language

321
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,583
that leave you unable to control
your emotions and actions.

322
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,541
We adults have a duty
to guide you all

323
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,750
to a higher moral ground.

324
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,083
That is why I'm here today

325
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,708
to advocate the passing
of the X Prohibition Law,

326
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,666
so that you will not falter
on your path to adulthood.

327
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,833
And if you do, we can
set you straight.

328
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,750
If our X Prohibition
becomes law,

329
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,708
I promise all of you
will be given new PMs!

330
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,208
[gasps]

331
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,791
Wearing these new models will
be mandatory at all times.

332
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,583
For male and female
students alike.

333
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,458
I know change can be difficult,

334
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,541
but the X Prohibition Law has
your best interests at heart.

335
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,875
So if you can recognize
that and voice your support,

336
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,000
the bill can become law
and start saving lives

337
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,416
that much faster.

338
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,833
I can't stress enough your
importance in this process

339
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,625
as independent minds.

340
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,041
In fact, our original plan
was to convince you all

341
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,541
to sign a petition of
approval here today.

342
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,791
But there's been a
change in those plans.

343
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,791
You'll now have the next
few days to debate it

344
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,208
and then sign it on Sunday.

345
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,458
[gasps]

346
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,791
Thank you for your help
in cleaning up Japan.

347
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,125
[TANUKICHI]
Those new PMs, they're just...

348
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,541
[AYAME]
Chastity belts.

349
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,541
Now do you finally get
how dangerous this law is?

350
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:20,125
And of all the times. This
is a huge monkey wrench.

351
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,791
It's like she knows our exact
plans for the forest.

352
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,583
What, how so?

353
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,791
Weren't you listening? 

354
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,208
She wants the students
to sign the petition

355
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,500
on this coming Sunday.

356
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,000
Ten o'clock, right?

357
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,166
Yes, the exact same time
the cordon will be lifted

358
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,000
from Yatsuga Forest.

359
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,458
[gasps]

360
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,666
[WAITER]
What'll it be?

361
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,500
Coffee. Green tea.
And some soda water.

362
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,666
Soda water?
Who drinks that stuff?

363
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,541
I request a tall
orange juice, please!

364
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,916
I know you're angry,

365
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,833
but I think you need
to calm down a little.

366
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,375
Our classmates are nothing
but well-behaved robots.

367
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,208
Now there's no way we'll get
'em to turn their backs

368
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,333
on a morality campaign
and charge into the woods

369
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,125
looking for
panty-soaking erotica.

370
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,083
This move might as well be
checkmate on our struggle.

371
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,708
Our only chance is to get some
erotic pictures out there ASAP

372
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,208
to get the kids'
shorts steamin'.

373
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,541
But, of course, Saotome
can't get in the mood.

374
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,875
You jerk!

375
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,208
It's not just mood, it's
about doing it hands-free!

376
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,291
Could Da Vinci have painted a
naked Mona Lisa with his feet?

377
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:28,791
[AYAME] Tanukichi, I'm ordering
you to take one for the team.

378
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,833
Oh. This is way nicer
than I've been imagining.

379
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,666
Seems like the perfect spot
to break my creative slump.

380
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,333
Yeah, well just so you know...

381
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,666
What?

382
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,166
I won't be doing any
"docking" with this stalker.

383
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,541
Saotome, we'll sneak you
into Tanukichi's apartment,

384
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,000
past the landlord and
you'll hide in the closet.

385
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,166
Whatever for?

386
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,125
So you can witness
a real live sex scene.

387
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,583
What're you talking about?

388
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,416
[AYAME] I want you to hang
this on your apartment door.

389
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,833
Help her awaken the
dirty artist deep inside!

390
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,666
If you close your eyes,
I bet you'll barely feel it!

391
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,416
Just the tip should be
enough. Just the tip!

392
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,666
Yes, tip would be good!

393
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,541
Knock it off, you two!

394
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,000
[TANUKICHI]
All right,

395
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,875
if all she needs is to see
someone get sexually aroused

396
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,750
this shouldn't be
too hard to pull off.

[sighs]

398
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,666
I can draw from inside the
closet. Just try to forget

399
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,375
that I am here and do
whatever you have to.

400
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,250
Be sure to summon me for meals.

know what's come over me.

I've never felt this way before!

414
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,708
The blindfold's because
I'm too embarrassed

to look you in the eye.

with another student's body.

I thought I was doing the right
thing. The morally clean thing.

458
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,000
So, why do I feel
embarrassed by it?

459
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,625
Perhaps this is why
mother and father

00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,708
have only given me the
briefest of explanations

happiness and embarrassment.

I'm really in no condition
to see anyone right now!

468
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,791
[shrieks]

469
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,541
[TANUKICHI]
What the hell is this?

470
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,500
[screams]

471
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,375
I'm back! I have
the will to thrill!

472
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:10,208
And if it wasn't for watching
Anna, I'd have never found it!

473
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,458
Must-draw-smut, must-draw-smut,
must-draw-smut! Ah!

474
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,625
I forgot about these!
Curse these infernal PMs!

475
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,916
[gasps]

476
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,666
[OTOME]
If I can't use my hands,

477
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,083
it's mouth time!

478
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,833
It's working! This is what
I've been waiting for!

479
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,041
Seeing the steamy filth
of human passion in person

480
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,791
has changed my life!

481
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,250
[screaming]

482
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,791
Look away, look away, look
away, look away, look away!

483
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,250
[TANUKICHI, AYAME screaming]

484
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:46,541
[ANNA panting]

485
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,500
[HYOKA] Finally, we can have
a nice chat in private.

486
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,625
[ANNA] What? I don't
think we've ever met.

487
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,166
I'm sorry, that's my fault.

488
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,833
I'm the President
of the Science Club

489
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,541
whose lab was ransacked
today without any notice.

490
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,750
My name is Hyoka Fuwa.

491
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:34,833
[ANNA]
Hm?

492
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,166
I'd like to know.

493
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,416
Why did you approve a
recent escalated crackdown

494
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,208
on the students of this school?

495
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,166
I assure you, if I've become
more severe in my governance,

496
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,250
It's only to attain a
stronger kind of love.

497
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,916
Oh! Just admitting
it makes me blush!

498
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,625
Huh? What love?

499
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,791
Ah, you're confused.

500
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,500
As long as all our
actions in life

501
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,458
are morally straight and pure,
it becomes that much easier

502
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,708
for us to be loved
and accepted by others.

503
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,166
For example,

504
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,291
say you achieve success in
the classroom, or in sports.

505
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,875
One can then draw
lessons from this

506
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,333
that help acquire manners,
civility, and virtue.

507
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,708
But above all other lessons,

508
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,375
we must master
the self-discipline

509
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,666
to shun the temptations
that are most lewd.

510
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,916
So what you're saying is,

511
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,125
you're attempting to
clean up school morality

512
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,208
because you think it'll
help someone fall for you.

513
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,541
[ANNA]
Yes, that's it!

514
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,375
My adorable pet flies are dead.

515
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,458
and they have only your quest
for moral purity to blame.

516
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,708
Killing pets is neither
virtuous, nor clean.

517
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,625
But you can't look
at it that way!

518
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,791
Any action that suppresses
"toilet culture"

519
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,500
is by definition right.

520
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,958
Besides! As the saying goes,
"Love is justice."

521
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,083
In other words, any action borne
out of love is fair and just.

522
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,583
So, the more just I am,

523
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,833
the more my chances improve
for that beautiful boy

524
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,375
to fall head over heels
in love with me!

525
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,250
