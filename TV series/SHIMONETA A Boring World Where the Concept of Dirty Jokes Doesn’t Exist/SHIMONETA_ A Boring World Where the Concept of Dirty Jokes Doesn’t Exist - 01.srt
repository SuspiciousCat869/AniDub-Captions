question to ask you.

00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,958
Can you please tell me
where babies come from

You've got the same

like our entire society does.

Scientifically speaking,

145
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,541
the concept of love is far too
vague and difficult to define

146
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,083
to serve as a reliable
biological mechanism.

It's my goal to discover the
true means of reproduction,

outside the gynecology clinic.

to tell me what
happened to them.

What had caused a baby
to grow inside them?

You don't say.

158
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,375
What is this girl's problem?

159
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,416
I don't know how to answer her.

160
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,291
I know you're an outsider,
you're not like the rest of us.

161
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,791
You know the real truth.

162
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,000
So I need you to tell me,
please, in the name of science,

163
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,958
and if a verbal
explanation's too difficult,

164
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,916
I'll accept a demonstration.

165
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,666
[AYAME]
Tanukichi Okuma, right?

166
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,750
My name is Ayame Kajo.
This is my second year.

167
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,291
Actually, I'm the Vice President
of the Student Council.

168
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,916
Whoa, you are?

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,416
We've nominated you to serve as
an intern for general affairs.

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,333
Would you be so kind as to
accompany me to our meeting?

171
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:19,916
[TANUKICHI gasps]

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,083
Of course!

173
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,958
[HYOKA] May I ask
one thing before you go?

174
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,416
[TANUKICHI yelps]

175
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,083
[HYOKA] My theory is that
peni--oops, that was close.

176
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,416
I'll use euphemisms.

177
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,083
I believe a man's cucumber
is key to conception.

178
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,625
Can you confirm that?

179
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,875
[ANNA] It's wonderful
to meet you, Tanukichi.

180
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,416
I'm Anna,

181
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,333
and as you may have gathered
from the assembly, I'm a Year 2.

182
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,375
[TANUKICHI]
Right.

183
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,666
As President of
the Student Council,

184
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,541
let me first say
how overjoyed we are

185
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,458
to finally have
you standing here.

186
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,375
We've been looking forward
to you joining the school

187
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,916
for a long time.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,250
Speak for yourself, I wasn't
looking forward to this at all.

189
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,416
[TANUKICHI] Hey! What the
heck are you doing here?!

190
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,250
Don't swear at
an upperclassman.

191
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,041
I'm Raiki Goriki, Year 3.
I'm The Secretary-Treasurer.

192
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,958
Anyway, now that we're
done with introductions,

193
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,583
I'd like to get down to
the real business. That okay?

194
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,916
[TANUKICHI]
Uh, yeah, sure!

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,583
[ANNA] Are you willing
to accept your nomination

196
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,083
as intern of
the Student Council,

197
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,583
and help protect public
morality at this school?

198
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,166
Of course, I'll do anything.
Thank you for the chance.

199
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,708
Wow, you're eager.

200
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,791
But why did you guys pick me?

201
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,916
The school I came from ranks
dead last in public morality.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,833
That's the reason we chose you.

203
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,458
We're facing a crisis.

204
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,000
And we believe you're
perfectly suited to handle it.

205
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,583
[TANUKICHI]
Huh?

206
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,916
What I'm about to share with you
is highly confidential, okay?

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,791
[TANUKICHI]
Sure. I won't tell a soul.

208
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,125
For years this city
has enjoyed its status

209
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,625
as the purest in the nation,

210
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,166
but recently a masked terrorist
known as "Blue Snow"

211
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,250
has been spreading toxic
words and imagery,

212
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,416
causing public morality
to nosedive.

213
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,583
Unfortunately, I think I got
a taste of that this morning.

214
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,208
And it's hard for me to even say
this, but to make things worse,

215
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,375
we believe it's very likely
the masked terrorist

216
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,083
is actually a student
at this school.

217
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,166
[TANUKICHI]
Uh?!

218
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,125
Tokioka's whole
reputation is at stake.

219
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,000
We have to hurry and
get rid of this terrorist

220
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,708
before the public finds out.

221
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,458
But, as desperately as we
want to save the school,

222
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,041
it seems that I and the rest
of the council can't spot her,

223
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,708
because we know so
little about perversion

224
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,333
that we don't even
recognize it when we see it.

225
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,333
I've witnessed an attack.
I was right next to her.

226
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,875
But I didn't know she
was spreading filth

227
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,958
because I don't
know what filth is.

228
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,333
I knew Anna's heart was pure,

229
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,333
but I didn't know
it was this pure!

230
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,750
Mister Okuma!

231
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,000
Spending years at that
morally low-performing school

232
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,000
means you have a subconscious
grasp of vulgarity

233
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,333
and perversion that we lack!

234
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,541
Join our fight and save
our school, our city,

235
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,958
and probably mankind!

236
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,000
[TANUKICHI]
I came to this school

237
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,875
because I admire you, Anna.

238
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,541
I wanted to be as close to you,

239
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,708
as close to greatness,
as possible!

240
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,041
I want to become more like you,
so I can be proud of myself!

241
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,333
I would be honored
to accept this mission!

242
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,000
That's your cue, Ayame.

243
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,375
Would you please
tell Mister Okuma

244
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,250
everything he needs to know?

245
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,541
So, uh...

246
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,041
Why here?

247
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,958
[AYAME] This place doesn't
get many customers right now,

248
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,000
so we can talk about anything.

249
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,666
I have to admit, "Mister Okuma,"
your acting was brilliant.

250
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,916
[TANUKICHI]
What?

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,916
She totally bought your
heroic little speech!

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,375
Just as I thought,

253
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,083
you're a boy who knows how
to squeeze out the bullshit!

254
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,666
Oh wow, ejaculating on my face
after four seconds of talking,

255
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,250
you really are eager!
Now I'm soaking wet!

256
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,041
[TANUKICHI] What's with
all the naughty language?

257
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,291
Who talks like that?

258
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,125
[TANUKICHI screams]

259
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,125
It's you!

260
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,541
[AYAME]
That's right!

261
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,291
Blue Snow, the dirty joke
terrorist, AKA Ayame Kajo.

262
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,916
Nice to meet screw!

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, hello, Decency Squad?

264
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,000
Hey, what are you doing? Stop!

265
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,208
[WAITER]
So, are you ready to order?

266
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,625
Ah! Help, this
girl's a terrorist!

267
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,875
I'm well aware of that.
Can I start you with a drink?

268
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,500
[TANUKICHI]
Uh, green tea?

269
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,375
[AYAME] Wait, so that line
about you enrolling at Tokioka

270
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,708
because you admire Anna
was actually true?

271
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,458
[TANUKICHI] Yes, for
the millionth time, yes!

272
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,625
[AYAME]
But that's crazy.

273
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,291
Isn't your father Zenjuro Okuma,

274
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,583
the notorious dirty
joke terrorist?

275
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm nothing like my father!

276
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,500
Meeting Anna has changed me
completely! I'm a new man!

277
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,666
[AYAME chuckles]

278
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,958
[TANUKICHI growls]

279
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,125
[laughing]

280
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,833
Well that's too bad
for you, Cowboy,

281
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,458
because now that
you've unmasked me,

282
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,166
I can't possibly let you escape!

283
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,166
What are you talking about?!
You unmasked yourself!

284
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,833
[TANUKICHI] Hey, this
isn't funny! Untie me, now!

285
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,458
I promised Anna I'd fight
for public morality!

286
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,666
Yeah, I know.

287
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,458
But let me extend an
alternate invitation.

288
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,375
Help me establish a dirty joke
terrorist organization,

289
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,750
called SOX.

290
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,708
Instead of upholding the law,
we'll tear it down.

291
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,458
[TANUKICHI] Are you out of
your mind?! I'll die before

292
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,750
I sink that low!

293
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,000
Why are you so against the idea?

294
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,458
Is it the name "SOX"?
Not catchy enough?

295
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,000
You're missing the point, Dummy!

296
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,041
I think it's a great name.

297
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,208
Look!

298
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,000
The "O" looks just
like a butt hole!

299
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,000
So what?

300
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,833
My god, you're a
stick in the mud.

301
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,125
You've got a totally amazing
name like Tanukichi,

302
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,041
but it's a waste because you've
let society domesticate you.

303
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,625
Leave my name out
of this, Weirdo!

304
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,791
Guess I need to explain Japan's
historical take on testicles,

305
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,750
so you can appreciate
the name you were given.

306
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,750
No thank you!

307
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,375
[AYAME]
Enlarging a man's nutsack

308
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,500
is the rare power
of the "tanuki,"

309
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,291
a creature from
Japanese folklore

310
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,000
unlike any other in the world.

311
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,083
You should be proud!

312
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,166
Proud of that?!

313
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,500
[AYAME]
Oh yes.

314
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,458
With a name like yours,
I can only imagine

315
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,416
the size of the twin boys
you're lugging around.

316
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,666
Don't flatter me.

317
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,666
I won't join you just
'cause you kiss my bum!

318
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,791
Analingus?

319
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,125
Not what I meant!

320
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,125
You set me up for dirty
jokes without even trying!

321
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,666
You and I are a perfect fit!

322
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,750
Like two things that fit
together in a funny way!

323
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,041
You set me up for dirty
jokes without even trying!

324
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,666
You and I are a perfect fit!

325
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,458
--Like a fist in the brown-eye!
--If you don't think of a joke

326
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,375
the first time,
you can't have a do-over!

327
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,625
How do you get away with
saying all this stuff, anyway?

328
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,416
The answer to that is simple.

329
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,958
It's because I have this.

330
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,500
Whoa, a flip phone? I can't
believe they still make those.

331
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,958
When I punch in the secret code,

332
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,250
it neutralizes surveillance,
so while the phone's open,

333
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,791
our PM monitors
will stop working

334
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,375
for up to three minutes a day.

335
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,041
Today I've got 50 more
seconds of invincible!

336
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,458
Well, don't get cocky!

337
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,000
[AYAME]
This was used to fight against

338
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,250
the Law for Public Order and
Morals in Healthy Child-Raising.

339
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,291
It's the only effective
weapon that my father,

340
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,458
Masashi Endo, left me.

341
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,833
By the way, I love
to slurp cock-tails

342
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,375
if ya' know what I'm sayin'.

343
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,333
Stop it! Wait,
Masashi Endo?

344
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,916
Yes.

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,666
The man jailed ten years ago for
shtupping a high school girl,

346
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,083
prematurely ending
his political career.

347
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,000
But in fact, my
father was innocent.

348
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,791
The PMs had some thugs frame him

349
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,708
so he'd no longer be
a threat to their power.

350
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,250
So you really trust your father?

351
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,333
And you're sure
he wasn't guilty?

352
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,250
Yes. I'm sure.

353
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,708
Daddy preferred GMILFs.

354
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,041
What kind of dad tells
his daughter that?!

355
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,083
He gave me the phone the
day they took him away.

356
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,916
Remember, Dear, your love
of dirty jokes is normal.

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,208
Use this phone to live
out your dirty dreams,

358
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,125
I just hope three minutes
a day is enough.

359
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,791
That's so messed up!

360
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,750
In normal life, people
think I'm a sour puss,

361
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,750
but that's just because
I can't shout "sour pussy"

362
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,083
at the top of my lungs while
making in-out hand gestures

363
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,583
like my soul yearns to do.

364
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,125
So that's why you're playing
as the terrorist Blue Snow?

365
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,708
[AYAME] Guess so.
I can't change who I am.

366
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,125
So, I decided to change
the world instead.

367
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,041
Well, I do have other reasons
for being Blue Snow,

368
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,583
but you're not ready
to hear those yet.

369
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,625
I'll ask you one last time.

370
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,416
Will you join me
in founding SOX?

371
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,833
When pigs fly!

372
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,291
[AYAME]
Suit yourself.

373
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,375
Then I'll just have to turn
you into the Decency Squad

374
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,458
as a sex offender.

375
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,625
[TANUKICHI]
Uh?!

376
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,916
This is the rope you
escaped with today.

377
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,791
I'm sure their lab would easily
find your skin cells on it

378
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,458
and nab you for
touching that woman.

379
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,750
But you'd be stupid to turn me
in 'cause I'd obviously tell

380
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,625
the Decency Squad
you're Blue Snow!

381
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,000
Nice try, Tanukichi,

382
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,833
but you've got two
great big reasons

383
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,291
not to rat me out to the cops.

384
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,708
Just like you've got...
those two great big testicles.

385
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,041
You really think it
was worth opening

386
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,125
your phone for that lame joke?

387
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,458
[AYAME]
Reason number one:

388
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,916
If I'm exposed as a
dirty joke terrorist,

389
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,541
it'll reflect terribly on Anna
and the Student Council.

390
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,041
[gasps] Oh no.

391
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,625
[AYAME] And reason two:
I'm Anna's bestie.

392
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,875
If she finds out she's been
trading lunch and braiding hair

393
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,125
with Blue Snow, the shock'll
probably kill her.

394
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,458
Her bestie?

395
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,625
Wait a second, who says
you're Anna's best friend?

396
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,916
I say it with this mouth!

397
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,583
Well, yeah, you only
have one mouth!

398
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,333
Hello, girls have four mouths!

399
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,541
[TANUKICHI gasps]

400
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,000
How'd she get four?

401
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,541
Mouth, hole and hole, then what?
Is she counting her nose?

402
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,625
Cooperate with me and I promise
you and Anna won't get hurt.

403
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,666
Like I said, Anna's my bestie.

404
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,583
So if you play your cards
right and help me out,

405
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,541
then I can help you
in your quest for love.

406
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,083
Wait, what? Who's on
a quest for love?

407
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,041
I don't have any unhealthy
feelings for Anna,

408
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,958
if that's what you mean.
It's purely respect.

409
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,000
There's nothing unhealthy
about love, you know,

410
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,750
or the burning desire to rub
your body all up on hers.

411
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,166
Those are pure and
natural feelings

412
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,333
and they used to make
the world go round.

413
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,416
[AYAME] Well, you don't have
to believe me right away.

414
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,791
For now,

415
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,666
just build a beautiful world
of dirty jokes with me,

416
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,875
and the rest will come in time.

417
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,958
Man...

418
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:01,083
This is seriously messed up!

419
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,833
Where... am I?

420
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,166
It's about about time you
woke up, Mister Okuma.

421
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,750
We're in the school's
chemistry lab.

422
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,333
I had a pressing question for
you, so I invited you here.

423
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,500
You call that an invite?

424
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,625
Are all the girls in
this school into rope?

425
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,666
[HYOKA]
Take a look in this box.

426
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,958
What's in there?

427
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,291
[HYOKA]
My pet flies.

428
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,125
They are currently melding
their bodies together.

429
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,250
I recently discovered that just
before a female fly lays eggs,

430
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,541
she joins her lower body with
the lower body of a male fly.

431
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,833
I hypothesize this
"bodymelding" is central

432
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,000
to fly reproduction and a
similar phenomenon must happen

433
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,750
between a human male and female.

434
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,375
And so my question is,
what do you think about that?

435
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,958
[TANUKICHI chukles nervously]

436
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,458
Well, we don't fly or crawl on
poopie, so I doubt it relates!

437
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,500
See ya!

438
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,791
[STUDENT F]
Hey, did you hear?

439
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,000
Word is, if you wear a girl's
undergarments, your pe--

440
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,416
I mean your tricky
stick falls off.

441
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,958
Whoa, seriously?

442
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,291
Because I heard wearing a girl's
underthings makes you grow,

443
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,708
um, shmammary glands.

444
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,833
[STUDENT H]
Guys!

445
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,333
Did you know if a
girl lifts weights,

446
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,625
her hair-down-there
turns into a boy pickle?

447
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,458
[STUDENT I] Oh, come on,
that doesn't seem credible.

448
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,625
That's silly.

449
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,416
Obviously if a girl
grows a boy pickle,

450
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,750
it's a mutation of her
rhymes-with-flitoris.

451
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,666
That's definitely
not the point here!

452
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,291
Now will you please untie me?

453
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,791
[AYAME] You're right,
the point is now you see.

454
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,416
This is the true
nature of Tokioka,

455
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,375
the most moral school in Japan.

456
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,041
Everyone constantly gossips
about forbidden topics

457
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,375
using code words
the PMs can't detect.

458
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,958
But it's all ignorant bunk

459
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,708
because they've been
sheltered from the truth.

460
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,958
[TANUKICHI]
I'll admit that.

461
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,875
[AYAME] No matter how
many hotties I pass out,

462
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,291
they still won't get it,

463
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,541
'cause we're missing
the most important part:

464
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,291
The old docking maneuver.

465
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,625
Yeah, but come on,

466
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,791
even before the Law for
Public Order and Morals

467
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,916
in Healthy Child-Raising,
you still couldn't show the act.

468
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,291
Let's not get off course here,

469
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,291
the point is,
as founding members of SOX,

470
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,958
it's our duty to educate the
ignorant masses of this school

471
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,791
about what "docking"
actually is.

472
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,958
Well, if you want help,

473
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,333
why don't you ask
that Hyoka Fuwa girl?

474
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,083
She's all about the birds
and the bees, and the flies.

475
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,250
No way!

476
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,208
That chick is full-blown
crazy in the head.

477
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,833
Says the terrorist.

478
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,791
Well, it is crazy to keep
a box of "bodymelding" flies

479
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,791
in the school lab.

480
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,500
Wait, what?

481
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,041
That's perfect!

482
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,708
This weekend's school assembly
is getting dirty terrorized!

483
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,666
[AYAME laughing]

484
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,166
Are we actually doing this?

485
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,500
Of course we are, Champ!

486
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,958
Just remember to put
on your game face!

487
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,166
I know, sorry, I haven't
worn those that pair yet.

488
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,041
That is not what
I'm upset about!

489
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,250
All right! Our
rebellion has begun!

490
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,541
Now it's time to say
goodbye to this boring world

491
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,500
where dirty jokes don't exist!

492
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:01,291
From this day onward,
things get titillating!

493
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,875
[WHITE SUIT] Today, we have
a very important announcement.

494
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,833
Next month, we kick
off our campaign

495
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,416
to collect signatures for
the approval of the new,

496
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,791
more stringent ban we're
calling, "X Prohibition."

497
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,500
[STUDENT J]
A picture of a woman?

498
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,750
She isn't wearing much.
What is this for?

499
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,708
Um, I feel kinda weird.

500
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,583
I feel... warm and tingly.

501
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,583
Stop looking! Stop!

502
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,250
Please stay calm, teachers,
we have to think!

503
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,500
[ANNA]
This is a diversion.

504
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,416
Blue Snow must have
another target.

505
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,541
--[phone ringing]
--[gasps]

506
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,541
[AYAME] Anna, Blue Snow
is outside, on the track.

507
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,791
I knew it!

508
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,666
Mister Goriki! Teachers!
Come on, let's go!

509
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,458
[AYAME] Foreplay's over.
Time to go all the way.

510
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,083
Don't let them
catch you, Tanukichi!

511
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,250
[AYAME moans]

512
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,458
We can't! You're a rebel
who wears leather,

513
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:05,500
and I'm a good little rich girl
at the top of my class!

514
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,125
But look how wet you are.

515
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,416
I know you want me,
and my bad boy 'tude.

516
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,416
Oh! Yes, yes I do!

517
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,041
Thrust your shlong
into my lovemound

518
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,583
like there's no tomorrow!

519
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,708
Here I go...

520
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,708
What is this?

521
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,666
[AYAME]
Oh, yeah!

522
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,916
[AYAME moaning]

523
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,375
Oh, wow! It's so good!
Oh my god, oh my god!

524
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,958
[STUDENT K] What's happening
to my bathing suit area?

525
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,208
[STUDENT D]
I'm warm and I don't know why!

526
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,000
[STUDENT L, N]
What's happening to my body?

527
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,041
[AYAME]
Damn! That's it! Harder!

528
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,750
[STUDENT F]
What is this feeling?

529
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,833
I'm so hot!

530
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,750
[STUDENT M]
Me too! What is that?!

531
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,500
[CHANTERS]
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

532
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,791
[STUDENTS yelling]

533
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:54,666
[AYAME gasps]

534
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,666
Shoot your hot spunk inside me!

535
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,750
[STUDENTS yelling]

536
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,083
[TANUKICHI] I'm deceiving
the girl I admire most.

537
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,083
So why is my heart fluttering?

538
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:13,916
This is wrong, I know it is.
It's really, really bad!

539
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,166
So why does it feel so good?!

540
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,958
