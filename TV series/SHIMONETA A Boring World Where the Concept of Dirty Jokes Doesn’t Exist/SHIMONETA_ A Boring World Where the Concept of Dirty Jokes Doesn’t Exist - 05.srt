00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,666
[AYAME] I'm really sorry
about yesterday, Tanukichi.

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,833
It's just, that was
my first time

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,166
ever seeing something
like that in person.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,666
So I kinda panicked.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,333
Huh? Yesterday?
What happened yesterday?

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,916
Duh, she's talking about you
almost "docking" with Anna,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,375
don't you remember?

8
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,375
Oh, silly girls,
that was just a dream.

9
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,750
Believe me, the wholesome
and morally sound Anna I know

10
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,750
would never do anything
as filthy as that.

11
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,291
Aww. Poor guy still hasn't
accepted the reality yet.

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,916
[OTOME] It was no dream.
Would you like to see proof?

13

[OTOME]
Check it out.

15
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:55,416
Oh, no! Tell me it was a dream!

[NARRATOR]
The future. Japan.

17
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,708
For decades, "The Law for
Public Order and Morals

18
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,000
in Healthy Child-Raising"
has banned all sexual content.

19
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,625
This law against libidinous
language, in combination

20
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,791
with the Peacemaker
surveillance technology,

21
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,666
has turned what used
to be an island nation

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,541
of anything-goes sexual
deviancy into the country

23
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:16,125
with the healthiest
public morality on Earth.

24
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,958
But, among the douched masses,

25
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,833
are subversives who would dare
oppose this brave new world

26
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,208
free of naughty thoughts.

27
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,500
This is the story of
these sick miscreants!

28
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,500
[AYAME]
Cock and balls!

29
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,000
Here, I brought cookies
to school today.

30
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,625
I baked them myself,
especially for you two.

31
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:11,583
These are for Miss Ayame.
And for you, Mister Okuma.

32
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,250
Oh, right! I should
make us some tea.

33
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,791
She's acting like
her normal self.

34
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,500
So last night
must've been a dream.

35
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,208
[ANNA]
Something wrong?

36
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,958
Please, don't be shy.
Go on, eat my cookies.

37
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,208
Uh, of course. I'd love to.

38
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,000
Your cookies are always
so moist and delicious.

39
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,791
[TANUKICHI]
What's that flavor?

40
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,791
It tastes good,
but kinda strange.

41
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,916
[ANNA] How do you
like it, Mister Okuma?

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,708
I added something extra.

43
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,958
Well. The secret
ingredient is "love."

44

Uh, Anna, what are you--?

45
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,958
You see, I discovered
something last night.

46
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,875
When my feelings of love for
Mister Okuma reach their peak,

47
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,500
the emotions deep down
within my body turn to liquid

48
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,291
and explode out of me
like a gushing volcano.

49
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:01,000
I've named this miraculous
discharge my "Love Nectar."

50
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,916
And I'm so honored, Mister
Okuma, that you would devour it.

51
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:10,375
Your cookies have my Love
Nectar mixed in the dough.

[TANUKICHI screaming]

53
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,166
[TANUKICHI] Ugh! Dear god,
why is this happening?

54
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,458
Well, that's annoying.

55
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,291
That naïve girl seems
to be totally incapable

56
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,083
of distinguishing
between feelings of love

57
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:22,916
and feelings of lust.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,416
How are we gonna fix this?!

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,875
Fix it? Why would
you wanna do that?

60
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,500
I thought you had
the hots for Anna.

61
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,875
Now that she feels the same way,

62
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,750
you've got the green light
to get freaky with her.

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,958
But you don't get it.

64
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,541
The thing I truly love
the most about Anna

65
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,250
is how innocent and pure she is.

66
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,500
There's no way I can enjoy
"getting freaky" with her,

67
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,166
if she has no idea what
she's really feeling.

68
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,125
I'm not interested
in defiling-- Uh!

69
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,708
Oh good, I found you.

70
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:48,041
Huh, it seems like the two of
you have gotten close lately.

71
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,458
Anna!

72
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,291
[ANNA] In fact, it occurs
to me now that last night,

73
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,083
just as I was about to
demonstrate my love

74
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,583
for Mister Okuma,

75
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,625
it was you who barged into
his apartment all of a sudden

76
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,875
and interrupted us.

77
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,583
Look, Anna, I can explain.

78
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,708
See, Okuma was worried
that you didn't like him,

79
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:06,083
so he invited me over to his
place to give him some advice.

80
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,250
Really? He was
worried about that?

81
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,541
Well, he shouldn't be because
when I'm near Mister Okuma,

82
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,083
my body starts to
heat up, like a furnace.

83
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,708
Now, I had resolved
to restrain myself

84
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:20,333
until Mister Okuma
accepted my affections.

85
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,250
Mister Okuma?

86
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,458
Yes?

87
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,833
If I hurt you, then I
sincerely apologize.

88
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,833
But from this point on,
there's really no reason

89
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,375
for either of us to
hold back, is there?

90
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,166
Oh, great.

I'm sorry.

My hands moved all on their own,

93
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,375
but it was for love,
and love alone.

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,875
Love Nectar?

159
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,208
[TANUKICHI yelps]

160
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,500
Ah! Just as I thought,
that's where it comes out!

161
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,708
[TANUKICHI screams]

162
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,375
[TANUKICHI] Stop that!
Ow! Don't clamp it!

163
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,583
[ANNA] Mister Okuma,
where are you? I need it!

164
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,333
Anoint me with your
precious Love Nectar!

165
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,875
[ANNA panting]

166
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,750
[ANNA] Today's the day
it shall be mine!

167
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,625
Give me your Love Nectar!

168
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,166
[TANUKICHI screaming]

169
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,625
[TANUKICHI]
Someone help me!

170
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,541
[ANNA]
Come back here!

171
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,083
"Love Nectar"? What's that?

172
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,916
[TANUKICHI]
Given the circumstances,

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,833
there's no way I can distribute
those Yatsuga Forest map.

174
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,041
I never know when Anna might
be lurking around a corner,

175
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:51,958
ready to pounce.

176
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,541
[AYAME]
I guess you're right.

177
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,791
It's a shame, though. Saotome
drew such beautiful pictures.

178
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,750
[OFFICER] Attention! Today,
we are going to wipe out...

179
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,375
[AYAME]
Looks like Sophia Nishikinomiya

180
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,875
brought out the big guns.

181
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,625
With such a huge show of
force by the Decency Squad...

182
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,625
[TANUKICHI] No one would
dare go to Yatsuga Forest.

183
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,916
We should just give
up. It's pointless.

184
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,500
[cameras click]

185
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,625
So what you're saying is
that this radical element

186
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,708
was planning to lure
students to Yatsuga Forest?

187
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,125
[SOPHIA]
No need to worry.

188
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,291
Tokioka students aren't stupid.

189
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,750
With the mere act of
signing this petition,

190
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,333
they defend the
prestige of attending

191
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,166
a high morality school.

192
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,666
They know which choice will
ensure a brighter future.

193
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,750
Starting today, a nationwide
signature-collecting campaign

194
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,250
is underway.

195
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,375
And long lines have
already begun to form

196
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,958
at the nation's top
morality schools.

197
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,708
This just goes to
show how popular

198
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,458
the X Prohibition bill is.

199
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,833
Please hurry up.

200
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,333
This day will go down in history

201
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,583
and I want to share it with
the students of Tokioka

202
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,833
who are about to sign.

203
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,041
[DRIVER]
Understood, Ma'am.

204
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,916
At Tokioka Academy,
a model morality school,

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,125
Sophia Nishikinomiya
is scheduled to address

206
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,791
the crowd of students who
are eagerly waiting to sign.

207
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,625
I knew that this would happen.
We can't stop it.

208
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,291
Uh?

209
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,500
Wait, where are you going?

210
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,083
[AYAME]
To Yatsuga Forest.

211
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,166
[TANUKICHI]
Huh?

212
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,208
[AYAME]
Even if nobody else can come...

213
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,750
I will steal that porn!

214
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,708
Wait, Kajo! You can't
go there alone!

215
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,875
That's crazy!
Just stop and think!

216
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,416
[AYAME] What's wrong?
Am I going too fast for you?

217
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,041
You look totally beat.

218
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,541
Wait, have you already
given yourself

219
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,666
a vigorous workout today?

220
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,583
[TANUKICHI panting]

221
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,916
Kajo...

222
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,333
In spite of everything, how
do you remain so committed?

223
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,833
Where'd that come from?

224
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,375
Don't worry. No matter
how shy you may be

225
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,791
or what you ultimately decide
to do, everyone will accept you.

226
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,583
Trust me, okay?

227
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,625
Now come on! We gotta
get to Yatsuga Forest!

228
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,625
[TANUKICHI] I think we
should turn back, Kajo.

229
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:00,416
There's no way the two of us
can storm past them on our own.

230
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Listen. We are terrorists.

231
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,958
Even if we know we're doomed,

232
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,041
we can't let anything stop
us from telling dirty jokes.

233
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,208
You should stay behind.

234
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,708
This is a battle that
I know I'm going to lose.

235
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,083
Sorry I forced you into
this mess with me.

236
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,291
From here on out,
I'm flying solo.

237
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,291
But I... I was... I was--

238
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,833
Yes. I'll be a lone
master fighter.

239
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,250
In addition to being
a masturbater!

240
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,666
Knock it off!

241
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,833

What the heck?

00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,916
[STUDENT A] I've never
seen anything this lewd!

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,375
There's even randy grannies!

245
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,750
[STUDENT B]
Naughty nurses, too!

246
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,125
[STUDENT C]
My pants are getting tight!

Ttwo bearded
dudes rough-housing!

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,625
Do two men make a baby
when their dicks touch?

249
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,208
[STUDENTS] What is this?
Why is my heart throbbing?

250
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,500
What is the meaning of this?

251
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,958
Why aren't there
any students here?

252
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,833
We contacted all their parents,

253
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,708
but everybody said
as far as they knew,

254
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,541
their children had
gone to the rally.

255
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,750
Then why am I not
seeing--? Yatsuga!

256
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,041
It's Fuwa.

257
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,750
[AYAME chuckles] The tide
has turned in our favor!

258
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,208
Now come on, we've
gotta focus hard.

259
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,666
And you'll fuck us hard

260
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,916
just as soon as you can make
your great big dick hard!

[ANNA]
Hello, Mother.

262
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,750
Oh, Mother.

00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,083
Please will you let me go?

264
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,583
What're you kids doing?

265
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,458
No trespassing! Please,
just go back to school!

266

All right, ladies, you're up.

267
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,458
Time for us to break down
the guards' defenses,

268
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,625
exactly as we discussed earlier.

269
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,791
Let's go.

270
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,625
Huh? What's going on here?

271
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,291
And now we commence.

00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,458
Nobody told me!

00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,291
Hey! Hold it! Do you want
us to haul you off to jail?

[STUDENT I]
Hey, boys!

doing right now!

[STUDENT J]
Help us, Decency Squad!

279
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,791
[STUDENT K] We came here to
prevent these perverted boys

280
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,375
from stealing
pornographic books!

281
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,250
[STUDENT L]
Boys are so gross!

282
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,500
[STUDENT M] They're ruining
our precious signature rally.

283
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,083
[STUDENT O, STUDENT P] Please,
sir! Stop those dirty boys!

284
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,833
Guys, it's a trap! That
seaweed girl betrayed us!

285
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,375
[OFFICER B]
Get back here!

286
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,083
[HYOKA] Please do not
resent us, male counterparts.

287
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,416
Just know that your sacrifice
will not be in vain.

288
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,125
Thanks to you, we shall acquire
all the lewd materials.

289
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,125
[FEMALE STUDENTS]
All of those body-fucking books

290
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,041
shall be ours!

291
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,916
[AYAME]
I gotta hand it to Mad Seaweed.

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,541
Using the boys as scapegoats
like that was brilliant.

293
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,750
[TANUKICHI] It's great that
all the girls are helping too,

294
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,250
but what if the
Decency Squad returns?

295
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,708
[AYAME]
It'll be a slaughter.

296
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,958
Those fascists are experts
at locating porn.

297
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,416
When they search an area,
no pubic hair is left unturned.

298
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,083
But even those
untrained students

299
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,291
can at the very least
buy us some time.

300
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,833
And during their diversion,
you and I will grab the porn.

301
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,375
Yeah, but, Kajo,
you'd really...?

302
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,750
[AYAME] Save the rest of that
question for later, all right?

303
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:16,166
And just FYI, I'm not as noble
as you seem to think I am.

304
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,375
See, I'm like a fish who
can't live out of water,

305
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,375
so all I do is
practice swimming.

306
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,625
But you, you're a cheetah
who never bothers running.

307
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,833
Instead, you try
flying and swimming.

308
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,791
And that's why you
never catch any food.

309
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,875
No. Sorry, that isn't fair

310
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,958
coming from the girl who
forced you to join SOX.

311
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,541
I need to make some
things clear to you soon.

312
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,875
Once this farce is over,

313
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,875
I'll give you a chance,
of your own free wi-- Uh.

314
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,125
Anna.

315
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,041
[ANNA chuckles]

316
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:52,083
Finally. Found you, Blue Snow.

317
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,625
[ANNA]
Don't run from me, Blue Snow!

318
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,333
Capturing you would be the most
virtuous thing I could ever do

319
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,750
and I know Mister Okuma will
love me forever for doing it!

320
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,000
[AYAME]
We should split up.

321
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,958
It's me that Anna's
after and besides,

322
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,750
you can still blend in
with the other students.

323
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,375
It was wrong of me to force you
to become an erotic terrorist

324
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,208
against your will, but I did,

325
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,708
so now I get to decide when
you wash your hands of it!

326
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,458
[ANNA]
Mister Okuma!

327
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,041
[screaming]

328
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,958
[groaning]

329
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,791
Ow, everything hurts.

330
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,458
[TANUKICHI]
A bookshelf?

331
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,958
Are--? Are these...

332
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,916
...graphic pornographic
treasures?

333
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,666
People are into that, too?

334
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,541
[AYAME screaming]

335
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,250
I've got you now. Yes,
I've finally captured you.

336
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,291
And now Mister Okuma will
accept my love for him!

337
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,250
[AYAME screaming]

338
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,666
[TANUKICHI]
If I let Kajo get caught,

339
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,375
then I'll be free
from this madness.

340
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,916
I mean, she forced me
into this. I had no choice.

341
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,791
The reason I came to Tokioka
Academy in the first place

342
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,500
was so I could be a pure
and healthy person like Anna.

343
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,708
But is that...
really what I want?

344
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,458
Though what you're
really trying to say is,

345
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,541
what we're doing makes me
wanna pound flower mound!

346
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,833
That it?

347
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,125
[TANUKICHI]
Stop it!

348
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,916
[thud]

349
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,708
What's this?

350
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,625
[ANNA]
Any last words, Blue Snow?

351
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,875
Or will it be easier to
talk once I unmask you?

352
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,875
[TANUKICHI]
Let her go!

353
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,541
Ah! Wait, who are you?

354
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:13,166
[TANUKICHI laughing]

355
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,541
[TANUKICHI]
I am the other founder of SOX!

356
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,083
My name is...

357
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,750
...to be... determined!

358
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,916
[AYAME]
Tanukichi?

359
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,291
So Blue Snow has a partner?

360
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,166
[ANNA]
That's all right!

361
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,041
I'll just apprehend
both of you at once!

362
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,083
[ANNA gasps]

363
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,333
[ANNA]
What is this strange sensation?

364
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,916
My body feels so warm. But why?

365
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,458
Why is my body throbbing for
someone other than Mister Okuma?

366
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,125
The one I love is Mister Okuma,
and Mister Okuma alone!

367
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,708
He's the only boy for me!

368
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,250
[AYAME]
Where'd you get that outfit?

369
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,375
[BOTH gasp]

370
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,000
Huh?

371
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,208
Now that I look closer
that physique, his scent.

372
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,541
They both resemble
that of Mister Okuma.

373
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,541
Even the contours of
that mysterious bulge

374
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,750
below his waist!

375
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,666
[screaming]

376
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,708
[TANUKICHI]
Eww.

377
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,250
[ANNA]
Why?

378
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,750
Why does my Love Nectar flow
freely for this masked stranger?

379
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,958
My heart belongs
to Mister Okuma.

380
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,208
Looking kind of like
him is no excuse!

381
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,750
My body shouldn't
be betraying me!

382
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,083
[sobs]

383
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:28,500
I can't live like this!

384
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,666
[TANUKICHI]
Aw, crap.

385
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,666
Wow, the two of you take the
struggle seriously, don't you?

386
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,583
[TANUKICHI, AYAME gasp]

387
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,000
[HYOKA]
So, did you discover

388
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:44,083
all the unhealthy printed
materials, Blue Snow?

389
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,916
[AYAME] No, not I.
It was SOX that obtained it.

390
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:53,041
You're an organization now?
My congratulations.

391
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,416
Well then, the Decency
Squad will be back any minute.

392
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,208
So I should probably get going.

393
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,041
I managed to collect
plenty of larvae

394
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,416
that will turn into
flies next season.

395
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,958
[AYAME] Yeah, I guess we
oughta get outta here, too.

396
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,875
I gotta say...

397
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,166
[TANUKICHI]
What is it?

398
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,166
You have... the most
beautiful dirty mind ever!

399
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,833
[TANUKICHI]
I don't wanna hear that!

400
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,208
[TANUKICHI]
Anyway,

401
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,375
our plan to retrieve the
porn from Yatsuga Forest,

402
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,875
as well as the boycott of
the X Prohibition rally,

403
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,291
both proved to be successful.

404
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,750
And though we only managed
to attain 20 erotic

405
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,416
and homoerotic books filled
with graphic sex scenes.

406
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,125
The way Kajo was carrying on,

407
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,333
you'd think we just
started a revolution.

408
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,625
After furiously thumbing
through the novels

409
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:47,083
Saotome plunged herself into her
work, even with a nosebleed.

410
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,750
And thanks to her
prolific output,

411
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,000
we have far more erotic
pamphlets and drawings

412
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,916
to distribute than we
ever could have hoped for.

413
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,083
But it's not over yet.

414
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,458
There's still fallout from

415
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,666
the nationwide X Prohibition
rallies to contend with.

416
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,875
Behind me here, you
can see the results

417
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,416
of today's X Prohibition
signature campaigns.

418
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,041
They just keep pouring in.

419
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,875
And now, Sophia Nishikinomiya
is about to speak

420
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,541
at an emergency
press conference.

421
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,750
They forced all of the students

422
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,666
that were arrested
to sign the petition.

423
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,375
The public should be outraged
at that. Are you ready?

424
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,583
[SOPHIA]
Ladies and gentlemen,

425
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,708
I want to thank you
for coming here tonight.

426
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,041
The X Prohibition
signature collection drive

427
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,416
that took place all across
the country this morning

428
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,750
was enthusiastically
embraced by the public.

429
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,791
And while there were
pockets of resistance,

430
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,375
I believe the pure hearts
who long for morality

431
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,791
and these signatures we've
gathered clearly demonstrate

432
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,375
what we want as a society.
And what we want--

433
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,833
[CROWD gasping]

434
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,083
What? What is it?

435
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:54,125
[screams]

436
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,583
My signatures? Where
are my signatures?

437
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,125
Ma'am, bad news!

438
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,375
Every single one of the signed
petitions has been replaced!

439
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,416
Those terrorists!

440
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,416
Huh? Stop filming!

441
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,958
We can't broadcast this
filth! Cut the feed!

442
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,791
[AYAME] We did it,
Tanukichi! Hand spank!

443
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,750
[TANUKICHI] It's called a
"high five" and you know it!

444
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,958
[TANUKICHI] That night, we
only burned a small portion

445
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,750
of the signatures that
had been collected.

446
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,208
But Sophia got in trouble
for the lewd illustrations

447
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,666
being broadcast on
national television.

448
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,750
So for now, X Prohibition's
been withdrawn.

449
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,750
And as for us...

450
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,375
[AYAME]
Hurry, Tanukichi!

451
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,583
Once we round this bend, we dive
straight into that man's hole!

452
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,708
[TANUKICHI]
It's a "manhole"!

453
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,916
[AYAME] Your upper mouth
is still so uptight.

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,500
But look at you, you're
a real ero-terrorist!

455
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,916
That should stroke your ego.

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,958
And you should stroke
what's between your legs!

457
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,000
[TANUKICHI]
Shut up!

458
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,500
[TANUKICHI] I'm still
not a fan of dirty jokes,

459
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:55,166
but if you asked me why I was
being an erotic terrorist,

460
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,291
I'd be able to give
you an answer.

461
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,916
I'm doing this for me.

462
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,583
For the part of me
that's been repressed.

463
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:05,541
And my erotic terrorism,
it's only just begun.

464
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,375
[TANUKICHI]
Of course, at the time,

465
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:45,916
I had no way of knowing that
the obscene books we stole,

466
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,416
would trigger such a disaster.
