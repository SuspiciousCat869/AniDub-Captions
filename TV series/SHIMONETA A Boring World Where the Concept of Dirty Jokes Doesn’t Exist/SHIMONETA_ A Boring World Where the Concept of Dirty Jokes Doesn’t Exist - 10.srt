enough of your babbling.

159
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,666
Don't make me shoot you!

160
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,750
How are you going to
shoot me with a fake gun?

161
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,583
I've observed the
tension in your hand

162
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:06,041
and compared it to the
usual weight of that gun.

163
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,666
Your grip is far too loose.

164
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,250
When combined with the fact that
the plastic inside the barrel

165
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:13,125
is clearly visible, I can
conclude beyond a doubt

166
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:15,375
that this is a toy.

167
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,833
So I ask you again,

168
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:19,541
what is it about underwear
fabric that you love?

169
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:20,958
Does it give you
the sensual thrill

170
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:23,375
that others get from
graphic pictures?

171
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:26,458
I appreciate any answer you can
provide, however simplistic.

172
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:29,250
Uh, look, either you
get it or you don't, kid.

173
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:31,333
It's about way more
than just fabric.

174
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:35,291
Now listen, you're gonna
take off your pan-- Ah!

175
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:38,791
Hey, what are you doing?!
You're hijacking my hijacking!

176

Oh, wow. This thing
is just a toy!

01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:43,083
Hey, thanks, kid.

Thanks, Miss.

Yeah, you noticed her fake gun.

01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:49,000
And then you started
getting in her head,

Yeah. It's not fear I'm
fighting, it's withdrawal.

You see, I've gone...
too long...

...without being able to touch
Mister Okuma's underpants.

I couldn't even find a
pair at his apartment.

It's been a week since his
musk has filled my nostrils.

If I don't smell
his undies soon,

No more talking.

198

I will now collect
your undergarments.

Both tops and bottoms.
The dirtier, the better.

Hey, this isn't
a request, people.

and hike those skirts.

315
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:44,333
He's in his last year at school.

316
01:13:44,416 --> 01:13:45,916
Well, if they know that much,

317
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,875
I bet he's being
arrested as we speak.

318
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:49,291
No.

319
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:51,666
Ichninose is still out there,
moving from bus to bus.

320
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:54,500
Which means we have a
chance to get him first.

[NEWS ANCHOR B] Breaking
news in the terror attacks

322
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:57,666
that have paralyzed a city!

323
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,791
The Decency Squad has stated
that 39 buses remain hijacked

324
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,875
by the organization calling
itself Gathered Fabric.

and some pills can't fix.

01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:27,875
Thanks for your concern.

336
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:29,875
Let's get back to
the task at hand.

337
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,458
All right.

338
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:34,958
Of the 42 buses, Gathered
Fabric still has 39.

339
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:37,208
Including the bus you
and Goriki were on,

340
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:40,625
passengers successfully defended
their underwear on three buses.

341
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,708
Others fought back?

342
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,500
One hostage who freed herself

343
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,250
was a girl with dark
circles under her eyes.

344
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:49,375
Another, was a girl
with a bob of silver hair.

345
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:52,625
Huh. Really is a small world
when you get down to it.

346
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,000
White Peak admitted
to the Decency Squad

347
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:57,708
that with the exception of
one bus hijacker's weapon,

348
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:00,708
all the firearms they were
carrying were stage props.

349
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,791
So to determine who's
got the real gun,

350
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:05,708
the Decency Squad's getting
help from our friend, Hyoka,

351
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:07,958
the girl with dark
circles under her eyes.

352
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,750
[TANUKICHI] Yeah, but that
still means we're outta time,

353
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:11,250
'cause the second they
find the real gun,

354
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:14,041
they'll rush the other buses
and round up the hijackers.

355
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:17,166
Not true. The police
are very risk averse.

356
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:20,458
If they go in on Hyoka's word
alone, and a hostage dies,

357
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:21,750
they'll be in trouble.

358
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,125
They won't move till
they're certain.

359
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:24,208
But still.

360
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:26,125
If they're watching
every bus now,

361
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:28,875
how are we supposed to not only
get on the one Ichinose is on,

362
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,791
but then get him off it?

363
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:32,416
We'll lure his bus
to a narrow street

364
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,708
where the cops can't drive
their truck to the side.

365
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:37,458
Then, with the Decency Squad
unable to see what's happening,

366
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:40,166
we'll jump on, grab that
jerk, and get out quick.

367
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,291
And then, after
alerting the government

368
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:44,250
that SOX has
kidnapped White Peak,

369
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,708
we'll go into hiding
with him as our hostage.

370
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:48,375
That sounds insane.

371
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:50,500
How are we even gonna find
the bus Ichinose is on,

372
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:52,166
let alone take him hostage?

373
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:56,250
Oh, we can find his bus.
We just need the right bait.

What bait?

01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:01,000
So, that's what's going on.

within a 500 meter radius.

we can lure him onto

that Kosuri collected.

is using panties like a flare,

trying to guide Takuma
Ichinose somewhere else.

So what if we could
use that method, too?

01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:21,458

three red pairs, three
pairs of large Spanx,

wearing someone else's panties,

471
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:22,541
as you prefer, but these
are dirty with my stink!

472
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:25,541
It can't be.

473
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:28,916
Breathing through panties
infused with your own scent?

474
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,125
You're even crazier than I am!

475
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:35,041
[AYAME]
Well, well. It's a fake.

476
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,375
I think we know
who the coward is.

477
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,791
White Peak, real name
Takuma Ichinose,

478
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,500
do you know what
your fatal flaw is?

479
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:45,166
For future reference,
I'll hear you out.

480
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,125
[AYAME] You think that
panties are only of value

481
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:49,333
if they've been worn
by someone else.

482
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:50,958
Never once has it dawned on you

483
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:54,333
to wear your own soiled
underwear on your head.

484
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,291
You're smart, but you let
the nose on your face,

485
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:57,791
and the trunk between your legs,

486
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:00,958
lead you rather than the best
erotic organ: Your brain.

487
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:02,416
And that's no way to live.

488
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,000
Heh. We're just not a match.

489
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,416
[TANUKICHI]
Sorry, Blue Snow.

490
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,000
I didn't mean to get
beat up so easily.

491
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:10,375
[AYAME]
Eh, it's fine.

492
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,291
Besides, you getting roughed
up is never a bad thing.

493
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,791
Anyway, let's go
talk to the Po-Po.

494
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:19,208
I am the leader of SOX!
We've captured Takuma Ichinose!

495
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:23,041
Let's go to a neutral
location to negotiate!

496
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:25,416
Kindly move your police
vehicles out of the way

497
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,208
so we can get back on the road.

498
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:27,750
[TANUKICHI]
Watch out!

499
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:28,958
[AYAME]
Huh?

500
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:29,791
[AYAME yelps]

501
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:30,583
[gasps]

502
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:33,208
[groaning]

503
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:34,250
[AYAME]
What was that?!

504
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,916
[COP A]
Blue Snow's out of the bus.

505
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
[COP B]
Get her!

506
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,500
[TANUKICHI]
Why did you...? How did you...?

507
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:46,708
When the bus doors opened

508
01:21:46,791 --> 01:21:48,833
and you jumped on to
fight with White Peak,

509
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:51,666
I came in the back,
dressed as a hostage.

510
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:54,958
See, I've realized
how pathetic SOX is.

511
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:57,416
Gathered Fabric's far more
serious about waging war

512
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,833
on our puritanical
society than you are.

513
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:02,000
It gives me chills.

514
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,625
Mister White Peak,
nice to meet you.

515
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,416
Will you please let Kosuri
join your terrorist group?

516
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,166
I've made plenty of arrangements
for us to have lots of fun.

517
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,708
[TANUKICHI]
Kosuri, no. Don't do this to us.

518
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:15,041
[KOSURI]
Cram it, "Big Brother."

519
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,500
I'm done with you
limp-noodle clowns.

520
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:20,791
There'll be consequences if
you don't get out of my sight.

521
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:57,083
[TANUKICHI]
