00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,791
Prepare to-- Oh!

161
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,458
Hey! Has anyone seen
President Anna?

162
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,375
Hm?

163
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,875
Madame President!

164
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,833
So this is where you've been.

165
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,250
And with Okuma?
Why's he upside-down?

166
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,166
And soaked in sweat?

167
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,500
That's how he was
when I found him.

168
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,416
So tell me, Mister Goriki,

169
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,416
did you find those
books I asked about?

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,833
I looked and looked,
but came up empty-handed.

171
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,875
Aw, well, that's a real shame.

172
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,416
Bye, Mister Okuma,
until next time.

173
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,166
[TANUKICHI]
Uh, yeah.

174
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,708
[ANNA]
Ptui.

175
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,791
Poor Goriki.

176
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,541
I sure hope he doesn't
meet an untimely end

177
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,750
in the reference room.

178
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,791
[OTOME breathes heavily]

179
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,083
Hey, what are
you doing, Saotome?

180
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,208
As you can see, I'm
sketching my sweet Anna

181
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,791
in all her lustful glory.

182
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,750
How many times do I have to beg
you to step in and help me out!

183
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,250
Anna keeps assaulting me!

184
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,375
[OTOME] No one can stand in
the way of my burning drive

185
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,375
to create art!

186
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,583
Look at her!

187
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,375
By the way...

188
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,583
Ayame has yet to emerge.
Do you suppose she's all right?

189
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,666
[gasps]

190
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,916
Kajo, what's wrong? Uh.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,500
Please just let it go.
Please just let it go.

192
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,333
Will you cut the crap
and just show me?

193
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,750
It's the only way
for you to prove

194
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,333
that you're not the
underwear thief, okay?

195
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,875
Um, Kajo. What's going on?

196
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,875
When I showed up, she shoved
something into her lab coat

197
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,375
and is being really
cagey about it now.

198
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,875
I think that you of all
people would understand.

199
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,083
You see, what I'm concealing
isn't stolen underwear at all.

200
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,500
It's this.

201
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,875
Uh, yeah, so. Anyone got
a lighter I can borrow?

202
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,708
This needs to go bye-bye.

203
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,000
Please give it back!
Give it back!

204
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,625
--[grunts] I'm begging you...
--Kajo...

205
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,875
Look, I've confiscated some

206
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,083
morally-unsound
slash fiction here.

207
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,166
We should incinerate it.

208
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,875
Um, yes, of course.
That is what we should do.

209
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,833
You're absolutely right.
We should burn it at once.

210
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,458
This terrible dirty pun.

211
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,791
It reminds me of the kind
of thing you might say.

212
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,791
Oh, please, come on!
That's a baseless accusation!

213
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,500
You know, the artwork in this
comic is disturbingly good.

214
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,875
[AYAME]
Wow, you're right.

215
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,875
I guess Saotome isn't
the only person around here

216
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,791
who can draw like that.

217
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,041
Well, whoever did this,

218
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,666
we should see if we can
get them to join SOX.

219
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,916
I know you two were behind this!

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,416
Take it easy, Tanukichi.

221
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,958
You're gonna blow
your load too quickly,

222
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,750
and nobody wants
the rocket to blast off

223
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,541
before it even gets
to the launch pad!

224
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,916
Don't start with me!

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,291
All right, I'm sorry!

226
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,458
But I don't get it. Why would
you wanna make this?

227
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, uh...

228
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,166
Some of the stuff that the
Committee of Bacon Lettuce Moms

229
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,750
gave us was kinda like that.

230
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,375
And I got pretty into it.

231
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,333
Why are you blushing so much?

232
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,875
Then this one girl,

233
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,208
I overheard her say, "My heart
pounds wildly out of control

234
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,666
whenever I see Goriki
and Okuma together!"

235
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,416
That feeling of excitement
seemed to be spreading

236
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,083
throughout the school,
so I asked Saotome

237
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,791
to draw this as a test and
to satisfy popular demand.

238
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,291
And then once I started
working on it,

239
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,041
I too developed a fascination
with this sort of fantasy.

240
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,500
You got brainwashed?

241
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,583
I'll have you know that once
we put my work out there,

242
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,541
it developed a huge following.

243
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,083
A huge following?

244
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,791
"Okuma and Goriki"
has now turned into

245
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,750
an immensely popular,
much-beloved ten volume series.

246
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,458
You're saying there
are nine more volumes

247
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,666

around out there?!

in order to broadcast

We at Gathered Fabric

are working together with SOX.

277

to defy our
oppressive government

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,416
by stealing underwear
in the name of justice.

Stop it! Quiet down,
you sick little sickos!

we're in this mess now.

We didn't ask for this.

more than a common pervert.

Like a huge shot of
jizz to the face!

Those stupid crotch sniffers.

292
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,083
They claim to be
working with SOX

293
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,750
and protesting the government
when all they're doing

294
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,333
is going around stealing
people's underwear!

295
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,125
And that's why everyone
has been treating us

296
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,458
like we're bad guys.

297
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,541
Being labeled "bad guys"
is a major problem. Right?

298
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,583
I mean, we're just
a bunch of healthy teens

299
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,958
who wanna shout
"dick" and "pussy"

300
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,250
at the top of our lungs and
look at some hot porn.

301
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,291
In what world does that
make us "bad guys"?

302
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,916
You're not helping.

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,666
But I don't really get
what the big deal is.

304
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,291
Why don't we just
ignore Gathered Fabric

305
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,416
and leave them alone?

306
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,833
I mean, what have
they changed here?

307
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,125
Haven't we always been
quote-unquote "evil terrorists"?

308
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,250
It's not the same, Tanukichi.

309
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,875
Calling ourselves evil
versus society calling us evil

310
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,041
is as different as

311
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,166
what the Japanese
call a large jimmy hat

312
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,791
versus what's considered
a large jimmy hat in Russia.

313
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,000
That looks yummy.

314
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,208
That's excessive.

315
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,250
Oh yeah? Well, Russian
dicks are excessive!

316
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,125
You think you're so clever.

317
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,791
All I'm saying is,
do you really trust words

318
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,083
when they come from somebody
you find untrustworthy?

319
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,833
Like if Sophia
Nishikinomiya told you

320
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,541
that Japanese jimmy
hats are the best ever.

321
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,666
Then would you
actually believe her?

322
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,166
Yeah, I find that
situation pretty unlikely.

323
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,708
Regardless, if SOX
loses people's trust,

324
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,750
they'll never believe anything
we say, that's the problem here.

325
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,458
Even if it's sex education.

326
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,541
So you see, if SOX's
credibility plummets,

327
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,625
then knowledgeable sex education
will get a bad name, too.

328
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,666
Which is why we absolutely have
to eradicate Gathered Fabric

as quickly as possible.

330

Man, when it comes down
to it, I just don't think

331
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,541
I have it in me to be as
strong or dedicated as Kajo is.

332
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Hey, you should watch
where you're going.

Please, you have
to help me quick!

334
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:27,083
I didn't do anything, but the
Decency Squad is chasing me.

I simply can't
thank you enough.

343
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,708
I'm so lucky to have
run into such a kind

and resourceful young man.

I don't know what I
would've done without you.

But wait, why is the

Well, I didn't expect to

in a back alley like
some kind of deviant.

358
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,875
Not after you reacted so
prudishly to those comics

depicting you and Goriki
in the throes of passion.

Uh, I mean, what
are you doing here?

363

This is the spot where
Blue Snow was hiding away

364

all those copies of
pornographic magazines.

365

I hypothesized
there was a chance

that my confiscated comics
might be stashed here as well.

it back that bad?

just now with a tiny little

"These things aren't big enough!

383
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,291
before running off that way.

I lost control.

That's okay, don't worry.

393
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,875
Um, by the way, did you
mention something about

394
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,916
being on the Student Council
at Tokioka Academy?

[gasps]

Actually, the whole reason
that I even came here

398
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,208
was because of your school!

399

I was so inspired to see

fighting vigorously
for morality!

Bumping into you here like
this must've been fate!

You can introduce
me to the council!

Sure, but first,
what's your name?

told me that I was number one.

Did that guy just
call you Onigashira?

417
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,833
[KOSURI] Yep, I'm Keisuke
Onigashira's only daughter.

Call me Kosuri.

419
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,833
See, the real reason I
came here was to join SOX.

420
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,500
I figured if I hung
out with the nerds

421
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,041
on the Student
Council long enough,

422
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,375
then I was bound to cross
paths with somebody from SOX

423
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,541
sooner or later.

424
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,041
But now that you know
my true identity,

425
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,458
I'll have to find another way
to make contact with them.

426
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,500
And, of course, to
keep my secret safe,

427
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,541
I've gotta give you a little
shock to wipe your memory clean.

428
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,958
Wait!

429
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,083
Look, I know that you probably
won't believe me, but...

430
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,791
...I'm actually
a member of SOX.

You have such an
unassuming face,

such a ridiculous,

You know, you almost had
the great Kosuri fooled,

437
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,291
so kudos for that.

438
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,458
No, but it's true.
I'll prove it.

439
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,416

so we're going to be using
that to motivate people

Such an intense encounter.
It has to be fate.

You're so dependable.

And so special and so disarming
and so full of mystery

452
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,291
and you're a member

I won't!

457

Kosuri took a big risk leaving
her washed-up old father behind

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,416
to join SOX!

459
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,041
I've made up my mind and
there's no turning back!

00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,541
Uh, yeah, but why?

461
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,916
Doesn't Keisuke Onigashira
aid all the terrorist groups?

462
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,583
He's a real hero
within the movement.

463
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,583
He's no hero, he's a fraud!

464
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,625
I lost all respect for
him when he cozied up

to the Decency Squad
during the Yatsuga incident.

466

Meanwhile, SOX is out
there in the trenches

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,416
doing so many incredible things.

You're making a profound impact
and you have so much influence,

469
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,166
not just over Kosuri,
but all kinds of people.

470
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,958
You know, like, um...
Gathered Fabric.

471
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,541
[AYAME] Tanukichi, something
about this girl smells fishy.

472
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,125
She seems dangerous...
and not in a fun, sexy way.

473
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,125
So you think that
Kosuri is a threat

474
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,333
and you don't want her here?

475
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,125
Kosuri is confident
she can be of service

476
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,708
to your awesome cause!

477
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,500
She can provide funding
for your missions

478
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,333
and offer a wide array of useful
tools that will assist you

479
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,875
in outmaneuvering
the Decency Squad!

480
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,458
[AYAME]
See?

481
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,000
She's clearly not in sync with
the values of erotic terrorists.

482
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,125
Air pistols? Stun guns? Funding?

483
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,958
We don't need
such garish things.

484
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,916
We just rely on our mouths.
Upper and lower!

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,958
Got that?

486
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,750
You two seem pretty
in sync to me.

487
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,333
But these instruments could be
very useful in your operations.

488
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,041
Kosuri also pledges her
unequivocal loyalty to you,

489
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,708
in both words and deeds.

490
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,166
[AYAME] People who are
too eager to please

491
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,541
are the least
trustworthy of all.

492
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,541
Like how the women who
scream the loudest in bed

493
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,416
are usually faking it.

494
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,791
Why does a girl like you
have all these weapons anyway?

495
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,166
It's just...

496
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,333
...everybody looks at Kosuri
like she's a useless kid

497
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,833
and people don't seem
to like her very much.

498
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,875
She's been picked on and bullied
by others her entire life.

499
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,416
Her father armed her with
a bunch of different weapons

500
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,291
so she would always be
able to protect herself.

501
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,541
That's why she was hoping
that SOX could welcome her

502
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,041
with open arms.

503
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,833
That was her dream. It's the
whole reason she came here.

504
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,000
[chuckles]

505
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,916
But I guess Kosuri's
being useless again

506
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,750
and only causing
trouble for you two.

507
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,791
All right.

508
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,791
Look, I agree
she's a little off,

509
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,583
but still, can't we
let her join us?

510
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,000
[AYAME] How can you
even say such a thing?

511
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,500
[TANUKICHI]
I don't know,

512
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,500
it looked like the Decency Squad
really had it in for her.

513
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,916
[AYAME]
What'd you do?

514
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I bombarded them with exploding
yogurt-filled balloons!

515
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,500
Doing all that
I could to obstruct

516
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,041
their quote-unquote justice.

517
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,583
Breaking the law for
public order and morality.

518
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,458
I figured I had to
at least do that much

519
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,708
if I wanted to prove myself
worthy enough of joining SOX.

520
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,958
[AYAME]
You know what this means?

521
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,166
It's like getting
caught cheating

522
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,458
'cause your wife comes
home from work early

523
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,250
and then you trip and
fall on your dick.

524
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,458
It's a disaster on
top of a disaster.

525
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,375
Uh, yeah, it would be pretty
bad if that happened.

526
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,625
[AYAME] If Kosuri
Onigashira is arrested,

527
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,250
then all of the
erotic terror groups

528
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,750
will rise up and
flock to her aid.

529
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,000
And when they do, our entire
movement will face a crisis.

530
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,708
Then we have no choice but
to protect her now, right?

531
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,041
You mean it?

532
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,500
You're really going to let
Kosuri join your group?

533
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,458
[AYAME]
Under protest, yes.

534
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,833
But I'll pound a fist up your
ass if you get out of line,

535
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,083
so brace yourself!

536
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,541
Oh, yes!

537
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm looking forward to you
ravaging my body to pieces.

538
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,625
[AYAME] Let me properly
introduce myself.

539
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,250
I am Blue Snow,
AKA Ayame Kajo.

540
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:42,166
I'm the blue birthmark standing
out on a lilywhite rear end!

541
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,833
And he's the star of a
homoerotic comic book.

542
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,041
A virginal, depraved,
genteel pervert

543
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,666
who won't admit that he loves
dirty jokes, Tanukichi Okuma.

544
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,833
Oh! Sounds lovely!

545
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,291
I just realized that
from the back,

546
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,125
your hairstyle looks like
a cock head! That's awesome!

547
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,750
Kosuri is honored to
receive your praise!

548
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,500
[TANUKICHI]
Uh...

549
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,625
[groans]

550
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,958
My life just keeps
getting more insane.

551
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, Father.

552
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,958
I really am trying so very hard,

553
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,958
but I still seem to be lacking
the powers that I need.

554
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,416
What should I do about it?

555
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,166
[ANNA'S FATHER]
Leave it to me.

556
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,291
I have a new idea. [chuckles]

557
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,791

Devil Blows His Own Trumpet."
