00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,083
Are you sure about that?
'Cause if it goes well,

159
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,458
then I can help you
get in good with Anna.

160
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,375
Ugh. So predictable.

161
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,875
I shouldn't be surprised,
though. It's the same old story.

162
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,500
You nasty boys are
always pitching tents

163
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,125
in your pants like
you're on safari

164
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,750
with rhinos, elk, and unicorns
running through your heads!

165
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,833
Hey, I am not "horny" for Anna!

166
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,166
[AYAME] It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

167
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,416
I mean, so what if
all you really wanna do

168
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
is stick your custard-cannon
in her glazed donut.

169
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,500
What's wrong with that?

170
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,041
Okay, now look, Miss Kajo,
let me be perfectly clear here.

171
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,500
I do not have any
desire to do the thing

172
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,291
you just described with Anna.

173
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,583
[gasps] Wait, don't tell me,

174
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,333
it's her fudge hole
that you're after?

175
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,208
You know that's
not what I meant!

176
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,250
Anna is a pure-hearted
young woman.

177
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,208
And for that, I look up to her!

178
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,916
I'll be satisfied
as long as I can be

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,875
an effective council member.

180
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,666
All this chastity
is grossing me out.

181
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,333
How can it be gross?!

182
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,000
[AYAME] Let me tell you
something, Tanukichi.

183
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,458
You can't just remove
the nuts and bolts

184
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,125
from boy-girl relationships.

185
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,208
In the end, she wants every
inch of your pure hard-on

186
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,666
and you should be
looking up her skirt.

187
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,375
[TANUKICHI] How dare you soil
my flowery words in mud!

188
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,583
The act of lovemaking
isn't something that's dirty

189
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,875
or immoral.

190
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,625
When two people gradually reveal

191
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,208
their intimate parts
to one another,

192
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,208
bringing together their
most sensitive areas

193
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,791
in sweet harmony,

194
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,666
it's their continued acceptance
of each other that forms a bond.

195
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,250
And it's not just a physical
thing. It joins their hearts.

196
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,708
Don't you see? That's why
dirty jokes are beautiful.

197
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,000
[AYAME]
But let's end the levity here.

198
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,166
[groans]

199
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,583
Anna doesn't find
any of this funny.

200
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,166
I'm sure you've already
noticed that about her.

201
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,666
[TANUKICHI]
So, tell me,

202
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,708
do you have any idea what's
been bothering Anna lately?

203
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,500
[gasps]

204
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,708
[TANUKICHI]
Anna has a stalker?!

205
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,708
[AYAME]
Yup. For the last week,

206
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,250
she's been receiving
letters and creepy photos.

207
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,708
[TANUKICHI]
Is she safe?

208
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,583
Please, if you think there's
anything I can do to help,

209
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,041
just name it.

210
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,625
I'll do whatever it
takes to protect Anna.

211
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,000
No, there's nothing
you can do for her.

212
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,083
But what if--?

213
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,458
[AYAME]
Oh, don't worry. She'll be fine.

214
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,583
Right now, you need to
focus on Otome Saotome.

215
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,833
If you do that,

216
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,666
then I can concentrate
on keeping Anna safe.

217
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,250
[TANUKICHI] You know,
when you talk like that,

218
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,291
it almost seems like you
really are her best friend,

219
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,166
like you actually
care about her.

220
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,958
[AYAME]
What do you mean, "like"?

221
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,333
[TANUKICHI] I thought the whole
best friend thing was an act.

222
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,208
[AYAME sighs]

223
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,083
Ten years ago, she befriended
me right at the moment

224
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,125
when I was most depressed
about not being allowed

225
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,750
to tell dirty jokes.

226
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,333
It's because of Anna
that I'm able

227
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,833
to blend in with polite society
now, even if it is just barely.

228
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,166
I really... blow her big time!

229
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,625
You mean owe her!

230
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,916
[AYAME] Anyway, I'll leave
the matter of Otome Saotome

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,291
in your capable hands.

232
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,750
[AYAME chuckles]

233
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,750
[TANUKICHI] If this is the
socially acceptable version

234
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,958
of you that Anna
helped foster,

235
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,250
I'd hate to see what
you used to be like.

236
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,458
[OTOME] An artist needs plenty
of calories in order to create.

237
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,125
Gotta eat!

238
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,583
So, how exactly do you think

239
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,041
I'll be able to help you
in your quest for love?

240
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,916
[OTOME] I haven't come up
with any specifics yet.

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,666
That's why I asked you
to meet me here.

242
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,375
[TANUKICHI] Well, who is
it you have a crush on?

243
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,291
[OTOME gasps]

244
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,333
I-I can't tell you that.

245
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,916
I will say,

246
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,625
I worry sometimes that I might
be making my love uncomfortable

247
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,125
or that maybe they
even detest me

248
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,541
and those fears are what
keep me up at night.

249
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,000
Hey, why are you grinning
at me like that, you creeper?

250
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,750
Is the notion of someone
like me being in love

251
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,291
really that ridiculous?

252
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,208
Uh, no, no, not at all.

253
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,666
In fact, I think
it's kind of sweet.

254
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,083
And really, there's nothing
for you to be embarrassed about.

255
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,958
I've got my heart
set on someone, too.

256
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,666
Oh?

257
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,916
Hey, I've got an idea!

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,291
How about we both
utter the names

259
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,041
of our secret
sweethearts in unison.

260
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,916
If you do, then I'll forgive
your insensitive grin.

261
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,166
Oh, all right, fine.

262
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,291
[gulps]

263
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,875
Okay, you ready?

264
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,041
One... two....

265
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:36,708
--[beeping]
--[TANUKICHI] Uh?

266
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,625
Anna Nishikinomiya!

267
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,833
[yelps]

268
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,500
You fiend, you've deceived me!

269
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,958
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I was distracted!

270
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,541
I got an email in my PM.

271
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,083
[growls]

272
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,791
[OTOME] Don't test me! If you
try to back out of our deal,

273
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,958
I shall inform the Decency
Squad of all of your crimes.

274
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,166
[TANUKICHI]
Okay, uh, my crush is--

275
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,666
[TANUKICHI] Wait, if Saotome's
infatuated with Anna,

276
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,000
then there's no way
I can tell her

277
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,416
that I'm in love with
the exact same girl.

278
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,958
What do I do here?

279
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,000
Should I just blurt
out some random name?

280
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,333
But whose?

281
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,666
What's taking you so long?

282
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,083
I'm about to hit "send."

283
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,583
Three... Two... One...!

284
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,458
It's Ayame Kajo!

285
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,500
Oh, so you got seduced by that
horrible little harpy, did you?

286
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,875
Perfect!

287
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,416
Together we'll drive a wedge
between Ayame and Anna.

288
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,875
And then I'll swoop in and
fill the harpy-shaped vacancy

289
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,291
left at Anna's side!

290
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,166
And we'll live
happily ever after!

291
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,208
[TANUKICHI]
Hold on, just a minute!

292
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,416
Yeah, what?

293
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,041
Did you forget?

294
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,458
I'm a villain who's
been deceiving Anna.

295
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,541
I mean, you can't possibly
wanna team up with someone

296
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,541
in such a complicated
position, right?

297
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,958
Huh? That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

298
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,291
[TANUKICHI]
Huh?

299
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,583
[OTOME]
Anna never seems happier

300
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,250
than when she's chasing
after perv-terrorists.

301
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,708
In fact, to me, it
almost looked like

302
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,541
the two of you were just
playing a really fun game

303
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,875
of hide-and-seek.

304
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,208
[OTOME]
Well, anyway,

305
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,458
I see no reason why we
shouldn't join forces.

306
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,958
Does that answer all
of your questions?

307
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,041
We've gathered here today

308
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,500
in order to discuss next month's
signature-collecting campaign

309
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,500
for the X Prohibition-- Uh!

310
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,958
Are you okay?

311
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh, you just dropped
your water bottle.

312
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,500
[ANNA]
I'm sorry, I--

313
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,083
I can't take it anymore!

314
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:28,125
We all know this low-down,
dirty dingo did it!

315
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,791
Mister Goriki, you're
wrong about him.

316
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,583
Mister Okuma's not
that kind of boy.

317
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,250
Madame President,
you still don't see it?

318
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,416
Okuma! This is your
handiwork, isn't it?

319
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,041
No, I had--

320
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,250
[RAIKI]
Liar!

321
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,291
Stop this!

322
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,583
I'm telling you.

323
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,833
Mister Okuma would never
do anything like that.

324
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,666
Uh, sorry, I guess.

325
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,458
[ANNA] I apologize for not being
more forthright about this,

326
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,541
but there's no need
for you to worry.

327
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,583
The matter will be
resolved soon enough.

328
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,291
Are you sure, Anna?

329
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,375
[AYAME] In case you hadn't
noticed, Goriki likes Anna.

330
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,833
Though I'm not sure
he even knows it.

331
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,416
[AYAME] That's why he
totally flipped out

332
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,416
when Anna suggested
you join the council,

333
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,750
and why he's had it
in for you ever since.

334
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,125
Now with this stalker situation,

335
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,000
his instincts to protect
Anna have kicked in

336
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,541
and only hardened him.

337
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,500
[TANUKICHI]
Poor Goriki.

338
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,333
Ha! By the way,
in case it wasn't clear,

339
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,208
I meant it hardened his heart,
not his dick, though maybe.

340
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,958
Gee, thanks for clarifying that!

341
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,166
Can't you go five whole
minutes without being gross?

342
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,208
Five holes? That's
a lotta orifices.

343
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,708
[TANUKICHI]
I give up.

344
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,916
The sad thing is: Goriki is
still better off than most.

345
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,500
Ever since the Law for Public
Order was put into place,

346
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,583
all of the ways people used to
express love have been censored.

347
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,916
So eventually,
it got to the point

348
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,541
where they forgot how to love.

349
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,000
Even worse, there are more
and more people who feel love

350
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,791
but don't realize it.

351
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,250
I wonder if that's what
Saotome is dealing with.

352
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,625
[AYAME]
Huh? What do you mean?

353
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,416
Oh. Nevermind. It's
nothing, just-- Uh...

354
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,916
Fuck me!

355
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,166
Shit! Piss! Fuck! Cunt!
Cocksucker! Motherfucker!

356
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,041
Tits! Shit! Piss! Fuck! Cunt!
Cocksucker! Motherfucker!

357
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,500
[TANUKICHI]
Why're you freaking out?!

358
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,500
[AYAME]
It was staring us in the face!

359
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,875
Once you put all
the pieces together,

360
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,750
then there's really
no doubt that Saotome

361
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,375
has got to be Anna's stalker!

362
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,958
She doesn't know how
to show her affection

363
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,416
for Anna in a healthy way,

364
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,708
so she's resorted to sending
creepy letters and photos!

365
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,166
Wait, you don't really believe?

366
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,750
It all makes total sense.
That's why she glared at me

367
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,625
with all the envy of a
horny little virgin boy

368
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,083
eyeing a lacy double-D
brassiere for the first time.

369
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,666
Oh! But if I don't handle this
delicately, I'll ruin my chance

370
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,458
to have her draw dirty, dirty
pornographic pictures for me!

371
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,166
[yells]

372
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,916
[TANUKICHI] Kajo, just calm
down a bit, all right?

373
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,625
[AYAME] Huh? Go down
on your dick all night?

374
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,958
[TANUKICHI] I didn't say that!
Come on, be serious!

375
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,958
Listen to me, I'm telling you

376
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,666
there's no way Saotome
could be Anna's stalker.

377
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,875
[AYAME]
Do you have any proof?

378
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,000
Just my instinct.

379
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,291
Oh, your instinct?

380
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,125
Instinct is crucial.

381
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,666
It's also known
as your "libido."

382
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,958
[TANUKICHI]
That is not what "libido" means!

383
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,750
[AYAME]
Oh, who cares what it means?

384
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,166
The important thing is,

385
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,208
you should trust your instincts
and always act on them.

386
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,583
Which is beautiful.

387
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,750
All right then, I have faith

388
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,916
in your assessment
of Saotome's character.

389
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,541
Wait, are you serious?

390
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,041
Oh, I just had the
greatest idea ever.

391
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,000
We'll trap the stalker and
get Saotome to capitulate.

392
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,916
We can screw both things--
I mean, do both things at once!

393
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,708
Are you cuckoo-banana pants?
You want to lure the stalker?

394
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,916
That's right.

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,333
See, I'm gonna
dress up like a boy

396
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,791
and then go out on a date
with Anna in the park.

397
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,666
When the stalker sees this,
he'll lose his mind,

398
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,500
go mad with pure primal
jealousy, and rush to attack me.

399
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,000
[RAIKI]
It's too dangerous!

400
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,916
I can take care of myself.

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,750
[RAIKI] Then at the very least,
let me be your date.

402
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,500
[AYAME] But you have
no dating experience.

403
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,416
Besides, if you
pose as her date,

404
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,083
the stalker will be too
scared to show himself.

405
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,375
No, you should stay hidden

406
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,791
so you can jump out
when we need your muscle.

407
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,166
[RAIKI groans]

408
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,958
Just in case, Mister Okuma,
you keep watch here.

409
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,791
Oh, okay.

410
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,625
Very interesting.

411
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,875
Well, the two of us will have
to follow them to the park then.

412
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,083
That way, as soon as the
stalker exposes himself,

413
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,791
I shall rescue Anna.

414
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,333
And when I capture
that scoundrel,

415
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,666
I'll capture Anna's
heart, as well,

416
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,916
and then it will
throb only for me.

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,833
Uh, throbbing hearts
are nice and all,

418
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,333
but what exactly
does that have to do

419
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,000
with why you're shaving my legs?

420
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,000
Isn't it obvious?

421
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,208
We've gotta disguise you

422
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,916
so that the stalker
won't suspect anything.

423
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,750
Why am I a girl again?

424
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,666
Hey, pull yourself
together, woman!

425
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,041
We cannot let those
two out of our sight.

426
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,708
[growling]

427
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,333
Darn you, Ayame!

428
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,708
How dare you be so
close to my beloved!

429
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,958
[TANUKICHI]
I hope Anna will be okay.

430
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:04,708
[OTOME breathing heavily]

431
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,875
[screaming]

432
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,041
Who told you you could peek?

433
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,250
What? You have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

434
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,000
I can't believe you call that
a slump. It's beautiful.

435
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,458
[crying]

436
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,875
[TANUKICHI]
Hey! What's wrong?

437
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,416
[OTOME] This is the one way
I have to express my love!

438
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,583
The only pictures I want
to draw are of Anna!

439
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,625
[TANUKICHI]
Huh?

440
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,833
It may sound strange,
but up until recently,

441
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,375
I had never used anybody
as a model for my artwork.

442
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,125
Before, I created
all of my paintings

443
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,541
from images that were floating
around within my mind.

444
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:49,250
But Anna is the first person
I ever really wanted to paint.

445
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,375
Since the day I met her,
I've spent every waking moment

446
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,875
trying to commit
her image to canvas.

447
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,291
But even after
hundreds of attempts,

448
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,666
I still couldn't get it right.

449
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,208
And I could never figure
out what was missing.

450
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,333
I thought if we became
lovers, maybe it'd be clear.

451
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:08,833
But I don't have the ability
to emote outside of my art.

452
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,250
And that's the reason
why I'm in a slump.

453
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,250
My only purpose in life is to
create art, and yet tragically,

454
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,791
all I can do now is desecrate
Anna's image like this!

455
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,500
She must be utterly
disgusted with me!

456
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,875
Saotome.

457
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,375
[rustling]

458
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,333
Saotome? What in the
blazes are you doing here?

459
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,708
Stop loafing about

460
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,500
and start winning our
school some more art shows!

461
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,541
Huh?

462
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,041
Goriki? Where did you come from?

463
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,666
Is that who I-- Wait, Okuma?

464
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,750
[grunts]

465
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:39,958
What're you up to out here?

466
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,375
[TANUKICHI]
Wait, it's not what you think!

467
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,583
[yelling]

468
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,333
Get away from her!

469
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,125
Anna!

470
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,166
[TANUKICHI]
I won't make it!

471
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,000
Eat fist, Twerp!

472
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,541
[STALKER A]
Mama.

473
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,000
Is that man gonna be okay?

474
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, don't you worry.
I got him in his vitals.

475
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,750
I guess, that's Kajo for ya.

476
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,916
[OTOME]
This isn't over yet!

477
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,333
Don't just stand
there, Tanukichi!

478
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,958
Anna, why are you with him?

479
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,708
How could you just throw
away our love like that?

480
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:09,375
Hey, look out!

481
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,083
[OTOME yelling]

[TANUKICHI]
Goriki, catch!

483
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,166
What do I look like--?

484
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,708
[TANUKICHI]
Huh?

485
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,916
Which one was I trying
to save just now?

486
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,583
You tart!

487
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,875
What? Tanuki-- Okuma?

488
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,125
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

489
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,000
[AYAME]
Mister Okuma!

Hurry, call an ambulance! Now!

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,041
I'm on it!

492
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,208
[OTOME]
Wait, what about me?

493
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,500
Isn't there any way
I can save the day?

494
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,583
[ANNA]
What's happened to me?

495
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,250
What is this odd sensation?

496
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,708
[ANNA squeals]

497
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,666
Why do I feel so
warm... down there?

498
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,375
