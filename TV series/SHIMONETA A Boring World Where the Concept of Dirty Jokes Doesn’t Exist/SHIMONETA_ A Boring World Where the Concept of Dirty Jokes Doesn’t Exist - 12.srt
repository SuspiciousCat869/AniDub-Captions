1
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:16,916
[AYAME]
Wait, what?

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,833
Yes. Yes. I see.

3
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,208
Understood.

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,666
'Kay, I'll talk to you
later, Mighty Cock.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,291
Can't you ever just
say goodbye?

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,625
What's wrong? Did
something bad happen?

7
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,541
[AYAME]
That was the coffee shop.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,958
Apparently we just
got an invitation...

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,000
...from Sophia Nishikinomiya.

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,375
Whoa, hold on.

11
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,500
Do you think that means
she knows that we're SOX?

12
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,958
I'm not exactly sure.

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,250
But still...

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,291
...we have no choice.
We have to go.

15
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,708
Just like a hard dick whose
tip is already inside a pussy,

16
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,333
we can't stop now.

17
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,875
[TANUKICHI]
However, at the time,

18
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,083
we still didn't realize it.

19
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,333
None of us could have known
that SOX's biggest crisis...

20
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,041
...was still to come.

21
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,416
Ooh.

22
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,625
So Sophia Nishikinomiya
really invited all of us

23
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,916
to come meet her in Nukumi?

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,125
Nukumi was once a hot
springs district.

25
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,500
From what I gather,

26
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,541
it was a pretty happening
place back in its day,

27
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,916
but now it's been
completely purified.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,875
I hear there are no traces
of its former glory.

29
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,625
[KOSURI]
Hey, what's that?

30
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,208
Oh. Dad gave me this.
Way back when.

31
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,500
[ZENJURO]
Here.

32
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,958
What is it?

33
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,291
When you get older and
you wanna go to Nukumi,

34
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,250
you be sure to bring that
with you, all right, son?

35
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,416
Trust me, you won't regret it.

36
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,500
[AYAME]
Your father is still behind bars

37
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,541
for being an erotic
terrorist, isn't he?

38
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,541
So I wonder--

39
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,166
What do you think this is
supposed to be used for?

40
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,916
[KOSURI] Oh, maybe it's
some kind of adult toy.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,291
Maybe you put Okuma's
banana in that...

42
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,541
[BOTH] ...gaping hole
right there in the center!

43
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,125
Not a chance!

44
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,291
This place has been declared
the nation's purest city.

45
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,833
It's hard to believe
now that it used to be

46
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,458
a debaucherous hot
springs district.

47
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,250
Though, the "pure
city" classification

48
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,958
is really just a title.

49
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,958
It's more of a health resort.

50
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,958
[OTOME] So, is that
Health Land over there?

51
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,250
The place she invited us to.

52
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,416
Yeah, they advertise

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,000
"Health Baths" and
"Health Restaurants".

54
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,833
And it says here that
they're a self-contained,

55
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,666
full-service health
resort that even offers

56
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,375
"Health Sports" and
"Health Rec Rooms."

57
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,541
Huh? "Health Sports"?
"Health Rec Rooms"?

58
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,458
What the health is
that supposed to mean?

59
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,416
[TANUKICHI]
Health Sports include dodgeball,

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,541
triangular base, folk dancing.

61
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,125
Of course, the folk
dancing isn't co-ed.

62
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,625
Meanwhile, the Health Rec Room
features card games, Parcheesi.

63
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,375
And a karaoke
machine fully loaded

64
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,541
with Decency Squad-approved,
morally uplifting songs.

65
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,416
Guests will wake up at
a healthy six a.m. and,

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
before breakfast, perform a
series of healthy exercises.

67
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,833
Curfew is at a healthy nine p.m.

68
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,416
[AYAME] Brown rice, organic
vegetables. MSG-free ramen.

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,250
Ew, gross. It's all so healthy,
I think I'm gonna be sick.

70
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,375
[AYAME] Sheesh, I mean
it's not like I was expecting

71
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,041
Sophia to come out
and welcome us herself.

72
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,250
But come on, it's weird that
nobody's here to greet us,

73
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,291
don't you think?

74
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,750
I don't see any
other guests around,

75
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,166
or anybody who works
here for that matter.

76
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,208
Are we the only
people in this place?

77
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,916
[RAIKI]
Is-Is that?

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,708
Okuma!

79
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,458
Never thought I'd bump into
you here. It must be fate.

80
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,625
Hey, Goriki!

81
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,958
Oh. You must be
Okuma's little sister.

82
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,708
I've heard so much about you.

83
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,041
Oh my goodness,
so you're Goriki.

84
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,875
I hear you and my brother
have become very close.

85
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,708
What? People are saying that?

86
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,791
How embarrassing. Right, Okuma?

87
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,500
Might be a little bit
awkward when the two of us

88
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,416
are alone at a meeting now.

89
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,166
So, what in the heck are
you doing here anyway?

90
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,541
Well, you see,

91
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,208
Anna's mother Sophia
personally invited me to come.

92
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,125
Here, take a look.

93
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,250
This is the same
invitation we received.

94
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,375
What's going on here? Ah!

95
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,625
President Anna?

96
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,916
Oh, um.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,708
I thought I smelled Mister
Okuma's manly scent

98
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,166
wafting through the air, but I
didn't realize he wasn't alone.

99
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,916
Anna, are you the one who
sent us all these invites?

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,041
[ANNA]
N-No. In fact, I'm just here

101
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,416
because I received an
invitation from my mother.

102
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,583
But it's weird. I've
looked all around this place

103
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,833
and I can't seem to
find her anywhere.

104
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,083
So what do you think
we're doing here?

105
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,875
Maybe this is a trap.

106
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:48,750
[ANNA gasps]

107
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,000
[ANNA]
Could it be?!

108
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,083
Is, uh... something wrong Anna?

109
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,291
My mother must've
reserved this entire resort

110
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,833
just for me and Mister Okuma.

111
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:56,875
[OTOME gasps]

112
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,583
[OTOME]
That gives me some ideas!

113
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,875
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's
not what's happening!

114
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,166
Say, whatcha drawing
over there, Saotome?

115
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,583
Hey, Goriki, maybe you and
Okuma should both whip out

116
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,583
your pencils and then
freehand each other.

117
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,375
No, we shouldn't!

118
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,583
[laughing]

119
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,208
No, Okuma and I would
just make a mess!

120
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,958
Huh, I've been trying
to get ahold of my mother

121
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,250
via the PM system
for a while now,

122
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,000
but there's been no response.

123
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,958
Well, there's no need to panic.

124
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,958
Let's just give her a little
more time to contact us.

125
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,000
Good thinking, Mister Goriki.
This is Health Land, after all.

126
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,666
We should all go take
advantage of the Health Bath.

127
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,416
[OTOME] Hey, where's Anna?
This was her idea.

128
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,375
She'd better not be
on the boys' side.

129
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,875
Oh, don't worry.

130
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,125
Tanukichi's not alone,
he's with Goriki.

131
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:42,458
Two unpeeled bananas soaking
side-by-side in a steamy bath?

132
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,208
Inspiration for
my next comic book

133
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,875
is bubbling out of me
like a hot spring!

134

[KOSURI]
Forget that bunch of bananas,

135
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,458
I'm more impressed
by these melons.

136
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,375
Not too big and not too small.

137
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,250
A perfectly proportioned
pair of flotation devices.

138

Hey! Stop that!
Kosuri, stop! Get off me!

139

Ooh! A new fetish!

You knock it off, too, Saotome!

141
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,708

taking his sweet time.

Hey, Goriki, what's the deal?

144
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,666
It took you long enough.
Looks like no one else is here.

145
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,708
We've got the whole
place all to ourselves.

147
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,250

Mister Okuma.

149
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,250
So, uh, where did Goriki go?

[ANNA giggles]

Oh, he's wandering
around the resort

152
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,208
in search of
nonexistent manju buns

153
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,958
that some adorable girl may
have asked him to find for her.

Not cool!

we're alone together.

If you're too loud,

and come over and we wouldn't
want that, now would we?

to come here to Health Land.

He's covered in black panties.

What did you do
to my poor mother?

Nothing. Don't you worry.

is completely different.

to you, I now hold the key

to opening the trove where

the treasure sleeps.

been after this whole time?

that phrase before.

A long time ago at Nukumi,

255
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,708
it was rumored that there
was a mansion in which

256
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,583
all of the treasures of
the country lie sleeping.

"Treasures"? You mean...
like old porno mags and stuff?

Oh, no. Nothing nearly
as trivial as that.

We're talking way
more spectacular.

that's sticking out of your bag?

allow you to access such filth.

Why are you dressed like that?

[OBORO]
I apologize for our appearance.

275
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,541
We fell into a pit and
got completely soaked.

276
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,916
And then, for some reason,
this lingerie was down there.

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,833
There's nowhere for you to
run now. Just give it up.

278
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,625
[chuckles] No, how about
we have a duel instead.

279
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,791
Do you honestly think

280
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,916
that you stand a chance
against all of us?

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,791
Well, since this place used
to be a hot springs district,

282
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,458
I humbly propose that
we use a dueling method

283
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,958
that was popular in the
hot springs of yesteryear.

284

talking about. Oh no.

So what are the rules? Tell us!

287
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,458
We play strip rock, paper,
scissors and after each match,

288
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,500
the loser removes an
article of clothing.

289
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,250
Then, whichever side is stark
naked first, loses the duel.

290
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,875
Hey, but wait a second,
you're wearing like

How's that fair when we're
all wearing next to nothing?

it on wholeheartedly!

to allow your side one victory.

for the chest first.

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,708
was just a little too intense
for a delicate young lady.

318

Oh well, on to the next one.

I'm not afraid.

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,750
Hey, when Goriki strips,
that'll be our chance.

321
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,291
Our chance for what?

322
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,250
Just trust me. And whatever
you do, don't look at Goriki.

Okuma, Ayame, listen!

00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,541
The rest of us will
handle this degenerate.

333

You two focus on taking
that obscenity-unlocking key

and hide it somewhere

Whatever you say, Anna. Thanks.

We can't let you prevail.

By doing what's righteous,

I will finally get the

340
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,000
All right, come on, Tanukichi,

341
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,375
let's go and find that
lascivious pleasure trove.

342
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,708
Okay, so do you
know where to look?

343
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,208
According to legend,

344
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,166
you have to take a cable car
all the way up a mountain.

A cable car?

[TANUKICHI]
I don't see one on the map.

347
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,375
If it's a cable car
that you seek,

348
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,250
I did find a rusted-over
something not too far from here.

Whoa, Fuwa?

00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,000
What're you doing here?

351
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,541
[HYOKA] I came to collect
some unusual insects

352
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,625
that are indigenous
to this area.

353
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,458
Would you like to see them?

354
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,958
Just take us to the cable car.

355
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,791
[AYAME] It doesn't
exactly look operational.

356
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,791
Is there anything
we can do, Fuwa?

357
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,833
Well, I'll take a look at
the switchboard and see.

358
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,333
I couldn't help but notice
your state of dress.

359
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,916
Has your cucumber gone from
its battle-ready stance

360
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,625
to spore releasing yet?

00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,791
So that's why he wanted
to show us this place?

477
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,958
He was only pretending to be
the bad guy, unlike White Peak.

478
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,000
That's why he dressed
up in black panties.

479
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,791
Uh, no. That part was real.

480
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,833
This dude actually has a pretty
serious black panty fetish.

481
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,791
He's kind of a huge freak.

482

So,

486
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,000
what're we supposed to
do with the treasure?

487
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,166
The world isn't quite ready
to behold its beauty yet.

488
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,541
We have to preserve this,
for future generations to find.

489
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,875
[OTOME]
In that case,

490
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,958
what do you say we leave
our signature behind, too?

491
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,125
Some sign we were here?

492
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,375
Took you long enough.
I was worried about you.

493
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,916
Sorry 'bout that.

494
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,291
Oh, I see that you
made it back already.

495
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,541
So go on, tell us
what was up there?

496
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,833
Something graphic and
disgusting, no doubt.

497
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,166
Well, no.

498
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,000
Actually, there was nothing
disgusting up there.

499
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,791
In fact, it was
quite... lovely.

500
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,166
Oh, wow, really?
Well, that's a big relief.

[ANNA]
Miss Tsukimigusa!

503
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,708
That cable car was used
by co-ed passengers

504
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,250
and I fear it may have
even been designed

505
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,375
for indecent co-ed
fraternization.

506
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,291
It was lewd and
had to be destroyed.

507
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, if it wasn't before,

508
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,750
that secret stash will
be protected now.

509
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,291
I wonder when that treasure
will see the light of day.

510
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,708
Hopefully, it won't
have to wait long.

511
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,083
Maybe we can't know
when, but still...

512
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,666
...I do know that
this boring world

513
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,083
where the concept of
dirty jokes doesn't exist

514
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,208
has gotta end someday.

515
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,416
And until then...
we'll keep fighting.

For decades,

"The Law for Public
Order and Morals

in Healthy Child-Raising"
has banned all sexual content.

521
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,791
This has turned
Japan into the country

522
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,458
with the healthiest
public morality on Earth.

But there are subversives
who would dare oppose

this brave new world
free of naughty thoughts.
