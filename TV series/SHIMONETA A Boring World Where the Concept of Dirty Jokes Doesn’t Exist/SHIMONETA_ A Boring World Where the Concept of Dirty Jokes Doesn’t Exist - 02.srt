The first time I terrorized

I got such a rush down there,

PM use mandatory,

159
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:04,000
soon made it impossible to view
unclean material, even online.

160
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,875
No matter how people
tried to download it,

161
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,750
the government would know.

162
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,166
In a final act,

163
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,250
the government deleted
peoples' personal collections,

164
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,791
using their PMs to tap
into their hard drives,

165
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,875
as well as retrieve information
on the whereabouts

166
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:20,083
of any remaining real
world hidden stashes.

167
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,000
[TANUKICHI] Finding paper
media in this day and age

168
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,416
is like finding buried treasure.

169
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,958
[TANUKICHI]
Is this it?

170
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,041
[TANUKICHI]
Elaborate hiding spot.

171
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,708
[TANUKICHI gasps]

172
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,750
[TANUKICHI]
Don't look at it!

173
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,750
[TANUKICHI] This is the last
time I do Ayame's dirty work.

174
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,500
After this, I'm back on the
path to good moral hygiene,

175
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,333
right alongside Anna.

176
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,458
In the pink or in the
stink, with this one?

177
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,458
For the last time,
I'm not looking.

178
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,666
[AYAME]
We'll hide them in the places

179
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,750
where the staff won't look,

180
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,083
but where students
have easy access.

181
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,000
[TANUKICHI]
Please forgive me, Anna.

182
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,916
[TANUKICHI] The whole reason
I came to Tokioka academy

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,125
in the first place was to
clean my mind of filth.

184
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,333
So why is this happening?

185
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,375
[TANUKICHI gasps]

186
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,916
Isn't it a lovely morning?

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,833
Want to discuss the process
of bodymelding with me?

188
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,750
Uh, you know, I'm a member
of the Student Council.

189
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,041
I can't talk about that.

190
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,208
I am aware of your
rank and status, yes.

191
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,791
Are you aware that I'm
an aspiring scientist?

192
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,250
Therefore, it pleases me greatly

193
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,125
to see the data from the video
support my hypothesis.

194
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,708
And that to achieve this result,

195
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,916
Blue Snow made use of
my personal test flies.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,166
How are you able to tell they
were your flies in the video?

197
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,916
There are several
observations I made

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,416
that lead me to that conclusion.

199
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,375
For starters, the
female's leg spasms

200
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,958
at the peak of melding match
those of my Specimen 43 exactly.

201
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:06,916
And the male's pen--

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,458
[sighs]

203
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,541
The cucumber slipped into
her ripened peach so easily,

204
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:17,000
I was certain the male half
of the duo was... Specimen 53.

205
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,291
So, what do you think,
Mister Okuma?

206
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,875
Shall we assume male and
female humans bodymeld

207
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,333
the same way as flies?

208
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,041
Uh, no comment.

209
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,833
[AYAME] We gotta aim lower.
Beyond old dirty pictures.

210
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,583
If I had a magic wand
between my legs,

211
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,458
we'd be papering the school with
a buncha new dirty pictures.

212
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,541
But it's too risky to try
making that dream a reality.

213
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,500
Even if you tried
drawing something vulgar,

214
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,000
the PM would follow
your hand movements,

215
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,666
and from that alone, determine
you had broken the law.

216
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,458
The fact is they would
send us to prison

217
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,958
just for a drawing a bum bum.

218
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,541
In the good old days,

219
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,458
they could digitally remove the
grass on an actress's garden,

220
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,791
or enlarge an actor's mushroom 

221
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,208
so viewers could see what
was being played with.

222
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,666
Back then, people cared
about making others happy.

223
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,041
Our country used to suck,
now we just blow.

224
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,791
It's not our country that's
gotten worse, it's your brain.

225
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,750
They even lock up little kids
for saying the wrong thing.

226
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,041
Treat 'em like monsters just
for saying "fur burger."

227
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,166
It's a new Dark Age.

228
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,250
They act like dirty jokes
are worse than murder.

229
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,625
[ANNA]
There's a new problem.

230
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,875
Students have been finding
actual paper copies

231
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,833
of old unhealthy pictures
all over the school.

232
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,208
[TANUKICHI] I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me, Anna.

233
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:25,916
[TANUKICHI gasps]

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,416
We cannot stand idly by

235
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,458
while our campus is overrun
by pictures of potty parts.

236
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,750
The faculty has been warning
that our school physicals,

237
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,250
when we're at our
most vulnerable,

238
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,208
could be the next
target of terrorism!

239
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,583
As the Student Council,

240
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,916
we must declare a schoolwide
moral emergency-- Huh?

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,208
Tanukichi, you look like
something's bothering you.

242
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,041
Uh, yeah, that picture...

243
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,333
I think...

244
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,416
Isn't it pretty?

245
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,000
I found it in the shoe closet.

246
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,208
No one said it was theirs,
so I took it and framed it

247
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,625
to add a little culture
to our council meetings.

248
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,583
Anna, I think that picture is...

249
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,083
I think it's one of the unclean
pictures you were talking about

250
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,958
that the perv-terrorists
left around the school.

251
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,291
[ANNA]
What?! That's unclean?!

252
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,083
All I see is a peasant girl
about to enjoy a mid-day snack

253
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,916
in the form of a
thick black mushroom.

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,958
The only thing that
puzzles me, though.

255
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,250
Is why she isn't using
her hands to eat it.

256
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,625
Must be some kind of
traditional party game.

257
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,458
[RAIKI]
Uh--

258
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,791
Hey... I'm not the only one

259
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,833
who thought that was just
a rotten banana, right?

260
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,125
Oh, big surprise. Goriki always
has bananas on the brain.

261
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,416
That's not true, I hate bananas.

262
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,458
I'll take your word for it,

263
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,250
but I still don't
understand why it's lewd.

264
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,625
You're up.

265
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,125
Go explain to her what that
mushroom's really about.

266
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,083
Are you crazy?
I can't tell her that!

267
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,958
Then perhaps the gorilla and I
should give her a demonstration.

268
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,583
What's wrong with you?
Don't demonstrate anything!

269
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,041
Well, didn't take
long for you two

270
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,666
to become bosom buddies, did it?

271
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,208
We're just friends,
nothing more.

272
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,041
I'm glad you get along so well.
Ayame might seem a bit cold

273
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,083
at first, but once you get her
warmed up, you'll find that

274
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,500
she's just a big softie inside.

275
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,500
Can we change the subject?

276
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,708
I'll give you an example.

277
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,500
One time she tried to
pick up a stray cat

278
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,375
but it scratched
her and she cried.

279
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,125
Also if you tickle her
too hard, she'll--

280
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,166
[AYAME]
Stop it!

281
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,750
Hey, this is Student
Council treason!

282
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,541
I don't need a constitutional
law lecture from you, Gorilla,

283
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,375
now help me tape Chatty
Cathy's mouth shut!

284
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,875
You know that's not my name!

285
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,375
How much you want for your help?
A dozen bananas? A crate?

286
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,833
A Costa Rican crop in your name?

287
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,708
How many times do
I have to say this?

288
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,333
I. Hate. Bananas!

289
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,958
This sounds strange,
Mister Okuma,

290
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,458
but since you became a member,

291
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,791
Student Council proceedings
have never been more civil.

292
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,083
Good work today, everyone.

293
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,958
[AYAME]
Why're you blushing, Creeper?

294
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,375
I don't wanna cause
Anna any more stress.

295
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,791
I mean, she's way too
sweet and pure for that.

296
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,000
That ain't your heart
talking, that's your dink.

297
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,541
Yeah? Well what about you?

298
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,125
I think you're upset
because Anna knows

299
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,541
how to put you in your place.

300
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,958
She didn't rise as far
as she has by being dumb.

301
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,875
And because she wields
her intellect with a smile,

302
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,041
she's bullet proof.

303
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,458
If Anna were to snap,

304
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,416
there's no telling the suffering
that would befall us.

305
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,166
Wow, talk about dramatic.

306
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,750
I know you're just
trying to scare me,

307
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,041
so that I'll do more
of your dirty work.

308
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,541
So why don't we just shake hands
and go our separate ways, okay?

309
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,166
Is it really so bad that
everyone's clean and polite?

310
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,250
You idiot! Don't you
watch the news?

311
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,166
[TANUKICHI]
Huh?

312
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,666
The X Prohibition Law.

313
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,250
Anna's mother is the activist,
Sophia Nishikinomiya,

314
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,541
and the whole thing's
her pet legislation.

315
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,458
Wait, hold on, what
is Anna's mom doing?

316
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,625
She's president of
the national PTA.

317
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,791
She also happens to be
the wife of the politician

318
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,958
behind the original Law for
Public Order and Morals.

319
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,791
I had no idea Anna came
from such an elite family.

320
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,375
Under the new X Prohibition Law

321
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,791
the Nishikinomiyas
are proposing,

322
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,083
the government would
receive even broader powers

323
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,625
to use PMs to record
anyone underage.

324
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,125
Bad words have always
set off the PMs.

325
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,791
How's this new
thing any different?

326
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,666
It's not different,
it's way worse.

327
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,833
They're gonna monitor every
part of our daily lives,

328
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,750
forget just the dirty talk.

329
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,750
Let's say you're out and about

330
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,291
and you see a hot
chick's armpit,

331
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,250
only it's hairy and
reminds you of her pussy,

332
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,875
so you start stroking your cock,

333
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,500
to get the poison out before it
backs up, and hurts your brain.

334
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,166
With the new law,
they'd be able to record

335
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,833
how many strokes it took for
you to pop to that armpit girl!.

336
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,333
'Course, I bet part
of you's excited

337
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,541
at the thought of being
watched like that.

338
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,583
As if!

339
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,916
And that's just
the tip of the penis

340
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,208
for how things will get
if we let that become law.

341
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,125
I may manipulate you
to serve my agenda,

342
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,500
but at least I'm rational about
where our society's headed.

343
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,208
Worst of all is if
this law passes,

344
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,916
SOX won't be able to educate
the students, even on the sly.

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Imagine the whole country slowly
filling up with know-nothings.

346
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,625
Like that Hyoka Fuwa girl?

347
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,291
Don't forget Anna.

348
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,666
She looks at a dirty picture and
sees a girl tasting a mushroom.

349
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,458
That is not the brain of
a normal, healthy teenager.

350
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,708
[SOPHIA] Oh, honey, I hate to
hear you struggling like this.

351
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,166
But until the X Prohibition
Law goes into effect,

352
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,625
you have to be strict.

353
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,958
Everything you do is for
the students' own good.

354
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,583
It's the only way
to keep them safe.

355
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,791
[ANNA] Right. I won't let
you down again, Mother.

356
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,666
After last week,
I've learned my lesson.

357
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,333
I'm so glad to hear that, Anna.

358
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,333
We must purify Japan
of all talk that is dirty.

359
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,125
It's the first step to
a truly healthy world.

360
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,166
Yes, as you wish.

361
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,333
[AYAME] Well, Tanukichi, have
you come up with any good ideas

362
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,666
for dirty terror attacks
during the school physicals?

363
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,083
Of course not.

364
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,083
Well, since they're for
new students like yourself,

365
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,083
your body will be
thoroughly examined.

366
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,708
Now that I think about it, you
may actually want to go ahead

367
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,083
and start warming up your loins.

368
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,250
Why would this news have
me acting like an animal?

369
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,541
'Cause you'll be nude.

370
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,250
When I say "thorough,"
I'm talking about them

371
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,000
poking their heads and fingers
up in every nook and cranny.

372
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,500
And since you're such a pervert,

373
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,166
the mere thought of that must
have you harder than trig.

374
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,333
Not true!

375
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,958
And for the record,
I've had physicals,

376
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,708
there's nothing
erotic about them.

377
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,791
They just measure your--

378
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:25,958
Dick with a ruler?

379
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,583
Height and weight!

380
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,708
Yeah, but dick measuring
might be a good idea

381
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,916
for gender equality.

382
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,458
Otherwise, it's so not fair

383
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,125
that the girls have
to measure their tits.

384
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,375
No fudging way!

385
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,458
Well, well, Tanukichi,
if I didn't know better,

386
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,958
I'd say you've got a tiny
secret you're trying to hide.

387
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,416
Dick size is often counter
to the slack in the sack.

388
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,083
I assume then with your teeny
peenie, you've got big bouncies.

389
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,625
They're both completely average!

390
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,166
Well, I understand
there's a margin of error

391
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,875
due to different
methods of measurement.

392
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,208
Let's sabotage the physicals

393
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,041
by adding protein
to the urine samples.

394
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,625
Why would we do that?

395
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,291
To get the faculty quaking in
their undergarments, of course!

396
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,500
Imagine the scandal if
test tube after test tube

397
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,125
was full of pee with the protein
of a New York strip steak!

398
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,583
They'd be sweating like you
watching Anna pick up a pencil.

399
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,083
That doesn't make any sense.

400
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,583
Protein in the pee-pee samples

401
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,791
would indicate that all of
the new boys were jacking off

402
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,000
in the shower each morning
before coming to school.

403
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,375
I'm done helping you!

404
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,000
Come on, like those old
comedies used to joke about.

405
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,500
Guys would say,

406
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,416
"Jacking it in the shower is
the best part of waking up!"

407

What kind of movies
are you watching?

408
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,375
Also, I thought your whole goal
was to educate students,

409
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,333
not gross them out!

410
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,916
Oh, that reminds me.

411
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,958
I have an idea about how to turn
the vision test into a lesson.

You're gonna love this.

414
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,333
A way for us to
say naughty things

00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,041
without the PMs or
faculty ever knowing.

00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,208
You're finished, Blue Snow!

468
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,500
All right, Creep!

469
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,375
Tell me where you're
keeping the spiked urine!

470
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,416
[ANNA]
Goriki, no!

471
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,041
Blue Snow's a woman and
that man looks like a man!

472
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,166
Trust me, I'm a man.

473
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,958
We fell right into her trap.

474
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,500
[TANUKICHI]
Don't do this, Tanukichi.

475
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,375
Stop following her.

476
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:52,916
But... why do I... Why am
I getting all... tingly?

477
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,583
It's like, I know what I'm doing
is wrong, but doing it feels...

478
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,958
It... feels so fantastic!

479
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,291
[TANUKICHI
 Let's begin!

480
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,416
To make babies, the man's
penis goes in the...?

481
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,458
[FEMALE STUDENTS]
"Va."

482
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,708
[MALE STUDENTS]
"Gi."

483
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,041
"Hunh"?

484
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,250
[STUDENT C]
What's a "vaggin"?

485
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,208
[TANUKICHI] There's more!
This is the last syllable!

486
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,791
[ANNA] We're flushing
your toilet talk, Blue Snow!

487
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,083
[TANUKICHI]
Anna?!

488
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,625
[TANUKICHI gasps, screams]

489
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,583
No... you... don't!

490
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,000
If Anna were to snap,

491
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,458
there's no telling the
suffering that would befall us.

492
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,666
[TANUKICHI]
She wasn't kidding!

493
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,750
--[TANUKICHI grunts]
--[ANNA screams]

494
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,666
[ANNA]
After her!

495
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,291
[TEACHER A]
Where's Blue Snow?

496
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,833
[TEACHER C]
Upstairs!

497
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:52,958
[TANUKICHI]
Oh, shoot!

498
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,333
[ANNA]
Stop in the name of decency!

499
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:03,916
[ANNA]
Fudge!

500
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,708
[TANUKICHI yelps]

501
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,833
[pants]

502
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,708
[ANNA]
I know you're here.

503
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,416
[TANUKICHI] Oh crap,
oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!

504
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,916
Have any last words?

505
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,458
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

506
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,125
--[TANUKICHI] Mommy!
--[ANNA chuckling]

507
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,875
[ANNA]
Now, expose yourself.

508
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,875
[beeping]

509
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,875
[BOTH gasp]

510
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,166
[AYAME]
Anna, it's a trap.

511
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,208
That's not Blue Snow.
It's a decoy.

512
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,583
How do you know that?

513
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,958
[AYAME] Because the real
Blue Snow's on the gym roof!

514
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,041
[ANNA gasps]

515
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,125
[BOTH gasp]

516
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,125
[AYAME laughing]

517
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm taking all of the boys'
urine samples with me!

518
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,166
I hope you enjoy reading
their lab results!

519
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,625
[laughing]

520
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,166
Save the urine!

521
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,416
[sighs]

522
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,250
That was too close.

523
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,625
[GIRL]
Well, well, well...

524
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,875
What an amusing thing
I've just witnessed.

525
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:54,333
