1
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,708
[AYAME] Are you guys ready
for this war to get hardcore?

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,416
Yeah, you already
said that last time.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
SOX is finally going all
the way, full-tilt to the hilt,

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,958
and I for one am
covered in goose bumps!

5
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,125
[AYAME chuckles]

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,708
Those Prefects oughta
brace themselves.

7
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,958
Like a bride on
her wedding night.

8
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,708
So, this big, risky idea that
you were telling us about,

9
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,333
what exactly does it entail?

10
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,958
[AYAME]
Good question.

11
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,708
The first thing that we'll need
to put this plan into motion is:

12
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,666
A pair of Tanukichi's
dirty drawers.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,833
[TANUKICHI]
Uh?!

14
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,458
[NARRATOR]
The future. Japan.

15
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,833
For decades, "The Law for
Public Order and Morals

16
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,125
in Healthy Child-Raising"
has banned all sexual content.

17
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,708
This law against libidinous
language, in combination

18
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,916
with the Peacemaker
surveillance technology,

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,833
has turned what used
to be an island nation

20
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,708
of anything-goes sexual
deviancy into the country

21
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,250
with the healthiest
public morality on Earth.

22
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,083
But, among the douched masses,

23
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,000
are subversives who would dare
oppose this brave new world

24
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,291
free of naughty thoughts.

25
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,541
This is the story of
these sick miscreants!

26
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,416
[AYAME]
Cock and balls!

27
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,083
[TANUKICHI]
Why is this happening?

28
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,000
The reason why the underwear
thieves keep returning

29
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:03,250
to Tokioka Academy to steal
our undies is the smell.

30
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,083
[TANUKICHI]
Huh? The smell?

31
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,500
Yeah, because at
this time of year,

32
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,666
teenagers' underpants
get so dank and sweaty

33
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,458
that they produce a
very pungent odor.

34
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,583
So, we'll use these
musty undies as a weapon

35
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,166
to attack Gathered Fabric's
already highly aroused

36
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,000
"down there" organs!

37
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,333
[KOSURI]
Hm.

38
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,458
Down where, exactly?!
Halfway down their faces?!

39
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,583
Please say it's their noses!

40
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,125
Oh, just calm down.

41
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:27,625
Now then, take a deep breath
for me... and exhale...

42
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,291
...and cum in your pants.

43
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,083
Hey! Don't try to hypnotize me!

44
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,416
All I'm saying is that
we'll use your aromatic,

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,000
sweat-soaked boxers as bait
to lure the bandits out.

46
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, man, what am
I doing with my life?

47
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,416
[OTOME]
"Okuma!

48
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,916
Just clear your mind and
focus yourself on my banana."

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,958
"Oh, Goriki! My dirty underwear
is touching your banana!"

50
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,583
"Okuma, make my smelly
banana smell even smellier--"

51
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,708
[KOSURI] Hey, Saotome.
Quit babbling to yourself

52
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,750
like a lunatic and get
back to work before I--

53
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,291
[OTOME]
Silence! I'm in the zone!

54
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,708
I must let this genius
pour out of me now!

55
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,833
[panting]

56
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,583
[KOSURI] Sheesh, why am I the
one who's stuck doing this?

57
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,541
All right, in order
to carry out this plan,

58
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,500
we're going to split
up into two teams.

59
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,958
The first team
will hide porno mags

60
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,166
all around the school perimeter.

61
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,000
We'll call them Team Engorged
Clitoris as a codename.

62
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,041
[TANUKICHI] But you're the
only one who can say that!

63
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,625
Oh, fine then, I guess we'll
just call them Team Prong.

64
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,625
Is that better for you?

65
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,666
Like I was saying,
Team Prong's mission

66
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,958
will be to plant dirty
magazines outside Tokioka.

67
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,583
Kosuri and Saotome,
that'll be your position.

68
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,541
Hey, wait, why can't I be
on the same team as you?

69
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,208
[AYAME]
Meanwhile, the other team

70
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,375
is going to penetrate
the school's interior.

71
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,208
And our codename will be
Team Cum Inside, okay?

72
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,916
[TANUKICHI] Again, that
name won't do us any good

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,583
if you're the only
one who can say it!

74
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,541
[AYAME] All right,
whatever. Team Tuck-In.

75
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,791
That's gonna be
me and Tanukichi.

76
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,708
I'll dress up as
Blue Snow and scatter

77
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,833
deliciously filthy pictures
throughout the halls

78
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,625
in order to distract
the Prefects.

79
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,958
And while that's going on,

80
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,500
Tanukichi will catch
the underwear thieves.

81
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,458
Besides embarrassing
the Prefects,

82
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,375
we'll also get to show
everybody that SOX

83
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,125
isn't aligned with
Gathered Fabric.

84
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,166
[KOSURI]
Huh?

85
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,291
It sounds like
you'll be taking on

86
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,875
most of the risk
yourself, Ayame.

87
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,375
[AYAME]
Oh, don't worry about me.

88
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,458
Tanukichi's soiled skivvies
will keep me nice and safe.

89
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,583
Well, you'll see what
I mean tomorrow.

90
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,000
[OTOME]
"Okuma!"

91
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,375
"Oh, Goriki! We can't!
Please don't touch me there!"

92
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,500
[KOSURI] Darn it, Team Tuck-In
gets to have all the fun.

93
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,958
It's not right.

94
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,166
By now, I should've already
hijacked Okuma's position

95
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,291
in the SOX hierarchy.

96
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,666
[AYAME]
Listen up, boys!

97
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,041
It's time for you to receive
Blue Snow's divine blessing!

98
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,583
Evening pussy juice,
fresh squeezed!

99
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,666
Drink it all up, boys!

100
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,708
[MALE STUDENTS cheering]

101
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,875
Blue Snow just showed
up outta nowhere.

102
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,541
She's thrown the entire
school into chaos.

103
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,500
Now's the perfect time
to snatch some undies.

104
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,916
Guess it's starting.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,875
[beeping]

106
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,291
Hey, Okuma, where
the heck are you?

107
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,958
[TANUKICHI] Uh, I'm out
patrolling with Kajo.

108
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,000
So, uh, think Blue
Snow's behind this?

109
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,250
[RAIKI]
Absolutely.

110
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,125
As soon as the ruckus
started, I spotted her.

111
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,500
Listen, there's a
ton of disgusting

112
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,125
and indecent material out here.

113
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,208
I need you to come and
help me clean it up!

114
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,416
[TANUKICHI]
Got it!

115
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,291
Wait. What? Kajo?

116
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,291
Uh, sorry, Goriki!

117
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,375
Kajo's chasing after
somebody we suspect

118
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,250
is one of the underwear thieves.

119
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,916
He could be dangerous.
I should help.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,125
[AYAME] As long as my
wings don't fall off,

121
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,375
as long as dicks don't fall off,
as long as we have hearts,

122
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,583
as long as we have pussies,
I can fly anywhere!

123
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,833
[AYAME laughing]

124
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,625
[TANUKICHI]
I feel like such an idiot.

125
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,541
I mean, can I really lure them
here with just my scent?

126
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,291
[gasps]

127
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,125
[TANUKICHI]
There's two of them?

128
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,833
[TANUKICHI] Oh yeah, that's
definitely Gathered Fabric!

129
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,166
I can't believe
they actually came.

130
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,375
[TANUKICHI]
Don't move! Hands in the air!

131
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,375
[TANUKICHI]
Huh?

132
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,750
[TANUKICHI]
Anna?!

Mister Okuma.

134
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,125
The sweetest scent
lured me here.

135
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:36,041
At last you show me that
you're ready to accept my love.

136
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,083
[TANUKICHI]
Uhh...

137
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,666
[ANNA]
You sent me a signal.

138
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,791
A delicious fragrance
that only I can smell.

139
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,583
Uh, I, um, I'm not--

140
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,041
[TANUKICHI screaming]

141
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,541
Oh, I am so... ecstatic.

142
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:55,541
My love for you is once again
flowing out of me like a geyser!

143
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,791
[ANNA screaming]

144
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,458
[TANUKICHI]
Hey, wait, Miss Tsukimigusa,

145
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,541
Why aren't you stopping this?
Aren't you a Prefect?

146
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,791
Yes, but Mister Matsukage
has instructed me

147
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,583
to prioritize the
desires of Miss Anna

148
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,083
over all other directives.

149
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,000
So ping pong balls and
toilet paper are lewd,

150
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,125
but what she's doing isn't?

151
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,250
--[ANNA yelps]
--[squelches]

152
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,666
[TANUKICHI]
Uh! Get off!

153
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,458
Mister Okuma's voice is
vibrating all throughout my body

154
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,500
and it feels absolutely amazing!

155
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,458
[TANUKICHI] This is all
a big misunderstanding!

156
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,041
I didn't do any of this for you!

157
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,500
It was a trap!

158
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,791
It was just supposed to lure
out the underwear thieves!

159
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,875
[ANNA]
Hm?

160
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,125
So these boxer
shorts weren't a gift

161
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,833
intended to thank me
for all my affection?

162
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,583
Or to signify your willingness
to finally reciprocate

163
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,333
those romantic feelings?

164
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,750
On the contrary...

165
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,458
Oh. That's disappointing.

166
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,500
Yes, well, I still
need some bait

167
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,250
to catch the underwear
thief, so if I could just

168
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,125
--have these back.
--No, I won't give them up!

169
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,708
I've done so much to try
and win your heart.

170
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,458
Don't I deserve some kind
of reward for my efforts?

171
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,125
[sobs]

172
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,541
Oh, come on!

173
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,458
You can't honestly tell me
that that doesn't qualify

174
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,208
as indecent behavior!

175
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,625
Tell her to stop!

176
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,875
I thought I made
myself clear earlier.

177
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,833
I'm required to put Anna's
wishes ahead of everything else.

178
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,250
Mister Matsukage was
explicit about that.

179
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,000
[TANUKICHI] Does logic
even exist on your planet?

180
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,208
[OBORO]
When he gave me this assignment,

181
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,666
Mister Matsukage
stipulated five provisions.

182
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,541
Huh? Like what?

183
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,041
Well, number one,
I must keep secret

184
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,166
any information that
could taint young boys.

185
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,541
As well as any intelligence

186
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,041
gathered by a
government organization.

187
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,000
Number two, entrance
into Anna's bedroom,

188
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,875
bathroom, or any place
she might undress,

189
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,083
is strictly prohibited
at all times.

190
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,000
Number three, while
obeying Provision two,

191
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,666
I am never supposed to
leave Miss Anna's side

192
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,250
whenever obscene acts
are taking place.

193
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,541
Number four, I am to
shield Miss Anna's eyes

194
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,958
from anything lewd
or lascivious.

195
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,500
Number five,

196
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,791
taking numbers one, two, three,
and four into consideration,

197
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,291
ignore them all
if they in any way

198
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,541
conflict with Miss
Anna's desires.

199
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,333
Like the "Three Laws of
Robotics" but effed-up?

200
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,500
[OBORO]
That's not all.

201
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,875
He also told me that I
have to protect Miss Anna

202
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,916
from any lustful acts that
may be inflicted upon her.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,583
However, if she for any reason

204
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,000
wants to initiate such
activities herself,

205
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,708
then I'm not authorized
to stop her.

206
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,041
[TANUKICHI]
In other words,

207
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,750
if Anna wants to poke at
my dick, that's just fine.

208
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,500
But if I were to
grope Anna's melons,

209
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:30,958
Tsukimigusa would
poke my eyes out?

210
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,583
Well, that hardly seems fair.

211
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,625
[footsteps]

212
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,666
[gasps]

213
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,875
[STUDENT A] Boxers ripe for
the taking? It's our lucky day!

214
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,541
[STUDENT B] Good thing
we followed our noses!

215
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,375
It's Gathered Fabric.

216
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:51,083
[ANNA] Mister Okuma's intimates.
My precious reward.

217
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,833
They'll pay for this!

218
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,541
Miss Tsukimigusa, let's go
catch those little thieves

219
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,666
and get back my musky undies!

220
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,791
[OBORO]
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,791
[ANNA] Get back here!
Give me back my boxer shorts!

222
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,166
Huh?!

223
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,500
So while I was doing
all kinds of grueling work

224
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,208
for Team Prong and you were
putting yourself in danger,

225
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,875
that loser got his underpants
stolen and failed?

226
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,291
[AYAME]
No.

227
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,125
Tanukichi didn't fail at all.
This is what I wanted.

228
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,500
[KOSURI]
Uh?

229
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,583
[AYAME] As a reward for
a job well done, Tanukichi,

230
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,291
you may boil or grill Saotome's
feet, whichever you prefer.

231
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,708
[OTOME] Hey, how did my name get
dragged into this conversation?

232
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,625
Kosuri's reports made one
thing very clear to me.

233
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,875
You were goofing off out there,

234
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,875
drawing when you
should've been working.

235
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,875
[OTOME] You little snitch!
How dare you rat me out!

236
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,625
[WAITER] I most humbly apologize
for keeping you waiting.

237
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,083
I have one large sugar water

238
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,208
and one "forbidden
switch" for you, ma'am.

239
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,083
[OTOME]
Wait. What is that?

240
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,666
What are you doing?

241
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,875
No, Stop it! Let me go
right now! Unhand me!

242
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,041
[AYAME]
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

243
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,541
[laughing]

244
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,000
Here. Give it a try, Tanukichi.

245
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,958
I'll pass. So that was
your plan all along?

246
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,125
[AYAME]
Yup!

247
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,916
We'll have Anna
off our tails now.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,583
Yeah, she'll be way
too preoccupied

249
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,000
with that pair of your
dirty crotch-warmers.

250
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,583
[AYAME] Lately, you've caused
Anna's sexual frustration

251
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,291
to reach its peak.

252
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,750
Like a dick that could
rupture at any minute

253
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,916
because it's been a week
since it was jerked off.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,250
[TANUKICHI]
It doesn't "rupture"!

255
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,083
And besides, Anna
doesn't even have one.

256
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,333
I knew if we hung up
your stank undies,

257
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,875
Anna's superhuman senses
would lead her right to them.

258
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,500
But your pheromones
were effective

259
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,250
beyond my wildest dreams!

260
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,166
[TANUKICHI]
What am I, a virgin sacrifice?

261
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,125
[AYAME] That's it.
The foreplay ends here.

262
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,083
Now we go all the way.

263
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,833
So let's talk about
Phase Two of the plan.

264
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,208
Team Prong will again be
in charge of distributing

265
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,875
dirty magazines all around
the school perimeter.

266
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,833
Is that clear, Saotome?

267
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,833
[laughing]

268
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,166
Meanwhile, those of
us on Team Tuck-In,

269
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,041
we're setting the real trap.

270
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,666
And this time we're gonna catch
Gathered Fabric in the act.

271
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,500
We'll leave Saotome's panties
in the middle of the school.

272
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,916
How'd you get those?!

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,916
[laughing]

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,958
[AYAME] These teddy bear
panties will be the bait

275
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,541
in our bear trap.

276
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,166
I'm counting on you, okay?

277
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,833
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

278
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,041
[AYAME]
Here, take a closer look

279
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,500
so you know what
you're working with.

280
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,666
[KOSURI] So I'm just stuck
being on the outside again?

281
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,958
Why does she trust
that loser so much?

282
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,000
No way!

283
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,833
[AYAME] Listen up, boys! Receive
Blue Snow's divine blessing!

Resist the urge, boys! Fight it!

that filth! Avert your eyes!

[TANUKICHI] Who'd've thought
all those wrestling matches

293
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,125
with Anna would come in handy?

294
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,875
Well, one down.

quite the action-packed day.

his fellow deviant?

Hey, wait! Get back here!

the Tokioka student storming
of Yatsuga Forest, aren't you?

306
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,166
[HYOKA] I have no idea
to what you are referring.

307
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,750
I am currently in the middle
of watching the birds docking.

308
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,916
So, would you kindly leave
me alone, whoever you are.

That's not nice.

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,083
And I was about to do you a
colossal favor and tell you

311
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,416
how you could get even more
directly involved with SOX

312
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,208
if only you'd lend me your ears.

313
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,333
Please, just for a second.

314
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,291
[HYOKA] The impeccable
timing of your smile

315
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,708
and that little
tilt of your head,

316
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,500
combined with the way
you clasp your hands

317
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,208
and the sweet squeak
of your voice,

318
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,500
your every mannerism
is deliberately designed

319
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,791
to charm your target.

320
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,166
You must be quite intelligent.

321
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,083
[KOSURI]
Hmph.

322
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,666
Wow, you're even more
hardcore than I expected.

323
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,166
To be able to size
me up that quickly?

324
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,416
[HYOKA]
So who do you work for?

325
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,291
[KOSURI]
I am an official member of SOX.

326
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,333
In order to get relief
from all of the tension

327
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,625
that society imposes on us,

328
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,875
I'd suggest you take
action right away.

329
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,041
[TANUKICHI]
All right, that's ten down.

330
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,666
[TANUKICHI]
Although,

331
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,458
seems like things are going
a little too smoothly.

332
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,583
Why was it so easy for
me to catch this many?

333
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:39,375
[alarm blaring]

334
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,583
[TANUKICHI]
Is it a fire? What's happening?

335
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,625
[door opens]

336
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,916
[TANUKICHI]
Crap! More Gathered Fabric?

337
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,250
So be it!

338
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,916
Enjoy my father's ultra-lethal
uber-secret move.

339
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,750
[TANUKICHI]
Electric Massage!

340
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,416
[TANUKICHI]
Look, don't blame me.

341
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,833
It's your own fault
for being so stubborn.

342
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,250
Uh?

343
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,500
Is that... Tsukimigusa?
What the heck's going on here?

344
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,000
What does it... look like...?

345
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,208
[TANUKICHI]
So, you're a dude?

346
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,875
Yes. That is correct.

347
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,833
[TANUKICHI] Then why were
you pretending to be a girl?

348
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,291
[OBORO] Another of
Mister Matsukage's orders.

349
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,583
He thought my mission would
go more smoothly this way

350
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,916
and that as a girl,

351
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,125
I'd be able to enter both
male and female spaces

352
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,875
and better suppress vulgarity.

353
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,625
And, of course, it's
possible he was also thinking

354
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,458
that if I disguised
myself as a girl,

355
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,583
then maybe Miss Anna wouldn't
be in quite so much danger.

356
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,500
[TANUKICHI]
She was in danger?

357
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,750
[OBORO]
es.

358
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,708
If I were ever to behave
like a boy around her,

359
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,291
there was a danger that I would
develop impure feelings for her

360
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,875
and potentially
even act on them.

361
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,791
[TANUKICHI] But that means
you have no real identity

362
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,916
of your own.

363
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,083
[OBORO]
I do have an identity.

364
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,541
If Mister Matsukage tells
me to be male, I'm male.

365
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,291
If he tells me to be
female, I'm female.

366
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,291
If Miss Anna thinks
peppers are delicious,

367
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,750
then I think they're delicious.

368
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,625
If she says pudding
is disgusting,

369
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,458
then I say it's disgusting.

370
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,416
That is my identity.

371
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,625
Mister Matsukage said it
would be for the best this way.

372
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,583
[TANUKICHI]
Oh, god.

373
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,125
[knocking]

374
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,208
Miss Tsukimigusa, have
you finished changing?

375
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,833
[TANUKICHI] Wait, what are
you doing in here anyway?

376
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,083
[OBORO] Well, while
Miss Anna was engrossed

377
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,208
in your undergarments, the
sprinklers suddenly went off,

378
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,708
so I rushed in here to
change out of my wet clothes

379
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,625
before they became see-through.

380
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:50,416
[ANNA] Miss Tsukimigusa?
Are you in there? Can I come in?

381
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,750
[OBORO] I see no reason
why not, Miss Anna.

382
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,333
[TANUKICHI gasps]

383
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,166
[ANNA] Well, you certainly took
your sweet time answeri-- Uh!

384
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,291
It's you! The Mister
Okuma look-alike!

385
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,750
[screams]

386
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,166
[TANUKICHI]
Now!

387
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,083
[ANNA] Oh, even though
you're just a pale imitation,

388
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,125
these smell exactly like him!

389
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,916
Such a yummy aroma!

390
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,750
[AYAME]
Ugh, not again.

391
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,791
You really think you can
appeal to my rotten heart

392
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,458
with some far-fetched lie about
Tsukimigusa being a boy?

393
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,000
[TANUKICHI] Uh, but I'm
telling you the truth.

394
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,583
Go and check for yourself
and you'll see I'm right.

395
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,666
[siren wailing]

396
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,875
[AYAME]
Can't now. The firemen are here.

397
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,166
We'll have to abort the rest
of our operations for today.

398
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,291
[KOSURI laughs]

399
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,291
Glad I caught you both.

400
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,000
[AYAME] Kosuri? Why are you
dressed up like that?

401
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,166
And what are you doing here?

402
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,958
[chuckles]

403
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,500
Ha! Well, I scored a major
victory for SOX's mission today,

404
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,208
so you're all very welcome.

405
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,666
I personally approached Fuwa,

406
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,416
the ringleader of
the normal students,

407
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,208
and managed to get her to commit
to helping out my brother.

408
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,125
I told her to send
any Gathered Fabrics

409
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,916
that she came across
to the changing room

410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,750
where Brother would
be waiting for them.

411
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,083
[TANUKICHI]
What happened?

412
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,041
[KOSURI] Well, see, I also
asked her to slow down

413
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,708
and obstruct the Prefects
in whatever way she could,

414
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,333
but she refused to cooperate
with me on that one.

415
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,166
So, I had to take matters
into my own hands

416
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,833
and get them all soaking wet
by squirting them myself.

417
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,083
Phew! Phew!

418
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,166
That was you?

419
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,708
What's wrong?

420
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,916
You jealous 'cause I'm more
useful to SOX than you ever were

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,833
and I'm starting to thrust you
out of the number two position?

422
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,416
--[TANUKICHI] Why, you litt--
--[OTOME] This is pointless.

423
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,375
Do you realize the extent
of what you've done

424
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,250
and all the damage
you've caused?

425
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,791
[AYAME]
She's right.

426
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,458
Now let's clear our heads
so we can think of a solution.

427
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,125
Commence masturbation.

428
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,875
I don't get it.
What's the problem?

429
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,000
Kosuri worked hard to win
your approval, Ayame!

430
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,500
I thought you'd be ecstatic!

431
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,166
Issuing orders to Hyoka Fuwa
gives people the impression

432
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,041
that SOX is guiding
ordinary students,

433
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,125
which is an image we'd
rather not have out there.

434
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,416
And setting off the sprinklers
was definitely a bad move.

435
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,875
We gain absolutely
nothing for our cause

436
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,583
by directly attacking the
Establishment like that.

437
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,083
In fact, we lose.

438
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,875
Kosuri was only
trying to help SOX

439
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,750
by sticking it to
our repressive enemies

440
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,500
and give them
what they deserve.

441
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,666
[AYAME]
What we aim to do here

442
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,333
is not to destroy the Decency
Squad or to injure the Prefects.

443
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,958
And we're not looking to slander
the Student Council, either.

444
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,958
Those aren't the peaceful
forms of protest

445
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,875
we embrace here at SOX.

446
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,166
[KOSURI]
What's wrong with you people?

447
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,000
Rhetorical BS?

448
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,291
Pandering to the Establishment?

449
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:43,708
These guys are no different
than my decrepit old father.

450
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,458
Pardon me. I've brought--

451
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,875
[AYAME] Ooh, what is that?
Hot towel service?

452
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,083
I'm afraid it's not a hot towel.

453
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,750
Someone tossed that into
the restaurant, ma'am.

454
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,791
This is--

455
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,250
[WHITE PEAK] I'm pleased to
see that the members of SOX

456
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,833
made it out tonight.

457
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,083
I am the leader
of Gathered Fabric.

458
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,375
Call me White Peak.

459
