1
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,120
So, we've decided to go
to the Moon.

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,180
We have to wait a few days
though, and go when it's full.

3
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,140
Earth's Moon: It has
one-eightieth of
Earth's mass...

4
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:38,030
One-sixth Earth's surface
gravity, and only one-
fourth Earth's diameter.

5
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,150
As our plant's lone
satellite, the Moon takes

6
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,100
28 days to complete
it's orbit.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,130
Okay, so that explains
what the Moon is, but

8
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,150
how exactly does Luna
expect us to getthere?

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,010
[chuckling]

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,110
Don't worry, Rei. You'll
see when the time comes.
I'll explain everything.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,020
Oh wow!

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,050
You're so good,
Naru!

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,170
At least Usagi seems
to be feeling better.
That's a relief.

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,170
I knew she couldn't
stay depressed
forever.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,130
Besides, there's no time
to be sad, we're going
to the Moon!

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,130
The moon is getting
fuller and fuller...

17
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,110
And as it does, my feelings
grow stronger and stronger.

18
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,180
I can't wait to go to the
moon and find out about
my previous life.

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,180
I want to learn everything!

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,040
So that I can rescue
him. As soon as possible!

21
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
Oh!

22
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,170
Hi Dad! Welcome home!

23
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,170
I brought doughnuts.

24
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,060
Your dad picked them up
on his way home. You can
have one, now.

25
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,100
Yummy!

26
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,130
Oh, Usagi!

27
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,000
This too. I stopped
by the jewelers.

28
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,090
Huh?

29
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,170
Wow! It's perfect!

30
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,130
Just like I wanted!
Thanks Dad!

31
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,210
So that crystal's
pretty important,
heh?

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,150
Is that because it's a
gift from a boy you
like?

33
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,200
Yeah... something
like that.

34
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,080
Agh!

35
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,130
Hey! Shingo!
I told you!

36
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,060
You can't play that
game unless I say so!

37
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,100
Well I don't see
your name on it.
You big dummy!

38
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,170
I said no!

39
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,140
[fighting grunts]

40
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,200
Give it back,
Shingo! It's mine!

41
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,180
You know what,
honey?

42
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,010
Huh?

43
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,090
Sometimes I think our
Usagi looks like a
different person.

44
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,220
Before we know it, our
little girl's gonna be
all grown up.

45
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,180
She's gonna go out on
her own and leave us.

46
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,220
Oh don't be silly, dear.

47
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,110
She's not going anywhere.
She'll always be our
spoiled little girl.

48
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,160
Tonight's the
full moon.

49
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,190
And soon it'll be
right above this
park.

50
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,160
It's mild and clear.
The perfect night to
go to the Moon.

51
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,110
A waning moon often means
malice and discord. A new
moon indicates death and

52
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,120
destruction. If you seek
a vision of the future,
a full moon is best.

53
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,100
I feel stronger just
standing here in the
moonlight.

54
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,120
This fountain...

55
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,080
Trade back next
time 'kay?

56
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,070
Next time then.

57
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,100
This is where Mamo and I
promised to trade back

58
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,220
his watch for whatever
he has of mine...

59
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,200
What's he doing?
Is he okay?

60
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,080
I miss you, Mamo...

61
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,210
[grunting]

62
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,100
[gasp]

63
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,190
All right! Is
everyone ready?

64
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,090
Time to combine powers
and go to the Moon.

65
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Step into the fountain
and transform. Then all
of you join hands.

66
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,230
We're going to
create a shield.

67
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,080
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

68
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,100
Mercury Power
Make Up!

69
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,220
Mars Power
Make Up!

70
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,130
Jupiter Power
Make Up!

71
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,010
Venus Power
Make Up!

72
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,090
[gasp]

73
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,090
Wow! Is that really
the Earth?

74
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,090
It's so beautiful...

75
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,190
Incredible!

76
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Look...

77
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,210
There it is.

78
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,180
So many craters. Just
like there are on
Mercury.

79
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,100
Luna? Do you know
where we're gonna
land?

80
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,170
Mare Serenitatis...
also known as the "Sea
of Serenity."

81
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,040
This is the Moon?

82
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,200
It's dark...

83
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,230
And there's no sound
at all. It feels so
strange.

84
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,060
Those ruins...

85
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,220
Silver Millennium. Our
kingdom, or at least
what it used to be.

86
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,220
Such grand architecture.
Was this the palace?

87
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,120
Yes. This was the
Moon Castle.

88
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,170
Now, we're here.

89
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,040
This was once the
Chamber of Prayer.

90
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,170
Only the Queen herself
was allowed to enter it.

91
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,140
It's at the base of what
remains of the Crystal
Tower, the very heart

92
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,040
of the Moon Castle.

93
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,040
A sword in a stone?

94
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,120
Mercury, Mars, Jupiter,
Venus! Can one of you
free it?

95
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,040
Sure! Just leave
it to me!

96
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,190
[grunting]

97
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,130
It looks rusty!

98
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,190
Let us help you!

99
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,190
[grunting]

100
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,010
We at least got
it loose!

101
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,180
Let me give
it a try.

102
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,190
Just a bit more. I know
you can do it, Venus.

103
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,120
[grunting]

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,040
[gasps]

105
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,150
We did it!

106
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,040
That is a legendary sacred
sword, intended to protect
the princess.

107
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,120
Mercury, Mars, Jupiter,
Venus. It belongs to
all of you.

108
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,060
Luna, thank you for
bringing everyone
here.

109
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,210
Could you be...

110
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,150
Queen Serenity...

111
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,020
My mother, from
my previous life?

112
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,230
My adorable little
Serenity, is that
you?

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,160
It must be. I can
see her in you.

114
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,190
You're not just a
recording, are you?

115
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,170
Thanks to the Moon
Castle's Eternity
Main System,

116
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,230
even though I have
physically perished,
my consciousness and

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,020
my memories remain
in this form.

118
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,220
I put Luna and Artemis
into suspended animation,

119
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,220
and sent them to Earth
to watch over you.

120
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,220
I have waited so long
for this moment.

121
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,210
Do you remember the
Moon as it once was?

122
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,040
Serenity, you used to go
down to Earth often to see
the green of the trees and

123
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:36,180
feel the wind in your hair.

124
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,130
And then one day
you found love...

125
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:46,150
Yes. I remember now
how I used to sneak
out, and go down to Earth.

126
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,210
Just to visit my
beloved Endymion.

127
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,210
[gasp]

128
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,230
Yes, Princess?

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,220
Agh!

130
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,200
You went to Earth
without telling us
again, didn't you?

131
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,230
Princess, you're
Silver Millennium's
sole heir.

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,020
You still have much to
learn. May we return
to your studies?

133
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,050
Yes...

134
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,020
Silver Millennium
as it once was...

135
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,140
We spent many happy
days here...

136
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,220
Hm. The happiest.

137
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,000
They were truly the best
times of our lives.

138
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,020
We come from a race of
beings born of the moon.

139
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,180
We protected the moon's
sacred stone, the Legendary

140
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,180
Silver Crystal. And our
mission was to watch over

141
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,080
Earth and guide it as its
people grew and evolved.

142
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,100
But then a great
disaster occurred.

143
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,220
A horrible alien creature
invaded Earth.

144
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,070
It meant to claim and
conquer the beautiful
planet for itself.

145
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,060
The creature was evil,
in its purest form.

146
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,040
But Earth was not enough
for this vile thing.

147
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,230
It wanted the Legendary
Silver Crystal, too.

148
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,020
So it brainwashed the
humans and attacked
the Moon.

149
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,080
Only the young Prince
Endymion was immune to
it's evil power. He fought

150
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,090
to save his people and
the princess he loved.

151
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,080
But alas, while protecting
you, he was slain.

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,200
[gasps]

153
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,200
When he fell, so great
was your despair, that
you took your own life!

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Using the power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal,

155
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,000
I eventually managed
to seal the evil away.

156
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,100
But in the process, Silver
Millennium was turned to
stone and crumbled into the

157
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,060
ruins you see now.

158
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,050
The Earth paid a far
greater price. The planet
was completely destroyed

159
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,210
and had to begin its
history all over again.

160
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,210
Now that ancient
evil has revived and

161
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,180
returned to finish
what it started.

162
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,210
This time it must be
eliminated entirely.

163
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,020
By using the true power
so the Silver Crystal.

164
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,080
Serenity! You are the
only one who can wield
that power.

165
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,190
The true power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal?

166
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,070
But your Majesty there's
something wrong with the
Crystal.

167
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,050
Its light was absorbed
into Prince Endymion's
body.

168
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,050
Since then, it
does not shine.

169
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,050
His body absorbed
the light?

170
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,200
Serenity...

171
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,010
Do not fret. Your love and
intense desire to save

172
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,110
Endymion are what
caused that to happen.

173
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,180
It's alright. I'm
sure he's alive.

174
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,060
I know he is...

175
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh Serenity, my dear
princess, always remember

176
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:05,210
that the Legendary Silver
Crystal follows your heart.

177
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,190
You are a princess, and
you are Sailor Moon, Guardian
of Love and Justice, take pride.

178
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,190
They are both part of you.

179
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,100
But underneath it all, you
are still you: a regular
girl. And you were reborn

180
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,110
that way for a reason.

181
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,130
It is important you
never forget that.

182
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:31,090
Mercury, Mars, Jupiter,
Venus: Work together.
Protect the Princess.

183
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,230
And restore our kingdom
to its former glory...

184
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,040
I cannot talk
much longer...

185
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,070
Serenity...

186
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,220
Be happy,
my child.

187
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,010
Mother!

188
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,090
Well it looks like it's
gonna be morning soon
down on Earth.

189
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,030
We should go back.

190
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,040
Sounds echo here that
can never be heard
on the moon.

191
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,080
There are wide oceans.

192
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,070
And the green forest, and
you can feel the wind on
your face...

193
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,200
I didn't just watch over
this planet. I dreamed
of it. I loved it.

194
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,060
I think that
it's out there.

195
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,220
What it all means, why
we were reborn. It's
here on Earth.

196
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,080
I never knew there
was a staircase
down here.

197
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,080
I wonder where
it leads to.

198
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,000
What's behind that door?

199
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,220
Just keep quiet
and follow me.

200
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,220
That's our
Great Ruler?

201
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,180
She looks almost
fully materialized.

202
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,010
What's that symbol
on her forehead?

203
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,090
O Great Queen Metalia.

204
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,130
There is currently no
trace of the Legendary
Silver Crystal anywhere

205
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,130
within Tuxedo Mask's body.

206
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,220
Whatever was there,
has vanished.

207
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,190
He is useless then. Get
rid of him! The Princess
must still have the

208
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,120
Legendary Silver Crystal.

209
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,180
If I may, Great Queen,
there may yet be use for
Tuxedo Mask.

210
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,200
I have a plan. Please
leave him to me.

211
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,150
Very well, but remember,
more energy is still
required if we are to

212
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,140
take over the entire world.

213
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,170
Now that the Princess has
fully awakened, time is
running out.

214
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,230
There is not
moment to lose.

215
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,140
Fear not. All will
be settled soon.

216
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,190
Well before the Four
Kings of Heaven can
remember their past lives.

217
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,100
Past lives?

218
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,000
What does she mean?

219
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,160
Who are we really?

220
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,170
I am Jadeite, knight of
patience and harmony.

221
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,200
I am Nephrite, knight
of wisdom and comfort.

222
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,090
I am Zoisite, knight
of purity and healing.

223
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,100
I am Kunzite, knight
of virtue and affection.

224
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,080
We four pledge you our
service. We would lay down
our lives to protect you.

225
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,170
I thank you brave knights.

226
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,030
Together we shall keep
the Earth prosperous
and peaceful.

227
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,170
Is this from
a past life?

228
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,130
I remember now. We
were knights.

229
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,210
And our master was
Endymion, Prince
of Earth.

230
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,100
We were reincarnated in
this time, here on Earth,
to find him again.

231
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,020
But we crossed paths
with Queen Beryl, who

232
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,120
put us under her spell,
before we realized that.

233
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,090
So, you've remembered
everything...

234
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,210
Queen Beryl...

235
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,090
How could you?!

236
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,020
You used us for
your evil plans!

237
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,020
I did.

238
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,160
In order to win this game
I required pawns that
could be sacrificed.

239
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,100
Damn you!

240
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,020
[screaming]

241
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,010
It hurts, I know. But
I'm afraid I'm not
done with you yet.

242
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,020
Not until the Dark Kingdom
rises and planet Earth
belongs to me!

243
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,120
Stop it! This is wrong!
This isn't what we
were reborn for!

244
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,140
Get rid of the princess
and the Sailor Guardians.

245
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,180
And then take the
Legendary Silver
Crystal.

246
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,180
Yes, my Queen.

247
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,160
According to this, Earth
has been experiencing a

248
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,180
marked increase in
seismic activity.

249
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,200
And there's evidence of
unusual thermal reactions
in the Arctic.

250
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,000
Originating deep
underground.

251
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,130
Recently there have been
more and more of these
abnormal data readings.

252
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,150
I'd bet money it has
something to do with
the Dark Kingdom.

253
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,100
Hey! What's that?!

254
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,130
[gasps]

255
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
[chuckling]

256
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,010
I'll transform Tokyo
into a frozen desert.

257
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,020
Kunzite!

258
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
You're rather
late, Princess.

259
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,190
Are you trying to turn
Tokyo into the North
Pole?

260
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,040
Exactly. In order to prepare
this world for Our Great

261
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,190
Ruler, the climate
needed some adjustment.

262
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,150
Where's Tuxedo mask?

263
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,150
What have you done
with him? Did you
hurt him?

264
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,170
You'll get him back. In
fact if you give me the
Legendary Silver Crystal

265
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,150
I'll return him right now.

266
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,190
Or should I say
his corpse!

267
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,180
The Legendary Silver
Crystal! She's wearing
it!

268
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,190
Agh!

269
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,000
Damn Sailor Guardians!

270
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,180
Let's go! Protect the
princess and the Crystal
no matter what!

271
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,000
[grunting]

272
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,150
Oh no!

273
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,200
[growling]

274
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,170
Please Kunzite! This
isn't you! It's not the
man I fell in love with!

275
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,210
Venus?

276
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,010
What did you say?

277
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,160
You can't be serious?!

278
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,120
Listen everyone! The
four of them, they weren't
always our enemies.

279
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,050
[gasps]

280
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,220
Jadeite, Nephrite,
Zoisite, Kunzite...

281
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,210
They were once brave
knights, in the past
they served Prince

282
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:33,000
Endymion on Earth.

283
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,060
Endymion on Earth.

284
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,210
I remember. She's
right. We have met
them all before.

285
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,010
One day when the princess
snuck out to see Endymion,
we saw her leave and we

286
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,050
followed her...

287
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,210
Like her, we were
enchanted with
Earth's beauty.

288
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,130
And like her...
we fell in love.

289
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,130
[roaring]

290
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,020
[screaming]

291
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,020
I can't! I can't
fight them!

292
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,070
This is just
too cruel!

293
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,080
Please! Remember and
go back to who you
were!

294
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,000
[mocking laughter]

295
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,180
Your pleas are futile!
They are under my
control!

296
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,040
How ironic! You're
about to be killed
by the men you

297
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,220
once loved!

298
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,050
I won't let that happen!

299
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,190
No one is going to kill
or be killed by someone
they loved!

300
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,030
Sailor Moon!

301
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,140
I am the Pretty Guardian,
who fights for love and
for Justice!

302
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,030
I am Sailor Moon!

303
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,000
And in the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

304
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,020
Hmph! As you wish. Then
I suppose we'll just
have to kill you instead!

305
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,020
Look out!

306
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,050
Moon Healing Escalation!

307
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,030
Agh! Dammit!

308
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,230
Come on!

309
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,110
We're Sailor Guardians!

310
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,020
We serve the Princess,
and we fight for her no
matter what!

311
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,190
Right! We can't let
the past haunt us!

312
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,190
We've got to pull
ourselves together
and go help Sailor Moon!

313
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,210
Let's combine powers!
Four are stronger
than one!

314
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,030
Venus Power!

315
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,170
Mercury Power!

316
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,000
Mars Power!

317
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,200
Jupiter Power!

318
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,020
Sailor Planet Attack!

319
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,100
[screaming]

320
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,040
Please! Remember
your true selves!

321
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't think that this
is over. We will be
back to destroy you all!

322
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,040
We were so close...

323
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,220
Mamo...

324
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,060
O supreme ruler,
Great Queen Metalia...

325
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,090
I beseech you. Grant
me your power!

326
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,180
I cast a spell
of awakening!

327
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,180
My dear Endymion...

328
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:31,170
I have waited so long.
But at last, you belong
entirely to me.

329
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:36,040
I have a task for you.
You will find the Moon
Princess, take the

330
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,180
Silver Crystal from
her and kill her.

331
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,040
Mamo...
I miss you...

332
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,010
I don't want to forget
your face, your voice,
anything about you.

333
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:41,150
Wait! Who's that? From
the back, he almost
looks like...

334
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,040
No. That's not him.
He couldn't be here...

335
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,030
...could he?

336
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,200
Act. 11- Reunion
Endymion

337
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,130
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
