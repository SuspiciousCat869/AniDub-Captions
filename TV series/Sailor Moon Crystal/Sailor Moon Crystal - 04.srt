1
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,080
Now there are three
Sailor Guardians, and
someone else, too.

2
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,130
Who are you,
Mamoru Chiba?

3
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,080
Friend or enemy?

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,170
Either way I
definitely don't
trust you.

5
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,150
Usagi!

6
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,090
Wake up! Hurry, or
you'll be late again!

7
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,170
[groggy] What
time is it?

8
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,040
[gasp] Ahh! Why
didn't you wake me up
earlier, Luna!?

9
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm late again!

10
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,060
That's what you
get for staying up
reading manga.

11
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,100
Looks like Sailor
Moon has solved
another mystery!

12
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,220
What an amazing girl.

13
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,080
Morning, Mom!

14
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,507
Morning!

15
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,020
Bye! See you later!

16
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,160
Have a good day!
Too bad Usagi can't
be more like her.

17
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,140
[yawn]

18
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,210
Hm?

19
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,210
Wow, there are a lot
more police officers
than usual.

20
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,110
Huh?

21
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,150
Come on!

22
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,100
Hey! I know! I'll
just transform into
a marathon runner.

23
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,170
Usagi! You can't
do that!

24
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,170
Why not!? Humph!

25
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,200
[sigh]

26
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,140
This girl with
the grumpy face is
Usagi Tsukino...

27
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,130
...also known as the
Guardian of love and
justice, Sailor Moon.

28
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,130
Her mission, and the mission
of all the Sailor Guardians,

29
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,110
is to find our missing
princess and protect her.

30
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,170
Okay! C'mon! We
gotta hurry!

31
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,210
[sigh]

32
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,100
Good morning!

33
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,100
You're not late
today, Usagi!

34
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,000
That's a relief!

35
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,170
Did you pass that
police road block
on your way?

36
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,100
Yeah. What's
going on?

37
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,130
You've heard of the
Kingdom of D, right?

38
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,170
Where all the gems
come from?

39
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,140
Well, their princess
is visiting Japan
right now!

40
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,220
Wow! A real princess?

41
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,110
There's going to be a
party! And the princess

42
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,090
will show off her
kingdom's treasure
for the first time!

43
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,060
[gasp] The Princess of D
and a secret treasure...

44
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,100
Could they be what
we're looking for?

45
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,170
Wow, Ami! You solved
all those difficult
equations so fast!

46
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,160
That's amazing!

47
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,000
Huh?

48
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,230
You know, I've never
been to an arcade
before, how exciting!

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,160
[chuckle] I'd never been
to one either until the

50
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,160
first time I came
here with Usagi.

51
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,170
Ami's a certified
genius. She goes to
school with Usagi.

52
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,230
She is Sailor Mercury.

53
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,220
Speaking of Usagi,
where is she, anyway?

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,150
Her teacher gave her
detention for falling
asleep in class again.

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,140
[giggle] That does
sound like her.

56
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,140
Rei's a shrine maiden
who goes to T.A. Girl's
Academy...

57
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,130
She has spiritual powers!
Rei is Sailor Mars.

58
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,190
Well, since we're
waiting, do you want
to try playing a game?

59
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,190
A game?

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,010
You killed me!

61
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,160
This isn't as
easy as I thought
it would be.

62
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,150
The key is to keep
hitting the attack

63
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,070
button while you dodge
at the same time.

64
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,180
Thanks! I'll
try that.

65
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,100
Good! That's it!
You got it!

66
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,110
All right!

67
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,150
[gasp] I'm sorry.

68
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,210
What's wrong?

69
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh, nothing! Thanks
for the help, Ami.

70
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,130
I'm here!

71
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,120
[gasps]

72
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,150
You're late, Usagi.

73
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,130
[embarrassed giggle]

74
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,000
Sorry! I stayed up way
too late last night so I
fell asleep during class.

75
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,220
Okay then, now that
we're all here, the
meeting can begin.

76
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,080
I still can't
believe I'm a
Sailor Guardian.

77
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm sick of fighting
Monsters already.

78
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,150
What are those
Monsters anyway? And
who sent them here?

79
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,090
I'm afraid I
can't tell you.

80
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,200
There's a lot about
the Monsters I still
don't know.

81
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,150
But defeating these Monsters,
isn't that why we all became
Sailor Guardians to begin with?

82
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,220
Yes, but there's more...

83
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,080
Your primary mission
is to find and protect
the princess.

84
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,020
You have all been chosen
as    h Sailor Guardians.

85
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,160
How are we supposed
to do that when we

86
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,140
don't even know who
this princess is?

87
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,110
I suspect her power
was sealed away.

88
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,190
It's kept her hidden from
her enemies but now we
can't find her either.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,160
Power?

90
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,050
Why would it have
to be sealed away?

91
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,220
Because the princess
might already possess the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

92
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,100
You see, the crystal is
a sacred stone that is

93
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,000
supposed to be a source
of unlimited power.

94
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,160
If that's the case, then
I think it's safe to

95
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,170
assume the Monsters
want the Crystal too.

96
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,070
Uh huh.

97
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,150
And if they get their
hands on it, our princess
will be in serious danger!

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,180
So we need to find
the princess and the
Crystal...

99
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,130
Well how do we do
that? We don't have
a clue where to start.

100
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,160
The key to finding
them lies with you.

101
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,080
Huh?

102
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,000
Once all the Sailor Guardians
awaken, the seal protecting
the princess will break.

103
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,150
Then, the princess will
awaken, too, and we'll be
able to find both her and

104
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,150
the Legendary Silver Crystal.

105
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,210
We understand.

106
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,140
Then it's all
up to us.

107
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,030
Ha! Take that!

108
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,100
Huh?

109
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,170
And that! And
another! I'm gonna beat
all you guys today!

110
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,220
[groans]

111
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,040
Come on, Usagi! You were
the first Guardian to wake up!

112
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,200
You should be the leader.
Act like it, will ya!?

113
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,140
Hey! We're talking
about important stuff!
Pay a little attention!

114
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,200
Luna, what are you
doing!? You're gonna
make me lose my game!

115
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,050
Ow! Get off me!

116
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,110
Looks like there are
a lot of extra police
on the street today.

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,020
It's because the princess
of Kingdom D is visiting
her embassy.

118
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,100
Oh?

119
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,030
Hi, Motoki! Isn't
it amazing!?

120
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,030
I wonder if she's a blonde
beauty like a princess
from a fairytale...

121
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,000
[creepy laugh]

122
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,110
[gulp]

123
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,120
I got a picture of her
even though it's nearly
impossible to get one!

124
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,110
Wanna see?

125
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,230
Uh, is that the princess?

126
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,160
She kinda looks
like you, Umino.

127
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,060
She does have great
taste in glasses,
doesn't she?

128
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,030
And a fancy ball being
thrown in her honor!
I wish I could go, too!

129
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,160
You shouldn't if you
know what's good for you.

130
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,040
Something's wrong.
I've got a bad feeling.

131
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,200
Failed again, Jadeite?
Shame on you...

132
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,170
Hello, Kunzite.

133
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,130
...Damn you, Sailor Mars!

134
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,030
I heard those Sailor
Guardians are also
looking for the crystal.

135
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,130
Let those pathetic little
girls in sailor suits try.
We'll get to it first.

136
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,190
My Four Kings
of Heaven!

137
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,110
Queen Beryl.

138
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,010
Once we revive our Great Ruler
with the power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal...

139
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,130
the Dark Kingdom will reign
supreme over the entire world!

140
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,040
-Yes, my queen!

141
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,220
The Legendary Silver
Crystal... Is it as
they say...?

142
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,210
Does it really hold
Such immense power?

143
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,120
Where could it be...

144
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,030
I'm back!

145
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,458
Oh?

146
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,200
Hey, Usagi!

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,180
Wow. What are you all
dressed up for, Dad?
You look great!

148
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,180
I'm going to the ball at
the Kingdom of D's embassy.

149
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,230
It's a story for the
magazine.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,190
No fair! I wanna go!

151
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll tell you all about
it in the morning, dear.

152
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,010
Goodnight!

153
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,140
Wait...!
[groan]

154
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,030
A ball at the Kingdom
of D's embassy...

155
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,476
Luna...

156
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:14,140
Huh?

157
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,030
Let's go to the
ball, too!

158
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,000
What!?

159
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,040
Moon Power!

160
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,020
Change me into...
a princess!

161
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,000
Perfect! Now
we're ready to go!

162
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Usagi, are you sure
that we'll be able
to get into this thing?

163
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,220
Yeah, we weren't
invited.

164
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,050
Don't worry about
that, Ami, just
leave it to me.

165
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,020
Thank you. Please proceed
to the entrance at the
front of the building.

166
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,090
[gasp]
Excuse me ladies.

167
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,180
[worried gasps]

168
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,210
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, but we
don't allow pets inside.

169
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,220
You'll have to leave
your cat with us.

170
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,220
Oh, well thanks
for taking care
of her!

171
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't leave me!

172
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,180
You really think
Princess D is in
danger?

173
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,140
Yes. I got a feeling
and it wasn't good.

174
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,200
Then we have to
find her quickly.

175
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,060
Yes, I agree.

176
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,230
Oh wow!

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,070
It's not just a ball,
it's a masquerade!

178
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,230
I have to get out
on the dance floor!

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,180
No sense in getting dressed
up and being a wallflower!

180
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,020
Usagi!

181
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,160
Might as well let
her be. We can find
the Princess ourselves.

182
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,230
[happy giggling]

183
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,050
[laugh] That sounds
just like him!

184
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,060
Huh? That woman looks
a lot like Usagi.

185
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,040
Hm. I wonder if my
little girl will grow
up to be that pretty, too.

186
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,020
[gasp]

187
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,030
[gasps]

188
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,020
I'm so sorry
about that!

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
Huh? Oh, no!
I'm soaked!

190
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,060
Oh! Handkerchief,
handkerchief. Where's
my handkerchief?

191
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,230
Rei, look! On
the second floor!

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,110
That's Princess D...

193
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,040
Princess, it's
almost time to unveil
the treasure.

194
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,010
Who is that?

195
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,230
My dress is a mess!
And I can't find Rei
and Ami!

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,220
[applause]

197
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,230
[distant laughing]

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,060
Huh?

199
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,200
You're a very
good dancer...

200
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,210
That's only because
I was dancing with you!

201
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,200
Oh, stop!

202
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,090
No, really,
I mean it!

203
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,170
I'm wearing a beautiful
dress. And I can dance
as well as anybody.

204
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,210
It's no fun being
a princess if I'm
all by myself.

205
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,090
(Mamoru)
Beautiful Princes...

206
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,190
Huh?

207
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,080
Would you give me
the honor of a dance?

208
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:36,030
Tuxedo Mask!? No
way! What's he
doing here?

209
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,120
I don't believe this...
Am I dreaming?

210
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,020
I was thinking
about you.

211
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,060
Just now I was
hoping that I would
see you again.

212
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,070
So was I.

213
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
His hand is so warm...

214
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,180
Um, so, aren't
you--

215
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,110
[gasp]

216
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,200
I wish that I could
dance with him forever!

217
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,110
What is she doing now?

218
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,000
[gasp]

219
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,130
Wait!
Tuxedo Mask!

220
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:38,190
It was just a dance
and yet, I feel so
warm inside.

221
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,130
You shouldn't trust
him. You don't even
know who he is!

222
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
Usagi! Are you
blushing?

223
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,010
Uh, never mind about
that! How did you
get in here?

224
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,190
I snuck in from
the balcony.

225
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,230
What happened
to Rei and Ami?

226
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,010
Treasure treasure.
That's all anyone
talks about.

227
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,200
It's like they care
more about this than
me...

228
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,020
[evil chuckle]

229
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,030
[gasp]

230
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,200
True. In fact, I
don't care about
you at all...

231
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,130
Now, give me that
secret treasure!

232
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,040
An intruder!

233
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,130
Hold it right there!

234
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,000
Damn it, it was
almost mine!

235
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,040
You leave
me no choice.

236
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,080
[gasps]

237
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,150
Come forward, oh
Monster who serves
our great ruler...

238
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,000
...and do my
bidding!

239
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,050
[screaming]

240
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,230
Princess D!

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,040
[sigh]

242
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,070
Good. Now take the
treasure and go.

243
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,140
No one else shall
have the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

244
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,140
Outta my way!

245
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,100
Oh no!

246
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,230
Mercury Power!
Make Up!

247
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,230
Mars Power!
Make Up!

248
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,230
Huh. Is that--?

249
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,437
What are you
doing!?

250
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:00,230
Princess D!

251
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,150
Get a hold of
yourself, Princess!

252
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,140
Get... away
from me!

253
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,040
[small giggle]

254
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,170
Anyone who dares to
try and stop me will

255
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,030
be offered as a sacrifice
to our great ruler!

256
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,110
Whoa!

257
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,070
This is bad! We
need to get out
of this room, now!

258
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,080
[groans]

259
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,160
Princess D! Stop
it! You should get
away from there!

260
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,020
[scream]

261
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,010
Usagi!

262
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,140
[gasp]

263
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,110
Tuxedo Mask!

264
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,050
Stop right there!

265
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,030
[gasp]

266
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,070
You stole the Legendary
Secret Treasure!

267
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,160
Douse yourself in
water and repent!

268
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,010
In the name of Mars
I'll chastise you!

269
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,110
You are so
annoying!

270
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,070
[struggling]

271
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,120
[struggling]

272
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,150
[screaming]

273
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,120
Usagi! Use
your pen!

274
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,150
My pen?

275
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,160
[gasp]

276
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,030
[sigh]

277
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,080
Well, this time it
was you who saved me.

278
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,160
Are you hurt?

279
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,070
No...

280
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,070
I can feel the warmth
of Tuxedo Mask's hand
on my own...

281
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,050
Wait! Tuxedo Mask...!

282
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,020
Usagi!

283
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,050
Hurry up and
transform!

284
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,090
Oh!

285
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,080
Moon Prism Power!
Make Up!

286
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,110
Oh no! My tiara!

287
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,170
When I used it in
the last battle it
got burned up!

288
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,140
What is this...?
What's happening?

289
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,070
Like when Tuxedo
Mask took my hand...

290
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,110
It's his warmth! I
can feel it making
me stronger!

291
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,180
[gasp] A new
tiara!

292
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,080
[evil laugh] You're
too late! The secret
treasure is mine!

293
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,200
Not so fast!

294
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,040
[gasps]

295
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,050
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights
for love and for justice!

296
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,110
I am Sailor Moon!

297
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,160
And now, in the
name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

298
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,507
Usagi!

299
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:03,190
[scoff]

300
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,170
Evil Spirit, be gone!

301
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,210
[snicker]

302
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,040
It didn't work!

303
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,040
What do we do?

304
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,030
Sailor Moon!

305
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Huh?

306
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,160
The only way to banish
the darkness is with a
stronger light!

307
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,220
Usagi, quick! Use the
new tiara to reflect
the moonlight onto him!

308
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,150
[gasp]

309
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,180
How dare you possess
the princess you villain!

310
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,060
Prepare to be punished!
Moon Twilight Flash!

311
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,070
Arghhhh!

312
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,060
Princess D!

313
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,040
What's going on?

314
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,180
Hm. The only thing
you hurt was my shadow.

315
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,220
They still got the
better of you, Nephrite.

316
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,040
Who- who are you!?

317
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:59,200
We are the Four Kinds of
the Dark Kingdom who serve
our Great Ruler. I am Kunzite.

318
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,210
Zoisite.

319
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,080
Nephrite.

320
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,200
Jadeite.

321
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,230
Hear me, Sailor Guardians...

322
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,130
The Legendary Crystal
you seek, rightfully

323
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,160
belongs to our great
ruler, and we will get it.

324
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,090
No matter what
the cost...

325
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,110
Then the Dark Kingdom
will reign over this world

326
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,140
and you will all bow down
before our Great Ruler!

327
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,060
We won't let
that happen!

328
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,150
Go ahead and stop
us then, if you can.

329
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,090
[evil laughter]

330
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,150
Huh?

331
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,050
What am I
doing here?

332
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,180
And, where are
my glasses?

333
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,050
Quick! Let's get
out of here!

334
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,090
But without my glasses
I can't see anything!

335
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,110
Do you think Umino
could be handsome
without his glasses?

336
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,100
I'm not so sure
about that,
right, Usagi?

337
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm just relieved it's
over. All that fighting
made me so sleepy! [yawn]

338
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,150
Seriously? Talk
about being lazy...

339
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,140
Ladies and gentlemen, Princess D
will no reveal the Kingdom of
D's Legendary Secret Treasure!

340
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,100
A statue of the First Princess
D! Crafted from a 2000-karat
diamond!

341
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,190
So it wasn't the
crystal we were
looking for...

342
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,210
Not this time,
it would seem.

343
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,100
Hey, where'd
Usagi go?

344
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,220
I was thinking about you.
Just now I was hoping that
I would see you again.

345
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,170
[sigh]

346
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:02,110
This feeling... It's
like... I've felt it
before...

347
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:09,000
Soft and warm... Like
sweet lips I've kissed
many times...

348
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,010
Get away from
Usagi right now!

349
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
[gasp]

350
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,200
Who are you really?

351
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,120
And why do you always
seem to show up
wherever we are?

352
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,160
Because I am also
looking for the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

353
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,120
Does that mean you're
with us, or against us?

354
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,110
Who can say?

355
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,170
If we're both seeking
the same thing... I
could be either.

356
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,120
The storm's picking up.

357
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,190
Luna! My school has
a new transfer student!

358
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,010
That's nice.

359
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,020
They say she's
incredibly strong!

360
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,060
Uh-huh...

361
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,180
She could be another
Sailor Guardian!

362
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,020
You don't say...

363
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,110
Hi there! Do you wanna
join our team? It's
really cool!

364
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,150
Uh-huh...

365
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,060
Wait, what are you
doing, Usagi!?

366
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,120
Act 5 Makoto-
Sailor Jupiter

367
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,180
The Moonlight is a
messenger of love.
