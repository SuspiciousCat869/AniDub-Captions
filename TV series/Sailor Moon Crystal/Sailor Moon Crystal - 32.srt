1
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:25,000
Hmm...

2
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,600
I see what
you're talking about, Meioh.

3
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,200
The data readings from
this area are abnormal.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,766
But, to call it a
"spatial distortion"?

5
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,266
An assumption like that
is somewhat farfetched,

6
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:36,600
don't you think?

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,900
Yes, you're right.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,733
I wonder why thinking
of it like that would

9
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,900
even occur to me?

10
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,000
Can we come in?

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,266
Sure, Reika.

12
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:46,433
You're working late?

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,866
Why don't you take a break
and come get dinner with us?

14
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,733
I'd love to, but I already
ate with my professor.

15
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,033
Aw, darn.

16
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:53,966
Wow!

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,133
Look at all these plants!

18
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,633
Mako would be so
excited to see this place.

19
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,066
Mm... "Mako"?

20
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,000
Who Motoki?!

21
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,000
She's a kid from Juban
Middle School who

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,233
comes to the arcade.

23
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,300
And, she's really into plants.
That's all.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,800
Uh huh...

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,300
Whatever.

26
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,100
Sorry you can't join us.
Next time?

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Sure.

28
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,100
So?

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,366
Whadya think of Setsuna?

30
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:05,700
She's pretty, isn't she?

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,633
Yeah.

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,300
She looks like a real
intellectual beauty.

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,933
Do you know anything
about the research

34
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,366
she's assisting with?

35
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,866
If I remember right, that
professor has published some

36
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,300
of his anti‐gravity studies
in the scientific journal

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
"Physical Review Letters."

38
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,200
Hmm...

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,300
I don't know any details
beyond what she said,

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,866
but she talked about getting
some strange readings from

41
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,933
the area around Sankakusu,
so she and the professor are

42
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,933
conducting some
studies there.

43
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,200
Hey, that gives me an idea.

44
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,566
Why don't we go have
dinner in Sankakusu?

45
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,566
There are lots of fancy
restaurants we haven't

46
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,766
tried, yet, in all
those new buildings.

47
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:38,933
[gasp]

48
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,933
Is something wrong?

49
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,066
I'm fine, but let's
go somewhere else.

50
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,866
I mean, just look at
the sky over there.

51
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,733
It's so dark and creepy.

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,866
[chuckle]

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,033
They're just
storm clouds, Reika.

54
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,766
Uhgh... Pathetic.

55
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:02,300
This one turned out to
be a defect as well.

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,833
Professor?

57
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:05,000
We must go.

58
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,266
It's almost time
to make contact.

59
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,100
The light of our
sacred life‐source,

60
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:13,633
the Taoiron
Crystal, grows weaker.

61
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,200
This is unacceptable.

62
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,633
Apologies,
Master Pharaoh 90.

63
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,033
I promise to deliver
you an abundance of

64
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,366
human hosts very soon.

65
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,633
And what of the
Vessilization?

66
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,266
Where do we stand?

67
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:31,300
Using human bodies that have
had their Hosts extracted,

68
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,833
we continue our attempts
to implant the eggs.

69
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,166
But, we have yet to come
across other specimens as

70
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,100
perfect as ourselves.

71
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:41,633
The anomalies are
slowing us down.

72
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,300
Those Sailor Guardians...

73
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,100
The ones protected by
their Guardian Planets...

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,300
And, that Sailor Moon
who possesses a light so

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,300
powerful, it can wipe out
a Daimon in an instant.

76
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,766
Its radiance is like
the Taioron Crystal,

77
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,166
our very source of life!

78
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,866
But, it is not alone.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,333
I see an ominous
light hidden near it;

80
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:10,166
one that will
bring destruction...

81
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:14,200
And the time of its
awakening is at hand!

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,266
An ominous light that
will bring destruction.

83
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,500
Does he mean the
three Talismans?

84
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,900
Eliminate the destruction
advancing toward us!

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,766
And, obtain the light
which Sailor Moon possesses!

86
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:31,000
We need its infinite power
as soon as possible for our

87
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,400
grand resurrection!

88
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,766
We shall bring destruction
not only on the Sailor

89
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:41,000
Guardians, but
on all humanity.

90
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,833
We will turn the Earth into
our second mother planet.

91
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:46,866
Sir!

92
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,166
Well, then, those Sailor
Guardians certainly seem to

93
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:53,100
have put him in a good mood.

94
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,266
You summoned me,
Magus Kaolinite?

95
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,833
How may I be of service?

96
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,233
Our Master requires a
massive amount of Hosts and

97
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,300
I need you to gather them.

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,066
As Tellu, Level 404 of the
Witches 5 and Ruru Teruno,

99
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,233
prefect of Mugen
Physical Education,

100
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:19,166
as well as its
botanical garden...

101
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,766
I will bring in Hosts
of the highest quality.

102
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:26,466
[classroom chatter]

103
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,900
Okay, class!

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,133
As you can tell
by the blackboard,

105
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,900
this week's assignment is
to give someone a gift.

106
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,400
I would like everyone to
give the clay projects they

107
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,233
made to someone special.

108
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,100
That person can
be your mother,

109
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,833
your father, or
even your best friend.

110
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,933
The point is to let them know
how much you appreciate them.

111
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,233
Who are you
giving yours to, Momo?

112
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,166
I'm gonna give
mine to my mom.

113
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,300
Her birthday's coming
up so it's perfect!

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,133
Here. This is for you.

115
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,066
A Sailor Moon pencil holder!

116
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,166
Wow, Kyusuke!

117
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,466
That's really good!

118
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,466
How come you're
giving it to me?

119
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:03,000
Huh?! Well 'cause, you're my...

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,233
Well you're a girl I really
like hanging out with, okay?!

121
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,166
It's a token of
our friendship.

122
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,500
It's a token...

123
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Of friendship?

124
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,866
Then, I think I'll
give mine to Hotaru.

125
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:19,033
Hotaru?

126
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:19,866
Yeah.

127
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,133
She's this girl,
who's really pretty,

128
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,133
and also kinda mysterious.

129
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,966
Look, it's that
sixth‐grader, Tomoe.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,533
She's leaving early again?

131
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:30,133
I heard she's not well.

132
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,866
She wears tights and
long sleeves all year long.

133
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,966
She's always so gloomy.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,633
Everybody knows
she's a weirdo!

135
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,966
Well, yeah, she is the
daughter of an eccentric

136
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,366
professor, after all.

137
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,900
Does she even
have any friends?

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,966
[chuckle] Oops!
Didn't see you there.

139
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,300
I shoulda watched my step.

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,466
Need help
picking up your stuff?

141
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:58,033
[giggling]

142
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:00,966
[gasp]

143
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:02,533
Uh...

144
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:03,466
What the heck?

145
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,900
Creepy...

146
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,366
[sigh]

147
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:15,066
Hey there!

148
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,366
You look kinda down.

149
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,466
What's wrong?

150
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,966
Well, I wanna see
Haruka and Michiru again.

151
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,033
[gasp]

152
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,100
They're Sailor
Guardians, just like we are.

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,433
And, they've
been helping us,

154
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,400
so why do we have to
keep acting like we're on

155
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,600
different sides?

156
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:34,300
I wanna meet with them
face‐to‐face and talk it out.

157
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,233
I have to get to
a club meeting.

158
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,366
So do I.

159
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,233
You're both
gonna abandon me?!

160
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:46,033
Things'll work out the
way they're meant to.

161
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,033
Have faith.

162
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,966
You should focus more
on your own life and

163
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,466
worry less about them.

164
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,233
Hey, shouldn't you be
taking a make‐up exam, now?

165
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,566
You're right, I
should get going.

166
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,266
You're a wonder
with plants, Mako.

167
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,600
Ever since you
joined our Club,

168
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,600
the greenhouses are
full of new species.

169
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:07,200
And it seems like the
flowers are always in bloom.

170
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,100
Really?

171
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,433
Yeah, totally!

172
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,200
Do you happen to
have a favorite flower?

173
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,966
The Camellia.

174
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,966
The Sasanqua Camellia.

175
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
Even now, it still
makes me think of him.

176
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,300
Mako...

177
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:23,766
Hey! I've been
meaning to ask you.

178
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:26,100
Have you heard about
a houseplant called a "Tellun"?

179
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,366
A "Tellun"?

180
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,666
No. I haven't.

181
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,366
It's low maintenance because
it doesn't need to be watered.

182
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:33,200
It takes moisture
right outta the air.

183
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,000
It's really popular, right now.

184
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,300
The Mugen Botanical Garden
is selling tons of 'em.

185
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,333
The Death Busters are
nesting inside Mugen

186
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,133
Academy, just as we thought.

187
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,000
Which means there's
a good chance the

188
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,600
school is their hideout.

189
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,000
Uh‐huh!

190
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,500
Let's move in
before things get worse.

191
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,633
Uh‐huh!

192
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,000
The energy readings we've
been getting from Mugenzu

193
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,433
are highly unusual,
especially near the Academy.

194
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,200
Professor Tomoe, huh?

195
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Something about his
face looks suspicious,

196
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,533
if you ask me.

197
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:05,133
And, it says here
he has a daughter, too.

198
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,466
"Hotaru Tomoe".

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,033
The same Hotaru we met?!

200
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,533
It's that new plant.

201
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,666
That must mean these are from
the Mugen Botanical Garden.

202
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,100
Interested?

203
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,966
You're lucky I still
have some in stock.

204
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,433
They're so easy
to take care of,

205
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,200
everyone seems to want one.

206
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:38,100
Mako, you really do have a
thing for plants, don't you?

207
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,766
Yeah, I'm kinda
curious about this one.

208
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,500
It's new.

209
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:46,966
"Tellun" Bred by Ruru Teruno,
of Mugen Academy.

210
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,666
I'm home!

211
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:57,966
Huh?

212
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,533
Where are you
going, Chibi‐Usa?

213
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,166
To Hotaru's place.

214
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,033
[gasp]

215
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,333
Wait! I'm going with you!

216
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,366
Okay...

217
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,066
Hello?

218
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,833
Chibi‐Usa!
What are you doing?!

219
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,100
We can't just
let ourselves in.

220
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,500
There was no intercom.

221
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,366
So it's not my fault.

222
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,166
What are you two
doing in this laboratory?

223
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,333
You know you're trespassing.

224
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:22,433
Yeah... Well, you see...
The thing is...

225
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,366
‐We just‐
‐It's okay, Kaori.

226
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,733
These two are my guests.

227
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:27,366
Hotaru!

228
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
This way.

229
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,833
So, what brings
you here today?

230
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,733
I wanted you to have this.

231
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,233
What?!

232
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,833
You're just givng
it away like that?!

233
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:39,700
But Mamo and I worked hard
to make that Holy Grail for you!

234
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,333
Well, My teacher told me
to give it to someone very

235
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:44,166
special as a present.

236
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,033
So, I thought I'd
give it to you,

237
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,666
Hotaru, as a token
of our friendship.

238
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,733
[gasp]

239
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:51,333
Oh...

240
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,233
Is that right?

241
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,166
Not that I care, but are
you sure you don't

242
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,666
wanna give it to Mamo?

243
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:57,266
I can't give it to Mamo.

244
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,166
The both of you
helped me make it.

245
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,133
If I only gave it to him,
that wouldn't be fair to you.

246
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,266
Chibi‐Usa.

247
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:08,166
I'm very sorry, but I
can't accept this gift.

248
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:11,266
People who love you worked
hard to help make it for you.

249
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,400
So, I really think it's
something you should

250
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,733
share with them.

251
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:17,566
But, thank you
for thinking of me.

252
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,566
Her eyes are so
dark and deep,

253
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,600
they could pull
you right in...

254
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,800
It's like they
know everything.

255
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,733
What's wrong?

256
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,600
Um, where's the‐‐?

257
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Down at the end of the hall.

258
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,566
I'll be right back.

259
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,766
Wow.

260
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,100
That was embarrassing.

261
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,000
[chuckle]

262
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:56,966
[gasp]

263
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,666
Hotaru?

264
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,033
Are you okay?

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,133
Just touching your amulet makes
me feel better, Chibi‐Usa.

266
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,900
All my pain disappears.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,566
Really?

268
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,233
The power inside of
it, does it have a name?

269
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,200
It's the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

270
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,900
The Legendary
Silver Crystal...

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,866
[gasp]

272
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,166
Hotaru?

273
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,966
What was that?

274
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:39,300
For a moment, I craved to
have Chibi‐Usa's amulet.

275
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,900
But why?

276
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,866
It felt as if there was
somebody else inside of me...

277
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,633
The Legendary
Silver Crystal?

278
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:50,966
[sigh]

279
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,833
<i>So Mugen Academy is</i>
<i>right behind this lab, huh.</i>

280
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:58,066
I wonder if this place
does experiments on animals,

281
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,200
like the lab Ami
saw at the school?

282
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Exactly what kind of
research are they doing?

283
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,266
Hello there.

284
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,733
Can I help you?

285
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,033
I, uh‐ drank too
much tea with Hotaru.

286
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,233
And I‐I have a
really small bladder,

287
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,733
so I had to go
to the bathroom.

288
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:14,933
‐A‐and then I just‐
‐I see...

289
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,600
So you're a friend
of my daughter's.

290
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:18,933
Hotaru.

291
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,966
It's time for your
health check‐up.

292
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,266
We, uh, should be
getting home anyway.

293
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:24,600
Bye!

294
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,233
See ya, Hotaru.

295
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,600
Bye‐Bye!

296
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,066
So that guy is
Professor Tomoe?

297
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,700
His hand was as hard and
cold as a block of ice.

298
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,733
When he first
touched my shoulder,

299
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,266
I didn't think he was human.

300
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,700
Chibi‐Usa?

301
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,600
It can't be her.

302
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,933
There's no way she'd
be walking around here.

303
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:56,800
Whoa!

304
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,033
Guess it's been a while
since I've been here.

305
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,433
Did you get
even more plants?

306
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,300
I did.

307
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,466
But most of them
aren't doing too well.

308
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,700
Probably because
of all the rain.

309
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,266
Would you like some tea?

310
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,266
Sure, thanks!

311
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:14,033
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.

312
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,966
[yawn] Me, too.

313
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,166
I smell
something nice, but...

314
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,000
Mako...

315
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:29,833
Mako!

316
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,866
The flowers are blooming.

317
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,266
Who's there?

318
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,133
Is that you, Nichogi?

319
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,333
Mako!

320
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,800
Wake up!

321
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,300
Oh, it's just you, Minako.

322
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,966
Mako, take a
look over there!

323
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
It's budding?

324
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:47,033
After only one day?!

325
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,133
Not that.
Look at all the other plants!

326
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,200
They've all
withered and died?!

327
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,666
Mako?

328
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,366
What the hell?

329
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,900
Hmm...

330
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,933
So this is how the three
areas that form Mugenzu

331
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,733
all connect, huh?

332
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,866
Tenohzu, Kaiohzu.
That's strange.

333
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,166
They're the same as Haruka
and Michiru's last names.

334
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,200
Usagi!

335
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,366
Hey guys.

336
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:20,433
What's up?

337
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:21,866
Something wrong?

338
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,733
Mugen Garden is our enemy!

339
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,900
Are you sure?

340
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27,033
[gasp]

341
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:27,866
Haruka!

342
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:28,900
Michiru!

343
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,766
Don't go!

344
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,333
Usagi!

345
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,900
Why are you
running away, Haruka?

346
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,333
What is it?

347
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,866
Are you trying to avoid us?

348
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:50,100
They live in
the Minato ward.

349
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,333
So close, and
yet I never knew!

350
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Haruka...

351
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:57,400
You're a Sailor
Guardian like I am.

352
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,066
I don't know why we
can't fight together.

353
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,966
Why won't you say anything?

354
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,100
Usagi.

355
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,500
We can't let the enemy
hurt more innocent people.

356
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,800
That's our mission, so that's
what we have to focus on.

357
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:27,466
Come on.

358
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,500
It's like a jungle in here.

359
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Look over there!

360
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,300
Everyone's unconscious!

361
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,966
I know that scent...

362
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,166
[gasp]

363
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:44,300
I was right!

364
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,300
Tellun!

365
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:46,966
[gasp]

366
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:47,900
Oh no!

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,133
My strength is
draining out of me!

368
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,900
[chuckle]

369
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,500
What marvelous
life energies!

370
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,433
And to think the mighty
Sailor Guardians just walked

371
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,933
into my trap of
their own accord!

372
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,366
Lucky me!

373
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,200
[chuckle]

374
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,166
These Tellun
plants are a part of me.

375
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:08,500
They are such
beautiful flowers.

376
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,633
And they thrive
on life force.

377
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,666
The blossoms in here are
filled with human energy,

378
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,666
concentrated souls,
otherwise called Hosts.

379
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:18,500
And, they are
all for my Master.

380
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,333
Once I've
offered them to him,

381
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,900
he'll make me a
Magus like Kaolinite!

382
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,300
I can sense it.

383
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,533
Someone is suffering.

384
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,566
Someone who is
very close to us.

385
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,533
‐Could it be...
‐...an ally?

386
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,966
I can't breathe...

387
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,900
And I can feel the
life draining out of me.

388
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:46,233
Is this how I will die?

389
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,233
No!

390
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:52,166
I cannot die, yet.

391
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:55,066
I must remember the
reason I was born.

392
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,366
And the reason I was reborn!

393
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,266
Awaken...

394
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,433
The time has come.

395
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,266
What was that?

396
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:10,933
Something's just
been awakened!

397
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,366
Ready girls?
Let's do this!

398
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:19,433
Moon Cosmic Power...

399
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,033
Mercury Planet Power...

400
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,966
Mars Planet Power...

401
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,300
Jupiter Planet Power...

402
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,966
Venus Planet Power...

403
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,366
Moon Prism Power...

404
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:34,300
Make Up!

405
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:15,066
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice.

406
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,466
I am Sailor Moon!

407
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,466
And now, in the
name of the Moon,

408
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,066
I'll punish you!

409
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:25,200
So you've
revealed yourselves.

410
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,733
Allow me to do the same.

411
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,133
I am called Tellu.

412
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,566
Know what my level is?

413
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,600
404.

414
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,966
That's very high, high
enough to take your Hosts

415
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,366
and the rest of
your other powers, too.

416
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,933
Mars Snake Fire!

417
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,133
Venus Wink Chain Sword!

418
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:54,933
Mercury Aqua Mirage!

419
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,333
Mandragora Buster!

420
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,700
Jupiter Coconut Cyclone!

421
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,533
Neo Queen Serenity!

422
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:14,333
Lend me your strength!

423
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,133
Lend your power to
my Heart Moon Rod!

424
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,000
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

425
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,333
[giggling]

426
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,300
Such brilliant power!

427
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,200
No way!

428
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,500
Sailor Moon!

429
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:47,700
Mommy, give me power, too!

430
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,100
I want to be able to
help Sailor Moon

431
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,500
and fight by her side!

432
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,633
Please!

433
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,333
Luna P?

434
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,066
Is this a new Moon Rod?

435
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,533
One just for me?

436
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,266
Pink Sugar Heart Attack!

437
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,433
[snicker]

438
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,366
[yell]

439
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,533
[gasp]

440
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:30,500
[scream]

441
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,266
[attacking yell]

442
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,233
Chibi Moon!

443
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,566
No!

444
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,233
Dead Scream.

445
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:45,266
[death scream]

446
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,366
That voice and
that attack...

447
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,733
You're Sailor Pluto!

448
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,200
What's going on?!

449
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:39,900
Next time, "Act.32
Infinity 6 Three Guardians."

450
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,700
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
