1
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,130
Tuxedo Mask!
Open your eyes!

2
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,130
Someone...
Is calling to me.

3
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,170
Long hair...

4
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,090
That shimmers
like moonlight...

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,140
The one who calls out
to me in my dreams...
It is you?

6
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,060
Sailor Moon?

7
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,230
You're sad. A face such
as yours should never
be sad.

8
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,170
Why are you crying?

9
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,030
Wait! Something like
this has happened
before...

10
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,130
Endymion!

11
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,160
Please don't leave
me, Endymion!

12
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,120
Endymion!
Endymion!

13
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,040
Endymion? That's...
my name?

14
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,100
I was reborn here on
Earth as Mamoru Chiba.

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,140
I remember now...

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
I came back...

17
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
to be with you
again...

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,020
I found you...
Serenity.

19
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,160
My love...

20
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,100
Hmph!

21
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,200
[gasp]

22
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,140
[screaming]

23
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,040
Sailor Moon!

24
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,090
The crescent
moon symbol!

25
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,528
[gasp]

26
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,080
Something's happening
to Sailor Moon!

27
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,160
Her body is
changing!

28
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,080
Usagi... she's...

29
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,140
Is that Usagi?

30
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,210
No. That's Princess
Serenity...

31
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,090
[gasp]

32
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,220
His broken watch, it's
ticking again... running
backwards.

33
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,140
Like it's turning
back time.

34
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,210
To the memories I
lost... that are
starting to return.

35
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,140
Unhappy memories.

36
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,140
[screaming]

37
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,110
[gasp]

38
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,060
It's all coming
back to me.

39
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,060
I remember now.

40
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,060
You are my one
true love, Endymion.

41
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,180
Long ago I saw a planet full
of hope and possibilities. Like
your eyes, it was a deep and

42
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,010
captivating blue that
mesmerized me.

43
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,090
So I secretly left the
Moon and came to visit.

44
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,010
And then I saw you,
Endymion, the Earth's
prince and heir...

45
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,010
You were so handsome.
With such charm and
strength. I came to this

46
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,220
planet many times just to
catch a glimpse of you.

47
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,110
Then one day...

48
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,150
You saw me.

49
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,070
And before we knew it,
we were falling in love.

50
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:59,000
Endymion, this has to
stop. We mustn't see
each other anymore.

51
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,120
Why?

52
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,070
People from the Earth
and people from the

53
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,130
Moon are not allowed
to be together.

54
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,200
It's forbidden. It's
the will of the gods.

55
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,160
We shouldn't, we
mustn't fall in love.

56
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,180
But it was too late...

57
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,010
Come on, men! Let's
conquer the Moon
Kingdom!

58
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,160
The Legendary Silver
Crystal will be ours!

59
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,120
Stop this! I am your
prince! Cease this
warfare!

60
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,000
Endymion?! Have you
turned against us?!

61
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,120
This is all her fault!

62
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,120
[gasp]

63
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,210
I will destroy you!

64
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,130
[gasp]

65
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,210
[screaming]

66
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,090
Endymion! No!

67
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,090
Please, say something!
Open your eyes!

68
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,180
We were reborn. Did we
find each other just
to be separated again?

69
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,100
Fate cannot
be that cruel.

70
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,150
I never got to tell you,
how I really feel about
you.

71
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,170
I love you! You're my
one and only true love!

72
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,090
Tuxedo Mask!

73
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,150
[crying]

74
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,160
[grunting]

75
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,180
So bright!

76
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,140
And powerful!

77
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,190
We can't get
anywhere near
them!

78
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,220
Usagi's tear crystalized!
It's gleaming!

79
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,040
It's too bright!
I can't see a
thing!

80
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,140
That brilliant,
white light...

81
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,180
Could it be...

82
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,190
I didn't think that the
seal would be broken
for a long time.

83
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,100
But there it is...

84
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,100
The Legendary
Silver Crystal!

85
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:03,190
Oh yes! What extraordinary
power! I can feel its energy
flowing through me! It can be

86
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,210
none other than the
Legendary Silver
Crystal!

87
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,110
Finally, the real
Crystal has appeared
at last!

88
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,020
A ball of light split
off from the Crystal.

89
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,230
And now it's going
into Tuxedo Mask!

90
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,230
The light...
it disappeared.

91
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,000
Queen Beryl,
you're here.

92
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,010
Now, Kunzite!
Hurry!

93
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,190
Seize the Legendary
Silver Crystal for

94
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,030
the glory of the
Dark Kingdom!

95
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,030
At once!

96
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,160
[grunting]

97
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,010
Wait Kunzite!
Don't do this!

98
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,220
Get out of my way!

99
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,170
Supreme Thunder!

100
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,140
Mercury Aqua Mist!

101
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,070
What?!

102
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,040
Evil Spirit, be gone!

103
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,230
[screaming]

104
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,040
Well, I'll just have
to destroy you myself!

105
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:13,020
[screaming]

106
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,120
[screaming]

107
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,120
Sailor Moon,
are you okay?

108
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,040
[gasp]

109
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,210
Where is Tuxedo Mask?

110
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,150
[gasp]

111
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,130
[snickering]

112
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,010
[evil laughter]

113
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,050
Tuxedo Mask!

114
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,190
Can't we save
him for her?!

115
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,170
We can't! We have to
protect the princess!

116
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,080
Looks like I'll be leaving
with the Crystal and Tuxedo
Mask!

117
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,130
Please, Sailor
Moon, stay back!

118
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,100
Let go!

119
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,060
I'm done with you
Sailor Guardians!

120
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,070
Please! Please
don't take him!

121
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,050
[crying]

122
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,070
No! Please just
let him go!

123
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,160
[crying]

124
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,170
Please, I beg
of you!

125
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Don't go!

126
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,230
Mamo!

127
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,160
[crying]

128
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,000
Sailor Moon...

129
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,210
I mean, Serenity,
my Princess...

130
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,020
Has your memory
come back?

131
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,050
So you remember now that
I, Sailor Venus,

132
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,210
am true leader of
the Sailor Guardians.

133
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,080
And how we four were
assigned to protect
you.

134
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,100
Do you recall our kingdom,
Silver Millennium? The glory
that it once was?

135
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,070
[sigh]

136
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,090
Yes, I remember.

137
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,200
So the Moon Kingdom's
real Princess isn't
Minako?

138
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,210
It's actually Usagi?

139
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm so sorry we had
to deceive you all,
but it was necessary

140
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,110
to protect both the
Princess and the

141
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,010
Legendary Silver
Crystal.

142
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,000
Then what's the
whole story?

143
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,110
Please tell us what
happened in the past.

144
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,110
Mhm. Back in ancient times,
the Earth was one big

145
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,080
country, a kingdom
unto itself.

146
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,060
The Moon was a separate
realm, distinct from
its close neighbor.

147
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:50,200
All of you served the Princess
as Sailor Guardians. You were
her bodyguards, her protectors.

148
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,010
Then came that
terrible day...

149
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,010
The Earth went to war with
the Moon and everything
changed.

150
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,190
That's right...

151
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,230
In our past lives
we were fighting.

152
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,230
As Guardians, we were
ready to lay down our
lives for the Princess.

153
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,090
Indeed. But while you were
busy trying to repel wave
after wave of Earth soldiers,

154
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,070
Endymion, the Earth's prince
and sole heir, fought to
make peace.

155
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,010
Sadly one of his own people
turned on him, and struck
him down.

156
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,200
Are you saying that
prince was Tuxedo
Mask?

157
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,010
Yes, that is correct.

158
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:33,040
The boy, Mamoru Chiba,
is Prince Endymion
reincarnate.

159
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,050
The terrible tragedy that
befell the Moon never should

160
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,120
have happened, but our enemy
brainwashed the people of

161
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,010
Earth and drove them to
attack us. Still, the Moon

162
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,130
Kingdom fought back and
managed to seal the
evil away.

163
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,100
So this is history
repeating itself.

164
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,000
It's so awful. Why is
this happening again?

165
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,060
That woman! She must
have broken the seal
and freed the evil!

166
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,060
Who are you talking
about?

167
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,050
Do you mean that woman
who took Tuxedo Mask?

168
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,080
Did you recognize
her? Who is she?

169
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,040
Oh Minako! Tell me that
you know where she's
taken Mamo!

170
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,100
Please! I need
to find him!

171
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,100
I'm sorry. I don't
know. Please calm
down, Princess.

172
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,060
Stop calling me that!
I'm not a princess!
I'm Usagi Tsukino!

173
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,090
I'm not royalty! I'm
just a normal girl in
middle school!

174
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,060
I'm just a girl in
love with a boy.

175
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,030
The only thing
I want is Mamo!

176
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,210
[crying]

177
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,210
It's still hard
to believe...

178
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,140
This was my tear but it's
also the Legendary

179
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,090
Silver Crystal we've
been looking for.

180
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,020
It's not your tear. It's
your strong love for

181
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:49,010
Endymion that manifested in
this world as the Crystal.

182
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,120
Endymion.

183
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,080
[gasp]

184
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,210
Mamo! No...

185
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,000
Ah! Princess!

186
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,120
Princess! Are
you all right?

187
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,090
What happened?

188
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,110
She fainted! It was
all too much!

189
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Princess? Princess?!

190
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,090
Have you found the
Legendary Silver
Crystal yet?

191
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,090
No, my Queen. And we've
searched his entire body.

192
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,230
I don't understand. With
my own eyes, I witnessed

193
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,150
the radiant light
of the Crystal!

194
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,080
I saw it get drawn
into his body!

195
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,220
Damn! Find it! Whatever
it takes! But until you
do keep him alive.

196
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,040
Yes, my Queen.

197
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,030
Who's he? I feel like
I've seen him before.

198
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,000
I agree with you.
He looks familiar.

199
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,010
It's like I knew him
from somewhere a long
time ago.

200
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,060
Endymion!

201
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,050
[gasp]

202
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,130
Endy-

203
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,080
Agh!

204
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,110
So what do you
think, Kunzite?

205
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,150
Uh, no. He doesn't
look familiar to me.

206
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,230
Let's focus. The only
thing that matters is
finding the Legendary

207
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:24,110
Silver Crystal for
our Great Ruler,
nothing else!

208
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,060
Without the Legendary
Silver Crystal you are
of no use to me!

209
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,090
[screaming]

210
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,030
Noo!

211
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,070
How many nightmares
has it been?

212
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,130
How many more times
will I wake up crying?

213
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:57,000
[crying]

214
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,150
After the Moon Kingdom fell,
Artemis and I were placed in
suspended animation.

215
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,080
And part of my memory
was sealed away.

216
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,090
I slept for a
long time.

217
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,000
But then I woke up
and met you, Usagi.

218
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,180
Only I didn't trust
you enough...

219
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,010
And I ended up putting
you through so much
pain and suffering.

220
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,080
I failed you.
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,130
Come on, Luna. You
gotta get up. Let's
go see Usagi.

222
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,120
But Artemis...

223
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,140
We want to see her.
We need her with us.

224
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,050
Usagi is the heart
of this team.

225
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,020
If she isn't happy
and smiling then
neither are we.

226
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,020
You feel it too.
You're her partner.

227
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,100
Yeah. You're right.

228
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,130
Thanks so much for
stopping by.

229
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,200
I'm sure she'll be happy to
see you. Please come in.

230
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,070
How is she doing?
Is she feeling better?

231
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,190
I'm not sure.

232
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,180
She hasn't come out
of her room for quite
a while.

233
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,160
Hey Usagi? It's
Luna. Everyone's
here to see you?

234
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,050
We came to check
on you. Can we
come in?

235
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,120
Give me a sec.

236
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,140
Sure.

237
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,020
Okay!

238
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,020
[gasp]

239
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,130
[gasps]

240
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,180
Um, hi...
everyone.

241
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,090
Usagi?

242
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,050
What happened
to your hair?

243
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,150
Okay, I finished
cutting.

244
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,170
This one's too small, I
think we can wrap around
one more time.

245
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,160
Whadya think?
Like it?

246
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,160
Mm hmm...

247
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,140
I think this is how
it was before, right?

248
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,150
When did your
hair get so long.

249
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,070
Ever since that day, it
just started growing
really fast.

250
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,190
Back when you were the
Princess you would always
let your hair grow long.

251
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,100
Now that your memory's
back, your body's

252
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,150
just changing back
a little too.

253
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,180
Don't worry about it.

254
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,050
My body's changing? Does
that mean I'm turning
into the princess?

255
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,170
Then who am I now?
It's like I've
stopped being me.

256
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,140
Usagi? Is this the
crystal on the
table, here?

257
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,140
Yeah.

258
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,030
But it hasn't been
glowing lately.

259
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,160
Now it just looks
like an ordinary
piece of cut glass.

260
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,100
Not like that day with
him, when it shone as
bright as the sun.

261
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,200
That day...

262
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,010
[gasp]

263
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,150
Tuxedo mask! What's
happening to him?!
Where is he?!

264
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,200
It'll be okay.

265
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,130
No! We have to rescue
him! If we don't hurry
he'll be-

266
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,120
I... Mamo!

267
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Please don't cry!

268
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,160
I'm sure he's fine!

269
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,190
I just can't take it!
I'm so scared! He's
gone!

270
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,150
And I don't know
what to do.

271
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Come on, Usagi! Don't
lose hope! Pull yourself
together now!

272
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,120
The Usagi I know is
stronger than that!

273
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,050
You really think,
that I'm strong?

274
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,080
Back in the Moon Kingdom
whenever we were sad,
Princess Serenity was

275
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,210
always there to cheer
us up with her sweet
smile.

276
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,120
Just like you've
always done for me.

277
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,060
I can't Ami! I'm
not the Princess!

278
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,140
That's right.
You're not.

279
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,050
You're Usagi
Tsukino.

280
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,170
And you don't have
to follow anyone

281
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,230
else's destiny
but your own.

282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,130
Even so, you've been
reborn now for a reason.

283
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,140
And we don't care why
or what your fate is
now.

284
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,050
We'll help you
no matter what.

285
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,070
Yes, that's right. We'll
be with you, come what
may.

286
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,080
Thank you.

287
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,090
[crying]

288
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,160
Usagi.

289
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,090
Thank you, guys. I
don't know what I'd
do without you!

290
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,210
But I still don't know
how to save Mamo!

291
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,150
[crying]

292
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,120
I think we should
go to the Moon.

293
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,100
Hnh?

294
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,160
The Dark Kingdom's location,
who our evil enemy really is,

295
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,180
and everything you wanted to
know about the Silver Crystal...

296
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,010
All the information...
All the answers are
there, on the Moon.

297
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,000
The moon?

298
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,200
The Moon, our former home.
Where Silver Millennium
once stood.

299
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,230
I was happy there.

300
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,010
Surrounded by my
dearest friends.

301
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,100
And then I found my
one true love...

302
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,140
Such precious moments.
I treasured them all!

303
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,000
I lost that happiness once,
I won't let it be stolen
from me again!

304
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,110
Never again! I will
not be a tragic
princess!

305
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,150
All right!
Let's go!

306
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,190
Let's find out what
secrets the Moon holds!

307
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,170
[determined grunts]

308
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,040
This is the Moon?

309
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,110
It's so dark.

310
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,160
And there's no sound at
all here. It feels so
strange.

311
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,130
What are those ruins?

312
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,130
Silver Millennium. This
is where are kingdom
once existed.

313
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,170
[gasp] Luna?
Who is that?

314
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,000
