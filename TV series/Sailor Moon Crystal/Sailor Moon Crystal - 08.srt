1
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,000
Who is that?

2
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,070
A crescent mark on
her forehead...

3
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,060
Is it possible
that she's-?

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,090
The legendary
Guardian of
Justice...

5
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,130
Sailor V?

6
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,020
There is a fifth Sailor
Guardian now? That
can't be.

7
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,040
Sailor V?

8
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,180
I don't believe it.
What is she doing
here?

9
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,030
Is she really the same
Sailor V from the news
and video game?

10
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,010
Her costume seems different.

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,050
I am.

12
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,170
I assure you it's me.

13
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,030
I've just never taken
off the mask in public
before.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,120
Sailor V's red mask?!
So you really are her!

15
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,180
How rude! Show
some respect!

16
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,100
While it is true she
is Sailor V, there is
more...

17
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,090
My mistress is of the
Moon Kingdom, Silver
Millennium.

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,140
She is heiress
to the sacred

19
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,130
Legendary Silver Crystal!
She is Princess Serenity!

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,170
[gasp]

21
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,210
Sailor V is the
princess? I
knew it!

22
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,220
And that crescent moon
mark on her forehead.

23
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,230
I was right! It must be the
symbol of Princess Serenity!

24
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,120
What's going on? My
forehead feels hot.

25
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,190
My tiara! It
changed shape!

26
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,180
[gasp]

27
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,160
That was strange. For
a second there it felt

28
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,190
like I was on the verge
of remembering something
important.

29
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,160
Damn it! This time
I was so close!

30
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,140
Princess Serenity?

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,120
Tuxedo Mask!

32
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,060
That man...

33
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,110
Princess Serenity...
That name... It sounds
so familiar.

34
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,110
Tuxedo Mask!

35
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,100
Usako...

36
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,090
I wasn't strong enough.
I couldn't protect her.

37
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,010
Ohh...

38
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,140
You've done a pretty
good job so far, Sailor
Moon, I'm proud of you.

39
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,200
Sailor V, my hero, is
standing right here in
front of me?!

40
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,170
And she's the princess?!

41
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,220
I don't believe it!

42
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm proud of you all.

43
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,000
[stunned gasp]

44
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,080
This may sound odd but
I feel like I already
know all of you.

45
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,010
Because I've been
watching you for so
long through the game.

46
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,200
Huh?

47
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,230
We've been using the Sailor
V game as a combat simulator
to teach you how to fight.

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,150
Looks like it
worked.

49
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,160
You were watching us?

50
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,200
What are you waiting
for, Sailor Moon?
Hurry!

51
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,160
Oh wow! So it was you
talking to me through
that video game!

52
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,220
I thought I was
going crazy!

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,517
[giggle]

54
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,180
Usagi? Are you
all okay?!

55
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,170
That you, Luna? Are
you at the command
center?

56
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,140
I'll see you soon.

57
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,120
Huh?

58
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,210
So you're really
just a girl?

59
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,090
This is kind
of my disguise.

60
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,090
Down here on
Earth, I'm Minako
Aino.

61
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,030
And I'm a middle
school student,
like you.

62
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,150
Please accept my apologies,
Princess. I should've been
there to greet you.

63
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,210
There's no need to
apologize, Luna. You
needed to be here.

64
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,150
You were just
doing your job.

65
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,230
Ah, the Command Center.
It's been a long time.

66
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,170
Sailor V... I mean,
Princess, we were

67
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,200
searching everywhere
for you.

68
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,200
Where have
you been?

69
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,170
I guess I have some
explaining to do.

70
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,010
I met my partner Artemis
long before you met Luna.

71
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,230
Back then we had no idea
any of you existed.

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,150
It was just the two of us.

73
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,030
I went by the codename:
Sailor V. And together, we
set out to solve the rash

74
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,150
of mysterious crimes that
seemed to be plaguing Tokyo.

75
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,210
Eventually we noticed
a pattern. The crimes
were all connected but

76
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,140
there was something more...

77
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,220
Behind every unusual
case we encountered,

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,220
was a large, s
sinister shadow...

79
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,100
The Dark Kingdom.

80
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,110
The kingdom is ruled, or
rather controlled, by a

81
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,160
terrible creature
born from the darkness.

82
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,150
A being made out of
pure evil, unlike
anything else.

83
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,110
In its lust for power, this
diabolical thing has become
determined to possess the

84
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,000
Moon Kingdom's sacred
stone, the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

85
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,160
It will stop at nothing.
It has plans to conquer
the Earth!

86
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,010
Right now, human energy
is the power it's been
surviving on.

87
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,200
That's why the attacks
involve so many people.

88
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,110
Have you actually
encountered this
creature?

89
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,190
Yes, a long
time ago.

90
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,060
It was responsible for the
destruction of the Moon
Kingdom, Silver Millennium.

91
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,000
It robbed everyone
of their happiness!

92
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,160
In the end, we managed to
seal it away.

93
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,060
But someone broke the seal
and now it's free again.

94
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,180
Do you understand?
This time we have to
seal it away permanently.

95
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,170
We can't let history
repeat itself.

96
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,130
We must stop this
thing once and for all.

97
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,000
I understand. That's why we
were made Sailor Guardians.

98
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,000
To ensure that doesn't
happen again!

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,020
Tell us, Princess.

100
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,230
Do you know where the
Legendary SilverCrystal is?

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
I do, but for your own
safety, I can't share

102
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,040
that information just yet.

103
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,020
The enemy will come after
us again for sure. It's
better if you don't know.

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,180
Whatever you say,
Sailor V...

105
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,020
Uh, I mean, Princess...

106
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,150
Don't worry you
can count on us!

107
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,210
The four of us are with
you. We're here to support
your endeavor.

108
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,070
No matter how strong this
enemy is or may become,
we'll face it head on!

109
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,130
We're not afraid!

110
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,130
As Sailor Guardians,
we'll fight for you
till the end!

111
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,200
Hmm...

112
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,000
Princess?

113
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,070
Yes. Thank you,
everyone.

114
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,210
Goodnight Princess!
See you soon!

115
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,000
[giggling]

116
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,020
Time is running out.
Soon they'll remember
everything.

117
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,210
I must hurry. This all
needs to be settled as
soon as possible.

118
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,180
Minako, you've been
fighting for so long,
all by yourself.

119
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,020
Please, stop!

120
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,030
Let them help you!

121
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,140
Artemis. I can't.
You know that.

122
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,050
I have a mission.
A very important
mission...

123
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,050
...that only I
can carry out.

124
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,100
[battling yells]

125
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,010
Get him!

126
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,090
Endymion!

127
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,050
Princess Serenity!

128
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,090
Endymion!

129
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,040
[gasp]

130
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,060
It was just a dream...

131
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,200
I guess I probably dreamed
that because I actually

132
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,040
met the Princess
the other day...

133
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,080
Princess Serenity!

134
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,180
"Serenity." That was the
name he called out. Was he
talking to me? Who is he?

135
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,090
I've seen him in my dreams
before. But I called him

136
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,210
"Endymion," this time.
What does it all mean?

137
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,110
Sailor V... I guess she's
the princess, but I feel

138
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,030
like she's still hiding
something from us.

139
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,050
Something important.

140
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,070
Mamo. Hi.

141
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,120
[uneasy laugh]

142
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,000
Good morning.

143
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,050
Hi.

144
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,200
It became an
obsession.

145
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,110
I needed to find the
Silver Crystal. It was

146
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,040
the only clue I had
to my lost memories.

147
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,120
The Legendary Silver
Crystal... the princess
said she knew where it

148
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,000
was but couldn't tell us.

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,200
I don't know. I'm not
sure what's real anymore.

150
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,110
I'm sorry, Usako.

151
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,040
Huh?

152
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,140
I wasn't able
to protect you.

153
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,010
I'm ashamed to look
you in the eye,

154
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,030
but I guess I was
destined to bump into
you again.

155
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,210
So why fight it?

156
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,110
[gasp]

157
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,210
Yeah. Must
be fate.

158
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,140
Hey! I just remembered!
This pocket watch, it's
yours right?

159
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,200
I meant to give it
back to you, but
I forgot.

160
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,230
No. You keep it.
In fact...

161
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,130
I have something of yours
that I've been holding
onto as well.

162
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,050
Huh? You have something of
mine? What on earth could
that be?

163
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,010
I didn't leave
anything with you.

164
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,120
Well then maybe I'll
let you have it next
time. Sound good?

165
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,120
[gasp]

166
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,120
Yeah. Next
time then.

167
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,220
When did she start looking
at him that way? Mamoru
Chiba, Tuxedo Mask...

168
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,220
So much I still don't know.

169
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,070
Is it okay for her to
fall in love with him?

170
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,210
Don't fret, Luna.

171
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,150
Artemis.

172
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,110
What is your
primary mission?

173
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,150
To find the Sailor
Guardians and train them?

174
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,120
There's more to
it than that.

175
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,090
Before the Moon Kingdom
fell, you had a place
in the royal household.

176
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,020
You used to look
after the Princess.

177
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,140
What are you
talking about?

178
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,130
You don't remember
do you?

179
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,220
To reduce the burden you
had to bear, part of your

180
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,070
memory was sealed
and kept from you.

181
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,070
But now, it's time for
you to know the truth.
All of it.

182
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,100
Huh?

183
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,170
Oh? The princess of
the Moon Kingdom,
you say?

184
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,120
Yes, O great
Queen Metalia.

185
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:39,030
She thought her mother had
defeated me, thought I was
sealed away forever. No doubt

186
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,180
she's reappeared to try
to rebuild her lost
kingdom.

187
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,010
This reborn princess...

188
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,090
I believe she has memories
of her past life.

189
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,150
She could know the location
of the Silver Crystal.

190
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,100
I agree. Lure her out and
force her to reveal it. I
want that Crystal immediately.

191
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,080
This time I will
be victorious.

192
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,150
And I will reign over
this world once more!

193
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,030
My Queen.

194
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,100
Queen Beryl, it would
seem the time has come.

195
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,150
Allow me, Kunzite, the
strongest of your four

196
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:31,010
commanders to be of
service to you now.

197
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,080
Do not let me down.

198
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,120
[sigh]

199
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,060
When did it get
so late?

200
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,060
Hello Sailor V...
or should I say
Princess?

201
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,020
I know that voice!
It's Kunzite!

202
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,170
Bring the Legendary Silver
Crystal to the top of
Tokyo Tower in thirty minutes.

203
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:07,110
Come alone. Or everyone
in this entire city
will perish.

204
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,100
[gasp]

205
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,010
It must be a trap.
You should call the
others, Minako!

206
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,040
No, Artemis. This fight
is for me alone.

207
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,020
I will face Kunzite
by myself!

208
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,050
Minako!

209
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,170
Hey Princess!

210
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,050
You're here! What
perfect timing!

211
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,090
Timing for what?
What's going on?

212
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,050
We were on our
way to come get
you.

213
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,140
I thought I'd cook
dinner at my place
tonight.

214
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,180
We were just going to
ask you to join us.

215
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,120
I wish I could. But I've
got some errands that I
need to run. Sorry!

216
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,150
Wait!

217
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,100
But Princess...

218
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,070
Tick Tock, my dear
Moon Princess. Time's
almost up.

219
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,180
What's going on? Is
this a blackout?

220
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,080
Can you all
hear me?!

221
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,170
The electricity just went
out all over Tokyo, and
it wasn't an accident!

222
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,130
[gasps]

223
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,020
What's going on?

224
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,120
It's like the energy
went out of them too.

225
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,150
Mamo!

226
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,090
Endymion!

227
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,050
[gasp]

228
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,100
A dream? No...

229
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,180
Someone was calling
out to me.

230
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,150
A blackout? Wait...
It's more than that.

231
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,120
You got what you wanted,
Kunzite! I'm here!

232
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,170
What kept you, Princess?
You're late.

233
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,090
Show me the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

234
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,210
I don't have it and I
won't give it to you!

235
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Now turn the city's
power back on!

236
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,070
We could have done
this the easy way...

237
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,130
But I guess you
prefer the hard
way!

238
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,190
Crescent Boomerang!

239
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,170
[gasp]

240
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,080
[roaring]

241
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,110
[screaming]

242
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,100
You can't protect
anything, Princess.

243
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,180
Not your Silver Millennium
or planet Earth.

244
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,130
Listen to me, Kunzite!

245
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,210
Please don't do this!

246
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,110
Remember who
you really are!

247
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Why are you hesitating,
Kunzite? She's the Moon
Princess. Destroy her!

248
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,130
Hmph! If you won't give
me the crystal, then you
can die!

249
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,220
Not so fast!

250
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,100
You're here!

251
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,000
Stop Kunzite!

252
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,220
How dare you steal our
light, and force our

253
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,230
princess to fight
you, that's awful!

254
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,220
So in the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

255
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,170
Don't! Please! This
is my fight!

256
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,060
No, Princess...

257
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,160
We got this.

258
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,130
We won't let you fight
all alone. We're your
Sailor Guardians.

259
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,200
We're here to help you.

260
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,000
[gasp]

261
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,160
We were each alone
in the beginning,
just like you.

262
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,150
Then we met Usagi and
became a team, but
it's more than that.

263
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,020
We became friends too.

264
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,230
When the going gets tough,
we support one another.

265
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,150
Because that's what
friends are for.

266
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,000
Thank you...

267
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,110
Enough with the
sentiment, it's
time to die!

268
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,180
Mercury Aqua Mist!

269
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,120
Evil Spirit,
be gone!

270
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,190
Supreme Thunder!

271
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,110
Crescent Boomerang!

272
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,170
Those attacks aren't
strong enough to work
on me!

273
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,190
Now, Sailor Moon!
Hit him!

274
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,200
What?!

275
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,200
Moon Healing
Escalation!

276
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,100
[gasp]

277
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,190
That didn't work.

278
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,030
[growling]

279
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,160
[screaming]

280
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,180
Sailor Moon!

281
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,418
[grunting]

282
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:07,090
Princess!

283
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,090
[screaming]

284
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,000
[gasps]

285
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,000
[gasp]

286
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,160
Tuxedo Mask!

287
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,080
I don't believe it! He's
here! He came to save
me again!

288
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,000
It's too dangerous here.
You have to get away from
this place.

289
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,010
I'll be fine. Leave
the rest to me.

290
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,010
Sailor Moon...

291
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,020
I've never seen you this
strong and confident.

292
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,000
You've more beautiful
than ever.

293
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,020
Every time we meet, I
learn something new
about you.

294
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,120
But I have so much more
yet to discover.

295
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,140
What kind of girl
are you really?

296
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,100
I want to know
everything. Who
are you?

297
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,220
Sailor Moon...

298
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,120
Time to finish off
the rest of you!

299
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,140
[gasp]

300
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,170
Sailor Moon!
Don't do it!

301
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,130
[roaring]

302
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,180
[gasp]

303
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,020
Usako! I will
protect you!

304
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,120
And this time,
I won't fail!

305
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,130
Ah!

306
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,150
[grunting]

307
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,160
Tuxedo Mask!

308
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,060
At last, it's time for
all to be revealed.

309
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,040
It's all coming back.
We used to be...

310
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,150
Guardians: sworn to
protect our Moon
Princess.

311
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,150
Now we've been reincarnated
so that the Moon Kingdom
might live again!

312
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,180
That's right. And the
real princess is...

313
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:49,050
I remember everything
now... my beloved...
Endymion.
