1
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,140
Sailor Moon! You're
my only hope!

2
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,100
I'm from the future!
30th century Earth!

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,010
And I need you!

4
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,030
[gasps]

5
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,160
Chibi-Usa?

6
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,150
The truth is...

7
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,100
I'm from Crystal
Tokyo, a city on

8
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,160
Earth in the
30th century.

9
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,130
And I traveled through
time to come here...

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,100
I shouldn't have
kept that a secret.

11
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,070
I was just so scared...

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,110
But I'm not lying now!
You have to believe me!

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,050
There was a huge
explosion in Crystal Tokyo!

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,030
And then Mommy...

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,170
She won't wake up.
And it's all my fault!

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,130
[gasp]

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,120
So Chibi-Usa's
from the future.

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,140
That could mean the
Black Moon is too.

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,160
[gasp]

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,160
Chibi-Usa, can you tell us
what caused that huge

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,110
explosion in Crystal Tokyo?

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,070
[gasps]

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,160
Was it the Black Moon?

24
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,030
Uhh, I don't know...

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,190
Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury,
and Sailor Jupiter, could

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,100
the Black Moon have taken
them to the future?

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,060
I don't know. I don't
know anything, really!

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,150
We can help you. But you
must tell us everything!

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,030
Chibi-Usa, you can
travel in time.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,190
You need to take us
all to the future.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,190
[gasp]

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,180
I don't understand what
happened or how you want

33
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,140
us to help you, but
it's clear we need to

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,180
go to the future!

35
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,100
To the future?

36
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,170
No! I can't go back! I
don't want to! I'm scared!

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,200
But even if we did go
back to the future...

38
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,180
It may already
be too late!

39
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,140
[crying]

40
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,040
It's okay.

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,160
We won't force you
to do anything.

42
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,070
All we want is to help you
and save our friends who

43
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,160
were kidnapped.

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,150
Alright? So take your time.

45
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,120
Just promise me you'll think
about what Venus said. Deal?

46
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,060
Deal.

47
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,150
Chibi-Usa, It's been a long
day. Why don't we all go

48
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,050
home and get some rest.

49
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,050
I don't wanna go home!

50
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,190
I wanna sleep over
at Mamo's house!

51
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,090
Hah!?

52
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,180
Happy now little princess?
Come on. Time for bed.

53
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,120
Okay.

54
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
When you came from
the future, were

55
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,140
you all by yourself?

56
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,210
Mm-mm...

57
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,160
No, I had Luna P with me.

58
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,130
I see.

59
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,120
Hey, would it be alright if
I asked you about your mom?

60
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,150
[gasp]

61
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
About Mommy?

62
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,120
She is kind and beautiful...

63
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,200
And a lot braver than me.

64
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,060
[whimpering]

65
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,050
Chibi-Usa...

66
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,000
Huh?

67
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,180
I believe, it's
okay to be afraid.

68
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,130
Being brave doesn't mean you
don't have any fears. It

69
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,050
means you have the
courage to face them.

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,150
You traveled
through time.

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,190
That must've been scary,
but you did it anyway!

72
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,220
In my book,
that's bravery.

73
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,060
[gasp]

74
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,210
Mamo.

75
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,200
It seems like the
only thing you care

76
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,120
about lately is Chibi-Usa...

77
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,110
Do you like her? Do you
think she's that cute?

78
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,170
Haven't you noticed it?

79
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,150
Mamo, Chibi-Usa is
in love with you!

80
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,140
What?! That's
ridiculous!

81
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,220
She's still in
elementary school!

82
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,020
She's just a little kid!

83
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,060
So what if she's little?!
That doesn't matter in love.

84
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,090
She's still
another woman!

85
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,060
[embarrassed gasp]

86
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,120
I'm so sorry.

87
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,100
I don't know what's
gotten into me lately.

88
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,110
You're right.
It's ridiculous.

89
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,140
How could I be jealous
of a small child?

90
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,180
[uneasy laughs]

91
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,200
Mamo?

92
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,200
Could I?

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,220
Spend the night? I
don't want to go home.

94
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,090
I just want to be
close to you right now.

95
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,110
[gasp]

96
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,220
I guess I'm a
little insecure.

97
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,200
It took us so long
to find each other.

98
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,110
I won't lose you again.

99
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,100
All I want is to love
and protect you!

100
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,010
Usako...

101
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,230
I feel the same
way. I love you...

102
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,080
And I promise, I will
never leave your side.

103
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,110
I will always be there to
protect you. Forever.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,210
A Time warp... Do you think
that's how Chibi-Usa was

105
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,150
able to travel here
from the future?

106
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,160
Luna?

107
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,200
[chuckle] Guess we
have been burning

108
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,140
the candle at
both ends.

109
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,170
Luna. Luna!
Where are you?

110
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,160
You have gone too far!

111
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,080
No one is allowed in
this part of the castle!

112
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,000
Luna. What are you doing
all the way out here?

113
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,000
This place is off-limits.
You know that.

114
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,100
Come. Let us go back.

115
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,548
[gasp]

116
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,200
Stay back.

117
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,150
That is a forbidden door.

118
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,130
Beyond it lies sacred
ground, secretly defended

119
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,120
by a solitary Guardian.

120
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,210
Luna, forget what
you've seen here and

121
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,180
everything I've just said.

122
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,170
Do you understand?

123
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,170
[gasp]

124
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,220
Was I dreaming?

125
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,220
A Silver Crystal
from the future...

126
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,130
and a mysterious key?

127
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Could that mean
Chibi-Usa is?

128
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,000
Being brave doesn't mean
you don't have any fears.

129
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,130
It means you have the
courage to face them.

130
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,170
Oh! Good morning.

131
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,220
Is everything okay?

132
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,130
Yeah, I just heard
Chibi-Usa get up.

133
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,160
I've made up my mind!

134
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,140
Huh?

135
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,230
I'm going to face my fears
and go back to the future!

136
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,000
And Usagi, Mamo, I want
you both to come with me.

137
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,150
You want me to come?

138
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,020
And me too?

139
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,140
[chuckle]

140
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,230
This is a Space-Time Key.

141
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,210
And if we use it, it will
take us all to the future?

142
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,210
Mm-hm!

143
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,180
Small Lady...

144
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,060
Time travel is strictly
prohibited. You must

145
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,230
never attempt it. You
should not even know

146
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,190
about it! Breaking this
ultimate taboo, could have

147
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,160
severe consequences.

148
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,190
I'm not sure if this is
gonna work. I've never

149
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,190
time-traveled with
anyone before.

150
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,210
Hold onto my hand and
don't let go. Okay?

151
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,170
Okay!

152
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,020
Right!

153
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,000
Got it!

154
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,140
Everybody ready?

155
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,150
O Guardian of Time,

156
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,120
tear apart the heavens and
open wide for me, the Door

157
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,150
of Space and Time!

158
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,030
"I summon thee by thy true
name, O Omnipotent God of

159
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,210
Time, Father of the
Guardian, O Chronos!"

160
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,190
Guide us on our journey!

161
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,060
Protect these travelers!

162
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Grant us the Path of Light!

163
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,180
[yell] Oh no! I
can't hold on!

164
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,210
Usagi!

165
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,020
Hmph.

166
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,060
Oh, my. Interesting.

167
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,050
Someone has opened a time
warp, and it is not the one

168
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,070
we use to go to and
from Nemesis.

169
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,120
Do you think
it's the Rabbit?

170
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,050
There are multiple energies.
If it's her she's not alone.

171
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,090
Well, well...

172
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,010
So the little brat has gone
running home to her mommy.

173
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,160
Prince Dimande!

174
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,050
The moment has come.

175
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,010
Now is the time to crush the
Legendary Silver Crystals of

176
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,230
both the past and future!

177
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,160
And the Crystal Palace
along with them!

178
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,060
Destroy the palace?

179
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,210
Hm...

180
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,180
I'll do it! It's the
perfect opportunity.

181
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,230
Just leave it to me.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,020
And don't you worry. No harm
will come to your sleeping

183
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,030
beauty. I know she's
what you really want.

184
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,150
[horrified gasp]

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,020
[snickering] Esmeraude,
you can't pull that off.

186
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,220
[angry scoff]

187
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,170
Chiral! Achiral!

188
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,180
We're the Boule
Brothers: the Black

189
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,140
Moon's finest creation.

190
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,000
Using the awesome power of
the Malefic Black Crystal,

191
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,010
we'll put on a show
you'll never forget.

192
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,080
Chibi-Usa!

193
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,190
Where are you?

194
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,010
Now what? Chibi-Usa said
we had to stay with her.

195
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,080
I think we're somewhere in
between the past and the

196
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,180
future. If we don't
find Chibi-Usa quick,

197
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,140
we could be lost
in time forever.

198
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,180
[screaming]

199
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,020
I gotcha. Hang on.

200
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,010
Luna, are you okay?

201
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,070
Yeah. I'm fine.

202
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,190
Thank goodness.

203
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,030
[gasp]

204
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,060
What is that?

205
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,090
I know that door!

206
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,150
Halt!

207
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,190
None shall pass!
It is forbidden!

208
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,000
[gasp]

209
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,150
I am the keeper of the
Door of Space and Time.

210
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,030
I am Sailor Pluto, Guardian
of the Underworld!

211
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,190
Any intruders beyond this
point, will be destroyed!

212
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,170
Sailor Pluto?!

213
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,060
That means, she's a
Sailor Guardian!

214
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,150
Dead Scream!

215
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,030
[scream]

216
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,040
Now I understand why Queen
Serenity wanted me to stay

217
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,130
away from that door!

218
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,090
"Forbidden ground ,"
"Defended by a solitary

219
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,180
Guardian"

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,190
The Queen was trying to warn
me about Sailor Pluto!

221
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,120
Stop! Don't hurt us! We're
Sailor Guardians too!

222
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,110
No matter who you are,
the law requires all

223
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,130
trespassers be
eliminated.

224
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,100
There are no exceptions.

225
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,140
Prepare yourselves!

226
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,070
[gasp]

227
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,050
I must fulfill
my mission.

228
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,070
Pluto!

229
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,060
Wait! They're my friends!
You can't kill them!

230
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,080
They're with me! I'm the
one who brought them here!

231
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,160
To save Mommy!

232
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,170
[gasp]

233
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,040
I know you told me
not to. I'm sorry!

234
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,220
Where have you
been all this time?!

235
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,130
I broke the law and
went back to the past.

236
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,140
I wanted to steal the
Silver Crystal, that

237
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,060
belonged to Sailor Moon.

238
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,080
I thought it would be more
powerful than this one, and

239
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,160
that I might be able to
use it to help Mommy.

240
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,140
The Silver Crystal is
unchanging. Its power

241
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,180
remains the same
in any era.

242
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,100
Regardless, as you
are now, you lack the

243
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,060
ability to use
either one.

244
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,060
But I...

245
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,100
You disobeyed. You stole
a Space-Time key, and

246
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,060
used it to go to the past...
without permission.

247
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,150
Chibi-Usa!

248
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,210
[gasp]

249
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,070
But I'm just glad
you're safe, Princess.

250
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,190
What?! Chibi-Usa?

251
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,220
Is a Princess?!

252
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,110
Thank you for returning
the Princess safely to

253
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,140
her own time. I deeply
regret my earlier actions.

254
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,080
Please forgive me.

255
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,200
That's right I'm a princess,
just like she said.

256
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,080
I guess I shoulda
mentioned that earlier!

257
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,140
But...

258
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,000
Now that you know...

259
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,060
Guess you'll all have to bow
down and start calling me

260
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,060
"Your Highness."

261
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,100
Eh?

262
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,140
[growling]

263
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,080
Princess? You're a snobby
brat! What kind of parent

264
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,090
would let their kid
become a little monster?

265
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,210
Somebody needs to
teach you some respect!

266
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,190
What's your problem?!

267
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
I've always been royalty!

268
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,080
Just now you know it!

269
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,150
[chuckle] My life never
seems to be easy when

270
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,220
I'm dealing with
the two of you.

271
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,230
The Door of Space
and Time is now open.

272
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,150
This way, Usagi.

273
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,210
Okay.

274
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,000
Sailor Pluto, aren't
you coming with us?

275
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,090
My place is here. I am not
allowed to abandon my post.

276
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,210
Please protect Small Lady
for me, and be careful.

277
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,180
We will Sailor Pluto. And
thank you for everything.

278
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,150
Beyond this door, lies
the 30th Century...

279
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,100
The moon is so low in the
sky. It's practically right

280
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,150
on top of the city.

281
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,200
This is 30th century
Crystal Tokyo?

282
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,120
[whimper]

283
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,090
I never thought
it'd be this bad.

284
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,150
It's too quiet.
Where is everyone?

285
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,230
Oh god!

286
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,080
[whimpering]

287
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,200
[gasp]

288
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,120
[gasp] Chibi-Usa!

289
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,020
Can you hear me?
Are you in pain?

290
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,200
Turn back!

291
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,200
[gasp]

292
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,200
Don't go that way!

293
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,130
That voice again...

294
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,020
Are you alright?
Speak to me!

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,030
Look over there! What's
that black monolith?

296
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,160
I don't know...

297
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,230
That day, a sudden, massive
explosion rocked the city...

298
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,090
When the dust settled,
that's what was left behind.

299
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,150
I didn't see how
it got there.

300
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,090
All I know is, people were
lying on the ground

301
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,130
everywhere; And they
weren't moving!

302
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,120
Over time, the
bodies began to--

303
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,010
Chibi-Usa?

304
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,230
Let's go. We
shouldn't be here.

305
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,425
Okay...

306
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,150
Follow me...

307
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,010
I'll take you to
where Mommy is...

308
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,100
She's at the
Crystal Palace!

309
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,180
[yell]

310
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,435
What just happened?

311
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,180
Is this the palace?
Are we already inside?

312
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,130
[frightened gasp]

313
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,180
Hello, we're the Boule
Brothers of the Black Moon.

314
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,110
The Black Moon!?

315
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,030
Chiral.

316
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,120
And Achiral.

317
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,040
[chuckles] It's quite an
honor to meet the Rabbit and

318
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,130
the legendary guardian,
Sailor Moon.

319
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,050
Allow us to
welcome you, with

320
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,210
Achiral's isomeric
display.

321
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,020
[laughing]

322
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,190
What's happening?

323
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,150
[grunting]

324
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,000
I can't move!

325
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,150
[evil chuckling]

326
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,050
Achiral's Electrochemical
Side Chain, there is no

327
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,210
reaction that can sever
its molecular bond!

328
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,210
It's not over yet!

329
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,180
No creepy doppelgangers
are going to beat me!

330
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,110
Moon Princess Halation!

331
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,130
The Moon Rod! Why
isn't it working?!

332
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,180
[gasp of pain]

333
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,040
Don't bother struggling.

334
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,170
You're fixed in Chiral's
magnetic field, called the

335
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,110
Chirality Center.

336
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,010
All of you have
been immobilized

337
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,170
at an atomic level.

338
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,020
How does it feel
to be cornered?

339
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,220
There's no escape from
this beautiful monument.

340
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,040
And this is but a taste
of what the Malefic Black

341
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,020
Crystal is capable of.
I intend to use its full

342
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,210
power to bury you, along
with the real Crystal Palace.

343
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,140
That won't
happen! It can't!

344
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,160
The palace! Mommy's there so
it can never be destroyed!

345
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,000
Chibi-Usa...

346
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,040
Mommy is strong! As long as
she's inside the Palace

347
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,140
nothing can shatter it! It
will stand for all time!

348
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,050
Mommy! Mommy! [chuckle]

349
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh but that's terribly
insensitive of me. Tell you

350
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,120
what, Rabbit, show
Auntie Esmeraude the

351
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,140
Legendary Silver Crystal
and I'll take pity on you.

352
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,060
I'll bury you and your
mom in the same grave.

353
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:20,010
[screaming]

354
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,060
Now vanish! Into
radioactive vapor!

355
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,170
[screaming]

356
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,170
Use your will!

357
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,030
Command the false
crystal to break!

358
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,080
There it is again...

359
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,140
Do it!

360
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,150
Agh! Alright!

361
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,010
False crystal! I
command you! Break!

362
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,050
Impossible! They escaped
from our masterpiece!

363
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,140
Now's our chance!

364
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,160
Venus Love Me Chain!

365
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,170
Tuxedo La Smoking Bomber!

366
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,050
[screaming]

367
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,080
Whose voice was that?

368
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,070
His advice saved us all!
Why is he helping me?

369
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,090
Oh wow...

370
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,020
This must be the
real Crystal Palace.

371
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,180
Follow me.

372
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,050
The Crystal Palace...

373
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,070
[gasp]

374
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,200
Someone's in there.

375
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm home.

376
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,070
Chibi-Usa, who
is that woman?

377
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,220
This is Mommy.

378
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Neo Queen Serenity.

379
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,010
Neo Queen Serenity?

380
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,180
[meow]

381
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,100
A kitten?

382
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,000
Diana! I'm so happy you're
alive! Where are you going?

383
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,160
[meowing]

384
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,010
[gasp]

385
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,160
Tuxedo Mask!?

386
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,030
Welcome to Crystal Tokyo
in the 30th-century.

387
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,040
And to our home,
the Crystal Palace.

388
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,120
Who are you? And why do you
look like Tuxedo Mask?

389
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,080
I am King Endymion.

390
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,120
King Endymion!?

391
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,140
Daddy!

392
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,040
Daddy!?

393
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:54,170
Act. 20- Crystal
Tokyo, King Endymion.

394
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,170
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
