1
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,300
Look down there!

00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,734
[snickering]

3
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,067
[gasp] It's Hotaru!

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,434
It's some sort of spatial
anomoly!

5
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:50,334
[gasps]

6
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:52,067
Is that...

7
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:54,434
...really Hotaru?

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,167
No...

9
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,167
That's someone else!

10
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:00,700
[chuckling]

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,500
[gasps]

12
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,467
[screams]

13
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:12,800
[grunt]

14
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,134
[gasp]

15
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:31,567
Mercury! Mars! Jupiter! Venus!

16
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,134
Hang on!

17
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:35,800
[scream]

18
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:37,700
I can't...get to them!

19
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,700
[gasp] That thing...

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,567
That thing is no longer Hotaru!

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,234
[laughing

22
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,934
Act.36 Infinity 10 Infinite ‐
Upper Atmosphere

23
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,867
[laughing]

24
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,267
What is this? No!

25
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,567
The seas are beginning to rage.

26
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,434
The sky is angry...Is there a
storm coming?

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,267
The space‐time distortion is
spreading...

28
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,567
What's going on? What's
happening?!

29
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,567
The moment is here!

30
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:23,934
At long last, Master Pharaoh 90
has accumulated enough power to
vesselize.

31
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:29,400
The time has finally come...for
him to be one with this planet!

32
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:32,934
Become one...with Earth?!

33
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:43,667
Pharaoh 90 is our one true
master. Once his vesselization
is complete, this world will
become a second Tau Star System.

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,767
And then, the Earth...shall be
our mother planet reborn!

35
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:49,834
[shaky breaths]

36
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:54,934
[grunts]

37
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:56,934
[gasps]

38
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,667
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto!

39
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,500
[grunting]

40
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:08,000
We will use our powers to put a
stop to this invasion!

41
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,734
For Neo Queen Serenity, who one
day will reign...

42
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:18,334
And for this planet, the planet
Earth, where she was born...

43
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,834
We must protect the new Silver
Millennium and this world with
it!

44
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,467
That is our mission! And we will
not fail!

45
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:45,734
[grunting]

46
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:48,067
Hmph, trying to seal us, huh?!

47
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,600
But you're wasting your efforts.

48
00:05:54,867 --> 00:06:03,867
Master's vesselization will be
finished soon. [inhale] And, I
no longer have to contain myself
within this human body!

49
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,400
[gasp]

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,867
Oh no!

51
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,567
At this rate, she'll destroy
Hotaru's body.

52
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:26,867
[laughing, groaning]

53
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:32,067
What's happneing to me? I'm
stuck. I can't move or break
free.

54
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,134
I won't let you escape!

55
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,400
[gasp] Who's there?!

56
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,900
You don't control this body. It
still belongs to me.

57
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,400
And I have no intention of
letting you leave it.

58
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:45,567
While I'm here, you are never
getting out!

59
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:52,067
[grunting]

60
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,134
[laughing]

61
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:02,734
So you're the one that was in my
way. I thought I had devoured
your wretched existence.

62
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,800
But somehow you have still
managed to survive.

63
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:10,767
[gasp]

64
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:15,934
Swallowing the Legendary Silver
Crystal has made me much
stronger.

65
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:21,934
A puny little Host such as
yourself...couldn't possibly
keep control of me!

66
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:27,467
[gasping]

67
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,767
This is bad. If I do nothing,
she'll destroy Hotaru's body.
[gasp, grunt]

68
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:40,634
Neo Queen Serenity!

69
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:43,534
Lend me your strength!

70
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:46,200
Lend your power to my Heart
Moon Rod!

71
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,034
How dare you! [yell]

72
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:14,534
[scream]

73
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:17,800
[gasp] My Moon Spiral Heart
Attack's power...

74
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:19,834
[gasps] It didn't work!

75
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,534
I refuse to let anyone get in my
way.

76
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:29,700
I'll get free of this body! And
tear it to pieces!

77
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,667
I'm running out of time...My
body is being ripped apart. But
still...

78
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:49,267
I have to protect Chibi‐Usa's
soul, and her Silver Crystal. No
matter what happens, she's not
going to get them!

79
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,834
Do you hear me? I'm not going to
lose!

80
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,100
What's happening? ‐I can't draw
power from the Silver Crystal
anymore.

81
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,600
[groan] Impertinent
troublemaker!

82
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,000
You are not going to interfere!

83
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,167
I need more power!

84
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,267
So I'll have to take these four
Hosts!

85
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,267
[gasp]

86
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,067
Mercury!

87
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,000
Jupiter!

88
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:18,767
Mars!

89
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,267
Venus!

90
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,100
Oh no!

91
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,034
[gasping]

92
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:28,600
[chuckle]

93
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,067
Guys? Guys, wake up!

94
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,167
I don't believe it!...She
actually extracted the souls out
of all of my friends!

95
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,100
[slurping] Mmmmm!

96
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:41,600
You monster...

97
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,267
[gasps]

98
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:48,267
[gasp]

99
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Are those...

100
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,200
...the Hosts of the Sailor
Guardians?

101
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:54,334
I have to save them!

102
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:55,267
[gasp]

103
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:56,767
[grunt]

104
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,600
[growl]

105
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,934
That is it, you annoying little
maggot! Hand over those Hosts to
me right now!

106
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:08,600
[crying]

107
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,100
I can't...hold on to all their
souls. Her power is too much for
me!

108
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:18,734
I wanna protect everybody so
badly,...but I may not be able
to.

109
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,400
And yet...

110
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
It's strange...

111
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:30,900
My physical body has been taken
over. At this point, I'm nothing
<i>more than a soul,...</i>

112
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:35,100
...which means... I'm already
dead, right?

113
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:42,734
So why am I still fighting? And
why do I keep fighting so hard?

114
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,734
Daddy is gone now. So what's
left for me to fight for?

115
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:59,967
And how is it that I have power
to fight at all? Where did it
come from? I don't remember ever
being this strong before...

116
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,134
[gasp]

117
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,067
Chibi‐Usa...

118
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:14,334
I can feel inside me the
presence of another
self...Someone greater and more
powerful.

119
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:19,267
She's telling me to use every
ounce of strength I have left to
help everyone.

120
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:23,334
Yes...Even though I'm only a
soul now,

121
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:28,967
I can still rescue these
other five souls, and the
Legendary Silver Crystal
with them.

122
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,234
I'm going to get them out of
here!

123
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:50,667
Even as a soul, I can still save
everyone,...

124
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,167
...right now!

125
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,634
What?!

126
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,900
She left and took all the Hosts!

127
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:09,734
[scoffs] That's fine. Because
now I can finally be free.

128
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,500
[chuckling]

129
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,900
[gsps]

130
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,234
You're awake!

131
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,500
Your souls returned to your
bodies!

132
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:26,367
Huh?

133
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,734
[sigh]

134
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,234
Hotaru...

135
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:34,700
She's the one who rescued us.

136
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,900
She saved our souls.

137
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:36,900
All of them.

138
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,667
From the hands of Mistress 9.

139
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,234
[sigh]

140
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,634
Hotaru! Wait!

141
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:49,900
[gasp]

142
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,234
Huh?

143
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,967
Hotaru?

144
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,967
[gasp]

145
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:08,300
Chibi‐Usa!

146
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:11,634
[deep breathing]

147
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:14,467
Mamo?

148
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:16,700
Chibi‐Usa.

149
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,967
Thank goodness...

150
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,634
[gasps]

151
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:21,734
[sigh]

152
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,800
Hotaru!

153
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:28,367
I'm so glad I was able to save
you, Chibi‐Usa. I really am.

154
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:32,900
I've been thinking, Chibi‐Usa,
and it may sound kind of
strange...

155
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,300
But I feel like destiny brought
us together.

156
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:38,467
I do, too!

157
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,900
I feel exactly the same. It was
destiny.

158
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,867
[sigh]

159
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,434
[growling roar]

160
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:56,800
[scream]

161
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,967
Hotaru?!

162
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,834
It's okay, Chibi‐Usa.

163
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:09,834
I'm so happy I met you, and that
I got to be your friend.

164
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:14,034
It was...the best thing that
ever happened to me.

165
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:14,967
[gasp]

166
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:16,767
I love you...

167
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:23,500
[gasp] ...Hotaru...

168
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,100
Thank you, Chibi‐Usa for
everything...

169
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:29,934
Goodbye.

170
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,434
[gasping] Hotaru! Don't go! Come
back!

171
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,700
[gasps]

172
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,767
[crying] It's...not fair...

173
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:53,034
Why does her fate have to be so
sad? [crying]

174
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:56,034
[gasp, grunt]

175
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,100
Chibi‐Usa...

176
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Sailor Moon needs you. You have
to help her fight.

177
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,867
Are you up to it?

178
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:12,734
[gasp] I‐

179
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,900
[whining gasps]

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,834
Yes. I can fight.

181
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,734
Hm.

182
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:24,567
I hav to fight!

183
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,700
Hotaru gave up her life for me.
I owe her.

184
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,034
I'm a Sailor Guardian.

185
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,567
So, I can't cry forever!

186
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,900
Moon Prism Power Make Up!

187
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:10,500
Thanks Mamo. I know your power
kept me alive.

188
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:14,634
I may not be that strong yet,
like Sailor Moon,

189
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:18,234
but I'll still do my best and
fight by her side!

190
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:24,167
Huh...It's like I gave her away
at her wedding.

191
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:26,234
And yet,...

192
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:30,667
...it's strange. Somehow I'm
overflowing with power.

193
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,167
Like I got it from Chibi‐Usa
instead of giving her mine.

194
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,167
I may have gotten some from
Hotaru, as well.

195
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,567
Hang on. I'm coming Usa.

196
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,634
[growling]

197
00:16:58,734 --> 00:16:59,667
[gasps]

198
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,234
Is that thing getting bigger?

199
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,067
[growling]

200
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:11,067
It's not just bigger, its power
seems to be getting stronger,
too.

201
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:17,567
That power...The power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal...

202
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:18,567
[gasp]

203
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,734
Give it to me now!

204
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,067
[gasps]

205
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:28,000
Jupiter Coconut...Cyclone!

206
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:33,234
Mars...Snake Fire!

207
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,700
Mercury Aqua Mirage!

208
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:48,634
Venus...Wink Chain Sword!

209
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:58,867
[groaning roar]

210
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,067
[gasps]

211
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,767
Pink Sugar...Heart Attack!

212
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,300
[groaning]

213
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:15,234
[gasps]

214
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:19,034
[gasp] Impossible...

215
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,300
Sailor Chibi Moon!

216
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,800
I'm so glad you're okay!

217
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,634
Mm..It's all thanks to Hotaru.
She saved me.

218
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,934
She protected me...

219
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,100
[whimper]...by giving everything
she had,...

220
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:42,967
[shudder] including...her life.

221
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:46,900
[sniffle] So Hotaru...

222
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,934
She's...gone?

223
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:52,634
[gasp] Uh‐uh...

224
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,300
Hotaru isn't gone at all!

225
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,900
Huh?

226
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:58,634
She's alive in our hearts!

227
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,434
Here in our hearts...

228
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:03,000
[gasps]

229
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:07,000
So, she's still here. She'll
always be with us.

230
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,700
Forever...

231
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:11,000
[gasp]

232
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:12,434
[tremble]

233
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:19,000
[gasps]

234
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:24,367
[gasps]

235
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:31,100
I will never, ever forgive you!

236
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,267
[growling roar]

237
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,100
[gasps]

238
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,834
What can I do to help?!

239
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,367
[gasp] Mamo!

240
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:48,767
[gasps] It's Tuxedo Mask!

241
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,834
The barrier's failing! You have
to act fast! Otherwise, the
enemy is going to invade the
Earth!

242
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
[gasp]

243
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,034
[roaring]

244
00:19:58,134 --> 00:19:59,367
Destroy that thing, quick!

245
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:02,967
You must transform into Super
Sailor Moon!

246
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:06,000
He's right. I've got a job to
do.

247
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,434
I will not let Hotaru's
sacrifice go to waste!

248
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,200
She saved us,...and we'll save
Earth!

249
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:17,867
Ready, guys?

250
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:22,200
Hm!

251
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,267
Moon Chalice,...

252
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:30,100
...come into my grasp!

253
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:35,367
And gather! The sacred power of
the Holy Sailor Guardians!

254
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,367
[sigh]

255
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:54,700
Sailor Moon.

256
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:59,834
She is so strong. Someday, I
hope...

257
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,934
...that I can be strong, as
well,...

258
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:06,500
...just like her!

259
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:13,434
[gasp]

260
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,434
Is that another...Moon Chalice?!

261
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:20,434
But how...?

262
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:22,034
It's Small Lady...

263
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:26,767
Her deep desire to be strong,
has triggered a new awakening.

264
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,100
Sailor Chibi Moon, are you
ready?

265
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,067
Hm!

266
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:51,900
Moon Crisis Make Up!

267
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:25,400
Sailor Chibi Moon...

268
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,967
...has now powered up!

269
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:28,567
[gasps]

270
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:29,467
Small Lady!

271
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,234
She has now become...

272
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,167
...Super Sailor Chibi Moon!

273
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:36,967
[gasps]

274
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,967
[growling roar]

275
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:46,134
Let's go, Super Sailor Chibi
Moon!

276
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,000
Hm!

277
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Super Sailor Moon!

278
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Itis time to combine our powers!

279
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:34,134
With the memory of
Hotaru in our hearts, we will
fight on!

280
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,267
Next time, "Act.37 Infinity 11 ‐
Infinite ‐ Judgement".

281
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,400
The moonlight is a messenger of
love.
