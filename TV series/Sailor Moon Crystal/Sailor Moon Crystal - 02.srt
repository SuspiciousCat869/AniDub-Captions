1
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,100
Hey, throw it this way!

2
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,060
[giggling]

3
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,200
Hey, you know that
girl Mizuno? From
class 5?

4
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,130
I heard that she
has an IQ of 300.

5
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,020
What? Seriously?!

6
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,130
All she does is study.
Even during lunch period
and recess. Isn't that sad?

7
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,200
Now that you mention it,
I don't think she has
friends either.

8
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,170
She never talks to anyone.

9
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,110
Huh? That's her!

10
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,120
So Usagi, how did
you do on the test?

11
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,090
You don't want to
know. My scores
were a disaster!

12
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,200
[chuckling]
Aren't they always?

13
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,170
What's that
supposed to mean?

14
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,040
[laughing]

15
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,130
Jadeite!

16
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,100
Where is the Legendary
Silver Crystal?

17
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,230
Why haven't you
brought it to me?

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,170
Apologies, my Queen.
I won't fail you again.

19
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,160
Our Great Ruler hungers
for power. She requires
nourishment.

20
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,130
Go gather more energy from
the humans to sustain her.
And hurry! Do not keep me

21
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,050
waiting for the Crystal
much longer!

22
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,130
Please rest assured,
Queen Beryl.

23
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,230
I have a new plan,
and this one will
succeed I promise you.

24
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,150
Come forth!

25
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,150
Our Great Ruler requires
your service, my monster.

26
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,120
Bring me the Legendary
Silver Crystal! Do not
fail!

27
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,230
I'm back!

28
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,080
Welcome home, Usagi!

29
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,110
Hope dinner's ready
soon. I'm starving...

30
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,110
Uh, Luna? You don't have
to keep an eye on me every
second you know.

31
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,220
Of course I do!

32
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,200
You haven't been Sailor
Moon very long, Usagi.
There's lots to learn!

33
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,100
The next enemy could
show up at any time!

34
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
[crying]

35
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,180
You've got to be
kidding me?!

36
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,140
I don't wanna do anything
that scary ever again!

37
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,160
Who are these enemies
anyway, Luna? And
what do they want?

38
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,220
They're not human.

39
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,010
They're evil forces
that shouldn't exist
in this world.

40
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,010
You need to find the
other Guardians. You'll
need their help to find our

41
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,000
Princess and protect her!

42
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,200
More Guardians and
a princess, huh?

43
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,070
[gasp]

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,230
You mean like
Tuxedo Mask?

45
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,110
[gasp]

46
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,100
And like Sailor V?

47
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,230
They've got to be
good guys like us,
right?!

48
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,170
It's not them. The second
Sailor Guardian is
someone else.

49
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,070
Huh?

50
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,160
Sorry.

51
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,230
Uh...

52
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,130
Ami Mizuno in Class
5 is so smart.

53
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,120
I heard she's the top-
ranked student in the
entire country.

54
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,130
Wow! She must be
a real genius.

55
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,010
Hey, don't worry. No
one expects you to get
scores like that.

56
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,180
I know. But did you
really have to say
it?

57
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,000
It's because she goes
to the Crystal Seminar.

58
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,020
Agh! Umino!

59
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,020
Did you say Crystal
Seminar?

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,220
That cram school for
the super smart kids?

61
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,080
Uh huh! I heard they
recruited Mizuno pretty
aggressively.

62
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,210
And even let her come
extra hours to study
more.

63
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,130
She's already number one
in the country. How much
smarter can she get?

64
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,170
Crystal Seminar is the
cram school over by
the arcade, right?

65
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,130
My dad says it's
expensive and that
only rich kids go there.

66
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,010
Mizuno's mom is a
famous doctor, so
she's pretty well-off.

67
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,130
So she comes from money
and she's a genius. She
lives in a different world.

68
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,000
Plus she acts so cold
and distant.

69
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,190
Like she doesn't want
anyone near her.

70
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,010
I heard she doesn't
have any friends at
all.

71
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,090
Aww...

72
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,010
[whining]

73
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,230
These are horrible!

74
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,170
Mom's gonna kill me
for sure this time.

75
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,180
[shriek]

76
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,120
Hm?

77
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,220
Is that...

78
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,150
Luna?! What's she
doing with the genius
girl from Class 5?

79
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,140
[giggling]

80
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,170
She doesn't seem cold
and distant like everyone
said she was.

81
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,100
[giggling]

82
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,220
I'm gonna go
talk to her!

83
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,170
Ah!

84
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,220
[giggling]

85
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,130
You're so soft.

86
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,030
Hello!

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,150
Huh?

88
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,110
Hi there. Is
everything okay?

89
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,180
Um, yes. I'm alright.

90
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,000
That's my cat.
Her name is Luna.

91
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,000
I hope she didn't
scare you!

92
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,190
Oh! Mm-mm!

93
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,160
When she jumped down
it was like she fell
out of the sky!

94
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,160
At first, I thought
she was an angel!

95
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,160
You thought that
cat was an angel?

96
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,110
[gasp]

97
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,190
Oh! Just ignore me.
I'm not making sense.
I'm sorry...

98
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,030
[giggling]

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
[gasp]

100
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,030
Hm?

101
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,040
Oh! Nothing!

102
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,220
She's so shy!
That's sweet!

103
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,210
You're Mizuno from
Class 5, right?

104
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,140
I'm Usagi Tsukino
from Class 1.

105
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,150
And I think you've
already met Luna.

106
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,230
Oh.

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,020
If I become friends with
her she can teach me how

108
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,120
to study so I do
better on tests.

109
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,160
Then I can be a
genius, too!

110
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,230
[giggling]

111
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,180
Uh, Tsukino?

112
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:25,040
I know! Hey Mizuno,
would you like to come to
the arcade with me today?

113
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,160
[giggling]

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,020
Uh...

115
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,050
Jump! Again!
One more!

116
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,010
Come on, Sailor V!

117
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,220
Almost! You can do it!

118
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:39,050
Uh... Ugh!
I lost again.

119
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,060
Hey, Usagi! How's
it going? You okay?

120
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,000
Hi, Motoki. I'm fine.
How are things with
you?

121
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,060
Is this your friend?

122
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,200
My name is Ami Mizuno.
It's nice to meet you.

123
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,180
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Motoki Furuhata.

124
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,140
Mizuno! Want to
try it? It's
really fun!

125
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,150
Huh? The game?

126
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,170
Yeah! Why don't
you take a turn.

127
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,130
Mm... Sure?

128
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,060
Whoa!

129
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,070
Careful! That guy's
pretty strong!

130
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,170
No way! You
beat him!

131
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,050
You're awesome
Mizuno!

132
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,210
What's going
on over there?

133
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,160
All right!
Keep going!

134
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,010
Wow. She's
pretty good.

135
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,040
Yeah. Seriously...

136
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,030
Watch out!

137
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,210
Quick! Before
he can attack!

138
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,000
Aw man! Nice!

139
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,130
Whoa!

140
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,050
[laughing]

141
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,070
Mizuno you beat the
game! And you got the
highest score ever!

142
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,050
[giggling]

143
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,070
Look! Something
came out!

144
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,000
I think it's
a prize!

145
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,060
[gasp]

146
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,200
What a pretty pen!

147
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,030
No fair! I'm so
jealous! I want
one, too!

148
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,070
Please, Usagi...

149
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,010
All right! Another cool
pen came out! Can I keep
it Motoki, please?

150
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,050
[laughing]

151
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,170
[giggling]

152
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,070
Has anyone ever
told you how funny
you are?

153
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,200
Are you teasing
me or do you
really mean that?

154
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,030
And has anybody ever
told you how much

155
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,180
prettier you are
when you smile, Ami?

156
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,140
Huh?

157
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,210
Oh! I used your first
name just now, huh.

158
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,170
Since I called you
Ami you can call
me Usagi!

159
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,160
'Kay!

160
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,220
[giggling]

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Is that the time?!
I have to go!

162
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,000
Do you mean to
cram school?

163
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,220
You go to that Crystal
Seminar nearby, right?

164
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,180
Yes, I'll be going
there every day
from now on.

165
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,190
Every day?

166
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,090
Uh-huh. Studying is
the only thing I'm
good at.

167
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,150
And since I want to
be a doctor like my mom,
I have to study a lot.

168
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,080
Wow! A doctor?!
That's so cool!

169
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,030
Okay, then! See
you tomorrow!

170
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
We're very glad to have
you here at Crystal
Seminar. So we'd like

171
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,040
you to have this
exclusive Crystal
Seminar Study disk.

172
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,060
You should use it
every day if you want
to become a doctor.

173
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,200
Study hard. As one of
our highest achievers,
we expect you to be a

174
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,190
role model for the
other students.

175
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes ma'am.

176
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,000
[sinister laugh]

177
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,070
You guys wanna go
get some ice cream
later?

178
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,120
That sounds great!

179
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,220
Count me in!

180
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,000
Hey Kuri!

181
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,030
Wanna come too?

182
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
213, 2.236067...

183
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,010
What's up with Kuri?

184
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,230
I guess she's studying.
She goes to Crystal
Seminar now.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,060
Seems like everyone
goes there these days.

186
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,200
Is Crystal Seminar
really that good?

187
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,200
The lessons there are
all taught by a special
computer program.

188
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,000
I heard it's actually fun.

189
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,200
Everyone takes the
disk home with them.

190
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,210
Oh...

191
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,010
[sigh]

192
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,030
I know!

193
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,180
I'll write it down
with this pen so I
don't forget.

194
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,100
Oh! There she is!

195
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,200
Hi Ami!

196
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,180
Oh, Tsukino! You
startled me.

197
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,120
Hey! You're using
that pen you won.

198
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,080
Look! I've got
mine too!

199
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,070
Oh! Wanna come get
ice cream with us
later?

200
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,110
[gasp]

201
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,010
Yeah.

202
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,060
Study hard. We expect
you to be a role model.

203
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,120
Hm?

204
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,000
Sorry, I can't go
with you. I need
to go study now.

205
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,090
Huh?

206
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,020
That was strange...

207
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,110
Luna...

208
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,230
Hey, Ami was acting
weird just now. She
didn't seem like

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
herself and she left
in a big hurry.

210
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,200
Yeah, I noticed that
too. Maybe we should
go check up on her.

211
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,010
Yeah.

212
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,100
Huh?

213
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,190
Her disk.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,100
Join Crystal Seminar
now! There's no
enrollment fee!

215
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,010
Earn better grades and
reach your full potential!

216
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Learning is fun with our
state-of-the-art PC study
program!

217
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,190
What's going on here?

218
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,060
We're advertising our
new program. Would you
like to take a flyer?

219
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,070
Oh! Thank you!

220
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,040
So this is Ami's
cram school.

221
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,030
Nope! Too weird!

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,030
Hey! Usagi,
don't litter!

223
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,030
Mm...

224
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,140
Hey! Bun-head!

225
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,080
Huh?

226
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,090
I am not a garbage can!

227
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,050
Huh?!

228
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,120
It's you again!

229
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,090
Your cat was talking to
you just now, wasn't it?

230
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,020
Uh! No it wasn't! Cats
can't talk to people.
That's ridiculous!

231
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,080
Gotta go! Bye!

232
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,030
[meowing]

233
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,030
Why does my heart
pound whenever I
see him?

234
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,230
Here, sir! Why don't
you take one, too?

235
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,050
It's normal.

236
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,040
The way everyone's been
acting I was expecting
more.

237
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,140
These are just
regular questions.

238
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,040
Maybe this isn't the
most recent version.

239
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,000
Or if I hit random
keys I'll find
something hidden.

240
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,100
I highly doubt it
would be that easy,
Usagi.

241
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,040
[gasp]

242
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,210
The Legendary...
be found!

243
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:48,130
Sacrifice yourself. Your
purpose is to serve and give
energy to our Great Ruler

244
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,060
You will gather data on
the Legendary Silver
Crystal.

245
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,000
The crystal must be found!

246
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,435
What is that?

247
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,050
It's some kind of
brainwashing program.

248
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,030
[gasp]

249
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,010
That means Ami's
in trouble!

250
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,090
Luna, what do we do?

251
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,060
There's a way to get
past them. Use your
pen from the arcade.

252
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,508
Huh?

253
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,050
You mean this?

254
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,220
You can use it to
disguise yourself.

255
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,060
Say, "Moon Power
Change..."

256
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,060
Moon Power!

257
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,100
Change me into
a doctor!

258
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,230
Wow! It really worked!

259
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,130
Come on now,
let's go!

260
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,040
Excuse me!

261
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,020
Hm?

262
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,000
I received an urgent
call there's been
an emergency.

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,040
I need to get
in there stat!

264
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,120
Huh?

265
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,130
Why can't you solve
the problems faster?

266
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,060
That disk was designed
especially for you.

267
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,130
You'll have to concentrate
harder if you want to succeed.

268
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,070
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,220
[chuckling]

270
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,140
By exploiting her
intelligence, soon we'll
be able to conquer all of

271
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,130
Tokyo. No! All of Japan!

272
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,050
Then it will be easy to
get our hands on the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

273
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,090
What is this?

274
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,230
A pen?

275
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,140
Oh! I used your first
name just now, huh?

276
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,070
Since I called you Ami,
you can call me Usagi!

277
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,000
Distractions will not
be tolerated! You
need to focus!

278
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,010
Sit back down!

279
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,070
I'm here, Ami!

280
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,000
What the-?!

281
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,110
Who the hell are you?

282
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,130
Who me? Well you see,
I'm uh... I'm a doctor!

283
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,230
Huh?!

284
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,150
Listen, Ami! This
teacher tricked you!
She's a fake!

285
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,160
She's using you
for something evil!

286
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,190
I don't know what
you're talking about,
young lady.

287
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,030
I cracked the code on
your special disk. I know
there's a brainwashing

288
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,140
program hidden in
the background!

289
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,090
[growling]

290
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,150
You meddler!

291
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,070
[growling]

292
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,160
Ah!

293
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,080
Quick Usagi! Transform
into Sailor Moon!

294
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,060
Here? Right in
front of Ami?!

295
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,000
It's okay! Just hurry!

296
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:11,110
Moon Prism Power!
Make Up!

297
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,130
I am the Pretty
Guardian...

298
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,170
Who fights for
love and for justice!
I am Sailor Moon!

299
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,090
And now in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you!

300
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,110
Hey! You took advantage
of a smart girl's thirst
for knowledge!

301
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,180
That's unforgivable!

302
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,140
I'm not gonna let you
brainwash my friend or
anyone else anymore!

303
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,160
Am I your friend?

304
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,140
Don't get in my way!

305
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,090
[screaming]

306
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,180
Ahh! I can't do
this! I'm scared!

307
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,140
[hysterically crying]

308
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,180
[evil laughter]

309
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,140
Are those Ultrasonic
waves? They won't
work on me!

310
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
[gasp]

311
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,150
[grunting]

312
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,190
No!

313
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,150
Can't...
Move...

314
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,210
I'm going to slice
you up into little
pieces!

315
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,110
No! I'm too
young to die!

316
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,060
It's all over. No
one can save you!

317
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,070
No! Stay away!
Someone help me!

318
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,180
Don't hurt her!

319
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,060
[gasp]

320
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,160
I knew it! Quick, Ami!
You have to use your
pen and transform!

321
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,120
[gasp]

322
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,010
Luna?!

323
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,070
I'll explain later!

324
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,050
Only you can save Usagi!
Now say the words: "Mercury
Power Make Up!"

325
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,040
Hmh!

326
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,160
Mercury Power
Make Up!

327
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,090
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
intelligence!

328
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,110
I am Sailor Mercury!

329
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,200
Douse yourself in
water and repent!

330
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,090
Is this really me?

331
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,130
Just as I thought! You
are the second Guardian
we've been searching for!

332
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,200
You're Sailor Mercury,
our team strategist!

333
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,180
Whoa! She's a
Sailor Guardian?

334
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,220
What the hell?!

335
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,230
Now! Fight her
Sailor Mercury!

336
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,436
Right!

337
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:04,140
Mercury Aqua Mist!

338
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,230
What the-?!
I can't see!

339
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,190
Sailor Moon!
Hurry!

340
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,100
Agh! I can't
get free!

341
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,150
There you are!

342
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,180
[gasp]

343
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,210
She's gone!

344
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,180
It's him! He
saved me again!

345
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,110
Come on now,
Sailor Moon!
Hurry!

346
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,000
Don't let your
friends help
go to waste.

347
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,230
Uh! Right!

348
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,010
Where is she?!

349
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,080
[gasps]

350
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,170
Moon Tiara Boomerang!

351
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,070
[screaming]

352
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,140
You did it!

353
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,190
Sailor Mercury!
Luna!

354
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,210
[chuckling]

355
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,230
Where did Tuxedo
Mask go?

356
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,230
So now there are two
Sailor Guardians to
deal with...

357
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,110
I can't believe I
transformed with that
pen.

358
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,130
Didn't I just win
it by chance?

359
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,090
I have no idea...

360
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,000
I see. It was
all your doing.

361
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,030
[giggling]

362
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,000
Alright then! Guess
we're gonna be good
friends!

363
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,190
I'd like that
Usagi! Sounds
great!

364
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,000
[giggling]

365
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,200
Let's go home and
have a meeting.

366
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,160
There's so much I
want to ask you about.

367
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,150
A meeting?
Right now?

368
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,010
I have so much to learn,
I can't wait another
second! Hurry! Hurry!

369
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,120
Aw. But I'm tired!

370
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,180
Usagi, if you catch the
66 bus at 6:00pm,

371
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,150
you'll get to see a
really pretty girl!

372
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,180
Really?! Then let's
go ride the bus!

373
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,150
Hold on, isn't that the
so-called "Demon Bus"
everyone's talking about?

374
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,020
Demon Bus?
What's that?

375
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,010
They say anyone who
gets on that bus will
disappear forever!

376
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,210
Are you serious?!

377
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,020
Act Three, "Rei,
Sailor Mars."

378
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,030
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
