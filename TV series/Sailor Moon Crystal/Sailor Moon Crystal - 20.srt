1
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,000
[gasp]

2
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,030
Someone's in there.

3
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,110
I'm home.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,050
Chibi-Usa, who
is that woman?

5
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,110
This is Mommy.

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,050
Neo Queen Serenity.

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,050
[meow]

8
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,050
Diana! I'm so happy you're
alive! Where are you going?

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,170
[meowing]

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,080
[gasps]

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,170
Tuxedo Mask!?

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,040
Daddy!

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,030
Daddy?

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,130
Huh?!

15
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,457
[gasp]

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,120
She went right through him!

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,090
Daddy, why can't I hug you?

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,050
I am relieved you made it
home safe and sound.

19
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,110
Traveling back in time to
the past was very dangerous,

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,130
however, you were
right to go.

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,180
I'm proud of you.

22
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,160
Daddy...

23
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,050
Welcome! To the magnificent
Crystal Palace!

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,100
And Crystal Tokyo,
in the 30th century!

25
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,120
I had no idea you would be
thrust into battle the

26
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,210
moment you arrived.
This is not the kind

27
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,120
of future I wanted
any of you to see.

28
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,080
[gasp]

29
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,150
What's going on? He
doesn't have a reflection!

30
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,200
As you can see, I
am not presently

31
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,130
a man of flesh
and blood.

32
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,180
My physical body is in
another room, lying

33
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,120
unconscious.

34
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,070
What you see is an astral
projection. My spirit apart

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,200
from my earthly form.

36
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,150
Who are you?

37
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,130
Haven't you figured it out?

38
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,180
I am King Endymion.

39
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,200
[gasp]

40
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,090
King Endymion?

41
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
You seem a bit more
surprised than I thought

42
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,180
you'd be. Yes. I am your
future self, Tuxedo Mask.

43
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,210
[gasp]

44
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,000
Now, Small Lady...

45
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,110
Time for you to properly
introduce yourself.

46
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,100
Honored guests!

47
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,210
Welcome to our
esteemed kingdom!

48
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,220
I am Usagi Small
Lady Serenity,

49
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,100
daughter of Neo Queen
Serenity and King Endymion,

50
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,180
Crown Princess and heir of
Silver Millennium.

51
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,000
It is my pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

52
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,090
Oh-kay.

53
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,210
Well done, Small Lady.

54
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,110
A very cordial and
respectful greeting.

55
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,180
One day you will be every
bit as refined and elegant

56
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,060
as the queen.

57
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,090
Small Lady...

58
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,130
Huh?

59
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,170
The king was worried about
you. He watched over you the

60
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,100
whole time you
were in the past.

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,120
Really, Diana?

62
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,000
I saw the way she was
behaving. Please pardon her

63
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,120
rudeness. As an
only child, our

64
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,130
daughter has been
rather spoiled.

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,070
Did say our daughter...

66
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,150
Sailor Moon, Tuxedo Mask...

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,020
This is your future
daughter.

68
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,130
What?!

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,110
Chibi-Usa is my daughter?
Mamo and I... are her parents?

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
I can't! I don't
even! Hunh!?

71
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,010
How?

72
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,200
Um... Well, uhh...

73
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,190
That means!

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,080
The Neo Queen Serenity
in the future is...

75
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,020
Yes. She is the future
version of Sailor Moon.

76
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,000
[gasp]

77
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,180
Queen? Me?

78
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,220
So this is who I'll become
in the 30th century?

79
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,150
It looks like the Silver
Crystal has expanded around

80
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,180
her body. But that
only happens when

81
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,170
she's in grave danger.

82
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,210
King Endymion, what occurred
to make the Crystal do this?

83
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,230
I cannot tell you.
I do not know.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,230
The queen rarely leaves the
palace, but for some reason,

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,220
on that day, she did.

86
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,120
She looked flustered and ran
out, as if in a panic.

87
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,170
Without warning, there
was a massive explosion.

88
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,210
In an instant, everything
was blown away. The only

89
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,190
building that remained
standing was the Crystal

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,150
Palace. When it was over,
there was no sound

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
but the silence of death.

92
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,150
The next moment,
we were attacked.

93
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,180
The Silver Crystal
immediately engulfed the

94
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,030
queen's body. As you
suggest, it appeared to

95
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,130
be protecting her.

96
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,170
But I, and the Four
Guardian Deities,

97
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,010
were not so fortunate.

98
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,220
Mercury, Mars, Jupiter,
Venus and myself...

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,210
We took the full
force of the blast.

100
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,210
And we fell...

101
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,000
I know not how or why,
but Small Lady and Diana,

102
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,110
alone, were spared.

103
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,230
[sigh]

104
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,110
Since she was a baby, I have
often told my daughter

105
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,230
stories from my
youth, about the

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,230
queen's heroism and
exploits as Sailor Moon.

107
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,130
She has heard the legend of
the invincible, greatest

108
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,130
Sailor Guardian,
countless times.

109
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,190
Therefore, I am not
surprised her first instinct

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,110
was to go to the past and
seek out your help

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,210
once disaster hit.

112
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,150
Diana, on the other hand,
could not bear to be

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,200
separated from Luna
and Artemis. So she

114
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,200
remained behind.

115
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,110
So nice to meet you all. My
name is Diana. I'm the

116
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,100
daughter of Luna
and Artemis.

117
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,040
What?!

118
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,140
You- Your our daughter?!

119
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,040
Yes.

120
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,200
King Endymion, back up a
minute. If it's been over

121
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,020
nine centuries, why
haven't you aged?

122
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,110
You don't appear to be
much older than I am now.

123
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,160
In the royal family, the
average life-span, is a

124
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,010
thousand years.

125
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,000
Wha-?! A thousand years!?

126
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,110
Typically, members of the
Silver Millennium family

127
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,230
grow and mature
just like humans

128
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,150
until they reach adulthood.

129
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,210
At 22-years-old, Serenity
ascended to the throne, and

130
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,130
shortly thereafter gave
birth to Small Lady.

131
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,190
She has not aged
a day since.

132
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,000
It is the power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal

133
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,120
that gave her an extended
life and eternal

134
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,140
youth. And when I married
into the Silver Millennium

135
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,030
family, I too, was
granted that power.

136
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,050
And we were far from the
only ones the Silver Crystal

137
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,030
blessed with its gifts.
Once Neo Queen Serenity

138
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,140
began her reign, the
citizens of Crystal

139
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,040
Tokyo became
long-lived as well.

140
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,040
Now, practically everyone
on Earth lives well into

141
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,190
their tenth century without
growing frail or decrepit.

142
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,130
Having been granted its
greatest wishes, humanity

143
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,010
began an era of peace
and prosperity we

144
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,210
thought would last forever.

145
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,060
We were wrong.

146
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,060
That enormous black monolith
appeared just after the

147
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,040
mysterious explosion.

148
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,230
It sucked in any and all
energy until space itself

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,140
began to bend and warp.

150
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,230
And then it got worse...

151
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,170
The comatose masses, who
had initially survived the

152
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,180
blast, started to
disappear because of

153
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,140
the spatial distortion...
until there was no one left.

154
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,060
I fear this planet is
facing total destruction.

155
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,200
Is there no hope?

156
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,170
The only thing that can
save the Earth now is the

157
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,170
Legendary Silver Crystal.

158
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,200
Unfortunately, the
only one who can

159
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,010
use it is Neo
Queen Serenity.

160
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,230
And there is no waking her.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,220
It seems we have
no options left.

162
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,220
No...

163
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,000
King Endymion,

164
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,210
I'm sure the Black Moon is
behind the catastrophe.

165
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,190
Do you know who
they really are?

166
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,030
This way.

167
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,030
Huh?

168
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,050
What's that?

169
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,230
The Planet Nemesis.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,160
Planet Nemesis?

171
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,180
It is a hidden world within
our very own Solar

172
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,160
System. A phantom planet
that went undetected

173
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,020
for quite some time.

174
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,200
Centuries ago, an Earth
criminal, guilty of the most

175
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,030
egregious offenses,
was banished there

176
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,020
in lieu of execution.

177
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,140
Nemesis was quarantined and
left alone, unchecked for

178
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,000
many decades; eventually
becoming a forbidden planet.

179
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,010
However, a massive
outpouring of negative

180
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,220
energy from Nemesis
recently caught

181
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,210
scientists' attention.

182
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,140
They wanted to renew
study of the lost world.

183
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,200
They never got the chance.

184
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,210
The Black Moon
hijacked the planet.

185
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,230
[gasp]

186
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,090
The Black Moon: Bloodthirsty
anarchists, who rejected

187
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,060
long life and
refused to live

188
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,030
peaceably in society.

189
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,230
Treason, terrorism,
and mass murder

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,090
were the least of
their crimes.

191
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,080
Once they seized the planet
of darkness, the group left

192
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,020
Earth and established a new
base of operations there.

193
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,090
Then they began a
full-scale assault.

194
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,020
I fear their plan is to
overthrow us, steal the

195
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,070
Legendary Silver Crystal,
and try to lay claim

196
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,050
to this world as well.

197
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,230
[gasp]

198
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,220
The black monolith...

199
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,220
The one that destroyed
Crystal Tokyo?

200
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,060
Correct.

201
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,170
I think that
might be one giant

202
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,000
chunk of Malefic
Black Crystal!

203
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,170
You know this type of stone?

204
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,190
Yes!

205
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,070
Members of the Black Moon
use that substance as an

206
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,190
energy source to
power their attacks.

207
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,180
Even small fragments
can be very dangerous.

208
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,080
So that's it.

209
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,070
The Black Moon mean to
do more than conquer

210
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,030
Earth and change
the future.

211
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,160
They intend to go back
in time and use this

212
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,200
Crystal to rewrite the past.

213
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,200
Huh?!

214
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,170
Are you sure?

215
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,080
[groans]

216
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,040
Usagi?

217
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,060
Are you okay?

218
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,090
I'm alright. I just felt a
little dizzy all of the

219
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,210
sudden, that's all.

220
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,190
[sharp gasp]

221
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Usagi's turning invisible!

222
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Her legs are disappearing!

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,070
Huh? My hands, too!
What's going on?

224
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,190
Usagi?

225
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,080
[gasp] I've got it too!

226
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,000
Quick! You must both return
to the past immediately!

227
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,200
Before you disappear
altogether!

228
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,090
Or worse, cause a rupture in
the space-time continuum!

229
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,090
Being in such close
proximity to your future

230
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,110
selves creates a paradox
that risks tearing the

231
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,020
fabric of time!

232
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,020
That's terrible!

233
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,010
Please forgive me.

234
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,090
I should not have let
you stay this long.

235
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,110
Don't apologize!

236
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,010
You gave us valuable
information we'd been needing!

237
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,010
We're in your debt!

238
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,200
Now hopefully, we might
be able to save Mars,

239
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,090
Mercury, and Jupiter.

240
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,090
As prisoners of the Black
Moon, they are likely

241
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,020
being held on Nemesis.

242
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,210
You really think so?

243
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,210
Allow me to assist in their
rescue. It's the least I can

244
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,180
do in return for your help.

245
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,010
But now, you must go.

246
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,010
Thank you! We'll be
back very soon!

247
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,020
Hmph!

248
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,010
Small Lady...

249
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,040
[gasp]

250
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,090
I cannot protect you in my
current form, so you must

251
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,210
return to the past.

252
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,210
Daddy?

253
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,190
Promise me that you will
stay out of trouble.

254
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,020
And please...

255
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,060
Be a good girl and try
to help where you can.

256
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,210
Yes, Daddy.

257
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,060
King Endymion,
I swear to you that

258
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,210
I will protect Small
Lady with my life.

259
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,230
[gasp]

260
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,190
Talking to my younger self
like this, I confess it does

261
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,030
feel a little strange.

262
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,090
Yeah.

263
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,110
Please take care
of my daughter.

264
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,210
[affirmative grunt]

265
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,120
Now hurry to the Door
of Space and Time.

266
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,060
There's a shortcut
through the palace.

267
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,230
King Endymion, about Sailor
Pluto... If she's a Sailor

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,140
Guardian like we
are, then why

269
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,110
were we not allowed to
know she even existed?

270
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,130
While Sailor Pluto also
holds the title of Sailor

271
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,120
Guardian, she is not
like you. Hers is a

272
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,210
separate, unique mission,
very different from yours.

273
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,070
Huh?

274
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,070
The blood flowing through
her veins is that of

275
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,120
Chronos, God of Time.

276
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,000
She is the beautiful,
solitary Guardian of the

277
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,030
door that is the
threshold between times.

278
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,130
Time alone is the last
sacred domain.

279
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,040
For millennia, Sailor
Pluto has been

280
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,030
the only keeper of
the Door of Space

281
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,050
and Time, protecting
that forbidden realm.

282
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,130
[gasp] King Endymion?

283
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,110
Pluto, I realize it is high
treason to even be here, but

284
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,130
we need a Space-Time
key, it's urgent!

285
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,000
Mm... Of course.

286
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,030
With this key, no matter
where or when you are,

287
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,000
you will always be
able to find your way

288
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,150
back to Sailor Pluto.

289
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,000
Pray to this key and it will
create a time warp.

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,020
Okay!

291
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,000
Sailor Moon, Sailor Venus...

292
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,110
Sailor Pluto... She is older
than all of us. She has

293
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,000
watched eras pass.

294
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,000
Her wisdom is unparalleled.

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,230
In my absence, you may
rely on her judgement.

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Trust her. She
will help you.

297
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,130
Yes, I will.

298
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,130
Sure. We'll take all
the help we can get.

299
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,020
Safe travels.

300
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,060
Bye, Diana.

301
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,010
See ya real soon.

302
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,230
Ouch!

303
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,130
[groaning]

304
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,090
Awesome! It looks
like we're right back

305
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,050
in the park
where we started!

306
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,120
That's a lucky break!

307
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,030
Get off, Venus!

308
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,160
[shrieking]

309
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,120
I'm so sorry!
Are you okay?

310
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,110
Don't worry about it.

311
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Here, lean on me, Usagi.
You sure you aren't hurt?

312
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,010
How do you feel?

313
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,060
I'm fine, but she
was kinda heavy.

314
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,110
Usako, I'll take
Chibi-Usa home with me.

315
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,140
Huh?

316
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,080
Why you? Give me one good
reason she can't come home

317
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,130
with me like always.

318
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,100
I'm responsible
for her, that's why.

319
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Besides you need
to get some rest.

320
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,140
Why do you have to look
after her on your own?

321
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,100
Don't you think she
should have both of

322
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,220
her parents with her!

323
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,220
Usako...

324
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,020
No, I understand. Mars,
Mercury, Jupiter, the

325
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
future... none of
that matters to you.

326
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,010
And I don't matter
to you either!

327
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,140
All you care about
is Chibi-Usa!

328
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,140
That's not true!

329
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't believe you!

330
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,020
Usagi?

331
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,120
Usagi! Wait!

332
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,140
How could I act so selfish
at a time like this?

333
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,010
I don't understand why
I'm feeling so jealous.

334
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,010
Chibi-Usa is our
child! Of course Mamo

335
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,140
would care about her and
want to protect her!

336
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,170
But still...

337
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,090
Why Mamo? Why couldn't
you say, "We're

338
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,140
responsible for her."
She's my daughter too...

339
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
[sigh]

340
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,150
Daddy...

341
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,220
[groan] It's bright.

342
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,100
When did it get
to be morning?

343
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,190
[gasp] Chibi-Usa?

344
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,497
Huh?

345
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,060
Small Lady!

346
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,100
What's wrong?

347
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,090
Where are Sailor Moon
and Sailor Venus?

348
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,140
It's dangerous for you to
come back by yourself.

349
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,210
I know I should have waited
for them. But I'm used to

350
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,090
being all by myself.

351
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,060
That's not true...

352
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,160
You know it is, Pluto!

353
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,170
But as long as I have
you, I don't care.

354
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,170
As long as we're friends,
I'm okay without anyone else.

355
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,050
[gasp]

356
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,090
Well, you certainly are
honest, Small Lady.

357
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,130
No I'm not...

358
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,170
I'm not honest at all.

359
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,150
[sigh]

360
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,140
Daddy...

361
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,100
Diana, you're worried about
your mom and dad, too.

362
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,230
Mommy... Please...

363
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,000
Please open your eyes.

364
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,150
I don't know what to do.

365
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,130
I need your help.

366
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,190
How come you won't open
your eyes, Mommy?

367
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:28,110
[crying]

368
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,120
Esmeraude...

369
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,150
Oh!

370
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,070
Doing a little unauthorized
reconnaissance are we?

371
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
I could say the
same thing of you!

372
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,080
You failed you know?

373
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,140
Agh! So did you!

374
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,000
What do you want?

375
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,020
[chuckling]

376
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,130
Please, Prince Dimande!

377
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,160
I beg of you, let me
have another chance!

378
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,200
This time, I'll show you
what I can really do!

379
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,150
There wasn't an opportunity
before to use the gift that

380
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
Wiseman gave me.
My trump card.

381
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,170
Code Extra: Operation
"Re-lax."

382
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,200
With the help of
this special power,

383
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,190
Sailor Moon, the "Rabbit",

384
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,160
And the Legendary Silver
Crystal, will all be

385
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,160
hand-delivered to you
on a silver platter!

386
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,080
What is it Luna P?

387
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,130
[evil chuckling]

388
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,080
[gasp]

389
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,130
Poor, defenseless
little Rabbit.

390
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,140
What happened to
your Sailor escorts?

391
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,180
A princess should know
better than to leave the

392
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,140
safety of the
castle by herself.

393
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,020
What a naughty little girl.

394
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,130
[gasp]

395
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,170
[gasp]

396
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,030
Small Lady!

397
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,170
Now then, Rabbit...

398
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,120
How about a demonstration of
that power you inherited

399
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,110
from Neo Queen Serenity?

400
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,160
Come on now,
Rabbit, fight back!

401
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,170
If you won't, then I guess
I'll just have to kill you.

402
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,150
I wish I did have
that kind of power...

403
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,150
We're coming Chibi-Usa!

404
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,170
Hang on!

405
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,100
Venus Love-Me Chain!

406
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,230
[gasp]

407
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,040
[gasps]

408
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,130
I've got you!

409
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,140
Nice catch!

410
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,130
[growl]

411
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,230
A Malefic Black Crystal!

412
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
She used it like a grenade!

413
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:33,100
Moon Princess Halation!

414
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
Not again! Why can't
I use Halation?!

415
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,030
Can't attack? Aww.
That's too bad.

416
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,210
[groaning]

417
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,050
Oh no!

418
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,120
[evil laugh] I'll destroy
you all without even

419
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,140
breaking a sweat!

420
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,230
Are you watching this
with your Evil Sight?

421
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,220
Can you see me,
Prince Dimande?

422
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,150
Who's your favorite now?

423
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,060
I feel so weak...

424
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,150
She's sucking out
all our energy!

425
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,160
Dammit!

426
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,190
Tuxedo Mask!
Don't give up!

427
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,150
You can defeat her!
I'll help you!

428
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Now!

429
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,140
Tuxedo La Smoking...

430
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,190
Bomber!

431
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,150
This can't be!
Prince Dimande!

432
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,210
I don't get it, why isn't
the moon rod working?

433
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,230
Why am I the only one here
who can't use their power?

434
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,180
I know that the Silver
Crystal from the past,

435
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,220
doesn't have any power
except in the past.

436
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,030
So I can't use my
Legendary Silver Crystal at

437
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,190
all in the 30th
century? But I need my

438
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,140
powers! How am I going to
defeat the Black Moon

439
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,060
without them? And what
about my friends?

440
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,010
How am I supposed
to save them?

441
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,190
I'm surprised they
got the best of

442
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,140
Esmeraude with one shot.

443
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,020
They did indeed. However, it
would seem the Legendary

444
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,120
Silver Crystal is not as
powerful as I once thought.

445
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,100
[gasp]

446
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,050
What do you think
Sailor Moon, Sailor

447
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,210
Venus, Tuxedo Mask?

448
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,140
Do you like this apocalyptic
version of the 30th century?

449
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,200
If it isn't horrible enough,
there's still time to make

450
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,120
it worse.
[sinister laughing]

451
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,070
I know who you are!

452
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,140
You must be the leader
of the Black Moon!

453
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,170
Why did you destroy
this planet?

454
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,010
What have you done with
the Guardians you took?

455
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,210
What do you want? Why
are you doing all this?

456
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,060
There they are, those
fierce, determined eyes, the

457
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,000
ones that stared back at
me that fateful day...

458
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,030
[gasp]

459
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,020
What's happening?

460
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,170
I can't move!

461
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,230
And I can't look away.

462
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,190
[gasp] Stop! Don't
look into his eye!

463
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,130
[screaming]

464
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,030
[gasp] Usagi!

465
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,080
Usako, where has
he taken you?

466
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,200
Mamo, I'm scared...

467
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,070
I'm alone and I
can't transform.

468
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,030
What if I never
see you again?

469
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,070
It's all my fault.

470
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,160
If only I hadn't taken the
Legendary Silver Crystal

471
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,040
that day...

472
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,060
What do I do? There's
nowhere left to go.

473
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,040
Act. 21: Complication-
Nemesis.

474
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,030
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
