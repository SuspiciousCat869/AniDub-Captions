1
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,030
You thought you were
wandering aimlessly, but you

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,070
were searching for me
without realizing it.

3
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,100
Someone who wants you.
Someone who needs you.

4
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,110
Come... Come with me...

5
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,060
Her key...

6
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,030
[gasp]

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,080
What could cause a storm
here?

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,020
Something has disrupted the
natural flow of Space-Time.

9
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,210
And Small Lady is
at the heart of it!

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,090
I sense great
danger!

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,220
[grunt]

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,110
King... Endymion!

13
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,020
What an incredible library!
I can't believe they have

14
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,140
digital records of all
recorded history here!

15
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,030
[gasp]

16
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,230
King!

17
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,120
I need to see Pluto
immediately!

18
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,060
Something's wrong. I think
it's Chibi-Usa.

19
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,230
Hang on! Wait for me!

20
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,040
No, you stay here! We'll be
right back!

21
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,070
[grunt]

22
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,130
What gives?! Why does
everyone keep leaving me

23
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,110
behind?! It's driving me
crazy!

24
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,090
Venus, look!

25
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
I think we found the right
case file.

26
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,130
You'll definitely want to
see this.

27
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,120
"Death Phantom."

28
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,130
"Considered one of history's
worst criminals, he

29
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,110
possessed the superhuman
abilities of "Evil Sight"

30
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,080
and "Beast Hands."

31
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,220
It also says he
single-handedly destroyed

32
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,140
the previous Crystal Tokyo
and turned it into a city

33
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,070
overrun with crime.

34
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,110
But despite his powers,
Death Phantom was human.

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,130
Thus the queen could
not bring herself

36
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,100
to execute him.

37
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,130
Instead, she exiled him to
Nemesis.

38
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,080
That dark world seems to
be involved with quite a

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,100
few unfortunate events.
Both past and present.

40
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm certain none of this
would be happening, if not

41
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,060
for Nemesis. No one
should've gone near that

42
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,010
planet. Death Phantom has
cursed it.

43
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,090
[panting]

44
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,080
Are you alright, Pluto? This
storm... What's going on?

45
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,210
Small Lady... She went deep
into Space-Time without a

46
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,030
key and vanished.

47
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,050
Chibi-Usa's gone?

48
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,220
She may be caught in this
storm. It started in the

49
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,200
same area where I felt her
disappear.

50
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,040
Something terrible must
have happened to cause

51
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,030
such a disturbance.

52
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,050
Mm.

53
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,000
Something powerful enough to
tear the very fabric of

54
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,040
Space-Time.

55
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,000
Chibi-Usa's out in this
storm all alone.

56
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going after her!

57
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,140
Tuxedo Mask, wait!

58
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,130
Come back! Don't go that way
without a key! You'll never

59
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,090
be able to return!

60
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,020
I wonder how long I've been
here for.

61
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,140
This Black Moon Castle is
like a labyrinth. No

62
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,230
matter how far I walk, it
seems like I'm just going

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,120
around and around in
circles.

64
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,010
But I know they're here. I
felt them. I'm sure of it!

65
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,180
My friends...! Where are
you?

66
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,100
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter...

67
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,120
It's hard to breathe.

68
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,100
It's like all the energy
is being drained out of me.

69
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,110
[gasp]

70
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,040
I hear our Guardian
prisoners are still present

71
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,140
and accounted for.

72
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,060
Yes, but they were just
bait for Sailor Moon and

73
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,050
now my brother has
what he wanted.

74
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,200
We should get
rid of them.

75
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,060
They are just wasting away
in the Dark Chamber.

76
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,230
Why prolong the
inevitable?

77
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,200
I knew they were alive!
Where is this "Dark Chamber"?

78
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,110
Because none of us
want to go anywhere

79
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,060
near the Dark Chamber,
that's why.

80
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,110
Yes. It's hostile
territory.

81
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,070
Some strange
stuff down there.

82
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,110
Hidden dangers seem to be
lurking around every turn here.

83
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,050
Lately it feels like this
whole place has a mind of

84
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,040
its own and we're all
at its mercy.

85
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,130
Maybe the lot of us are
cannon fodder and the

86
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,210
planet's the one in command.

87
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,100
[fainting]

88
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,060
Uh--

89
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,180
Uh--

90
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,040
Stay back! Don't touch me!

91
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,190
[grunt]

92
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,100
What have you done with my
friends? Tell me where the

93
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,190
Dark Chamber is!

94
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,060
None of that matters. Your
friends are all dead.

95
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,190
I don't believe you!

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
They're alive and I will
find them!

97
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,080
Hold it together, Usagi.
You can't die here.

98
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,050
Not now! Not yet!

99
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,130
Not without seeing
Mamo again!

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,210
Fabricating Droids this
advanced is quite complex

101
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,130
and requires considerable
amounts of energy.

102
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,000
But it's worth it.

103
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,060
How may we
serve you?

104
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,180
Droids will always stick to
their plan. You give them

105
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,040
their instructions and they
follow them, without question.

106
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,110
[panting]

107
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,190
What is that?

108
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,210
Please, come in, future
Neo Queen Serenity.

109
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,000
It is an honor to
greet the beautiful

110
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,210
ruler of Crystal
Tokyo.

111
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,220
I am Prince Dimande's
brother, Saphir.

112
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,230
This chamber is the core of
Nemesis: the Malefic Black

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,425
Crystal reactor.

114
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:45,210
A reactor?

115
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,120
This planet is sealed off.
The reactor is the only

116
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,060
opening to the outside. You
and your friends came

117
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,230
through it to get here.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,140
Take a moment to admire the
Malefic Black Crystal's power.

119
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,080
Beautiful, yet dangerous. It

120
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,090
could melt down or explode
at any second, but without

121
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,090
it we would never be able to
execute our grand plan.

122
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,020
The plan to rewrite Earth's
history!

123
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,010
My brother doesn't know how
unstable it is. Nor does he

124
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,070
understand the full extent
of the danger.

125
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,030
We forcibly accelerated the
core's fusion reactions

126
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,120
without fully comprehending
how they worked. If the

127
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,230
whole system collapses and
the planet goes out of

128
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,060
control, I won't be
surprised.

129
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,030
In a way, Nemesis is much
like my brother.

130
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,030
He too is dangerous and
unstable.

131
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,050
He often acts on impulse and
allows his emotions to

132
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,070
distract him.

133
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,030
For example, attacking the
Earth with the Malefic

134
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,110
Black Crystal was a rash
decision and not part

135
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,110
of our original
plan.

136
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,130
Your Majesty, I beg your
forgiveness.

137
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,190
[gasp]

138
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,230
We were disillusioned and
naive. When Wiseman

139
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,190
appeared, with his omens and
prophecies, he told us

140
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,130
exactly what we wanted to
hear.

141
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,100
None of us should have ever
set foot on this cursed

142
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,230
planet. But we followed him,
blindly.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,030
The Malefic Black Crystal is
a type of invincible stone

144
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,030
that takes in light and
energy, and converts them to

145
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,090
negative energy. It can
even warp time and space.

146
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,010
So with this stone, all that
I have ever wanted will

147
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,120
finally be within reach.

148
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,030
Yes. You can have
everything. The entire

149
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,180
universe is yours for the
taking.

150
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,180
Only one thing stands in
your way...

151
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,070
The Legendary Silver
Crystal... which belongs to

152
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,220
the Earth's queen...

153
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,080
Her crystal is the only
stone whose power rivals

154
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
the Malefic Black
Crystal.

155
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,060
It is a threat to us! As
long as it exists, we cannot

156
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,010
obtain unbeatable power.

157
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,050
Destroy it! Eradicate it
from the universe!

158
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,090
The "Legendary Silver
Crystal"...

159
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,090
I've always wondered.

160
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,050
But I have yet to see
its power for myself.

161
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,220
Perhaps if we were to attack
our former home with the

162
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,210
Malefic Black Crystal, the
queen would show us.

163
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,010
[gasp]

164
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,130
My poor brother...

165
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,000
The Malefic Black Crystal
has ahold of him. He's

166
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,100
possessed. And he doesn't
even realize it. [grunt]

167
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,160
[gasp]

168
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,010
I doubt that anything can
stop him now. He's gone mad.

169
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,030
It's too dangerous.

170
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,220
But for the sake of the
future, for the Earth, for

171
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,060
all of us, for
everything...!

172
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,060
Someone has to try. Would
you be willing to help me?

173
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,030
You want my help? What do
you mean? What could I do?

174
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,100
[scream]

175
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,050
You could stop living.
Perhaps then my brother

176
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,110
would realize Sailor Moon
isn't so special.

177
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,140
[gasp]

178
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,090
My brother and I, we had it
all worked out. We were

179
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,000
going to stop the Moon
Kingdom from ruling the Earth.

180
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,060
The Black Moon was
supposed to go to the

181
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,070
past and rewrite
history.

182
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,210
That was the plan.

183
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,070
But then you came along
and ruined everything!

184
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,150
He lost his mind and it's
all your fault!

185
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,180
That's not true.

186
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,100
Vile Witch! You and that
Legendary Silver Crystal of

187
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,230
yours wrecked human history!

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,090
But I can fix it. Right
here. Right now.

189
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,230
With your death!

190
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,120
Is he right? Is it
all my fault?

191
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,050
Did I somehow
cause this?

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Am I the one... who
destroyed the future?

193
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,140
What is this light? Why
can't I strike her?

194
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,210
[grunt]

195
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,010
Usako!

196
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,130
What incredible light! It's
strong enough to penetrate

197
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,100
even the furthest reaches of
space-time!

198
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,050
You are correct, Wiseman.

199
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,000
What you are seeing is the
light of the Legendary

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,050
Silver Crystal. It's true
power; which has been

201
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,220
concealed within that woman
all this time.

202
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,210
If you're going to drop by
Nemesis for a closer look,

203
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,100
I'll go with you.

204
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,110
[gasp]

205
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,000
Are you who I think you are?

206
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,030
Mm.

207
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,120
[grunt]

208
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,100
[scream]

209
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,030
The light! Its power!

210
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,020
Don't accuse me of trying to
wreck history! You and the

211
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,100
Black Moon are the ones
doing that!

212
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,010
Well no more. You will not
manipulate time any longer!

213
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,010
[scream]

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,100
I don't believe it!

215
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,110
I'm overflowing with power
like never before!

216
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,120
If I try it now, I'm sure I
can transform!

217
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,090
Moon Crystal Power...
Make up!

218
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,110
Mm!

219
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,160
[grunt]

220
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,170
She transformed.

221
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,070
The power of the Malefic
Black Crystal is supposed to

222
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,110
nullify all other
energies!

223
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,160
[gasp] I feel them!

224
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,140
Where are my friends? Show
them to me.

225
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,050
There they are!

226
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,507
Mars,

227
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,190
Mercury,

228
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,040
Jupiter!

229
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,080
I found you! Now time to
wake up!

230
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,030
[gasp]

231
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,160
Sailor Moon...

232
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,140
I can feel her power.
She's close by!

233
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,070
But we're stuck here.
How do we reach her?

234
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,040
If you can hear us, Sailor
Moon, tell us what to do.

235
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,090
Transform! You can
do it now!

236
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,100
Come on! I'll give you a
hand!

237
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,200
Mars Star Power!

238
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,040
Mercury Star Power!

239
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,050
Jupiter Star Power!

240
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,070
Make up!

241
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,210
Mm!

242
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,060
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter!

243
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,090
Sailor Moon!

244
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,060
Impossible.

245
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,180
Yes. And yet somehow there
they all are.

246
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,100
It's the power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

247
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,200
That power is indeed
exceptional, just as he

248
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,130
said. Wiseman!

249
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,020
Right here, my prince.

250
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:45,120
[chuckling]

251
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,190
What is that black
shadow behind him?

252
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,210
[chuckle] Now you have all
witnessed the remarkable

253
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,060
power of the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

254
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,130
A stone that can
unleash such powers across

255
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,100
the reaches of time
and space, and overcome

256
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,220
the negative energy of the
Malefic Black Crystal as

257
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,150
though it were nothing.
Truly a sight to behold!

258
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,180
What fearsome power it
possesses. I see why men

259
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,050
would wage war over it,

260
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,170
why it wrecks havoc
and causes disasters.

261
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,120
Open your eyes, Dimande!

262
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,080
[gasp]

263
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,070
You're wrong!

264
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,200
The Legendary Silver
Crystal protects peace!

265
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,120
Its true purpose is to bring
harmony and love!

266
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,050
If not for the misguided
and evil actions of

267
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,060
men like you, war itself
might never have existed!

268
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,040
All could have lived in
peace! But for you, peace

269
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,120
wasn't enough!

270
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,200
Are you so blinded by hate?
Can't you see?

271
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,170
The Malefic Black
Crystal is dangerous

272
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,050
and you are
misusing it!

273
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,120
Sailor Moon?

274
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,050
No, Ami. I don't
think that's her.

275
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,120
That's Neo Queen Serenity!

276
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,040
Neo Queen Serenity... I see
far better than you think.

277
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,090
"Peace" and "harmony" are
illusions. Fear and

278
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
malice are the Silver
Crystal's true Legacy! As

279
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,050
long as mankind
desires it,

280
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,200
that stone is the
root of all evil!

281
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,160
Exactly, my Prince. You see
the Legendary Silver Crystal

282
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,190
for what it really is.

283
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,090
Now take it! And crush them
all!

284
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,100
Uh!

285
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,070
Do it, my Prince.

286
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,170
[chuckle]

287
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,030
With my friends by my side,
nothing can defeat me!

288
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,210
And you're not getting the
Legendary Silver

289
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,100
Crystal! Not now!
Not ever!

290
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,050
[grunt]

291
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,060
Burning... Mandala!

292
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,060
Shine Snow Illusion!

293
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,180
Sparkling... Wide Pressure!

294
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,070
Wait Brother!

295
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,040
Prince Dimande! Time to show
them your Evil Sight!

296
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,030
I'm stuck! I can't move a
muscle!

297
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,180
Hurry, my Prince! Kill them
all! And take the Legendary

298
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,170
Silver Crystal from Sailor
Moon's dead body!

299
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,160
[gasp]

300
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,180
The reactor!

301
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,220
[grunt]

302
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,060
The power of the Legendary
Silver Crystal this close to

303
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,090
the reactor is causing it to
melt down!

304
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,170
I'm not about to stick
around and die here!

305
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,140
Going somewhere?

306
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,110
I see through your
camouflage.

307
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
You can't fool me!

308
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,130
I know you've got another
mission on the side,

309
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,160
so fess up!

310
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,150
Who are you, Wiseman?! And
what do you really want?!

311
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,060
[giggle] Such a coward.

312
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,050
Who?

313
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,110
You. Who else?

314
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,080
[struggling]

315
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,130
Bye bye...

316
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,180
Who are you? [scream]

317
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,190
Pathetic dreg!

318
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,040
[grunt]

319
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,080
[grunt]

320
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,180
Now's our chance! We need to
get out of here, quick!

321
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,110
[gasp]

322
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,140
Sailor Moon.

323
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,100
But how?

324
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,120
We're trapped,
there's no way out.

325
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,040
Pluto! Please lend us your
power.

326
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,200
If we all use our power
together, that should be

327
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,200
enough to get us back to
Earth!

328
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,080
The power of Neo Queen
Serenity...

329
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,070
Pluto!

330
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,140
Please help us get back
home to Earth!

331
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,050
You're not getting away from
me!

332
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,200
Brother! Hurry, we have to
go!

333
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,050
To think you could just slip
through my fingers like

334
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,100
that... Sailor Moon, your
power is truly awesome!

335
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,130
However...

336
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,170
You'll be back soon enough,
along with the Legendary

337
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,130
Silver Crystal. Of that, I'm
quite certain.

338
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,080
[chuckle]

339
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,130
Chibi-Usa! Where are you?

340
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,080
Usako... I need you.
Lend me your strength.

341
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,150
Help me find Chibi-Usa!

342
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,120
[giggle]

343
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,130
Mm!

344
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,080
[giggle] Over here.
This way!

345
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,120
[gasp]

346
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,130
Come on... You're getting
warmer. I'm right over here.

347
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,050
Usako? Chibi-Usa?

348
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,190
[giggle]

349
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,180
[giggle]

350
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,220
[chuckle]

351
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:48,120
[gasp]

352
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,100
You're back!

353
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:54,220
Jupiter, Mercury, Mars,
Sailor Moon!

354
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,180
I never lost hope! I knew
we'd be together again!

355
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,080
Thanks for staying strong!

356
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,170
Hope you weren't too
worried!

357
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,040
It's good to see you!

358
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,090
How did you escape?

359
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,130
Neo Queen Serenity. She
shared some of her amazing

360
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,100
power with us! That's how we
were able to transform and

361
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,130
get back here!

362
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,140
Yes. But it wasn't just her.

363
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,200
Mm.

364
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,080
[gasp]

365
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,180
Your own power helped too,
Sailor Moon.

366
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,090
You called on your inner
strength. You summoned the

367
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,180
Silver Crystal's power
through space-time.

368
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,110
Well done. You should be
proud of yourself.

369
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,090
Mm.

370
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,090
[gasp]

371
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,090
Tuxedo Mask and Chibi-Usa!
Where are they?

372
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,160
We do not know.

373
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,050
Small Lady wandered deep
into space-time and went

374
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,170
missing. We believe
that is what's

375
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,130
causing this
unusual storm.

376
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,130
Tuxedo Mask rushed into the
tempest after her and neither

377
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,080
of them has a key to return.

378
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,190
[gasp] What?!

379
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,000
My name is Black Lady, Queen
of Darkness.

380
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,220
Wiseman, the Ruler of
Darkness, chose me! And I

381
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,000
have been reborn as the
queen of Nemesis!

382
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,010
I'm not a little girl
anymore. I'm all grown up.

383
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,140
[laughs]

384
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,000
Act 23: Covert Maneuvers
Wiseman

385
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,010
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
