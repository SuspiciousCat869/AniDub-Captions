1
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,180
No!

2
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,010
Sailor Mars!

3
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,230
What are you doing here?
Answer me, Chibi-Usa!

4
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,140
So that's Chibi-Usa?

5
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,230
Have you been spying on
us this whole time?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,050
You know something about
this, don't you?!

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,150
Was this your plan? Are you
with those kidnappers?!
[gasp]

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,110
Usagi, don't!

9
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,050
Luna? Why are you
defending her?!

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,210
You need to calm down.

11
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,000
She's getting away!

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,000
Listen to me!

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,020
The Silver Crystal?

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,230
Go easy on her. She's just a
child. If you're too harsh
she won't tell us anything.

15
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,070
But she's...

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,030
Welcome home, sweetheart.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,180
Oh? Isn't Chibi-Usa
with you?

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,050
I don't know where she
is! And I don't care!

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:24,000
How could I yell at a child
like that? I'm such an awful
person...

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,100
[doorbell ringing]

21
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,100
Usako?

22
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,230
Sorry to bother you
but I need your help.

23
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,090
She must have wandered
around for hours before
she ended up at that park.

24
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,000
I think she was
afraid to go home.

25
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,050
Maybe it's best that she
stays here tonight. Usako
seemed really upset.

26
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,210
Usagi didn't mean it. Deep
down, she understands.

27
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,030
And Chibi-Usa...
she's just scared.

28
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,230
I think she may have been
through some kind of trauma.

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,070
She doesn't trust us because
she doesn't know us.

30
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,000
But once she does, I'm
sure she'll open up.

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,210
She's not a threat.
She's just a little girl.

32
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,080
Mommy? Mommy,
where are you?

33
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,140
If something should ever
happen to me, it will all be
up to you...

34
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,090
The legendary Guardian,
Sailor Moon, is invincible.
Nothing can defeat her.

35
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,060
Daddy! Mommy!

36
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,230
[crying]

37
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,210
Please do not cry, milady.

38
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,080
Huh?

39
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,130
My magical rose has
begun to wilt.

40
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,050
Only the smile of a fair
maiden can revive it. Here.

41
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,140
Will you help it
bloom again?

42
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,130
Thank you. I am Tuxedo
Mask, at your service.

43
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,100
And my name is Luna.

44
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,050
Did you have a bad
dream, little one?

45
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,020
Pretty good, right? I
should be a professional
ventriloquist.

46
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,000
[gasp] Wait a sec!

47
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,120
I have a toy that I can make
talk, too! This is my Luna P
ball.

48
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,000
But I just call it Luna P.

49
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,110
"Luna P"?

50
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,100
Small Lady.

51
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,060
Small Lady!

52
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,130
Huh? Who is "Small Lady"?

53
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,110
That's my name.

54
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,090
Mommy gave it to me.

55
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,080
So, we've got Small
Lady and Luna P.

56
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Huh?

57
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,160
Oh, is that your house key?

58
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,100
This key is very important.
I need it to get home.

59
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,060
Is home far away?

60
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,090
[sigh]

61
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,170
Lay down. Time for Small
Lady to get some sleep.

62
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,230
Hey, do you know if Sailor
Moon is really strong?

63
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,030
Invincible.

64
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,040
I wonder if she could
save my mommy.

65
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,130
Aww.

66
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,120
Poor thing. Chibi-Usa's just
a lost little girl who
misses her mom and dad.

67
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,030
Did she say who they were
or where she was from?

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,170
She didn't say anything
else. That's all Mamoru was
able to get out of her.

69
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,160
Ah. But if he's making
progress, we should probably

70
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,110
just leave her to him for now.
We've got bigger worries.

71
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,070
Like the Black Moon...

72
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,030
What's that? Are you playing
chess against the computer?

73
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,180
Um... yeah.

74
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,160
Really? Is chess as
difficult as they say it is?
It certainly looks confusing.

75
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,030
[chuckle] It's actually not.

76
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,190
Chess is a game of
cause and effect. You make
a move and your opponent

77
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,040
makes a counter move.
Once you figure out

78
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,040
their strategy, you can
anticipate what they are
going to do next.

79
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,120
And our enemy? What are
they going to do next?

80
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm not sure. I don't know
who they are, or what
they're after.

81
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,070
But there's one thing
about this new enemy of
which I am certain...

82
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,170
They aren't coming.
They're already here.

83
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,020
[gasp]

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,160
[stunned gasp]

85
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,140
Chibi-Usa... You stayed
with Mamo last night?
And Luna, too?

86
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,050
Oh there you are!

87
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,200
Thank goodness you're home!
I was so worried about you,
my little Chibi-Usa!

88
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,100
Are you hungry at all?

89
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,010
How about I fix
you some nice--

90
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,100
[awkward groan]

91
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,020
Were you able to calm
down last night?

92
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,050
Chibi-Usa has something
around her neck that looks

93
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,080
just like the "Legendary
Silver Crystal."

94
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,060
I know. I saw it, too. And
there's a strange key on the
chain with it.

95
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,100
She told me the reason she
came here was to ask Sailor
Moon for help.

96
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,140
She thinks you are the only
one who can save her mom.

97
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,140
Let's just give it a bit
more time, 'kay?

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,060
[sigh]

99
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,190
Cheer up, Usako. Please.

100
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,130
No matter how many times I
stare at the Malefic Black
Crystal reactor, the

101
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,130
immensity of its power
never ceases to amaze me.

102
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,190
Prince Demande!

103
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,230
You needn't worry, brother.

104
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,130
As per your instructions, I
have been using the energy
of the "Malefic Black

105
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,050
Crystal" to produce Droid
soldiers and send them en
masse to Earth.

106
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,110
Those simple automatons are
little more than puppets,

107
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,220
until your alchemy
breathes life into them.
Excellent work.

108
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,210
Brother, I understand
you've captured Sailor Mars.

109
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,030
Yes.

110
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
But that was a rather
aggressive move, don't
you think?

111
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,160
What is it you're planning?

112
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,050
Are you questioning my
orders, Saphir?

113
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,160
My plans are my own.

114
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,190
I'm sure he wasn't
questioning anything.

115
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,060
Saphir's a good little
soldier. Always faithful.

116
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,060
As am I, my Prince. I will
obey your every command.

117
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,060
Rubeus, where is
Sailor Mars now?

118
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,170
She's locked away in
the Dark Chamber, right
where I left her.

119
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,210
Her will is quite strong. I
wasn't able to break her.
She wouldn't give up any

120
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,190
information about "The
Legendary Silver Crystal."

121
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,180
Wiseman...

122
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,120
Do as you will, my Prince.

123
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,180
But it may be worthwhile to
keep her. She can still be
put to good use.

124
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,110
Then I shall keep Sailor
Mars alive for the time
being.

125
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,050
Prince Demande!

126
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,050
May I have a turn?

127
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,150
As third eldest of the
Spectre Sisters, I,
Berthier, wish to serve you.

128
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,180
And how do you
propose to do that?

129
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,220
I'd like to take on the
Sailor Guardians with power
of water. I feel the

130
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,090
presence of the "Rabbit"
close to her.

131
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,080
The "Legendary Silver Crystal"
may be nearby too.

132
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,110
Go.

133
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,000
Code 002. Operation
"Re-move."

134
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,000
There is an active piece in
play that needs to be
cleared from the board.

135
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,160
Aww man. No water again?!

136
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,010
These sinks are always
breaking. It's such a pain!

137
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,140
There's the ones in
the locker room?

138
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,140
But those are so far away.

139
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,140
I wonder what the problem
is. Could there be something
wrong with the pipes?

140
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:42,110
Listen to the water. Hear
its ripples. Feel its flow.

141
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,190
[gasp]

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,100
This main's busted. We're
lucky the school didn't
flood!

143
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,150
Thanks, Miss Mizuno! I don't
know how you knew it was

144
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,020
broken, but I'll get
this fixed right away!

145
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,150
[nervous laugh]

146
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,220
Not bad.

147
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,230
[gasp]

148
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,120
But water divining
without a rod or pendulum
is practically heresy.

149
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,150
Don't you know that?

150
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,200
[gasp]

151
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:31,000
Who was that? Another enemy?
The latest threat from the
Black Moon?

152
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,000
No. I shouldn't assume the
worst. I'm just a bit on
edge.

153
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,160
But our friend is missing.
We need to be vigilant.

154
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,190
Rei... I hope you are alright.

155
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,140
Hi, Ami!

156
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:53,870
Hi, Naru?!

157
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,145
Usagi was feeling a little
down, so I thought we'd
swim!

158
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,055
[grumbling in water]

159
00:12:58,065 --> 00:13:00,185
I didn't know you belonged
to this health club!

160
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:07,235
Um... Well, my father's the one
who's the member. I just
come here once in a while.

161
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:10,584
What does your father
do for a living, Ami?

162
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,614
He's a Japanese-style
artist.

163
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,424
You mean, like a painter?

164
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:15,534
How cool!

165
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:18,504
I don't see him much. He
and my mom are divorced.

166
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:21,554
But back when I was little,
my father taught me a lot.

167
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:26,614
Swimming and playing chess,
they still calm me down and
help me stay focused.

168
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:28,444
Aww. That's nice.

169
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:29,534
Is this your first
visit to Japan?

170
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:34,504
Yes. I'm so excited to
participate in the World
Chess Championship.

171
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:38,444
Now, Miss Berthier, in
addition to being the third
best professional chess

172
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:40,554
player in the world, I
understand you're

173
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:42,574
also one of this planet's
foremost expert dowsers.

174
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:44,534
Tell us a bit about that.

175
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:46,414
Dowsing is an
ancient science that

176
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:47,564
many people nowadays
have never heard of.

177
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:52,414
Or if they have, they
know only of using a
divining rod to find water.

178
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:55,534
But I've perfected my
pendulum technique so that
I can find anything.

179
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,424
And does dowsing in any way
enhance your chess game?

180
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:03,514
Yes. I use my pendulum in
every match. Its swings show
me where to move my pieces.

181
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:04,524
Fascinating!

182
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:06,534
Before we went on air
you mentioned there

183
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,524
was a specific player
you wanted to face?

184
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:09,624
Yes.

185
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:12,614
Junior Chess Champion,
Ami Mizuno.

186
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:15,454
[gasps]

187
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:19,584
Ami, if you're watching, I'd
like to challenge you to an
individual match.

188
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:37,464
Thank you for accepting my
challenge. I've been wanting
to meet you.

189
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:39,504
You have? Why me?

190
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:42,634
Call it a professional
interest.

191
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:45,514
Are you as proficient at
dowsing as they said on TV?

192
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:48,504
Could you even find
a missing person?

193
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,524
Why don't you try
it yourself?

194
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:55,604
It uses the same skills
finding water does...
Sailor Mercury.

195
00:14:57,414 --> 00:15:03,412
Let's make a bet. The victor
can have whatever she wants.
May the best woman win.

196
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:14,422
Sailor Mars...

197
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:23,362
If you win the game, I'll
give her back to you.

198
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,472
And if you should win...

199
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:27,482
...what is it that
you want from me?

200
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,402
The "Rabbit."

201
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,472
That brat's around
here somewhere. I can
sense her nearby.

202
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:44,402
By "Rabbit" do you
mean... who I think?

203
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:48,472
[evil chuckling]

204
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:55,582
So The Black Moon is
after Chibi-Usa. But why?
Who is she to them?

205
00:15:57,502 --> 00:16:01,572
My dowsing pendulum is made
from the "Malefic Black
Crystal"...

206
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:06,402
It can tell me anything...
even the thoughts in your
head.

207
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:11,572
Yes... You're
afraid Mercury.

208
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:16,422
You're afraid to lose Mars.
It reminds you of when you
lost someone long ago.

209
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:19,472
I need to focus. I
can't let her get to me.

210
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:24,572
You're alone. And Deep down
you know that's never going
to change.

211
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:27,452
It's inevitable. No matter
how much you love the people

212
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:30,422
you care about, someday
they're going to leave you.

213
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:31,402
[gasp]

214
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,512
Poor little Sailor Mercury.
Fate was not kind to you in

215
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:53,432
the past and I'm afraid
the future does not look good.

216
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:57,422
Your worst fears are going
to be realized... over
and over again.

217
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:15,462
You're going to lose this
game, Sailor Mercury. You're
going to lose everything!

218
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:19,472
Your precious friends, your
family, even your life as a
Sailor Guardian!

219
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:21,502
[gasp]

220
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:27,792
[snicker]

221
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:38,328
[chuckle]

222
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:42,498
Ami!

223
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:48,378
You can do it, Ami!

224
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:50,268
Shh!

225
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,338
Miss! You need to be quiet!

226
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,318
We're so sorry! She
won't do it again!

227
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,268
If she continues to
interrupt the match,

228
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:57,418
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave!

229
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:59,388
I promise! She'll be
quiet from now on!

230
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,398
What's the matter with you?

231
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:06,288
Thank you!

232
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:21,288
What happened? I had her
right where I wanted her!

233
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:23,298
You're right,
Miss Berthier.

234
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,278
I am alone in this world...

235
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:31,278
And there will come a day,
when I have to say goodbye
to the people I love.

236
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:38,308
But, I'm not going
to feel sad.

237
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:41,278
Because there have been
many happy moments in my

238
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,358
life and no one can take
those away from me!

239
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:46,388
So even if I lose
those I love!

240
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:50,278
As long as I hold those
precious memories close
to my heart...

241
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:51,438
I'm never alone!

242
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:54,398
[gasp]

243
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,298
Huh?

244
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,318
Checkmate.

245
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:31,378
[cheering]

246
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:32,388
Did she win?

247
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:35,288
Yay! Way to go Ami!

248
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:37,318
How could I lose?
It's not possible!

249
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:40,398
There! Now give
back Sailor Mars!

250
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:44,288
You won the match,
but not the game!

251
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:45,408
[gasp]

252
00:19:46,358 --> 00:19:48,428
Hey! Let us through!

253
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,438
We need to get to Ami!

254
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:53,368
No! Stay back!

255
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:55,348
[gasp]

256
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:59,368
As you can plainly see,
this isn't over yet.

257
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:02,368
And I left surprises for
your little friends, too.

258
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:07,448
If you resign and knock over
your king, I promise not to
hurt you.

259
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:11,458
I won't let you have
Chibi-Usa. She and Sailor
Mars are not pawns!

260
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,478
I'm done playing games!

261
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:19,358
Mercury Star
Power! Make up!

262
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:56,408
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for intelligence.

263
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:59,308
I am Sailor Mercury!

264
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:03,348
Douse yourself in
water and repent!

265
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:05,408
[screaming]

266
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,388
They aren't living
creatures.

267
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:13,408
They're some sort of robot,
made to look human.

268
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:17,408
Shine Snow Illusion!

269
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:24,448

[rev up yell]

271
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:38,368
I am Berthier of the
Four Spectre Sisters!

272
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:41,348
Your little parlor trick
won't work on me!

273
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,358
[scared gasp]

274
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:45,358
I can't breathe...

275
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:50,388
Now, tell me where
the "Rabbit" is!

276
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:53,458
I'm not telling you
anything! I'd never turn
Chibi-Usa over to the enemy!

277
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:55,408
Venus Love-Me Chain!

278
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:56,398
[gasp]

279
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:58,448
Now Sailor Moon!
Finish her!

280
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:00,438
Moon!

281
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,368
Princess!

282
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:07,448
Halation!

00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:09,468
[gasp]

00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:13,318
[death scream]

285
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:18,826
[frustrated gasp]

286
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:23,766
It's no use.

287
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,796
Berthier's water sphere
is a torrent that will
never run dry.

288
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:28,756
[gasp]

289
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:29,736
[chuckle]

290
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,676
Mercury!

291
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,726
Hey, do you know if Sailor
Moon is really strong?

292
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,696
Invincible.

293
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:49,656
Mercury!

294
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:30,766
The Black Moon... who are
they? What do they want?

295
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:32,636
We still don't know.

296
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:34,766
Their moves are totally
unpredictable. And they
were hidden among

297
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:36,776
us long before we ever
knew they were there.

298
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:40,656
They aren't the usual
suspects. Maybe they want
Chibi-Usa and don't care

299
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,686
about the Silver
Crystal at all.

300
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:43,826
Chibi-Usa?

301
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:47,776
It's possible. She may very
well hold the key to all of
these mysteries.

302
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,756
Act.17 Secret:
Sailor Jupiter.

303
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:54,676
The moonlight is the
messenger of love.
