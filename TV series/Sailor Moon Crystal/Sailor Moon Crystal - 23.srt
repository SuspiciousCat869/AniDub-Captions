1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,160
[gasp]

2
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,120
Come on... You're getting
warmer. I'm right over here.

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,090
Usako? Chibi-Usa?

4
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,190
[snicker]

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,060
[laughing]

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,070
I'm going after them!

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,150
Space-Time storm or not, I
have to find them!

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,140
You can't go! It's too
dangerous.

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,200
We don't even know where in
space-time they are.

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,170
I don't care how dangerous
it is! If Mamo's out there,

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,210
then I'm going!

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,140
I broke out of Nemesis just
so I could see him again!

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,000
In the great oblivion
between space-times, the

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,210
laws of physics don't apply.
It is a gaping abyss,

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,070
littered with pitfalls and
hazards that appear without

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,150
warning.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,110
Even under normal
conditions,

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,220
none should
venture there.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,230
Too bad. I'm going.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,160
And if she goes, that means
we all go, too!

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,140
Have faith in Sailor
Moon, Pluto.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,000
We know she
can do this.

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,036
And as Sailor Guardians,
it's our duty to protect her.

24
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,096
Right. Plus, there's no
talking her out of it.

25
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,100
Very well then.

26
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,200
Hm.

27
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,130
These coordinates are
unstable. I can't get a fix.

28
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,110
There's a
chill in the air.

29
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,090
Are we even headed in the
right direction?

30
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,180
I am not certain.
Out here in the

31
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,050
In-Between, you need a
Space-Time key to have any

32
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,200
reference point for knowing
where and when you are.

33
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,210
Those without one, become
drifters, destined to wander

34
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,210
forever in this interval of
time.

35
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,040
Or else until they
disappear into the void.

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,150
A powerful shockwave
preceded this storm. My

37
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,100
guess is, that was Small
Lady colliding or clashing

38
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,180
with something, and she has
ended up somewhere.

39
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,220
Well, wherever
Chibi-usa is,

40
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,140
Tuxedo Mask must be there
too, since he followed her.

41
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,080
Maybe. But there's no
guarantee he found her and

42
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,220
they're together.

43
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,000
Mm.

44
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,100
Mars is right. We don't know
that he's with her.

45
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,120
He is.

46
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,090
He made a promise to protect
her. And Mamo keeps his

47
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,060
promises. He'll follow her
to the edge of the universe

48
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,110
if that's what it takes.

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,180
Usagi...

50
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,070
I know what he's thinking.

51
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,070
He's the man I love. I know
him better than anyone.

52
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,110
When he said he would give
his life for her, he meant it!

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,110
Mamo has a strong sense of
responsibility, and

54
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,140
Chibi-Usa is our
daughter.

55
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,090
He'd do anything for her. I
know they're together

56
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,080
because he'd find her, no
matter what!

57
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,120
That's just the kind of man
he is.

58
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,150
Mamo... I'm sorry...

59
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,140
You have no idea
how much I

60
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,160
wish I could be with
you right now.

61
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,150
Fate is so cruel. I wanted
to see you so badly, and

62
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,060
just when I thought I could,
we were ripped apart again.

63
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,060
Mm.

64
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,190
I'm sensing
something.

65
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,160
Is anyone there?

66
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,040
Luna P?!

67
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,230
Uh--

68
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,210
So Chibi-Usa did
come this way.

69
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,080
Small Lady would never go
anywhere without Luna P.

70
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,100
It is too dangerous
to go any further.

71
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,140
We need to go back.

72
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,030
Chibi-Usa... Mamo ...

73
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,140
Sailor Moon!

74
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,080
[grunt]

75
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,170
Where am I?

76
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,070
Saphir!

77
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,170
[grunt]

78
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,120
Brother...? What happened?
Where are we?

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,110
I don't see Rubeus.

80
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,110
Wait a minute... Are
we in the Dark Chamber?

81
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,160
Yes. Things are a bit
nasty with the reactor

82
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,220
right now, so I decided
to bring you down here.

83
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm afraid your little
science project has gone

84
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,000
berserk.

85
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,130
It's melting down?

86
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,080
Better! The power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal and

87
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,100
the explosion that followed,
triggered hyper-accelerated

88
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,200
fusion reactions. The
entire planet is ablaze!

89
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,100
The energy
is unbelievable!

90
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,080
And it's all thanks to you,
Saphir. Because of the

91
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,160
reactor you constructed,
Nemesis is finally reaching

92
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,210
its full potential.

93
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,130
This may not have been what
you intended, but you should

94
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,120
be proud. With this
planetary evolution

95
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,050
the power of
Nemesis is unsurpassed.

96
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,050
The mark of the Black Moon.

97
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,090
Who are you? What's your
name?

98
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,170
[chuckle]

99
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,110
We'll get to that later.
Wiseman is calling.

100
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,200
Now, come with me.

101
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,100
What is this? Are we passing
through the core of Nemesis?

102
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,190
[giggle] The core is
bursting with chemical

103
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,190
reactions right now.
It wouldn't be this cold,

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,170
dark, or quiet if that's
where we were.

105
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,150
Okay then. Where are we?

106
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,130
This is a pocket of warped
space created by the Malefic

107
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,090
Black Crystal's negative
energy. A hidden corner at

108
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,230
the edge of Space-Time,
which Wiseman controls.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,180
Black Moon Castle is gone.
Ahead is your new base of

110
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,060
operations: Wiseman's Castle
of Darkness.

111
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,100
Wiseman has a castle of his
own? Does that mean he lives

112
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,170
here? Is this distorted
space where he disappears to?

113
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,070
And her... She looks so
much like the Queen.

114
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,220
Who are you,
mysterious lady?

115
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,020
[chuckle]

116
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,040
Welcome to my humble abode.

117
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,170
I never realized you
had your own dimension.

118
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,220
Grand, isn't it? And what do
you think of my dear Rabbit?

119
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,150
Have you said hello?

120
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,120
Now I see...

121
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,150
So you've grown up and
switched sides, is that it?

122
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,190
Don't be rude! Wiseman
needed me and so, here I am.

123
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,140
Wiseman's will is
absolute.

124
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,110
It is truth. He
leads, we follow.

125
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,190
Surely this was
explained to you.

126
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,160
Have you
forgotten it?

127
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,180
Wiseman.

128
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,190
Something's changed. He's
different from before.

129
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,080
Where is Rubeus? Any
idea what happened to him?

130
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,190
If you mean your red-headed
friend, Wiseman killed him.

131
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,180
What!?

132
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,220
It was his own fault. He
questioned Wiseman's

133
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,140
authority and then
tried to desert.

134
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,040
I say he had
it coming.

135
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,180
Rubeus...

136
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,190
Wiseman... Now you've gone
too far!

137
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,040
Just who the hell are you?!

138
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,080
And what is it
that you really want?

139
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,200
[groaning]

140
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,070
Help me Brother!

141
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,060
Saphir!

142
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,070
[grunting]

143
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,120
I am your Lord and Master!
My will is absolute! You

144
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,210
shall serve me in any way I
see fit! I give the orders

145
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,170
and you obey!

146
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,130
Yes, Wiseman.

147
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,130
Your will is absolute.
We're yours to command.

148
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,220
Not only are these Malefic
Black Crystal earrings

149
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,050
stronger than any you've had
before; they are symbols of

150
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,150
power and signify
your loyalty to

151
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,170
Nemesis. Wear them with
pride.

152
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,210
At last, I have you, my dear
Rabbit. And this

153
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,030
Legendary Silver Crystal you
were kind enough to bring

154
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,060
me. But something is
missing... This is just an

155
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,150
ordinary piece of glass.

156
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,070
Where is its light? Where is
its power!?

157
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,060
Only Neo Queen Serenity can
use that it. That is her

158
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,060
Silver Crystal from
the 30th century.

159
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,140
But there're two, and
the other one

160
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,160
belongs to
Sailor Moon.

161
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,140
I see. Then the surge of
power I witnessed, in the

162
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,220
reactor chamber,
came from the Legendary

163
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,060
Silver Crystal of the past.
And to use either stone, I

164
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,180
must have Neo Queen
Serenity and Sailor

165
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,110
Moon within
my grasp.

166
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,060
All right, then. Bring me the
Legendary Silver Crystal of

167
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,100
the past as well...

168
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,220
The rest should be simple
enough, especially for you.

169
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,140
I will get you the
other crystal right away.

170
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,160
I am at your
service, Wiseman.

171
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,070
This will not
be difficult.

172
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,210
Oh really?

173
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,100
Neo Queen Serenity's
castle is impenetrable.

174
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,080
It can't be breached
by just any old attack.

175
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,080
Hmph!

176
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,130
Also, that's a pretty
piece of glass you have

177
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,110
there, but is it the real
thing?

178
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,160
I have my doubts. It doesn't
work. And there's no proof

179
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,100
it is what you say it is.

180
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,110
Are you sure you can trust
her, Wiseman?

181
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,160
Because I don't.

182
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,070
How dare you? Once I capture
Neo Queen Serenity, you'll see.

183
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,180
We'll fire a second giant
piece of the Malefic Black

184
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,190
Crystal into the Earth. That
should get the queen's

185
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,150
attention and force her to
show herself. Then I'll

186
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,230
make her kneel before me.

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,230
The planet's already been
badly damaged.

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,160
A new attack
could destroy it.

189
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,190
So be it.

190
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,220
Who cares? What does it
matter? I already have what

191
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,230
I want. The only
man I love.

192
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,160
Endymion.

193
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,180
You know what needs to be
done. Now go. With your new

194
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,130
earrings, you can travel
freely in space and time.

195
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,040
Get everything ready to
attack the Earth.

196
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,070
Do you see that Saphir?

197
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,120
Nemesis is alight! Just look
at it burn!

198
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,170
I never realized what an
enormous planet it actually is.

199
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,110
Finally, I have you
all to myself.

200
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,100
I won't let anyone
get in our way.

201
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,100
You are mine and mine
alone...

202
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,090
... Forever...

203
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:12,338
Chibi-Usa... Mamo... You're
surrounded by darkness...

204
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:13,498
Where are you?

205
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:21,033
Chibi-Usa... Mamo...

206
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:23,311
You're awake!

207
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,261
Guys?

208
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:28,161
Are you okay? You slept
for a long time.

209
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,321
Mom? [gasp]

210
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:33,101
My room? How did I get here?

211
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,331
[chuckling]

212
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,181
Your friends brought you
home. Don't you remember?

213
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,281
You fell in gym class
and got a concussion.

214
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,032
[sigh] My Usagi,
such a klutz.

215
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:44,022
You girls catch up. I'll go
make some tea.

216
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:46,102
[gasp]

217
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:47,202
Luna P!

218
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,222
King Endymion repaired it
for us, and I was able to

219
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:52,212
use it to alter your
mom's memory...

220
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,172
At least for
the time being.

221
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:56,222
What really happened?
Tell me.

222
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:58,212
You overdid it while we were
searching through

223
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:00,102
space-time, and you passed
out.

224
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:02,222
We thought we'd come back
here for a bit so you could

225
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,202
recover. You'd been there
too long anyway.

226
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,242
Must feel nice to be back
home in your own bed.

227
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:09,082
You were talking in your
sleep and snoring too.

228
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,082
I was?

229
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:12,052
We tried pinching your
nose to make you stop.

230
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:13,112
Really?

231
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:15,032
But it didn't work. You were
still louder than a buzz saw.

232
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:18,062
Aww. You guys are so mean!

233
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:22,212
Everyone came over to play!

234
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:23,182
[gasp]

235
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:27,072
Uh--

236
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:29,112
Usagi?

237
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:30,212
[exhale]

238
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:34,192
It all seems so unreal.

239
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:37,062
I'm home and the five of us
are together again. I can

240
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:39,082
hardly believe it...

241
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,012
And I'm really happy!

242
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:46,082
I mean that. I am. It's
just... something's missing.

243
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:49,152
I want Chibi-Usa and Mamo
here with me. too.

244
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:54,202
Without them, I'm lonely.

245
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:57,232
Guess what, Usagi! I brought
Luna P to school for show

246
00:13:57,242 --> 00:14:00,202
and tell! And now everybody
wants one! [giggling]

247
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:03,192
[crying]

248
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:07,022
Jeez, you're a hopeless
case, you know that?

249
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:09,092
No kidding. Everyone is
trying to comfort you

250
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:11,012
and this is
the thanks we get?

251
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,242
But we know it's your
maternal instinct kicking

252
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,082
in, so we'll let it slide.

253
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:16,192
Don't be sad, Usagi.
We love you.

254
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,102
And we just want
to see you smile.

255
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:19,222
Heh.

256
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:23,222
I have to find them. I'm
not going to stop looking.

257
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:26,042
They are both coming
home safe and sound.

258
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,242
That's a promise.

259
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,082
Chibi-Usa, Mamo
and you guys all mean

260
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,192
everything to me!

261
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:34,042
I need to find them,
will you help me?

262
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:35,082
Of course we'll help!

263
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:36,092
They're our friends.

264
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,222
We want to find them
just as much as you do.

265
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:41,062
If we all put our heads
together and come up with a

266
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,042
plan, I'm sure we can save
them.

267
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:46,012
Plus, we wouldn't let you go
alone even if you wanted to.

268
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,242
-That's for sure!
-[laughing]

269
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,012
You've gotten so strong,
Usagi. I'm proud of you.

270
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:06,212
Serenity... Can you hear me?
Forgive me, my love.

271
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:09,012
I could not protect
our daughter.

272
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:11,012
And now she's gone.

273
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:16,222
You saved Sailor Moon,
didn't you?

274
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,172
She told me she felt your
presence and you shared your

275
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:22,102
power with her. But the
Legendary Silver Crystal

276
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:25,232
from the past cannot be used
here in the future. Did you

277
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:29,022
activate it for her? Or were
you somehow with her when

278
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,082
she escaped?

279
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:33,072
Serenity... Are you awake?

280
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,082
Please lend me your
strength. As a disembodied

281
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:40,032
spirit, I can hardly do
anything. Serenity, why

282
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:41,082
won't you answer me?

283
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:43,022
She hasn't forsaken you.

284
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,232
It's just not time
for that yet.

285
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:46,012
Diana?

286
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:49,062
The queen would never
abandon her loved ones. If

287
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:52,062
things were truly desperate,
you know she'd intervene.

288
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:53,242
Just like she did with
Sailor Moon.

289
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:57,172
But for the time being, she
remains inside the Legendary

290
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:00,222
Silver Crystal, healing her
wounds. She needs to build

291
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:03,022
her strength back up, so
that we'll have it when we

292
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:03,242
need it the most.

293
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:05,212
It's good the queen's not
awake yet. That

294
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:08,042
means things aren't as
bad as they could be.

295
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,072
So, please try to
cheer up, okay?

296
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:11,102
Hm.

297
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,072
[meow]

298
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:15,152
Thank you, Diana.

299
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:18,072
Get to bed early. You need a
good night's sleep.

300
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:19,012
I will.

301
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:20,092
See you in the morning,
Usagi.

302
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:22,182
Okay, bye guys!
Have a good night.

303
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,112
Mm.

304
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,172
A blood-red sunset is a bad
omen.

305
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:39,192
Mamo, Chibi-Usa... Wherever
you are, please be safe.

306
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:43,212
Huh? Pluto's
Space-Time Key?

307
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:46,032
[gasp]

308
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,022
[gasp]

309
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,192
[gasp]

310
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:56,042
What's going on? Why is
everything getting all

311
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,212
warped and twisted?

312
00:16:58,062 --> 00:16:59,042
[gasp]

313
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,062
It feels like it's ripping
my body apart!

314
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:05,072
[screaming]

315
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,022
[gasps]

316
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:11,202
I think it's over. You all
okay?

317
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:13,212
Yeah, we're fine. What was
that?

318
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:16,212
[panting]

319
00:17:18,242 --> 00:17:24,062
The Key... Was it Pluto
trying to warn me? Does she

320
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:25,192
need me to come to the
future?

321
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:26,102
Usagi!

322
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,232
Are you okay?

323
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:31,022
Luna! Something's wrong!

324
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:34,092
I agree! We need to get to
the 30th century right away!

325
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:36,162
Let's go.

326
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,092
Ready?

327
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:39,072
Mm!

328
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,232
Moon Crystal Power!

329
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:46,242
Mercury Star Power!

330
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:50,152
Mars Star Power!

331
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:53,202
Jupiter Star Power!

332
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:56,152
Venus Star Power!

333
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:58,212
Make up!

334
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:18,012
[panting]

335
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,082
Pluto!

336
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,242
Sailor Moon!

337
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,032
Did something
bad happen?!

338
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,052
We felt a shockwave all
the way in the past!

339
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:27,012
It's awful! Take
a look.

340
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:32,162
[gasp]

341
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:33,202
Oh no!

342
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:39,022
A second Malefic Black
Crystal? But the Earth was

343
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:41,242
already destroyed, why would
the Black Moon attack it again?!

344
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:55,022
Hello... Neo Queen Serenity.
Wake up. It's me!

345
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:59,022
Who are you? What are you
doing here?

346
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:06,182
[gasp]

347
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:08,222
Don't you recognize me?

348
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,112
I'm your daughter.

349
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:13,222
Princess Usagi Small
Lady Serenity.

350
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:16,042
You're not Small Lady. You
can't be!

351
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:17,182
Oh, but I am.

352
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,062
How else could I be
here? Only members of the

353
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,022
Silver Millennium
royal household

354
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:22,242
may enter
the Palace.

355
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:25,162
But then... why do you look
like that?

356
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:29,022
I grew up. Now I look like
who I really am.

357
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:31,222
Someone gave me the power
to change and finally,

358
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:33,072
I have awakened.

359
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:35,052
[gasp]

360
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:36,112
King Endymion!

361
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,222
[gasp]

362
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:40,162
Who are you?

363
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:42,242
It couldn't be!

364
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,062
Did you miss me? Don't tell
me you forgot!

365
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:50,162
Not that it matters! Now
give me the Silver Crystal!

366
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:52,172
[gasp] [yelp]

367
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:53,192
[gasp]

368
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:57,042
[grunt]

369
00:21:57,072 --> 00:22:00,052
[groaning]

370
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:03,222
Neat trick. So that's how
the unworthy are cast

371
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:05,032
out of paradise.

372
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,012
Guess this means I'm kicked
out of the family and can no

373
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:09,232
longer inherit the throne.

374
00:22:10,072 --> 00:22:13,072
Fine! Keep your crown!

375
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,222
I never wanted it anyway.
Not from a world that

376
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:19,112
didn't want me! Now it's
time to turn my back on you!

377
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:20,212
[panting]

378
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,042
Small Lady!

379
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,102
Chibi-Usa!

380
00:22:23,112 --> 00:22:24,112
[panting]

381
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:26,202
Chibi-Usa? Is that you?!

382
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:32,062
Yes. My name was Chibi-Usa,
once upon a time.

383
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:35,162
But not anymore. I've grown
up. I'm not the little girl

384
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,042
I used to be.

385
00:22:37,062 --> 00:22:38,102
Wiseman!

386
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:40,012
[gasp]

387
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:44,222
My name is Black Lady:
Queen of Darkness.

388
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:48,042
Wiseman, Ruler of Darkness,
chose me to be at his side.

389
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:50,222
And now I am Queen
of the Dark Planet.

390
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:52,192
The Queen of Nemesis!

391
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:33,102
Please, Chibi-Usa! Stop!

392
00:24:33,112 --> 00:24:35,132
Take the Legendary Silver
Crystal!

393
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,172
Take my life! Take
whatever you want!

394
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:39,052
I don't care
what it is!

395
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:41,102
Just stop being Black
Lady...

396
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:44,102
Please! That's not
who you are!

397
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,232
I've had enough
of this future.

398
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:49,102
I don't wanna see
any more of it!

399
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:54,092
Act 24: ATTACK - BLACK LADY

400
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:57,092
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
