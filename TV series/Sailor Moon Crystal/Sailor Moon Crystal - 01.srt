1
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,170
Usagi! You're going
to be late!

2
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,030
[moaning]

3
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,080
[Usagi screaming]

4
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,110
Mom! Why didn't you
wake me up sooner?!

5
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,040
Agh!

6
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,110
Owwie!

7
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,190
Usagi? Are
you alright?

8
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,100
No, I'm not
alright!

9
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,190
That really hurt!

10
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,030
Oh! Thanks for
lunch! Bye!

11
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,070
See you later, dear.
Please be careful,
okay?

12
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,150
Okay!

13
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,080
What am I going to do
with that girl?

14
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:50,220
If only she were
more like Sailor V.

15
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,160
[screaming]

16
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,070
I'm late! I'm
late! I'm late!

17
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,060
Why does morning
have to come so
early?

18
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,070
I'm so sleepy...

19
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,190
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I'm
14 and go to Juban
Middle School.

20
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,150
I'm a bit of a klutz,
and honestly, kind of
a crybaby, too.

21
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,140
[screaming]

22
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,140
Owie! Ow! Ow! Ow!

23
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,090
Huh? That's weird.
Did I step on
something?

24
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,080
[whimpering]

25
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,070
No way! A cat? Oh!
I'm so sorry, kitty!

26
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,190
[meowing]

27
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,160
Wow, you're such a
sweetie!

28
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:25,020
Sorry if I scared
you! Are you okay?

29
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,190
[screaming]

30
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,170
Hey! What's the big
idea?! What'd you
do that for?

31
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,090
[meowing]

32
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,020
What's that on your
head? Are those
bandages?

33
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,200
Want me to take
them off?

34
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,210
Okie dokey!

35
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,020
Huh?

36
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,000
[bells ringing]

37
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,456
Ahhhh!

38
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,220
Ahh! I don't have time
for this! I have to
get going!

39
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,230
Come forth. The time
has come.

40
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,180
Our Great Ruler
requires your service.

41
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,020
Now go...

42
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,000
And bring me the
Legendary Silver
Crystal.

43
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,130
Usagi Tsukino! You're
late again! Go stand
in the hallway!

44
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,150
[students giggling]

45
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,210
Yes, Ms. Haruna...

46
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,010
Aw! It's not my fault
the other kids always
get to school on time.

47
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,220
The princess in my
dream was so beautiful.

48
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,030
Some day, I'm going
to become a princess

49
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,220
and I'll never
go to school again.

50
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,180
[stomach growling]

51
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,220
I'm so hungry...

52
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,150
[giggle]

53
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,020
Well since I skipped
breakfast, why not!

54
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,100
Miss Tsukino! What
exactly were you
doing just now?

55
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,180
Um, nothing, Ms.
Haruna. Uhh...

56
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,010
Excuses like that
lead to scores
like this!

57
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,140
[students laughing]

58
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,030
This is Haruna Sakurada,
our homeroom teacher.
We call her 'Haruda' for

59
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,140
short. She also
teaches English.

60
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,230
Which, by the way,
is my worst subject...

61
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,000
[sigh]

62
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,120
Wow! I can't believe
you tried to eat during
class.

63
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,140
You seriously need to
learn some self-control.

64
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,050
I can't help it...

65
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,170
This is my best
friend, Naru.

66
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,050
Hey, Usagi! How'd
you do on your
exam?

67
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,110
I didn't study much
so I only got a 95.

68
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,120
That's Umino. He's an
Otaku. And totally
annoying...

69
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,150
[annoyed groan]

70
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,190
Exams are easy.
They're like child's
play to me.

71
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,150
Child's play?! You
really are obnoxious
you know that?

72
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,020
He scored higher than
me! And without even
studying!

73
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,230
Naru's smart and
pretty! Plus, her
family's rich!

74
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,000
By the way, did you
guys here there was

75
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,000
another jewelry
store robbery?

76
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,130
There've been
so many!

77
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,060
I know, it's
so scary!

78
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah but Sailor V was
able to catch all the
bad guys! So it's cool.

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,457
Sailor who?

80
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,040
You haven't
heard of her?

81
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,140
Sailor V is a costumed
crime fighter! Under
cover of darkness, she's

82
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,130
been fighting evil
all over town.

83
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,200
Rumor has it she's
actually a special

84
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,200
investigator working
for the police.

85
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,180
Ohh. There really
are people like
that?

86
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,020
Stealing is wrong, but
I get how someone

87
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,220
would want all
those pretty jewels!

88
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,040
I know, right?!
Jewelry's the
best! So sparkly!

89
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,140
Totally! Naru, doesn't
your mom own a big
jewelry store downtown?

90
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,190
[chuckling]

91
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,010
Yeah she does! And
she's actually having
a huge sale!

92
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,000
Lot's of stuff's been
put on clearance so
it's super cheap!

93
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,170
Really? Can I stop
by after school today?

94
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,140
Me too! Me too!

95
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,010
The one in the middle is
the Pigeon's Blood Ruby.
It's worth a billion yen!

96
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,210
So, Mom can't really
give you a discount
on that one!

97
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,160
So many people...

98
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,170
Step right up, ladies!
Take advantage of our
deep discounts!

99
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,000
Hi, Mom! I'm back!

100
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh! Welcome home,
sweetheart!

101
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,435
Are those
your friends?

102
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:40,160
Uh-huh!

103
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,150
[chuckling]

104
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Well it's crowded but
have a look around.

105
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,030
Any friends of my Naru
can have an extra
special discount!

106
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,180
Really?!
Thank you!
[gasp]

107
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,170
[giggling]

108
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,200
I wonder what's gotten
into Mom. Maybe it's
a new business plan.

109
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,020
We've never had
a sale before...

110
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,000
No need to shove!
There's plenty
for everyone!

111
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,220
[excited laughter]

112
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,190
[gasp]

113
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,070
This is so cute! I'll
ask Dad to get

114
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,220
it for me for doing
well on my exam!

115
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,080
That's right.
Keep buying.

116
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,220
I still need more of your
youthful energy... More!

117
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,140
I can't...

118
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,030
I wish I could get
something, but Mom

119
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,220
would never let me
with grades this bad.

120
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,010
Oh well...

121
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,476
Hm?

122
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,020
Hey, that hurt,
Bump-head.

123
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,040
Are you trying to
make bumps on my
head, too?

124
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,150
[annoyed growl]

125
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,070
Look! These aren't bumps!
They're buns! Can't you
tell the difference?

126
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,090
30 percent...

127
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,050
Ugh...

128
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,180
You need to study a
lot harder, Bun-head.

129
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,497
[annoyed growl]

130
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:52,160
Mind your own
business!

131
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,070
[gasp]

132
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,170
What's wrong with
me? Why is my heart
pounding like this?

133
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,210
Who the heck wears a
tuxedo in the middle of
the afternoon, anyway?!

134
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:33,040
Agh! What an
arrogant jerk!

135
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,060
This is the biggest
jewelry store I've
seen yet.

136
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,050
They might actually
have it.

137
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,220
The Legendary
Silver Crystal.

138
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
[sigh]

139
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,466
Hm?

140
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,090
Oh! So this must
be Sailor V!

141
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,010
I wish I could be like
her. She doesn't need
to study. And I bet

142
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,000
it feels super awesome
to take down all those
bad guys!

143
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,210
Oh come on! Why can't
I beat this guy?!

144
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,110
Hey, Usagi! Stopping
by on your way home
from school again?

145
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,080
[giggle]

146
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,170
That guy is tough to
beat. There's a little
trick to it.

147
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,070
Hit him twice! Now quick!
Use your special attack!

148
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,040
All right!

149
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,070
[giggling]

150
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,220
This is Motoki. He works
at this arcade part-time.

151
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,020
He's so sweet and
really cute, too!

152
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,000
I've kinda got a
little crush on him!

153
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,010
[meowing]

154
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,110
Oh, it's the black
cat from this morning!

155
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,100
Oh, so you're
back again.

156
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,100
That cat's been wandering
around here for the past
few days.

157
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,070
[laughing]

158
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,140
Hey look!

159
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,220
She's got a crescent-
shaped bald spot on
her head!

160
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,120
[chuckling]

161
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,120
Huh?

162
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,090
I'm home!

163
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,030
Welcome back, Usagi. I
ran into Umino earlier.

164
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,100
He said you got
your test results.

165
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,160
Huh?

166
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,040
He got a 95 on his
exam. His parents must
be so proud.

167
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,050
How did you do
on yours, Usagi?

168
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,220
Ugh! That Umino...
Him and his big
mouth!

169
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,050
[shocked gasp]

170
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,220
30 percent?!

171
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,110
Usagi!

172
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,010
How dare you
fail again?!

173
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,110
Go outside and think
about what you've done!

174
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,060
Wha-?

175
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,090
But Mom...

176
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,110
What'd ya do to make
Mom so made this time?

177
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,110
Shingo?

178
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,200
Stupid Usagi. Kicked out
for failing yet again.

179
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,090
Man, I wish I had
a smarter sister!

180
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,140
Mmm!

181
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,000
Shingo! Don't call
me names! I'm still
older than you!

182
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,220
You're in for it
now! Sailor V Kick!

183
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,030
Ow! My foot! My
foot! My foot!

184
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,090
Please let me
in, Mom!

185
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,020
[sigh]

186
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,120
Patience, Ikuko.
Patience...

187
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,140
[chuckling]

188
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,210
Foolish humans! They
have no idea the jewelry

189
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,120
they bought is
draining their energy.

190
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,090
Pity though. It would
appear that the jewel
I was seeking isn't here.

191
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,210
Is that you, Mom?

192
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,476
[gasp]

193
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,040
[whimpering]

194
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,220
Mom didn't have
to get that angry.

195
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,020
It's not fair. I'm
trying my hardest.

196
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,020
[sigh]

197
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,150
I don't feel like doing
my homework right now.

198
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,341
I'm tired. I think I'll
take a little nap.

199
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,130
What's going on? Is
this the same dream
from this morning?

200
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,100
Huh?

201
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,060
No wait! This is a video
game! I get it now.

202
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm Sailor V and I have
to rescue that cat!

203
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,230
The black cat with the
crescent-shaped bald
spot.

204
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,090
Ah! Ow! What the
heck was that for?!

205
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,100
Don't be so insulting!
This is not a bald spot!

206
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,010
Hm?!

207
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,100
The cat is talking?!

208
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,160
My name is Luna. I
came to this town in
search of you, Usagi.

209
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,180
Huh...

210
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,140
Thanks for removing
the bandages earlier. I
couldn't speak with them

211
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,200
on. And they made it
harder to find you.

212
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,060
Kids around here
stick things on stray
cats for fun.

213
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,120
They're such evil brats!

214
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,080
How lucky that you
found me! I'm so glad
to finally meet you.

215
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,130
You have no idea!

216
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,100
Good night!

217
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,060
Usagi, get up! You
are not dreaming!

218
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm totally dreaming.
I must be!

219
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,160
[sigh]

220
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,230
Okay then, I'll prove
it's not a dream.

221
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,010
I have a little
gift for you,
Usagi.

222
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,100
What?! A gift for me?

223
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,070
Oh wow! A jewel
encrusted brooch!

224
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,070
Pretty!

225
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,130
I love it! I can't
wait to try it on!

226
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,170
Usagi, turn around and
listen to me. Strange
things have been

227
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,150
happening in Tokyo
lately that the
police can't handle.

228
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,170
But you can. You're
the chosen Guardian!

229
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,150
It's your mission to
find the other Guardians.

230
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,030
And together, defeat
this evil enemy.

231
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,170
Also, you must help
them find our missing
Princess.

232
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,130
Luna!

233
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,120
Huh?

234
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,030
What's happening?
The brooch is
glowing!

235
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,140
Now do you believe
what I've been telling
you, Usagi?

236
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,130
Huh?

237
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,150
Repeat after me: "Moon
Prism Power Make Up!"

238
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,160
Moon...

239
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,040
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

240
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,100
Huh? No way!
What's going on?!

241
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,080
I look like Sailor V!

242
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,040
Pretty cool, huh?

243
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,120
Huh? What's that?

244
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,180
Someone help
me! Please!
My mom is-

245
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,060
That voice,
it's Naru!

246
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,050
[gasp]

247
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,060
A monster must
have appeared!

248
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,110
Luna! I don't know
what's going on, but
Naru's in trouble!

249
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,100
I have to save her!

250
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,100
[chuckling]

251
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,060
What's happened to
you, Mom?! Stop this!

252
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,180
Mom? I'm not your mother.

253
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,190
She's tied up in the
basement, so I'm afraid
she can't help you.

254
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,080
[shocked gasp]

255
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,100
And now that you know
my secret, dear Naru, I
cannot allow you to live!

256
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,140
[screaming]

257
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,020
Hey you! Ugly
monster lady!

258
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,140
Get away from Naru!

259
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,080
Who the hell are you?!

260
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,060
[gasp]

261
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,190
Who me? Well I...
I guess, uhh...

262
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,060
[meowing]

263
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,060
That's it!

264
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,150
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice!

265
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,030
I am Sailor Moon!

266
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,060
And now in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you!

267
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,200
Sailor Moon? Never
heard of ya. You
don't scare me.

268
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,200
Awaken minions! It is
time for all those who
have given energy to

269
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,140
our Great Ruler to
arise and serve her!

270
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,170
[gasp]

271
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,060
What's going on?

272
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,140
Attack this girl!

273
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,040
[growling]

274
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,160
What? I thought
this was just
a dream!

275
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,160
Oh my gosh! My
knee's bleeding!

276
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,040
[evil chuckling]

277
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,110
[growling]

278
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,140
What are you doing,
Sailor Moon? You need
to fight back!

279
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,190
Kick that monster's butt!

280
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,060
What do you mean 'kick
her butt'? How am I
supposed to do that?!

281
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,080
Agh!

282
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,150
[evil chuckling]

283
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,190
What am I gonna do?
How'd I get into
this mess?!

284
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,160
[hysterically crying]

285
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,050
I can't take
it anymore!

286
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,090
I just wanna
go home!

287
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,170
Agh! Ultra sonic
waves! They're
deafening!

288
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,090
[crying]

289
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,130
Stop crying, Sailor
Moon! Now's your
chance! Take it!

290
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,120
Hurry, Sailor Moon!
She's weak! Finish
her!

291
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,220
The tiara you're wearing,
throw it and yell, "Moon
Tiara Boomerang!"

292
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,100
Moon Tiara Boomerang!

293
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,090
[gasp]

294
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,210
[screaming]

295
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,110
Great job! You beat her!

296
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,100
Well I didn't find the
Legendary Silver Crystal,

297
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,130
but I got to see something
else quite interesting.

298
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,180
Sailor Moon, wait!

299
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,230
I shall remember your
name, Sailor Moon.

300
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,080
But you can call
me Tuxedo Mask!

301
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,010
Sailor Moon, huh? She
certainly made short
work of my monster.

302
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,090
Nevertheless, I will
obtain the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

303
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,080
No matter what it takes.

304
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,090
Hmph!

305
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,200
And, and! Just when the
robber was about to attack
me I screamed and passed

306
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,160
out cold! But before I
lost consciousness, I'm

307
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,190
pretty sure a Sailor
Guardian jumped in to
save me!

308
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,120
I so wish I'd come to
in time to find out
who she was.

309
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,170
That's weird, Naru.

310
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,020
Are you sure you
weren't dreaming?

311
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,230
It really happened!
I swear!

312
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,080
Are you okay,
Usagi? What's
wrong?

313
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,080
So everything that
happened, it wasn't
a dream...

314
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,160
What's next? I don't
even want to think
about it!

315
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,130
[groaning]

316
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,120
Luna! I don't want to
fight anymore scary
monsters!

317
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,050
You're going to have to.
It's only a matter of time
before more enemies appear.

318
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,190
We'll need to gather
our allies and fight
them.

319
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,130
Allies? You mean
like Tuxedo Mask?

320
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,230
Oh, Usagi... Hey! I
think I know who the
second Sailor Guardian is.

321
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,120
Act Two, "Ami,
Sailor Mercury."

322
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,150
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
