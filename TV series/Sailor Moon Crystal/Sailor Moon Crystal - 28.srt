1
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:22,833
I'm home!

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,933
You're especially late
tonight. Where were you?

3
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,733
Mako cooked a really
fancy dinner for

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,300
everyone at her place.

5
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,033
The food was so good!

6
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,866
Okay, Mamo. Thanks.
See ya tomorrow!

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,500
[humming]

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,666
What's with the phone call,
kid? Why were you talking to

9
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,433
Mamo and what's tomorrow?

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,433
Jealous much?

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,433
So... you really want me to
tell you? Well it's a secret.

12
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,500
You'll never know!

13
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,900
Chibi‐Usa! Tell me! Tell
me right this minute!

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,833
Spit it out! Out with it!

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,633
Why are you two always at
each other's throats?

16
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,100
Enough! It's not a
conspiracy. Chibi‐Usa

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,033
and her friends are just
going to the amusement

18
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,666
park after school.

19
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:14,933
And Mamo?

20
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,800
He agreed to chaperone
while I'm at my Women's

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,933
Association meeting.
With everything that's been

22
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:21,466
going on lately, the kids
can't go by themselves.

23
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:24,000
We're gonna ride the Mugen
C Park roller coaster

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,733
together, just him and me!

25
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:30,333
No! You're going to that new
amusement park? And with

26
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:35,900
Mamo?! I wanna go too!
It's so unfair!

27
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,033
Hello? Mamo...

28
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:33,533
If you're going to Mugen C
Park, I wanna come too!

29
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,133
Don't you have plans already?
I thought you and the

30
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,700
others were going
to go check out

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,533
Mugen Academy tomorrow?

32
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,033
[sobbing] But I want to go
on all the romantic rides

33
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,266
with you, Mamo!

34
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:48,866
I want to go! I want to go!
I want to go!

35
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,866
I won't be far away.
The park is located in

36
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,033
Sankakusu.

37
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:57,033
It's on that reclaimed land,
in Mugenzu. Which means the

38
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,733
school, is pretty much
right next door.

39
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,133
I'll have my communicator
on so you can

40
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,166
reach me at all times.

41
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,766
First sign of trouble,
I'll be right there.

42
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,766
Sankakusu?

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,766
The center of the Tokyo Bay
Land Reclamation Project.

44
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,933
The three reclaimed sites
are Tenohzu, Kaiohzu, and

45
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,266
Meiohzu. Together they
form a triangle,

46
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,833
from which Sankakusu
gets its name.

47
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:26,133
The area has homes,
offices, shopping.

48
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,966
It's its own
full‐fledged city.

49
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:31,100
And in the center, right at
its heart lies the Mugenzu

50
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,833
District, home to
the prestigious

51
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,133
Mugen Academy.

52
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,700
It would seem some of the
defects got exposed to the

53
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
outside world, and ended up
releasing their Daimons.

54
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,600
Forgive us, Magus Kaolinite.

55
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,600
What's done is done. But
at least they led us to

56
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,966
discover the anomalies
the Master mentioned.

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,166
The ones protected by
Guardian Planets.

58
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,266
Little girls who think they
can protect this world.

59
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:10,033
I have a new mission for you
Witches, so listen well.

60
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,266
Remove these anomalies.
I want them gone.

61
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,600
You can use Daimons,
but work quickly.

62
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,733
Successfully eliminate the
Sailor Guardians and I will

63
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,533
level you up.

64
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:24,700
Get through this, with a
level high enough, and you

65
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,666
shall be granted the
title of Magus.

66
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,533
Do you mean that?

67
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,166
You will let us be
Magus like you?

68
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,533
I give you my word. You will
be permitted to communicate

69
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,933
directly with Master Pharaoh
90, and receive the

70
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:45,066
blessings of our life
source, the Taioron Crystal.

71
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,033
The blessings of our life
source? Thank you, ma'am,

72
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,933
we will strive to be worthy
of such an honor!

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,533
Now go, my Witches 5! And
gather some Vessels and

74
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,500
Hostes as well!

75
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,100
Of course, Magus Kaolinite.

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,800
You can leave
everything to us.

77
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,000
We will do our Master proud.

78
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,233
I sense something strong.

79
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,900
What is it, Rei?

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,133
This place is overflowing
with a powerful aura.

81
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,733
Something's off with the
spatial density of this

82
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,133
entire area.

83
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:27,833
It looks like it's distorted.

84
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,633
Do you guys see that? The
wind's picked up all of a

85
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,000
sudden. They're
agitated and upset.

86
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,133
A storm is coming soon.

87
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,166
[gasp]

88
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,266
Is something wrong?

89
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,600
That feeling again.

90
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,466
Someone's definitely
watching us.

91
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,266
[amusement park chatter]

92
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:54,066
[screaming and laughter]

93
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,733
Sorry you had to give
up your free time.

94
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,666
I appreciate you
coming with.

95
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:01,333
No worries. I'm happy to
help. These rides look fun.

96
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:02,733
You want me to wait
for the kids

97
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,333
while you give the
roller coaster a try?

98
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07,133
Uh, it's nice of you to
offer, Asanuma, but that

99
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,700
stuff's not for me.

100
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,733
That's their second
ride in a row!

101
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,300
Are they just gonna ride the
roller coaster all day?

102
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,066
So how do you boys
know Chibi‐Usa?

103
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you all in the
same class with her?

104
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,200
Yeah!

105
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,233
Want something to drink? How
'bout some lemonade? On me.

106
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,133
All right!

107
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,633
'Kay. ' I'll be right back.

108
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,833
[happy screaming]

109
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,066
I'll be right back Momo! I
need to go get my hat.

110
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,233
Okay! Well, then
I'll go with you.

111
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,000
I saw where it went. It
pretty close by. Go and have

112
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,166
fun. I'll be fine.

113
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:48,133
I won't be long! [giggle]

114
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,800
Hey there, Momo. Why
isn't Chibi‐Usa with you?

115
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, she, uh...

116
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:01,633
Her hat flew off so she left
the park to go get it alone?!

117
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,966
[sigh] Unbelievable.

118
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,366
Asanuma, hold down
the fort here.

119
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:09,566
Uh... You're coming
back, right?

120
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,233
I could've sworn it fell
somewhere around here.

121
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,100
Maybe it's behind
this building?

122
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,533
Mugen Academy.

123
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,233
"A new school with a focus
on integrated learning."

124
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,133
It says here they have
a kindergarten

125
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,733
and primary school all the
way up through university

126
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,533
and graduate programs.

127
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:34,533
They boast of sports stars,
entertainment professionals,

128
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,066
and other highly
accomplished

129
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,533
persons amongst their
alumni. Their elite education

130
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,100
system has garnered them
a lot of attention.

131
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,866
They also have security
guards at the door.

132
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,966
What now?

133
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,566
[gasp] Oh yeah!

134
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,766
I think I have the perfect
way to get inside.

135
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,966
Just leave it to me!

136
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,133
Okay...

137
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:59,266
Moon Power! Change me
into a student who

138
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:02,100
goes to: Mugen Academy!

139
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,300
Usagi?!

140
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,766
Wait there! I'll go take
a quick look inside!

141
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:19,100
With this disguise, no one
will even notice me!

142
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Usagi! [sigh]

143
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:23,633
Think she'll be
okay on her own?

144
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,200
Wow, it's incredible!
Are all private

145
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,533
schools like this?

146
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,766
I can't believe this entire
60‐story building is a

147
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,166
school! Talk about high‐class!

148
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,666
Nothing out of the
ordinary so far.

149
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,133
[gasp]

150
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,866
What beautiful music...

151
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,033
A violin?

152
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,666
Enchanting...

153
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,800
But who's playing it? I feel
like I have to know...

154
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:33,766
That melody... It's
like a gentle wave.

155
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,600
[gasp]

156
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,533
It stopped.

157
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,933
Someone's coming!

158
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,100
[gasps]

159
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,666
Haruka Tenoh?

160
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,100
Coming to a place like this
all alone, that's a very

161
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,166
bold thing to do.

162
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,666
Bold, yet dangerous.

163
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:06,100
Be careful. It could
cost you your life.

164
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:12,066
Best not to go poking your
noses around here.

165
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,233
If the four of you leave now,
I'll overlook it this time.

166
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:19,200
But get in my way, and
there will be trouble.

167
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,833
Hey! What are you doing?

168
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:28,000
Who are you? State your
year, class, and name!

169
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,533
Oh no! My cover's blown!

170
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:30,866
Get back here!

171
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,566
That scared me.

172
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:39,233
<i>For a moment there, her eyes</i>
<i>turned so dark, I thought</i>

173
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,100
they might pierce my soul.

174
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:46,233
My whole body is still
shaking. Is she an enemy?

175
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,333
Where am I?

176
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,666
I'd better hurry and get
back to the others before I

177
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:08,933
get caught again.

178
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,400
Thank goodness!
Glad I found it.

179
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,266
Mommy Ikuko gave this to me.

180
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,433
Chibi‐Usa!

181
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,766
Where did she go? I need
to find her, quick.

182
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,766
Hey are you alright?

183
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,300
I get these attacks a lot.

184
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:54,133
They usually pass on their
own. Please go away.

185
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,766
You're hurt...

186
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,100
This area is off limits.
You shouldn't be here.

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,333
Chibi‐Usa!

188
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,666
Usagi!

189
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,633
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you with Mamo?

190
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,900
My hat flew off when I was
on the roller coaster

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,633
earlier. I came to get
it and found her.

192
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,800
I think she's in pain...

193
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,466
What do we do?
Should we call for help?

194
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,333
She's wearing a Mugen
Academy uniform...

195
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,200
[meowing]

196
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:26,866
[chuckles]

197
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,566
[gasp] My brooch!

198
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,833
The Legendary Silver Crystal
is trying to warn me again!

199
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,733
[roar]

200
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,500
Another Atavism?!

201
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:46,166
Don't be scared. Just stay
down. Ready Usagi?

202
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,666
Hey! Wait Chibi‐Usa!

203
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,666
[growly roar]

204
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,700
[screaming]

205
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,033
Chibi‐Usa?

206
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,300
Are you two okay?

207
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,733
We heard you guys screaming.

208
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,966
[gasp] Watch out!

209
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,566
[screaming]

210
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:10,866
Makes sense there'd be
another one here.

211
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,900
Alright! Let's transform!

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,900
[affirmative grunt]

213
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,233
Moon Cosmic Power Make Up!

214
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,266
Moon Prism Power Make Up!

215
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:32,366
Mercury Planet Power
Make Up!

216
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:01,266
Mars Planet Power Make Up!

217
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:33,833
Jupiter Planet Power
Make Up!

218
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:01,433
Venus Planet Power Make Up!

219
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,466
Protected by Mercury,
the Planet of Water,

220
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:37,933
Guardian of Wisdom.

221
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:40,166
I am Sailor Mercury!

222
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,400
Douse yourself in water,
and repent!

223
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,800
Protected by Mars,
the Planet of Fire,

224
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,466
Guardian of War.

225
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:52,466
I am Sailor Mars!

226
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:56,266
In the name of Mars,
I'll chastise you!

227
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,333
Protected by Jupiter, the
Planet of Thunder,

228
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:03,300
Guardian of Protection.

229
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,866
I am Sailor Jupiter!

230
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,666
I'll fill you with regret,
it'll leave you numb!

231
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,800
Protected by Venus,
the Planet of Beauty,

232
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,300
Guardian of Love.

233
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,366
I am Sailor Venus!

234
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:20,866
In the name of Venus, I
will punish you with love!

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,733
I am the Pretty Guardian, who
fights for love and for justice.

236
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,333
I am Sailor Moon!

237
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:33,166
I am the Pretty
Guardian Trainee!

238
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,466
I am Sailor Chibi Moon!

239
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,733
And now...

240
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,900
In the name of the Moon,
we'll punish you!

241
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,300
[growling]

242
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,366
Careful, girls. Don't let it
get you with its claws!

243
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,566
[growl attack]

244
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,200
[chuckles]

245
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,466
I think it was smart to use
a different Vessel this time.

246
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:08,533
Things are getting
interesting.

247
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:09,966
It shouldn't be long now.

248
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,233
Those annoying Sailor
Guardians are about to die.

249
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,633
[growling]

250
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,533
Mercury Aqua Mist!

251
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:27,200
Burning Mandala!

252
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:32,533
[fear gasp]

253
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,900
No! Look out!

254
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:49,566
Chibi Moon!

255
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,766
[growling]

256
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,100
[chuckling]

257
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,400
Daimon! Show no mercy! Tear
them to pieces, every last one!

258
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,866
[attacking roar]

259
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,866

Venus Love Me Chain!

261
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,233
Sailor Moon, Now!

262
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,700
You heard her!

263
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Time to use your
Heart Moon Rod!

264
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,766
Okay!

265
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,800
Neo Queen Serenity!

266
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,700
Lend me your strength!

267
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,566
Lend your power to my
Heart Moon Rod!

268
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:57,800
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

269
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:05,200
[roaring]

270
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,433
A cat?

271
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,266
That horrible monster
was a possessed cat?

272
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,466
[scoff] Another lousy defect.

273
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,300
Hey! Is everyone okay?

274
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,166
Where's Chibi Moon?

275
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:27,933
Mamo!

276
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,433
Hey, Mamo!

277
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,200
[gasp] Are you still in pain?

278
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:38,600
I'll be okay, but...
Who are you?

279
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,433
Oh no! She saw us transform!

280
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,766
Well uh... See it's kinda
complicated.

281
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,166
I am a Guardian of Justice.
I am Sailor Chibi Moon!

282
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:50,600
Chibi‐Usa!

283
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,466
We're all Sailor Guardians.

284
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,466
We fight for love
and justice, and we

285
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,833
protect the innocent.

286
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,433
Ah, yeah. It's true, but
also not true. It's

287
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:01,233
more of a metaphor.

288
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,333
You're hurt.

289
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,866
Oh! I didn't notice.

290
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,866
Who's there?!

291
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:33,700
Maybe the battles not over.

292
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,900
Did you see that?

293
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,666
It almost looks like
they're...

294
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,666
Wait! Come back! Who are
you? Are you two our

295
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,733
enemies? Or our friends?

296
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,533
Next time, "Act.28
Infinity 2, Ripples."

297
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:41,466
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
