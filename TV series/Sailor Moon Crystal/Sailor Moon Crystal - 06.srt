1
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,020
That is the Moon Stick.
It's yours now.

2
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,030
Oh...

3
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,160
It's very powerful.
It will help you
in battle.

4
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,130
[battle cries]

5
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,100
Find the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

6
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,060
[gasp]

7
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,030
That same dream again.

8
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,160
Someone is calling
to me from my dreams.

9
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,210
Who are you?

10
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,200
And why do you need me
to find The Legendary
Silver Crystal?

11
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,080
Ah! Ami! Mako!
Good morning!

12
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,200
Good morning to
you too, Usagi!

13
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,040
Atta girl. You
didn't oversleep.

14
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,070
I've been having a lot
of weird dreams lately.

15
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,130
I wake up and then I
can't go back to sleep.

16
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,050
Recently it's been the
same dream over and over
again every night.

17
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,190
Who are you
mystery man?

18
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,040
Agh!

19
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,050
Owie!

20
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,120
Are you alright?

21
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,170
[gasp]

22
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,120
Not you again!

23
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,210
Bun-head? You should really
learn to watch where you're
going. You could get hurt.

24
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,090
Same to you, pal!

25
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,120
No thank you!

26
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,120
[gasp]

27
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,130
Take care of
yourself.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,060
Who's that?

29
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,170
Uh, I don't know! I
just keep bumping
into him!

30
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,000
Usagi, your face is
red. Are you okay?

31
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,230
Oh! You're
blushing!

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,060
No, I'm not!
It's hot today!

33
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,220
That shirt...

34
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,170
I recognize that uniform.
It's from Moto-Azabu, the
very elite private high

35
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,140
school. Are you sure
you don't know him?

36
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,100
I know his name. It's
Mamoru Chiba and he's
always mean to me.

37
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,180
Aha! So you do
know him?

38
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,060
Oh! It's not what
you're thinking!

39
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,220
Usagi, Mako!

40
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,080
Hm?

41
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,160
Look there.

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,180
This mysterious person,
calling himself Tuxedo
Mask, has made a statement

43
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,140
to the media.

44
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,100
He claims to have committed
numerous offenses, and says
he did it in order to obtain

45
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,000
a lost treasure called
"The Legendary Silver
Crystal."

46
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,080
Hey, did you guys
see the news?

47
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,170
Yeah, about that
Tuxedo Mask guy?

48
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,070
What was that treasure
he wanted?

49
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,090
The Legendary Silver
Crystal. They say it's
priceless and it's somewhere

50
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,210
here in Japan.

51
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,190
They're doing a special
news report about it on
TV tonight. Might be

52
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,090
worth checking out.

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,150
Really? That's
a pretty big deal.

54
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,110
Oh...

55
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,190
Tuxedo Mask. What
are you up to this
time?

56
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,200
Tuxedo Mask?

57
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,110
What is the Legendary
Silver Crystal?

58
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,010
[chattering]

59
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,160
This should flush out
some more information.

60
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,220
I will find the Legendary
Silver Crystal. I don't
care what it costs me.

61
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,000
There have long been rumors
of The Legendary Silver
Crystal, but its existence

62
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,230
has yet to be officially
confirmed. Stay tuned.

63
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,010
We'll have expert analysis
right after the break.

64
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,170
[chuckling]

65
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,210
Now the Sailor Guardians,
Tuxedo Mask, and the humans
are all searching for the

66
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,080
Legendary Silver Crystal.

67
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,090
How very amusing.

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,000
Do not laugh, Kunzite.
This is no joke.

69
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,100
The Legendary Silver
Crystal rightfully belongs
to the Dark Kingdom. Yet

70
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,030
thus far you have failed
to obtain both it and

71
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,140
sufficient energy for
our Great Ruler.

72
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,160
Queen Beryl, I beg of
you, give me one more
chance!

73
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,050
But Nephrite...

74
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,180
You are injured. You
underestimated the
Sailor Guardians.

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,130
Sailor Jupiter...
You will pay.

76
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,000
Allow me, Queen Beryl.
Nephrite has failed you,
but I, Zoisite, will not.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,100
Hmph!

78
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,150
This is a good thing. I
shall be able to exploit
this turn of events for

79
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,200
our gain, and get you
everything you seek.

80
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,110
This has turned
into a huge mess.

81
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,010
It's a trap. It has
to be. Right Luna?

82
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,170
Could this mean danger
for our Princess, too?
Shouldn't we do something?

83
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,020
I don't know. I never
imagined anything like
this.

84
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,140
Tuxedo Mask, I didn't
think he was our enemy,
but...

85
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,190
[gasp]

86
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,120
Luna, do you have any
idea who our enemies
might be?

87
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,140
Or where the princess is?

88
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,180
I've been doing a lot
of research. I have a
few hunches but I don't

89
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,100
know for sure.

90
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,130
If a certain evil being
should awaken and gain
the power of the Crystal,

91
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,220
it could mean the
end of the world.

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Can the Legendary Silver
Crystal really destroy
the entire world?

93
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,180
It is that powerful.

94
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,230
Depending on how it's used,
it could blow up a whole
planet, easily.

95
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,220
[shocked gasp]

96
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,180
Is that really our mission
as Guardians? To find and
protect something so

97
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,170
potentially dangerous?

98
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,140
Yes.

99
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,140
I have told you about The
Legendary Silver Crystal and
the princess from the Moon.

100
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,190
I have faith in all of
you that you will find
them.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,140
But you must do it soon.
They need your protection.
That is your fate.

102
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,110
It is your destiny.
Why you were made
Sailor Guardians.

103
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,110
And it's also why I came
here and awakened all of
you. I was sent here from

104
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,130
the Moon to do so.

105
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,140
The missing princess
we're searching for
is from the Moon?

106
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,000
Someone from the Moon
sent you here?

107
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,220
They sent you...
to awaken us?

108
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,110
Luna, you're from
the Moon?

109
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,140
You will all understand
more once you've awakened
fully. Right now I must

110
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,170
learn more about who
our main enemy is.

111
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,110
And I need to continue
my investigation of
Tuxedo Mask, as well.

112
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,030
The power to blow up a
whole planet? A royal
princess from the moon?

113
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,020
I don't believe it.

114
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,130
Huh? That looks like
the Moon Stick Luna
gave me.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't be afraid. You
can do it. You're
Sailor Moon.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,467
[gasp]

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
Uh...

118
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,030
Did Sailor V really
just talk right now?
Or did I imagine it?

119
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,210
Usagi? Is something
wrong?

120
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,130
Oh! No, it's nothing.

121
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,170
But tell me, is Sailor
V a Guardian of
Justice, too?

122
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,000
Huh?

123
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,020
It's possible. She
could be a Sailor
Guardian like we are.

124
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,070
Or she could be
just a regular girl.

125
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,010
The papers used to run
stories on her all the
time. But lately I haven't

126
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,000
heard anything. It's
like she's dropped
out of sight.

127
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,220
Welcome! Today's program
will feature a new topic:
The Legendary Silver Crystal.

128
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,040
Educating us about this
mysterious treasure,
is today's guest,

129
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,200
Professor Izono.

130
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,170
Thank you. It's a
pleasure to be here.

131
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,030
The Legendary Silver
Crystal has both

132
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,210
amazing and terrifying
magical powers.

133
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,210
It can grant immortality
or cause massive destruction.

134
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,210
So we need everyone's help to
find it as soon as possible.

135
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,020
Everyone watching this
broadcast right now
must search for it!

136
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,060
[dazed sigh]

137
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,190
I'm home, Mom!

138
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,040
I can't find it.

139
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,000
It's not here. Or here.

140
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,010
Or here. I can't find
it anywhere. Where
could it be?

141
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,150
The Legendary
Silver Crystal...

142
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,010
Mom?!

143
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,466
Where is it?

144
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:55,220
What's wrong?

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,020
What's going on,
Mom? Answer me!

146
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,220
It's not here.
I can't find it.

147
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,220
It's likely hidden somewhere
very unusual. So check
everywhere! leave no

148
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,020
stone unturned!

149
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,000
Ami!

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,180
Ami, can you
hear me?

151
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,210
Yeah! Things are getting
really bad out here!

152
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,030
Where's the Legendary
Silver Crystal?!

153
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,000
What's happened
to everyone?

154
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,000
Something evil must
be controlling them!

155
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,230
Alright girls! Let's
meet up at the arcade!

156
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,030
Ah...

157
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,210
[gasps]

158
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,070
Ooh...

159
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,080
Luna, what is
this place?

160
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,190
No way!

161
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,050
A secret base!
Awesome!

162
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,210
I needed a place to
do research, investigate
our enemies.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Huh...

164
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,020
The evil energy is
concentrating in
one spot.

165
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,040
[gasp]

166
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,050
The TV station?

167
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,230
Luna, someone must be
using the broadcast signal
to transmit some sort of

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,190
mind control.

169
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
I underestimated him.

170
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,070
I never thought Tuxedo
Mask would do something
like this.

171
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,040
He isn't the
one doing this!

172
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
Huh?

173
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,020
Tuxedo Mask is always
coming to my rescue.
He isn't our enemy.

174
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,010
He's always there for
me. It's like he knows
me!

175
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,190
Usagi... It almost sounds
like you've fallen in
love with him.

176
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,080
Uh...

177
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,110
Think carefully, Usagi.

178
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,040
Are you sure about him?

179
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,010
He could just be using
you to get to the Crystal.

180
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,100
You're all wrong!
You don't understand!

181
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,190
Usagi...

182
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,020
Who are you, Tuxedo
Mask? And why do you
keep saving me all the

183
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,230
time? It's not true.

184
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,090
You're not my enemy.
You can't be!

185
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,210
These human beings
are pathetic.

186
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,100
None of them have been
able to find The Legendary
Silver Crystal.

187
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,050
They're of no
use to me!

188
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,130
[chuckling]

189
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,090
I'll take their energy
though, drain them of
every last drop.

190
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,220
Oh no you won't!

191
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,100
The Sailor Guardians.

192
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,020
I was expecting you.

193
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Such evil energy.
Reveal yourself!

194
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,130
It's Zoisite!

195
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,220
Your plan didn't work!
We stopped the signal
in time!

196
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,180
Guardians! Let's
transform!

197
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,180
Mercury Power
Make Up!

198
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,230
Mars Power
Make Up!

199
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,200
Jupiter Power
Make Up!

200
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,110
[struggling breaths]

201
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,210
What's the matter with
me? I feel so weak and
dizzy.

202
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,130
[gasp]

203
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,210
Tuxedo Mask...

204
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,100
Are you all right?

205
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,080
So warm...

206
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,010
Huh?

208
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,130
I was too rash and
impulsive. This giant
mess is my fault.

209
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,000
You mean, it
was you?

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,220
I started it. But
this isn't my doing.

211
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,140
Please believe me.

212
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,050
I do believe you.

213
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
[chuckle]

214
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,070
The Silver Crystal,
I must find it. I
need to.

215
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,140
But, I didn't have any
information.

216
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,120
And I don't have special
powers to help me.

217
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,140
I know how you feel.

218
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,090
Even though I'm the
leader, I don't feel
like it. I'm powerless.

219
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,090
It's my job to protect
everyone but I can't.

220
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,030
I guess all we can
do is try harder.

221
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,020
Oh no...

222
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,140
[grunting]

223
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,150
Hah!

224
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,140
[grunting]

225
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,220
Surrender. Now!

226
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,060
You stole people's
energy! How dare you!

227
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,020
Give it back or pay!

228
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,040
Don't underestimate me.

229
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,160
[gasp]

230
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,020
[screaming]

231
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,060
[evil laughter]

232
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,070
This is the most evil
aura I have ever felt.

233
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,150
Is that...

234
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,030
Our enemy?

235
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,110
[gasp]

236
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,070
Sailor Guardians...

237
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:45,090
My name is Queen Beryl. I
command the Four Kings of
the Dark Kingdom. And I

238
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,130
have sent them to obtain
the Legendary Silver Crystal.

239
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,100
Once I secure it, the
Dark Kingdom will rise
again.

240
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,110
Then every human being
on Earth, shall perish.

241
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,060
[struggling breaths]

242
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,160
I can't move!
She's too strong!

243
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,120
We're no match for
her incredible power.

244
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,120
We need you, Sailor
Moon! Help us!

245
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,000
Come on, Usagi.
Where are you?

246
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,090
I've gotta transform.
The others need me!

247
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,190
But I can't change into
Sailor Moon in front of
Tuxedo Mask.

248
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,130
[gasp]

249
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,010
Well, Sailor Moon, what
are you waiting for?
Hurry! Transform!

250
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,090
You knew then, all this
time, that I was Sailor
Moon?

251
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,020
Only you can save them.
You're their last hope.

252
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,070
But how? I can't summon
mist or fire or lightning
like the others can.

253
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,040
I'm just a big crybaby.

254
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,170
And without Luna
I'm totally useless!

255
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,170
[gasp]

256
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,070
Your power is very
special. You open
people's hearts.

257
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,140
You saw the other Guardians
for who they really were and
brought out the best in them.

258
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,180
You made them smile.

259
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:18,130
In my book, that makes
you the best one to
lead them. So...

260
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,210
He took my hand again.

261
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,210
I feel stronger like I
did before. Like I can
do anything!

262
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,140
Usagi!

263
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,100
There's no time
to waste!

264
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,030
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

265
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,220
I am the Pretty
Guardian, who fights
for love and for justice!

266
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,080
I am Sailor Moon!

267
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,060
And now in the name
of the Moon, I'll
punish you!

268
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,150
Sailor Moon!

269
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,220
Sailor Moon, you're too
late. Kneel before my
awesome power.

270
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,080
I am not going
to give up...

271
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,130
I may be a crybaby...
and a bit of a klutz
too...

272
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,090
Don't be afraid. You can
do it, you're Sailor Moon.

273
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:26,190
But I am Sailor Moon. I
am the leader! So, please
Moon Stick, help me save them!

274
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,060
What?

275
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,070
Sailor Moon, do it!

276
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,230
Moon Healing
Escalation!

277
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,050
[screaming]

278
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
The evil aura
is weakening...

279
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,160
She did it! Usagi
saved us all!

280
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,100
Mark my words, you
will pay for this.

281
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,000
Usagi...

282
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,220
[exhausted breaths]

283
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,120
Sailor Moon...

284
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,160
[chuckle]

285
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:36,080
You completely wore
yourself out. But
you did it. Thank you.

286
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,150
I feel so safe and warm
in his arms. Some of my
strength is already returning.

287
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,130
I think I've been carried
like this before... This
embrace feels so familiar.

288
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:10,000
That dream I've been
having... It's always the
same. A man's voice calling

289
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,180
out to me. But whose
voice is it?

290
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,090
And where, am I?

291
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,200
A pocket watch that
shows the phases of the
moon, but it's broken.

292
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,100
I wonder whose it is.

293
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,180
Could it belong
to Tuxedo Mask?

294
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,200
You're finally awake.

295
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,160
[gasp]

296
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,120
Is that you?
Tuxedo Mask...

297
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,160
I was in a car accident
on my sixth birthday. My
parents died and I lost

298
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,010
all of my memories.

299
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,050
I don't even know
who I really am.

300
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,190
That's awful.

301
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,170
I have a recurring dream
where someone implores me
to find the Legendary

302
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,110
Silver Crystal."That's
my only clue.

303
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,030
Is that all you
want? To regain
your memories?

304
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,210
No, my true wish is...

305
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,040
Act. 7 Mamoru Chiba,
Tuxedo Mask.

306
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,230
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
