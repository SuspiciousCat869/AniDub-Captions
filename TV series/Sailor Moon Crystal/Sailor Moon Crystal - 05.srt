1
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,080
I wonder when it's
gonna stop raining.

2
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,050
[yawning]

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,040
Try to be a little more
alert, Usagi. You don't
pay any attention to your

4
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,180
surroundings whatsoever.

5
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,090
Hm? Which means?

6
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,110
You need to keep your
guard up and be ready
to face danger at a

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,180
moment's notice!

8
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,050
How am I supposed to
do that? And besides
Luna, I've noticed

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,030
you've put on a
little weight lately.

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,120
Is that how you keep
your guard up?

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,020
Usagi!

12
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,010
It's dangerous. You
should be careful.

13
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,080
Yeah... Thanks.

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,050
Usagi, are you okay?

15
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,160
Her perfume, it
smelled really nice.

16
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,200
Curse those meddling
Sailor Guardians!

17
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,060
Not only have we failed
to obtain the Legendary
Silver Crystal, but we

18
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,110
haven't gathered enough
energy for out Great
Ruler either!

19
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,220
Let me try again. I've
learned their weakness,
I can defeat them my Queen.

20
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,130
Does that mean you
have a plan, Nephrite?

21
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,140
Yes, I shall gather energy
and beat the Sailor Guardians
by exploiting humanity's

22
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,160
greatest mortal flaw... Love.

23
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,100
Hmph!

24
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,120
You look so
beautiful, Naru!

25
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,100
[giggling]

26
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,090
My cousin's getting
married this summer.

27
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,200
She and her fiancé
couldn't make the

28
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,150
wedding dress fitting,
so since I'm about her
size, I went for her.

29
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,040
Where did you
take this?

30
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,100
It was at the bridal
shop near the entrance
to the shopping district.

31
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,190
Do you know it?

32
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,190
I heard that some of
the grooms-to-be who
visited that shop with

33
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,160
their girlfriends
vanished off the
face of the earth.

34
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,190
Maybe your cousin's
fiancé will go
missing too.

35
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,220
Umino! What a terrible
thing to say!

36
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,080
Yeah! Shut up!

37
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,100
Well they're getting
married in June and they
say marriages that month

38
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,150
are supposed to be lucky.

39
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
Then they'll be
happy for sure!

40
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,060
Oh! She's a June Bride!

41
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,110
[giggling]

42
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,220
Awww!

43
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,110
I can't wait to
get married!

44
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,130
And wear a beautiful
wedding dress!

45
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,160
A white one with-

46
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,180
You should be careful.

47
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,090
Whoa! The new girl
looks tough.

48
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,110
Hey!

49
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,160
Why aren't you wearing
this school's uniform?

50
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,190
Because the sizes here
are all too small for
me, that's why.

51
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,210
So that's the new girl
who just transferred
into Class 6 today.

52
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,190
They say she's got
superhuman strength,
and that she got kicked

53
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,150
out of her last school.
Supposedly for picking
fights.

54
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,150
Oh.

55
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,120
She does look kinda
scary, doesn't she.

56
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,180
She didn't seem
that way to me.

57
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,050
Uh...

58
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,000
So, that's how
it's gonna be.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
I heard she's some
kind of amazon.

60
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,110
No way. Scary.

61
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,000
I got it!

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,000
Lunch time! Lunch time!
What's in the box today?
I hop-

63
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,120
It's that transfer
student...

64
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,030
Whoa! Her lunchbox
is super cute!

65
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,000
[giggle]

66
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,200
Wow! That looks yummy!

67
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,130
[gasp]

68
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,010
[gasp]

69
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,477
Huh?

70
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,070
Hey!

71
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,130
Be a little more
careful next time!

72
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,100
Huh?

73
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,100
Uh... Thanks!

74
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,020
Oh! It's you again!

75
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,190
I heard she's some
kind of Amazon...

76
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,100
You shouldn't zone
out like that. You
could get hurt.

77
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,010
Um, tell me, does
it taste as good
as it looks?

78
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,210
Uh... Yeah...

79
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,090
Oh...

80
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,140
Here. Would you like
to have some too?

81
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,010
Yeah! You sure?

82
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,180
But it's your lunch,
I really shouldn't...
Oh! But maybe just one!

83
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,210
Bon appetit!

84
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,180
This is as delicious
as it looks!

85
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,230
It's no big deal
They're easy to
make.

86
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,190
What?! You mean you
made this yourself?

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,220
Yeah.

88
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,220
That's so cool! How
did you learn to
make all that?

89
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,120
And your lunch box and
matching bag are both
totally adorable too!

90
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,180
Where did you buy
them? What store
was it?

91
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,140
Oh, I just found
this lunch box at
my old house.

92
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,160
And so I decided to
make a bag to go with
it.

93
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,010
Amazing!

94
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,230
That's really
impressive!

95
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,200
It's just a
little bag.

96
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,190
And also...

97
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,190
Your rose earrings
are really lovely.

98
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,210
Oh. Why thank you.

99
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,120
[giggling]

100
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,190
What on earth was that?

101
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,230
My mom would be so surprised
to hear that you make your
own lunches.

102
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,230
I can barely cook at all.

103
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,050
Uh, since I'm new here
and living on my own
do you think you could

104
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,200
tell me a bit about
this town?

105
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,190
Huh?

106
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,210
Everyone else is too
afraid to talk to me.

107
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,120
They won't even look
me in the eye.

108
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,110
[laughing]

109
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,010
Scared of a pretty girl
with cute earrings and
perfume?

110
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,190
That's ridiculous!

111
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,050
I'd be happy to tell you
whatever you might want
to know about town.

112
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,200
Ask me anything!

113
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,130
Well in that case, can
you tell me where to find
a discount supermarket,

114
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,010
a place to buy cute
accessories... Oh!

115
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,170
And an arcade, too!

116
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,140
What? An arcade?

117
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,190
Wow! You're really
good at this!

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You sure you've never
played this game before?

119
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,040
It's the same as
fighting in real life.

120
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,070
You let the bad guy chase
you so you can catch him
off guard, then you hit him

121
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,140
with your ultimate attack!

122
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,040
Ultimate attack!

123
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,220
Hi Usagi! You're
here early today.

124
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,170
Oh! Hi, Ami!

125
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,230
That girl is good.
She's mastered the
game already.

126
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,080
Have you met the new
girl yet? She just
transferred into

127
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,010
Class 6 today.

128
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,200
I'm Makoto Kino.

129
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:13,050
I'm Ami Mizuno. I go
to Juban, too. It's so
nice to meet you.

130
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,130
Nice to meet you too!

131
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,130
Hey Usagi! So are all
the girls you're friends
with cute?

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,070
I don't think
we've met.

133
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,000
It's... you...

134
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,220
Oh! Nothing! I thought
you were someone else.

135
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,130
Hm?

136
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,220
I'm Motoki Furuhata.
I work here part-time.

137
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,030
Hey, does everybody
usually call you
Motoki like I do?

138
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,130
Well my college friends
call me "Furu".

139
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,040
Furu? Huh?

140
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,140
Hey!

141
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,220
That gives me an idea!
I'll call you "Mako"!

142
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,220
Makoto is now Mako, the
strong and careful chef!

143
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,060
I've never had a friend
give me a nickname before.
I like it.

144
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,140
[giggle]

145
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,080
You really are something,
Usagi. You've got such a
big heart.

146
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,000
You can make
friends with anyone.

147
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,160
So do you guys
want to hear a
weird rumor I heard

148
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,030
from a customer
the other day?

149
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,200
A rumor?

150
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,040
Well this is the bridal
shop he was talking about.

151
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,040
It's also the same one
Naru went to, I think.

152
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,040
Hm? Where's Mako?

153
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,040
So gorgeous. I wish
I could wear a dress
like that.

154
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,090
I think you'd look
great in that dress.

155
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,200
Hm?

156
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,100
Yeah. You're so tall and
statuesque. A strapless
dress would suit you.

157
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,010
You think so?

158
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,190
Ah! When I get married
I'm going to wear a

159
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,150
wedding dress
just like these!

160
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,090
Yeah? I think I'd prefer
a white wedding kimono.

161
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,230
What about you, Mako?

162
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,080
Uh? Well I...

163
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,040
I guess I'd wear
whichever kind of dress
my fiancé liked best.

164
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,040
Mako, you are
too cute!

165
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, I'd just
like to match him.

166
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,040
Such an old-
fashioned girlie
girl!

167
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,060
Okay, cut it out
Usagi. Quit teasing
me.

168
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey, isn't this the
bridal shop that's
supposed to be haunted?

169
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,010
You mean the one
with the ghost bride?
Yeah I think it is.

170
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,210
Huh? Ghost bride?

171
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,190
Hm?

172
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,110
Rumor has it that one of
the mannequins comes to
life at night and seduces

173
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,000
men. They say a lot of
grooms-to-be have gone

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,210
missing after visiting
here with their fiancés.

175
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,230
Ooh, that's so creepy.

176
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,180
Hi Rei!

177
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,190
Oh hi, Usagi.

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
Stop worrying, Usagi.

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,000
There's no scientific
proof that ghosts
are real.

180
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,050
You really don't
think there's a
ghost at all?

181
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,160
I don't care what it
is. If a weak man allows
himself to be seduced

182
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,090
it's his own fault.

183
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,040
I think all men are
fools. I don't trust
them.

184
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,000
[nervous laugh]

185
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay...

186
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,060
All of it sounds too
complicated for me.

187
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,190
I'm gonna go
home! See ya!

188
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,030
Oh. Bye.

189
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,210
I get the feeling
this isn't the last
we'll be seeing of her.

190
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,180
Yeah, I think you may
be right about that.

191
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,230
Please, please I beg
you! Let my fiancé
come back to me.

192
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,050
[sobbing]

193
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,010
Don't cry, dear. The
ghost bride is just
an urban legend.

194
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,220
He hasn't been
kidnapped.

195
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,080
He'll turn up soon.
You'll see.

196
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,050
We definitely need to
investigate this.

197
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,050
Okay. All locked up.

198
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,040
Is that a bride?

199
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,070
Yes. Gaze into my
eyes and become
my slave.

200
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,180
[gasp]

201
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,100
Give me all your
energy. Pour out
your love.

202
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,010
You're...
so beautiful.

203
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,120
It's getting late.
I should hurry.

204
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,210
So are you gonna come
to my game this Sunday?

205
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,150
[giggle]

206
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,150
Sure, I'll make
you lunch.

207
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,210
A huge bento that
we can both eat
afterwards.

208
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,210
Kino...

209
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,000
[sigh]

210
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,230
Of course that wasn't
him in the arcade.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,020
That guy there just
reminds me of him.

212
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,020
[giggle]

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,230
There you are, Mako.

214
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,230
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

215
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,030
[gasp]

216
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,040
Look into my eyes.

217
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,150
Oh...

218
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,010
I love you.

219
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,497
[gasp]

220
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,100
An evil aura...

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,170
This way. Hurry!

222
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,220
Over here!

223
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,090
Who's there?
Where are you?

224
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,010
Huh?

225
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,170
Tuxedo Mask...

226
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,100
Am I still dreaming?

227
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,000
[gasp]

228
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,080
Usagi?

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,010
Oh no!

230
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,190
Rei! Ami! Can you
hear me? Usagi's
in trouble!

231
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,180
Where are you going?

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
Tuxedo Mask, where
are you taking me?

233
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,120
[gasp]

234
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,010
Motoki! Mako!

235
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,020
What's that weird
green light?

236
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,090
Usagi!

237
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,080
[evil laughter]

238
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,538
[gasp]

239
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,170
Is that?

240
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,120
The ghost bride?!

241
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,160
[evil laugh]

242
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,090
That's it. Pour
out all of your
energy!

243
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,090
Sacrifice yourselves
to our Great Ruler!

244
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,000
The rumors were wrong!
That's not a ghost!
It's a Monster!

245
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,090
Are friends are in
trouble! We have
to save them!

246
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,180
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

247
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,130
Mercury Power
Make Up!

248
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,190
Mars Power
Make Up!

249
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,020
How dare you pretend to
be a blushing bride and
take advantage of innocent

250
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,150
people who are in love!

251
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,150
I am the Pretty Guardian!

252
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,030
Who fights for love
and for justice!

253
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,130
I am Sailor Moon!

254
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,230
And now in the name
of the Moon, I'll
punish you!

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,130
I was expecting you
Sailor Guardians!

256
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,110
What is this? I
can't see anything!

257
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,220
I've got her.
Leave it to me!

258
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,180
Evil Spirit, be gone!

259
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,180
Where'd she go?

260
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,140
There! Next to Mako!

261
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,030
[gasp]

262
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,140
Mako!

263
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,100
No one moves! Or
I kill the girl.

264
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,100
[gasps]

265
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,110
[chuckling]

266
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,110
So he's the one
behind all this!

267
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,130
Hmph! Pathetic humans.
You are so easily deceived
by appearances!

268
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,140
Appearances?

269
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,180
What happened?

270
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,040
Hey! Wait up! Are
you on your way
home?

271
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,030
Huh? Oh, hey
there Kino.

272
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,200
I thought we could
walk home together.

273
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,200
Didn't I tell ya?
I have a girlfriend
now.

274
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,070
Hm...

275
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,230
So yeah, I'm gonna
walk home with her
from now on.

276
00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:00,230
Sorry, Kino! See ya!

277
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,010
Was it... all a lie?

278
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,060
That girl, she's
still conscious?

279
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,170
Motoki, he looks like
the boy I loved. He
told me that he loved

280
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,030
me... But it was a lie.

281
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,200
Ridiculous humans. So
obsessed with trivial
emotions.

282
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,230
Why can't they
just face the truth?

283
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
I heard she's some
kind of Amazon.

284
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,070
Who am I kidding?

285
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,010
They'll never see
me as anything
else.

286
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,160
How could you ever
believe anyone would
love you?

287
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,160
I was a fool to
believe in love.
He never loved me.

288
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,070
Love isn't real. I
don't believe in
anything anymore.

289
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,230
Don't say that, Mako!

290
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,538
[gasp]

291
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,220
To love another
person isn't wrong!

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,080
Usagi... You're...

293
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,180
I believe in love. I
believe we each have
a soul mate that we're

294
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,030
destined to be with.

295
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,050
I believe I will
find that person.

296
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,130
The one that's meant
for me, that I'll love
with my whole heart!

297
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,010
There's someone out
there for you too,
Mako. I know there is!

298
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,080
So please, don't
stop believing!

299
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,000
Believe in love!

300
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,040
Love can conquer
anything!

301
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,060
Thank you, Usagi!

302
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,190
Agh! Fine then, Sailor
Guardians! Believe in
love all you want,

303
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,210
Let it be the
death of you!

304
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:16,487
[gasp]

305
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,070
[screaming]

306
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,070
[grunting]

307
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,435
Oh no!

308
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:24,130
[chuckling]

309
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,210
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this.

310
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,150
[gasp]

311
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,060
I will show you...

312
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,180
How powerful
love can be!

313
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,140
How did-?!

314
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,160
If you want to try and
use love to defeat me,
then bring it on!

315
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,200
That vision...

316
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,170
I knew it!

317
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,050
[gasp]

318
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,497
Hm!

319
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,140
Jupiter Power
Make Up!

320
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:32,080
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for courage!

321
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,200
I am Sailor Jupiter!

322
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,190
I'll fill you with
regret, it'll leave
you numb!

323
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,140
Mako!

324
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,190
Damn it! Not another
one! You're a Sailor
Guardian too?

325
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,230
No one can defeat
the power of love!

326
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,030
Flower Hurricane!

327
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,210
What the hell is this?

328
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,080
I can't move.

329
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,050
That look in her
eyes... Do I know it?

330
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,110
Jupiter, my guardian
planet! Bring forth
a storm!

331
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
And bring down
your thunder!

332
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,220
Jupiter Thunderbolt!

333
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,040
[screaming]

334
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,080
Sailor Jupiter...

335
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,070
Mako!

336
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
[groaning]

337
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,180
Is this a mannequin?

338
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,210
What the- Why am I
sleeping on the
sidewalk?

339
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,050
Tuxedo Mask, did he lead
Usagi here so that she
could save everyone?

340
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,210
I fell in love with a
senior who broke my
heart. After that it

341
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,010
was painful to be at the
same school with him.

342
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,040
I'm so sorry.

343
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,210
But, that's not why I
transferred. He's not
the reason I came here.

344
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,170
It felt like something
more important than
love was calling me here.

345
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,190
Like there was a
whisper on the
night wind.

346
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,120
And it told me I
needed to come here.

347
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,090
Good for you. Life's
too short to waste
it moping over some guy.

348
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,110
I'm glad. Because now
we get to have you
as one of us.

349
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,130
She's right. We're
happy to have you,
Sailor Jupiter.

350
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,200
You are our ally,
guardian of thunder
and courage.

351
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,060
Sailor Jupiter...

352
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,070
I remember now. That's
who I really am. And I
know that there's a

353
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,060
mission I have
to carry out!

354
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,040
Huh?

355
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,020
Luna?

356
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,120
There are four Sailor
Guardians now.

357
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,090
Sailor Moon, you must
now take your place as
leader of our mission

358
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,220
to find the Legendary
Silver Crystal and
the Princess!

359
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,100
You want me to
be the leader?

360
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,140
Wait, what did
Tuxedo Mask
confess to?

361
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,230
He claims some of the
robberies were his doing
because he was looking for

362
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,070
the Legendary Silver Crystal.

363
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,000
He's definitely up to
something. Usagi, I'd
stay away from him if

364
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,080
I were you.

365
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,030
Tuxedo Mask, are you a
friend? Or are you...
an enemy?

366
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,030
Act. 6: Tuxedo Mask

367
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,060
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
