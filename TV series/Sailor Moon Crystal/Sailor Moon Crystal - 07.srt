1
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,130
So where am I? What
is this place?

2
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,040
You're in my apartment.

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,090
I remember, I used the
Moon Stick and Moon
Healing Escalation for

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,050
the first time, and
then I'm not sure...

5
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,060
[gasp]

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,090
After the battle you passed
out. You fell into a deep
sleep. I couldn't wake you.

7
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,010
Do you remember?

8
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,090
Yes. I do now.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,150
I can't believe I
never noticed before.

10
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,100
The low tone of voice
and the tuxedo tie...

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,140
And those eyes that I
can't seem to look
away from...

12
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,050
I see it now, you
are Tuxedo Mask.

13
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,200
Why did you become
Tuxedo Mask in the
first place?

14
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,090
I did it so that I could
find my lost memories.

15
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,070
They're gone. And I need
the Legendary Silver

16
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,170
Crystal in order
to get them back.

17
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,050
Your memories?

18
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,180
Yes.

19
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,160
Dad! Mom! C'mon
let's go for a
drive!

20
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,150
Ahh!

21
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,110
Sadly, neither Mr. or Mrs.
Chiba survived. Only their

22
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,080
son, Mamoru, managed
to pull through.

23
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,120
However...

24
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,060
Who... Who am I?
What am I doing here?

25
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,140
Oh no...

26
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,090
On my sixth birthday, my
parents died in a car
accident. And I lost all

27
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,150
my memories. I couldn't
even recognize my own name.

28
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,000
They had to tell me what
it was. Who I was...

29
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,220
"Mamoru Chiba", is
that who I really am?

30
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,140
I don't know. I could
be someone else entirely.

31
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,080
That's how I've felt for
years, but then I started
having this dream.

32
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,010
"Find the Legendary Silver
Crystal", that's all she

33
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,160
says, and that's the
only thing I know.

34
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,190
Before I knew it, I
was roaming the streets
at night, like a

35
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,160
sleepwalker on a mission.

36
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,190
I needed to find the
Crystal. It was the only

37
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,140
clue I had to my
lost memories.

38
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,130
So? What about you?

39
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,120
Huh?

40
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,110
The Crystal. Aren't you
and the Sailor Guardians
looking for it too?

41
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,020
How come?

42
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,230
Oh, well I...
I don't know why.

43
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,080
Luna didn't give a reason.

44
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,160
She just told us to find
the Silver Crystal and
protect it.

45
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,230
I see...

46
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,140
His eyes look so sad...

47
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,080
If it's alright with you,
can we keep this a secret
between the two of us?

48
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,230
I appreciate it.

49
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,110
Something just between
us... A secret.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,210
He could just be using
you to get to the Crystal.

51
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,110
I know him. He's not my
enemy. I trust him.

52
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,000
I wish I could stop time
at this very moment.

53
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:38,100
And that it would
stand still forever.

54
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,010
I-I'm sorry.

55
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,200
Everyone must be worried
sick about me by now.
I should go.

56
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,210
Usako...

57
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,020
[sigh]

58
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,200
Your bag...

59
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,210
Mm-hm.

60
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,210
Usako...

61
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,180
He's Mamoru, so I guess
I'll call him "Mamo".

62
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
So you've found all four
Guardians, but they haven't
regained all their memories

63
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,190
from their past lives yet?

64
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,110
I'm afraid not.

65
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,180
Sailor Moon in particular
is still having a lot of
trouble, unfortunately.

66
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,000
I think she needs
some more time.

67
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,170
Time's a luxury
we don't have.

68
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,220
But I don't think-

69
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,050
The enemy will
be upon us soon.

70
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,050
[gasp]

71
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,190
O Great Ruler, Queen
Metalia! Your humble
servant awaits!

72
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,160
[moaning]

73
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,000
I offer this energy from
the humans. May it revive
you, Great One.

74
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,070
[moaning]

75
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,170
Human energy alone is not
enough to revive me.

76
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,000
Where is the Legendary
Silver Crystal?

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,180
My apologies, O Great
Queen Metalia. The Sailor
Guardians have appeared

78
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,120
and they're thwarting
our efforts.

79
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,030
Sailor Guardians? As in
the ones who defeated me

80
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,180
in ancient times
and sealed me away?

81
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,140
Yes...

82
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,150
And I'm afraid that
it may be worse.

83
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,060
It's possible they already
possess the Crystal.

84
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,130
Do not allow that! The
descendant of the putrid

85
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,150
Moon Kingdom must
never fully awaken!

86
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,010
Yes, O' Great Ruler!

87
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,000
Crush them and get me
the Legendary Silver
Crystal!

88
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:06,210
This time not just the
planet, but the entire
universe will be mine!

89
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,140
Once Queen Metalia fully
revives, she may indeed

90
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,040
devour the whole
world and beyond.

91
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,020
But there's no
turning back.

92
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,170
Not since that fateful
day when I first stumbled
upon D-point.

93
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,180
It was as if some force
had drawn me there and

94
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,170
wanted me to discover
the Dark Kingdom.

95
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,010
With my own hands I broke
the seal, and freed Queen

96
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,050
Metalia from her
ancient prison!

97
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,220
It may have been my destiny
to release her. But when it
comes to the Legendary Silver

98
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,050
Crystal, I won't hand
it over so easily!

99
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,220
I shall keep the
Legendary Silver
Crystal for myself.

100
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,180
Then the entire planet
will be mine for the
taking!

101
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,090
Come Zoisite!

102
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,220
Yes, my Queen!

103
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,170
Your wounds are healing
nicely. So I have a new
task for you. I believe

104
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,140
Sailor Moon could be the
key to the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

105
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,040
I understand,
my Queen.

106
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,180
Hm...

107
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,220
Huh?

108
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,210
Yumiko! Kuri!
Over here!

109
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,140
Huh?

110
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,060
Did you come to
rent movies too?

111
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,220
Uh huh. Lately I've been
kind of hooked on romance
movies.

112
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,220
I can't make
up my mind.

113
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,060
Hm?

114
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,220
Seriously! There's
too many to choose
from!

115
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,090
I know. That's why this
store's so popular. They
have everything!

116
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,200
I've gotta watch the
movies. I've gotta
watch the movies.

117
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,170
Gotta watch the movies.

118
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,140
Uh...

119
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,220
Sailor Moon
has it, right?

120
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,180
I'm going to be the
first one to catch her!

121
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't like this.

122
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,190
It's so good.

123
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,230
These homemade sandwiches
you brought are the best,
Mako!

124
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,040
Well there's plenty
more. So eat all
you want.

125
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,190
All right!

126
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,090
[giggling]

127
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,090
Here Ami.
Want one?

128
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,030
Oh, I'm fine.
Thanks.

129
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,020
Oh. Huh?

130
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,030
Is that Sailor V?

131
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,230
Well you mentioned her
before. So I thought I'd
do a little research.

132
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,100
Look! She has a crescent-
shaped mark on her forehead!

133
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,080
It looks just like Luna's
mark. So maybe it means

134
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,090
that she's from the
Moon Kingdom too.

135
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,220
Hmm...

136
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,517
Huh?

137
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:20,040
Hello ladies!
[giggling]

138
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,080
Umino!

139
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,070
Are you still talking
about Sailor V?

140
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,020
That girl's
old news.

141
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,200
C'mon get with the
program. Sailor
Moon's what's hot!

142
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,170
Right, Usagi?

143
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,070
Ugh!

144
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,160
Everyone all over town is
looking for Sailor Moon,
but I intend to be the

145
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,020
first one who's actually
going to catch her!

146
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,160
[snickering]

147
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,020
What the heck are
you babbling about?!

148
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,000
Uh, hey Umino, are
you feeling okay?

149
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,170
Why is he being
so creepy!

150
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,010
He was a little overly-
aggressive today, don't
ya think?

151
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,090
Luna!

152
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,090
Sorry.

153
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,040
Tell me, Luna, about
Sailor V, you sure you
don't know who she is?

154
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,230
Uh...no. I don't think
she has anything to do
with the Moon Kingdom.

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,010
Really? That's
too bad.

156
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,170
But I'm still kinda
curious about her.

157
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,200
Perhaps Usagi can sense
something about Sailor V
that the rest of us aren't

158
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,110
able to pick up on.

159
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,200
Usagi was the first
Guardian Luna found
and she's our leader.

160
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,080
She could have some
kind of special
ability.

161
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,230
A special ability?

162
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,090
[laughing]

163
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,120
Hey, what is it? What
are you laughing at
Mako?

164
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,220
It's your face, Usagi!

165
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,210
My face?

166
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
[giggling]

167
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,220
What is it? Tell
me you guys?

168
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,000
What's wrong
with my face!

169
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,230
Here, take a look
in the mirror.

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,140
Huh?

171
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,020
Oh no! I got ketchup
on my face!

172
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,060
Oh! Handkerchief!

173
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,050
Handkerchief! I gotta
find it! where could
it be? Oh!

174
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,070
[sigh]

175
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,090
Usagi's definitely
"special".

176
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Stop teasing
me, Luna!

177
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,200
[laughing]

178
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,220
Just great. Now
everyone's laughing
at me.

179
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,210
His watch. I must've
accidentally taken it.

180
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,210
Usagi?

181
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,160
Yes! What?

182
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,120
Did you find your
handkerchief?

183
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,010
If not, you're welcome
to use mine.

184
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,230
Oh yeah, I found it!
No worries. Thanks
anyway!

185
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,010
Okay then!

186
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,040
So Ami I've been
meaning to tell
you,

187
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,200
I found this great little
shop in town that sells
the cutest backpacks.

188
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,220
I know I should
tell everybody...

189
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,220
About Tuxedo Mask. That I
know who he is and about

190
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,190
how he knows that
I am Sailor Moon.

191
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,030
I'm sure they'd be
surprised, maybe even
shocked.

192
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,230
Luna might even yell at me!

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,190
But... What if they
wouldn't let me see
him anymore?

194
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,210
Mamoru...
Mamo...

195
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,120
How come my heart aches
whenever I think of him?

196
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,080
I miss you...

197
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,230
What are you thinking
about right now, Mamo?
Do you miss me too?

198
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,190
Hey Naru! Want to
walk home together?

199
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,040
Is something wrong?

200
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,070
I can't walk home with
you. There's something
I need to be looking for.

201
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,110
What are you looking
for? Maybe I can help.

202
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,160
Sailor Moon...

203
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,210
Huh? Sailor-

204
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,110
Agh! I'm so sorry!
Let me get that!

205
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,140
Listen to me Usagi.
Your friend Naru
isn't herself!

206
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,170
Something's wrong
with her?

207
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,190
And the rest of
your classmates
too!

208
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,110
Hm?

209
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,230
I must find
Sailor Moon.

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Find Sailor Moon...
Find Sailor Moon...
Find Sailor Moon...

211
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,050
[gasp]

212
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,070
[gasp]

213
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,180
That DVD!

214
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,090
Rental Shop Dark?

215
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,070
Put the DVD in here.

216
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,110
Okay.

217
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,220
It's nothing
but static?

218
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,220
[screams]

219
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,100
Wh-what made
it do that?

220
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh no! What happened to
the game! Don't tell me
we broke the machine!

221
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,220
What are you waiting
for, Sailor Moon?
Hurry!

222
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,180
That is a brainwashing
DVD from our enemy!

223
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,200
They're all over town.
People are in danger!
You need to hurry!

224
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,150
The Sailor V from the
game is talking to
me again...

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,110
A brainwashing DVD?

226
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,060
You should go Usagi.
Try to help anyone
you can.

227
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,130
I'll check out this
disk and see what I
can find.

228
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,080
[affirmative grunt]

229
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,150
Why did I tell
her all that?

230
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,170
Something's
wrong with me.

231
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,010
I must find
Sailor Moon...

232
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,000
I need to know
where Sailor
Moon is...

233
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,110
I must find her
and take the
Crystal from her.

234
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,180
What the-

235
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,220
Sailor Moon.
Find Sailor Moon.

236
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,180
Where is Sailor
Moon? I must
find her.

237
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,150
I don't understand.
What the heck is
going on?

238
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,140
Find and capture Sailor
Moon. Sailor Moon holds

239
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,020
the key to the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

240
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,210
She must be
taken alive.

241
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,080
I feel so weak...

242
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,130
Get away from the
monitor or you'll
be brainwashed too!

243
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,170
Sailor Moon must
be sacrificed!

244
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,190
Given as tribute to
the Dark Kingdom!

245
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Did he say, Dark
Kingdom?!

246
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,140
Where is Sailor Moon?

247
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,080
Must find Sailor
Moon and capture
her.

248
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,030
Mako, can you
hear me?

249
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,230
Ami, this is
really bad!

250
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,090
People all over the city
are saying they want to
capture Sailor Moon!

251
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Same thing where I'm at!
I'm worried about Usagi!
I think she's in danger!

252
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,200
The enemy has brainwashed
the entire city! Hurry
everyone!

253
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,120
You must protect Usagi!

254
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,150
Did you hear
that? Let's go!

255
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,080
[affirmative grunts]

256
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,180
Sailor Moon.
Find Sailor Moon.

257
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm so scared. But I
have to do this. There
isn't any other way.

258
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,130
Now more than ever I
need you to lend me
your strength.

259
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,160
Help me Mamo.

260
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:44,100
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

261
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,140
Want Sailor Moon?
Here I am!

262
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,010
Catch her...

263
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,140
Catch Sailor Moon...

264
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,230
[growling]

265
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:31,030
Moon Healing
Escalation!

266
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,140
What the-? Where the
heck am I? How weird.

267
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,120
Oh no! It's late!
I better get home.

268
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,100
Huh? Where am I?
How did I get here?

269
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,070
Huh?

270
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,000
Ah thank goodness!
They're all okay!

271
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,110
[screaming]

272
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,030
[snickering]

273
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,030
Well well, Sailor Moon
you really do have
special powers.

274
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,110
But they won't save you.

275
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,110
Zoisite?!

276
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,230
You walked right into
my trap. What a fool.

277
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,220
You took advantage of
people who were just
trying to watch movies for

278
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,170
fun. That's unforgivable!

279
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,200
I am Sailor Moon!

280
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,190
In the name of
the moon...

281
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,000
I'll puni- Ahh!

282
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,000
Tell me! Where is the
Legendary Silver
Crystal hidden?

283
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,150
I don't know!

284
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,210
Tell me where it
is or you die!

285
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,040
Let her go!

286
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,476
Huh?

287
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:24,190
Mercury Aqua Mist!

288
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,190
Trying to blind me?

289
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,170
Evil Spirit, be gone!

290
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,180
Supreme Thunder!

291
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,040
Oh no!

292
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Tell me where the
Legendary Silver
Crystal is now.

293
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,200
If you don't, I'll
kill you and all
your friends.

294
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,000
[groaning]

295
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,210
No! I have to
save them!

296
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,020
Tuxedo Mask...

297
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,000
Help me...

298
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,180
[growling]

299
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,180
You came for me just
like I knew you would.

300
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,210
Tuxedo Mask...

301
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,130
Hey you in
the mask...

302
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,080
What gives? I thought
you wanted the Legendary
Silver Crystal too.

303
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,050
What I want?

304
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,180
You have no idea
what I want!

305
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,170
Don't think I'd
let you do that
again.

306
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,200
[screaming]

307
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,060
Tuxedo Mask!

308
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,180
[struggling grunts]

309
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,150
You sure you don't want
the Crystal? Cause it

310
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,020
seems like you want
something pretty bad.

311
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,090
He does...

312
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,090
Tuxedo Mask does want
the Crystal! He needs
it to remember!

313
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,060
And he's been searching
for it all this time

314
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,040
alone with no
one to help him!

315
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,040
It's true. For a long
time the Crystal was the
only thing I wanted.

316
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,170
But now, when I see her...

317
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,020
Angry one moment and
laughing the next...

318
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,020
The Crystal?

319
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,080
No. That's not what
I really want.

320
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,070
Usako... You're
what I want!

321
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,050
Oh Mamo!

322
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,060
I've had enough
of this!

323
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,060
[gasp]

324
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,090
No!

325
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,160
Let go of me!

326
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,180
Get out of my way!

327
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,200
Agh!

328
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,080
Usako!

329
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,050
[gasp]

330
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,070
I think I'll kill you
first. And then once
you're out of the

331
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,190
picture, I can take
the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

332
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,030
[nervous breathes]

333
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,100
Agh! Usako!

334
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,080
Now die!

335
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,030
No!

336
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,210
What?

337
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,070
[painful yell]

338
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,160
Damn you!

339
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,160
What on Earth
was that?

340
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,160
[gasp]

341
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,040
Who is that?

342
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:41,070
A crescent mark on her
forehead. Is it possible
that she's...

343
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,160
The legendary Guardian
of justice...

344
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,220
Sailor V?

345
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,200
[giggle]

346
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,060
Are you really
Princess Serenity?

347
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,040
I am, and I've been
watching over you
for quite a while.

348
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,160
We've been
looking for you!

349
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,010
Where have you been?

350
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,220
Now that we've found
you, what do we do
next?

351
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,120
You've all awakened as
Guardians, but you still

352
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,110
need to remember who you
were in your past lives.

353
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,160
Who we were... in
our past lives?

354
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,210
Act. 8, Minako,
Sailor V.

355
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,230
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
