1
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,833
There is soon to be an
awakening...

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,766
I see a light. A light that
will bring destruction to

3
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:36,200
the Omega Area, our
sacred ground.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,266
And I see other lights.
The lights of planets.

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,200
The shining radiance of...
Guardian Planets.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,833
This Omega Area overflows
with power: a power that

7
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,600
reminds me of our old world.

8
00:00:56,533 --> 00:01:00,133
The massive aura of that
energy is like a beacon.

9
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:02,900
The powerful are
drawn to it.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,500
I sense a light similar to
that of the Taioron Crystal:

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,433
the source of our
existence and from

12
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:15,600
which our life force
flows. It attracts me.

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,633
Regardless, this sacred
ground now belongs to us!

14
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:26,733
From here, we shall build
ourselves a new world!

15
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,233
I will not tolerate
any interference.

16
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,566
Remove these
anomalies immediately!

17
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,800
Of course, without
hesitation. Thy will shall

18
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,600
be done, Master Pharaoh 90.

19
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,166
As for the light that
brings destruction,

20
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:48,566
make sure it stays asleep!

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,133
Awaken...

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,366
The time has come...
For the light guided

23
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,200
by the three Talismans.

24
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,500
Let the destruction begin!

25
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,100
[gasp]

26
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,333
What was that?

27
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:20,500
What a strange dream.

28
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,366
[gasp]

29
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,700
The flames jumped...

30
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,466
Was that an oracle
from the fire?

31
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,500
What was it trying to tell me?

32
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:42,700
Where am I? It feels
so warm and bright.

33
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,633
What's that sound? [gasp]
Those are bells!

34
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,133
Are they wedding
bells? Are Mamo and I

35
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,300
finally getting married?

36
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,633
[alarm clock]

37
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,700
Usagi! Time to get
up. It's past 8.

38
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,533
[gasp]

39
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,233
[panic wail] Why didn't you
wake me sooner, Mom?

40
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,666
[sigh] That girl. Just
when she was getting

41
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:13,766
better, it's the same
old routine.

42
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:16,766
When you're right, you're
right, Mommy Ikuko.

43
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:20,333
Usagi just keeps getting
older, but won't grow up.

44
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,533
And now onto our
other top story.

45
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:25,200
We're receiving reports of
a bizarre incident that

46
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,400
happened yesterday in
the Minato Ward.

47
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,066
Several students from the
Mugen Academy private school

48
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,100
were attacked by a strange
creature, which has

49
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,533
yet to be identified.

50
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,733
Though authorities won't
confirm, eyewitnesses are

51
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,100
claiming the attacker
was a fellow student,

52
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,233
who had suddenly
turned into a monster.

53
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,200
Officials will only say
they're investigating the

54
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,200
matter as a case of
possible atavism.

55
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,566
What's "atavism"?
I've never heard that word.

56
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,200
You know how humans evolved
from apes? Atavism is like

57
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,066
an evolutionary throwback.

58
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,666
A return to a more
primitive state.

59
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,200
Oh...

60
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,400
But I doubt that's what
really happened.

61
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,600
Seems far‐fetched.

62
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,266
Humans devolving into
monsters?

63
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,266
If true, that's very scary.

64
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,833
I'm off to school! Bye!

65
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,633
[gasp] I should go, too!

66
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,166
Bye Daddy Kenji! See
you when I get back!

67
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,166
Bye Chibi‐Usa.
Have a good day!

68
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,433
I'm sorry, Mamo!

69
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,500
You're late again, Usa. I
was just about to leave

70
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,066
without you.

71
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:24,766
[gasp]

72
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:29,166
Don't be angry. Sorry
I kept you waiting.

73
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:31,500
Starting tomorrow, I
promise I'll be on

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,266
time from now on.

75
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:36,766
Okay? So smile, and give
me my morning kiss.

76
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,466
Ma‐mo!

77
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,300
[growling]

78
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,166
Good morning, Master Mamoru.
You look well today.

79
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,300
Hi, Diana. Good
morning to you, too.

80
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,600
Oh yeah. Usagi, I
brought your lunch.

81
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,066
You left it at home.

82
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,600
You need to get up earlier.

83
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,400
And stop skipping breakfast.
It's not good for you.

84
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,800
A well‐balanced breakfast
is the most important

85
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,300
part of the day.

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,733
You tell her, Chibi‐Usa.

87
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,233
[chuckle]

88
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,566
Little brat! Stop ruining
my romantic moment!

89
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,233
Even though she annoys me,
I actually like Chibi‐Usa.

90
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,533
She's me and Mamo's
daughter from the future.

91
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:21,733
Her home is in the 30th
century, but she came back

92
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,133
to the past to train as
a Sailor Guardian.

93
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:27,066
So right now, she's living
with me and my family.

94
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,633
Oh! It's my friends
from school!

95
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,700
I'm gonna walk
with them. Bye!

96
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,700
Not long ago, we fought a
fierce battle against the

97
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,566
Black Moon to save
Earth's future.

98
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,366
But now that seems like
a distant memory.

99
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,133
Things are back to normal.

100
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,666
<i>It's peaceful again. And</i>
<i>everyone's living their</i>

101
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,200
regular lives.

102
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,566
Awaken. Let the
destruction begin!

103
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,500
Is something wrong?

104
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,366
No. Nothing to worry about.

105
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,433
Sometimes I'm happy but
then I'll be hit by

106
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:15,100
a wave of anxiety. It's
like a roller coaster.

107
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,300
The moments when
everything's okay are rare

108
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,566
and precious. I know
they won't last forever.

109
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:25,133
But what can I do? That's
my fate. No matter what

110
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,566
happens, I'll get through
it. Because it's

111
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,300
my responsibility. Because I
have a mission to fulfill.

112
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:54,700
Come in, Kaiohmaru.
Oh, there you are!

113
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,266
We should head out to pick
him up soon, or we'll be

114
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,633
late for school.

115
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,166
The seas are going
to be rough today.

116
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,466
Haruka, I thought
I told you.

117
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,433
Don't floor it on
the straightaway.

118
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,266
But she rides so
smooth, coach!

119
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,033
Let me get her up to speed.

120
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,600
Not a chance! We're still
just breaking her in.

121
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,366
We agreed you'd stay
under 5000 RPMs.

122
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:26,433
You wanna wreck
before the race?!

123
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,100
Wow. He's certainly
popular. Who is he?

124
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
What? Have you been
living under a rock?

125
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,466
That's Haruka Tenoh. The
most talented young driver

126
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,533
to hit the Japanese
circuit in years!

127
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:38,633
But his sweetest ride
doesn't have wheels.

128
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:41,500
Those "birds" up there are
Tenohmaru and Kaiohmaru.

129
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,366
They belong to
him and his girlfriend.

130
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:46,100
They go to school in those?!
What a life.

131
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,533
Where have you been,
Michiru? You're late.

132
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,633
The wind is restless today.

133
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,800
Look. Isn't that Michiru
Kaioh, the famous violinist?

134
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,533
So the rumors about her
dating Haruka Tenoh were true?!

135
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:03,466
No way!

136
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,366
I hate to admit it,
but they really do

137
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:06,333
make a perfect couple.

138
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,766
I guess. And they do go to
the same school.

139
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,600
You know, the one that
was in the news.

140
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,666
Oh! I didn't realize they
went to Mugen Academy.

141
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:16,700
Finally!

142
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,633
Hi, Motoki! Hi, everyone!

143
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,266
Hey, Usagi. Hi, Naru.
Come on in.

144
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,266
You're late, as usual!

145
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,833
But I don't mind. I was able
to finish an entire book

146
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,333
while I waited for you.

147
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,466
[giggle]

148
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,833
<i>This is Ami Mizuno. She's a</i>
<i>genius with an IQ of 300,</i>

149
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:37,433
and a heart as big
as her brain.

150
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:40,333
I knew you'd be the last one
to get here. Pigs will fly

151
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,800
before Usagi's on time.

152
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,200
That's mean, Rei! You
don't have to rub it in!

153
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,166
This is Rei Hino. She's a
beautiful shrine maiden with

154
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,433
amazing spiritual powers.

155
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,533
Hey! 'Bout time, Usagi.
Where ya been?

156
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:58,300
This is Minako Aino. Long
before the rest of us

157
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,500
awakened as Sailor
Guardians, she was

158
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,433
fighting evil as Sailor V.

159
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,866
Hurry up! Get over here!
You absolutely have

160
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,533
to try this new game!

161
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,833
This is Makoto Kino. She's
strong, but also a "girly

162
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,833
girl" with many talents.

163
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,733
She's a great cook and
has a green thumb too!

164
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:18,566
We were all friends in a
past life, and fate brought

165
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,066
us together again as
Sailor Guardians.

166
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,400
As long as we're a team,
there isn't anything we

167
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,766
can't overcome.

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,666
What is "Battle Lap"? Is it
new racing game or something?

169
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,266
Yup! It's so realistic
you feel like you're

170
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,566
right on the track!

171
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,600
Here's your helmet.

172
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,433
Just step on the clutch,
and start the engine.

173
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,733
The engine noise is so loud!

174
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,666
And I can feel the vibration!

175
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,766
You wanna change gears
quickly. Keep shifting and

176
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,533
go straight to fifth.

177
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,600
[nervous groans]

178
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,733
This is scary! It's like
I'm driving a real race car!

179
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:56,333
Push harder on your
throttle. Increase the RPM.

180
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,033
Huh? Who's that?

181
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,800
Holy cow!

182
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
You were a lap behind a
minute ago, but now you're

183
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,766
neck and neck!

184
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,433
Whoa. That's unreal!
Take a look at his time!

185
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,500
He handles those turns like
a real race car driver!

186
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,466
I can't see. How
fast is he going?

187
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:17,133
400 kilometers per hour?!

188
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,800
[gasp] Usagi, look
out for the wall!

189
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,166
Huh? [scream]

190
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,166
Are you okay?

191
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:34,333
This game feels real even
when you crash...

192
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,633
That speed. Did you realize
how fast you were going?

193
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,800
It didn't feel fast at all.

194
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,266
I could hardly sense
anything with the helmet on.

195
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:44,433
Really?

196
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,566
If that's true you should
try out the track sometime.

197
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,333
You might have a hidden
talent for racing.

198
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:51,633
[chuckle]

199
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,766
[gasp]

200
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,433
Oh, I'm sorry.

201
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:02,566
Your eyes...

202
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,400
Their color has a
certain air of nobility.

203
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,066
You may have been a
prince in a past life.

204
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:14,366
That's an odd thing to say
to a guy you don't know.

205
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:17,466
This mirror, it reflects
one's previous lives.

206
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,666
Well, I gotta go.

207
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,366
Let's race sometime.

208
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,300
See ya, Bun‐head.

209
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:32,066
He is so cool!

210
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,833
Apologies. Forget
what I just said.

211
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,066
I didn't mean
anything by it.

212
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,066
Have a good day.

213
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,833
You seem to have made
a new friend in there.

214
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,066
Jealous?

215
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,566
Don't be ridiculous.

216
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,466
That bun‐head girl. She
seemed so innocent and

217
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:01,733
naiÃ¯ve. I thought
it was cute.

218
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,266
I'm in love...

219
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,366
Yeah, I haven't crushed on
anybody this hard in a while.

220
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,566
Hey, that cool guy!

221
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,700
Huh?

222
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,566
I think he was someone
famous. I know I've seen his

223
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,233
face before. You may have
just met a celebrity!

224
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,133
I've seen that uniform.

225
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:40,866
Oh. That's right! It's the
one from Mugen Academy.

226
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,566
Mugen Academy!

227
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,966
Mugen Academy?

228
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,766
What? You've never
heard of it?

229
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,033
The Tokyo Bay Land
Reclamation Project

230
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,033
recently developed several
large tracts for

231
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,100
commercial use. The biggest
one is Sankakusu, home to

232
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,366
the Mugen District and its
new private school.

233
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,033
Umino! Where did
you come from?!

234
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,033
Soon after the Academy
opened, its prestige went

235
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,200
through the roof! Tons
of famous actors

236
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,333
and musicians study there.

237
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,433
They have Olympic athletes
too. It's like a whole

238
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,500
school full of the best
and the brightest!

239
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,366
Wow, Minako. You're
well‐informed.

240
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,266
I heard they have a massive
concert hall their students

241
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:12,266
get to use. So there
are some really

242
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,266
big, super‐hot teen
sensations that perform

243
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:16,166
there all the time!

244
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:18,166
Oh! You could meet
celebrities just by going to

245
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:21,600
school. I'd transfer there
tomorrow if I could.

246
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,200
You're so star‐struck.

247
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,833
A school for the best and
brightest In other words, a

248
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,300
school Usagi couldn't get
into in a million years.

249
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,333
[groan]

250
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,933
Shush, Rei. That's true,
but don't say it.

251
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,300
And there's the death blow.

252
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,333
Thanks, Ami...

253
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,466
Look! There he is!

254
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:40,100
I knew I'd seen
him somewhere.

255
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,366
I just couldn't remember.

256
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,133
His name is Haruka Tenoh.

257
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,300
He's Japan's newest
racing prodigy!

258
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,500
Cool...

259
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,433
So he's an actual race
car driver? Wow.

260
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,100
No wonder he's so good.

261
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
[fangirling scream]

262
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,366
Do you think he hangs around
Juban Shopping District?

263
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,133
Maybe we can see him again.

264
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,333
[laughing]

265
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,566
Hey look! They go
to Mugen Academy, too.

266
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,500
I'm super jealous. Their
uniform's are so cute!

267
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,533
Yeah!

268
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,333
[gasp]

269
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,266
[roar]

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,366
[growling roar]

271
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,833
I'll get Naru and Umino to
safety. You be careful!

272
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,400
Don't worry. I will!

273
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,433
Ready. Let's transform!

274
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:50,366
Right!

275
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,366
Moon Cosmic Power Make Up!

276
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:38,000

I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice.

281
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,066
I am Sailor Moon!

282
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,233
And now, in the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

283
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:54,866
Protected by Mercury,

Guardian of Wisdom.

285
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,266
I am Sailor Mercury!

286
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,566
Douse yourself in water,
and repent!

287
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,233
Protected by Mars,
the Planet of Fire,

288
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,566
Guardian of War.

289
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,800
I am Sailor Mars!

290
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:14,933
In the name of Mars,
I'll chastise you!

291
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,533
Protected by Jupiter, the
Planet of Thunder,

292
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,133
Guardian of Protection.

293
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,533
I am Sailor Jupiter!

294
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:27,100
I'll fill you with regret,
it'll leave you numb!

295
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,033
Protected by Venus, the
Planet of Beauty,

296
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:32,200
Guardian of Love.

297
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,900
I am Sailor Venus!

298
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:39,233
In the name of Venus, I will
punish you with love!

00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:42,066
[grunts]

300
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,866
What is it?

301
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:46,033
Is it an atavism?

302
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,200
Whatever it is, there's a
girl trapped inside!

303
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,266
Stand back. I'll free her.

304
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:58,133
Evil Spirit, be gone!

305
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:03,300
It's okay. We got this.

306
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,433
Ready, Jupiter?

307
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:05,333

[roaring]

311
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,000
What just happened?

312
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,433
She needs medical
attention! Call for help!

313
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:49,800
Yeah. Okay!

314
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,300
Someone's watching us...
Is it another enemy?

315
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:56,833
Something wrong?

316
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,100
No. Everything's fine.

317
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,866
My brooch lit up and
started making sounds

318
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:05,600
right before that girl
turned into a monster.

319
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,166
Was the Legendary Silver
Crystal trying to warn me?

320
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,833
Look at those features...

321
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:20,066
It's an atavism.

322
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,366
Are you positive?

323
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,166
All of you watched the
news this morning, right?

324
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,433
Did you see the story
about the students

325
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:29,500
who were attacked, allegedly
by some kind of monster?

326
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:32,533
Luna, weren't the students
in that story from Mugen

327
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:33,900
Academy too?

328
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Mmhm.

329
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,433
A new enemy? So soon?

330
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:41,000
Mugen Academy and
de‐evolution...

331
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,833
Smells fishy if you ask me.

332
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:46,833
Then we agree. We'll
investigate Mugen Academy

333
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,233
as soon as possible.

334
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,933
[affirmative grunts]

335
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:52,100
Let's go.

336
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,166
To Mugen Academy.

337
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,466
Yikes! It's another atavism!

338
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:33,200
Well I don't care! Anything
that tries to disturb love

339
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,300
and justice will
answer to me!

340
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,966
Next time, "Act.27 Infinity
1 Premonition, Part 2."

341
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,500
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
