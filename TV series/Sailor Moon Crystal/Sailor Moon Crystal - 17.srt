1
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,177
I can't breathe...

2
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:28,057
It's no use.

3
00:00:28,203 --> 00:00:30,203
Berthier's water sphere
is a torrent that will
never run dry.

4
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:32,604
[gasp]

5
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:33,114
[chuckle]

6
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:36,105
Mercury!

7
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,135
The Black Moon...

8
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:37,165
Who are they? How
could they do this?!

9
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:42,175
Rei... Ami...

10
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:45,145
[gasp]
Who's there?

11
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:50,145
Do not cry, lady.
Do not cry.

12
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:52,225
Ahh! It's possessed!

13
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:53,235
No!

14
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,265
Don't you dare hit Luna P!

15
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:58,275
You named that thing?

16
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:04,285
Here. You can borrow
this if you want. Just
for a little while.

17
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:07,255
What!? Where did you get
that? Give it to me!

18
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,155
It was a present. I
got it from Mamo.

19
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:12,225
What?! Did you say "Mamo"?

20
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:14,215
When the heck did you
start calling him that?

21
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:19,105
I didn't even know there was
a Tuxedo Mask doll. It's cute.
Why'd he give this to you?

22
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,255
Guess I was wrong then.

23
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:23,255
I thought you were crying
cause you were sad, but you
seem to be just fine.

24
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:25,195
Huh?

25
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:27,245
[gasp]

26
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,115
Chibi-Usa?

27
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,295
Wait, was she...

28
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,165
... trying cheer me up?

29
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:54,185
Hey Mamo!

30
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,195
Well now...

31
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,295
Hello Ladies, I wasn't
expecting to see the
both of you.

32
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:00,285
Huh? Both of us?

33
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:03,185
Chibi-Usa?!

34
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:05,145
Where did you come from!?

35
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:09,145
Mamo? What is
this place?

36
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:13,125
Oh! Hey Mako!

37
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:14,155
Wait up!

38
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,145
[coughing]

39
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,195
Hey! [coughing]

40
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:18,225
That cough doesn't
sound too good.

41
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,175
Oh, I just caught
a summer cold.

42
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:22,175
Is something wrong?

43
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:25,125
Possibly.

44
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,065
Usagi!

45
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,075
I got an alert from
the Sailor V game!

46
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:31,295
Hm?

47
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,255
Chibi-Usa?

48
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,155
Holy cow!

49
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,245
She's amazing!

50
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:44,275
It's the highest score of
all time! No one's even
come close to that!

51
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,145
You're incredible,
Chibi-Usa!

52
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:50,125
[giggle] I wanna
play some more!

53
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,255
You okay?

54
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,175
Is there any game
she's not good at?

55
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:01,165
[giggle] Look how
much I got!

56
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,215
She's a natural.

57
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:05,085
I can win twice as much!

58
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,075
There she goes.

59
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:07,245
Mamo, Mamo!

60
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:09,065
I won all the candy!

61
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,215
That's quite an
armful ya got there.

62
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,275
[chuckles]

63
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:13,295
Come here Chibi-Usa!
I'll get you a bag for
all that loot.

64
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:15,155
Okay!

65
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,245
Did you catch that?

66
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:18,295
I did.

67
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,295
That toy is helping her win.

68
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,185
Gotta find one in
just the right position!

69
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,235
A little more.
A little more!

70
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:29,255
Darn it! What happened?
I was so close!

71
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,255
You suck at this game.

72
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:32,061
You don't have to rub it in.

73
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:32,334
Humph.

74
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,104
Usagi! Chibi-Usa!

75
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:36,264
[chuckle] These are for you!

76
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:38,224
For being such
good customers!

77
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,264
Just don't tell my uncle.

78
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:43,294
Yay! Sailor V
dolls! Awesome!

79
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:46,194
[chuckling]

80
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:48,254
They're definitely
two of a kind.

81
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:51,134
Did you have fun playing
all the games?

82
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:52,264
Uh-hunh!

83
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:54,264
Then I think that's
enough for today.

84
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:57,244
I'll take you home. Usako
needs some time with her
friends.

85
00:05:57,254 --> 00:05:58,294
Huh?!

86
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:05,204
Remind me to thank Mamoru
for getting Chibi-Usa away
from here.

87
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:08,224
No kidding! She's the last
person I was expecting to
see.

88
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,304
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:13,334
I didn't realize she was
following me. Should've
been more careful.

90
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:15,224
Don't beat yourself up.

91
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:19,134
I'm glad Chibi-Usa was here
to distract you, because now
you feel better.

92
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:20,104
Huh?

93
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:21,244
Don't you?

94
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,224
[chuckle]

95
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:25,144
Good to hear.

96
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,294
So what's the latest? Have
you figured out where Rei
and Ami are?

97
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:31,244
I still haven't been able to
reach them or pick up their
signals. So nothing yet.

98
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:34,304
They could be too far away
for our sensors to find.

99
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:37,244
Wherever they are, I
hope they're alright.

100
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:42,144
The Black Moon... I hate to
admit it but I can't get a
read on them.

101
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:45,244
They wormed their way into
our lives and just started
causing trouble.

102
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:48,294
Now. Tell me where
"Rabbit" is!

103
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:52,224
This "Rabbit" Berthier
wanted, do you think that
could be Chibi-Usa?

104
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,104
Possibly.

105
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:57,144
The Black Moon is
looking for Chibi-Usa?!

106
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:58,204
Huh?

107
00:06:58,214 --> 00:06:59,114
Ya think...?

108
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,254
I do.

109
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:04,294
Whatever's really been going
on, I think it's clear
Chibi-Usa holds the key.

110
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:07,234
Yeah. Until we
figure things out...

111
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:10,144
We can't let them get their
hands on her. We have to
keep her safe.

112
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:16,204
So, is she an enemy?
Or someone that
needs our help?

113
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:20,114
Taste this, dear. Tell
me if you like it.

114
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,244
Nope. Don't like
it. I love it!

115
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:25,294
Oh you!

116
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:27,254
You're still such a tease.

117
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:28,284
Is there a secret
ingredient?

118
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:29,224
Yes.

119
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,274
Mm... Tell me.

120
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,314
But then it wouldn't
be a secret anymore.

121
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:35,284
Okay I'll guess it then.
Let me just have a
little more.

122
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:36,264
Not until dinner!

123
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:37,304
But I'm hungry.

124
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:53,214
[chuckling] Don't
make me beg!

125
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:55,284
Chibi-Usa?

126
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:58,314
Is that you? Huh?
I guess not.

127
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,154
She's not there?

128
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:03,254
I thought I heard her come
in but must've been my
imagination.

129
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:27,144
Small Lady, if ever you feel
sad, just cast this spell.
It will raise your spirits.

130
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,224
Okay, Pluto.

131
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,274
[laughing]

132
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:41,144
[giggle] Abra-cadabra. Poof!

133
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:44,104
[laughing]

134
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:47,274
Look Mommy! White doves
just came out of that
girl's umbrella!

135
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:49,154
See them! They're
flying away!

136
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:51,284
Yes, sweetie. All the
birds are flying away.

137
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:53,324
Chibi-Usa?

138
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:55,264
You weren't looking Mommy!

139
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:59,114
All right, I think you've
had a little too much
excitement for one day.

140
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:02,134
Let's go home. I'll make
you curry rice for dinner.

141
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:03,314
Again?

142
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:12,274
What are you doing here,
little lady? Is everything
okay?

143
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:14,234
Chibi-Usa?

144
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:15,294
[gasp]

145
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,274
[scream]

146
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:23,164
Mommy!

147
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,314
What was that?

148
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:30,284
Oh! It's you.

149
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,234
What's wrong? Did
all the thunder and
lightning scare you?

150
00:09:37,314 --> 00:09:40,144
[sobbing]

151
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:43,154
It'll be alright. 'kay?

152
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:44,304
I definitely saw something.

153
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:49,264
As soon as I touched her, I
had a vision. Some kind of
catastrophe. An entire city

154
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:54,114
exploding! Where was that?
And what does it have to do
with Chibi-Usa?

155
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:58,164
Mommy... Mommy!

156
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,274
These two Sailor
Guardians...

157
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:09,184
I wonder if they are like
the queen: immortal and
forever young.

158
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:12,264
Have they felt it's power?

159
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:15,154
The power of the "Legendary
Silver Crystal."

160
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:18,334
With its "eternal promise and
limitless possibilities".

161
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:24,284
I can hardly wait to see the
look on that woman's face,
when I crush it into pieces!

162
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:28,144
I sense that there is
no need to be hasty.

163
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:30,184
Be patient, my Prince.

164
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:33,154
All things will
come in due time.

165
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:36,274
Prince Demande.

166
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,124
I wish to seek vengeance!

167
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:41,104
The Sailor Guardians
defeated Koan and Berthier.

168
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:44,104
And I refuse to let my
little sisters die in vain.

169
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:47,194
I, Petz, will capture the
one with the power of
thunder.

170
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:54,314
Code Zero Zero Three:
Operation "Re-new." We will
find the Legendary Silver

171
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:57,284
Crystal and hunt
down the Rabbit.

172
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,304
I will have everything
that I want...

173
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,164
And all that I desire...

174
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:38,274
[coughing]

175
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:40,304
I hate to have to
disappoint Chibi-Usa...

176
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,304
But I won't be able
to fix her toy.

177
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:46,264
I couldn't even figure
out how to get it open.
Any ideas?

178
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:47,264
[annoyed groan]

179
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,184
"Chibi-Usa, Chibi-Usa."
That's all I ever hear!

180
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,174
Huh?

181
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:52,294
That kid's all anyone
ever talks about.

182
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,314
My parents are
even sending her
to school now?!

183
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:57,224
All children should get
a proper education.

184
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:00,154
I'm sick and tired of this.
I can't take it anymore!

185
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:01,214
We agreed to protect her.

186
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:03,294
Besides she's become
attached to you. Haven't
you noticed?

187
00:12:03,294 --> 00:12:05,324
Yeah. I know,
like a stalker!

188
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,294
I really don't get
what you see in her.

189
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:10,164
How can you be 100%
certain she's
not our enemy?

190
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:11,234
[coughing]

191
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:13,244
Hey! It's Mamoru.

192
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:19,224
I just am. I can't exactly
explain it, but I feel how
deeply frightened she is.

193
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:21,304
So you think the Black Moon
or some other enemy was

194
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:24,274
after Chibi-Usa so she
ran to us for help?

195
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:28,294
I think it was
worse than that.

196
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:30,324
Also, I'm not so sure
she's from this world.

197
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,154
[realization gasp]

198
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:34,184
I wonder if the Black Moon
and her are from the same
place.

199
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:35,274
Nice one, Usagi!

200
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:37,174
Excellent deduction!

201
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:38,274
Who said that?

202
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:40,184
Thank you.

203
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:41,224
Careful. Don't
get cocky now...

204
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:42,204
I won't.

205
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:43,224
That cat can talk!?

206
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:45,194
But I would make a good
detective, don't you think?

207
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:46,304
You could be right.

208
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:50,164
Yeah. And if I am it means
Chibi-Usa might know
something important.

209
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:53,144
Like where the Black Moon
took Rei and Ami when they
kidnapped them.

210
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:55,184
The Black Moon?
Kidnapped!?

211
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:58,304
I'm not so sure
about this thing. Is
it really broken?

212
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:00,254
[yell]

213
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,224
Luna! Make it stop!

214
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:05,274
What the heck
is going on here?

215
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,304
[coughing]

216
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:12,234
What was that all
about? It was nuts!

217
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:13,264
[coughing]

218
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:14,294
Wait, isn't that...?

219
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:17,164
Makoto! Hey Makoto!

220
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,304
Oh! Hey Asanuma!

221
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,304
[cough]

222
00:13:22,164 --> 00:13:25,104
Hey, you look a little
flushed. Are you
feeling okay?

223
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:27,154
It's just a cold.
No big deal.

224
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:28,234
You're hot!

225
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:30,164
Something just shocked me!

226
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:33,274
Sorry. You probably
shouldn't touch me right
now. You see, I tend to get

227
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:38,194
a little statically
charged when I'm not
feeling so well. [chuckle]

228
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:40,154
Makoto! [yelp]

229
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:43,154
Sorry. My bad. [chuckling]

230
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:51,154
So many plants! It's like
you have your own little
private garden. But inside.

231
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:53,254
Are those your parents?

232
00:13:53,314 --> 00:13:55,174
Yeah.

233
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,244
That's an old picture. They
died in a plane crash.

234
00:13:58,294 --> 00:14:00,254
It's not something
I talk about.

235
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,324
Sorry. I didn't mean
to bring up...

236
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:12,204
Don't worry about it. It's
okay. Have some tea. It'll
help you relax.

237
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:13,244
Take a seat.

238
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,324
Oh. Thanks.

239
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,204
It's rose tea. Try it.

240
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:30,164
Unseasonable monsoon-like
conditions continue to
affect Tokyo.

241
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:34,184
In other news, more
mysterious crop circles were
discovered outside the city.

242
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:39,174
Eyewitnesses claim to have
seen strange glowing discs
in the skies above the area.

243
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:43,174
But citing a lack of
corroborating evidence,
local authorities have thus

244
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:43,314
far refused to comment--

245
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:45,214
Makoto.

246
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:49,234
Lately I've noticed, there
are a lot of strange things
going on around here.

247
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:50,334
Strange things like what?

248
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:52,214
Um, well...

249
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:56,204
This afternoon I was
in the cafÃ©, and I thought
I heard a cat talking!

250
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:57,264
What?!

251
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:01,254
And your friend Usagi said
Rei and Ami were kidnapped?
What did she mean?

252
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:04,174
And how come you give
off electric shocks
when you're sick?

253
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:07,274
[gasp] Are you girls...

254
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:12,114
Are you all from
another planet?

255
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:15,324
Uh? What're you
talking about?

256
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:30,114
I can't lie to you when you
look at me like that. Well,
here goes.

257
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:34,304
[deep breath] My friends
and I are human beings.
That's the truth.

258
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:36,224
However...

259
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:38,244
You're right. We're not
like other people.

260
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:41,224
We have special abilities
and a destiny as Guardians.

261
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:44,334
Because of that destiny,
something came and took
Rei and Ami away.

262
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,114
But I'm determined
to save them.

263
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:52,304
They're my friends. They
embrace and understand me.
They love me for who I am.

264
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:55,324
I never knew how
important that was.

265
00:15:56,214 --> 00:16:00,194
I'd do anything for them.
Even if there's danger, I'll
face it, head on!

266
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:06,234
You'll see. One day you'll
find someone important who
understands you too.

267
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:10,104
It might be someone you fall
in love with, or even a
close friend. [coughing]

268
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:11,314
[coughing]

269
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:13,204
Makoto, do you
need a doctor?

270
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:15,124
No thanks. I'm okay.

271
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:22,104
You're a very strong
woman. Aren't you?

272
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,104
Huh?

273
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,114
I want to be strong too.

274
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:33,114
I can't help you with your
destiny. I know that.

275
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:37,104
But if you'll let me,
I'll protect you!

276
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:43,124
[gasp]

277
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:11,294
You don't need to worry.

278
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:14,124
I won't tell another
soul! I promise!

279
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,314
Your secret's safe with me!

280
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,324
[coughing]

281
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:24,154
This cold, I think
it's getting worse.

282
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,294
There is an alert from the
national weather service.

283
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:29,294
A severe typhoon
warning has been issued
for the Tokyo area.

284
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:31,254
Residents are urged to
stay indoors and--

285
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:32,234
[coughing]

286
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:33,324
And... the cable's out.

287
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:37,334
What's that? [coughing]
[wheezing]

288
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,114
What's up with all this
weird weather we've been
having?

289
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,294
And I heard there's a bad
cold going around too.

290
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:56,304
Well then how come
you're not sick, Usagi?

291
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:58,214
'Cause I'm tough!

292
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:02,114
Hey Minako! You and
Artemis staying dry?

293
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:07,114
We're doing fine, but I can't
reach Mako. Can you slip out
and meet me at her place?

294
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,124
[evil chuckle]

295
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:13,264
Everything is working out
exactly as planned.The
infection should reach

296
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:16,224
critical mass just
as the storm breaks.

297
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:19,264
It is time! Take
your human forms!

298
00:18:21,144 --> 00:18:22,274
Now, my Droids...

299
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:25,124
Go forth! And infiltrate!

300
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:27,224
Disappear into the masses!

301
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:32,144
It won't be long before this
entire civilization is part
of the Black Moon.

302
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,124
[evil laughing]

303
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:43,134
[chuckling]

304
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:44,224
Usagi!

305
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,264
They're here!

306
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,124
Hang on! We're coming!

307
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,234
It won't open!

308
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:52,154
What?

309
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,154
It's locked!

310
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:54,314
Oh no you don't!

311
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:55,274
[screams]

312
00:18:56,314 --> 00:19:02,294
Jupiter Star Power...
Make Up!

313
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:42,114
Moon Crystal Power...
Make Up!

314
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:49,324
Venus Star Power...
Make Up!

315
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:42,334
[gasp] Mako!

316
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:46,204
You didn't really think you
could replace me, did you?

317
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:47,184
[yell]

318
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:49,174
[shrieking]

319
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:50,334
It was a droid?

320
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,164
Darn it! Why couldn't you
just die when you were
supposed to?

321
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,224
Who are you?

322
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:59,114
You've met the other Spetcre
Sisters, I, Petz, am the
eldest.

323
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,144
I'm here to make you pay for
what you did to my younger
siblings!

324
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:05,264
You're with the same guys
who took Mars and Mercury!

325
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:06,409
Jupiter!

326
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:12,334
I am the Pretty Guardian,
who fights for love and for
courage!

327
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:15,204
I am Sailor Jupiter!

328
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:19,154
I'll fill you with regret,
it'll leave you numb!

329
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:22,194
Big talk! But we'll see
how long you can keep

330
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:25,104
fighting once the virus
takes full effect.

331
00:21:25,154 --> 00:21:27,104
Flower Hurricane!

332
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:31,134
[death screams]

333
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,294
Is that the best you can do?

334
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:41,314
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

335
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:45,154
[death screams]

336
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:51,314
Is the full effect of the
virus finally hitting you?

337
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:53,194
I can't hold on.

338
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,174
I know I'm not strong
enough...

339
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:01,194
But if I was, I'd
protect you!

340
00:22:05,154 --> 00:22:08,134
Agh! How many of these
things are there?!

341
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:10,164
Jupiter!

342
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:11,154
Is she okay?

343
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:14,184
[screaming]

344
00:22:14,194 --> 00:22:15,164
Jupiter!

345
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:16,184
[evil chuckle]

346
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:22,224
Moon Princess Halation!

347
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:27,284
[scared yell]

348
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:30,284
[death scream]

349
00:22:32,294 --> 00:22:33,284
Hmm...

350
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:38,124
Too bad. No more Petz. But
she left me such a lovely
present.

351
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:38,324
[gasp]

352
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:51,194
Jupiter!

353
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:35,124
Too much has happened. We
can't wait any longer. We
have to confront Chibi-Usa

354
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:37,204
and make her tell
us what she knows
about the Black Moon.

355
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:40,284
Let's settle it, once and for
all, whether she's our enemy
or our friend.

356
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:42,114
You heard her Chibi-Usa!

357
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:43,164
Tell us what you know!

358
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:44,284
What's the Black
Moon all about?!

359
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:49,214
I don't know anything! I
swear! What happened
wasn't my fault! Mommy!

360
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:53,224
Act.18 Invasion.
Sailor Venus.

361
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:57,234
The moonlight is the
messenger of love.
