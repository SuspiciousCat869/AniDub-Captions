1
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,000
If you are who you say you
are, then you should have
the Legendary Silver Crystal.

2
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,120
Hurry up and hand it over!
Now! Or I'll shoot!

3
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,020
[Wincing]

4
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,100
[Gasps]

5
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,150
I'm not kidding around.
This gun is loaded!

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,060
Give me the Legendary
Silver Crystal or
I'll take it by force.

7
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,060
[Gasps]

8
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,130
[Grunts]

9
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,190
[Gasps]

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,050
[Gasps]

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,030
[Sighs] It's just a toy!
You scared the hell out of me!

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,180
[Grunting]

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,120
Hey! Wait! Come back here!

14
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,130
You have a reading on the
Legendary Silver Crystal?

15
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,080
Well done, Saphir.

16
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,220
Thank you, Prince Demande.

17
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,080
I live to serve
you, brother.

18
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,090
Wiseman.

19
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:23,040
The Legendary Silver Crystal
brings with it calamity and
misfortune.

20
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,170
I recommend that you find it
and destroy it as soon as
possible, my prince.

21
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,220
If that is your counsel, then
that's what we'll do.

22
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:34,586
To the restoration!

23
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
We will rewrite the past and
make all as it should be!

24
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
[Chuckles]

25
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,570
Prince Demande.

26
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,440
If I may, I think I know
just who you need.

27
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,500
We are the four
Spectre Sisters, faithful
servants of Crimson Rubeus.

28
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,450
Just leave everything to us.

29
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,430
The Crystal has protectors
guarding it, and I sense one of
them has powers similar to mine.

30
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,590
A fellow psychic who can control
fire! What fun it will be to
crush her!

31
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,420
Then this mission is yours!

32
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,540
Commence Code 001.
Operation: "Re-cruit."

33
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,490
Yes, sir. I will raise an army
for you and obtain the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

34
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,490
[Chuckles]

35
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,530
[Screams]

36
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,560
You okay?

37
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,550
I'm still alive! I thought
she'd shot me! That Chibi
Usagi! Where'd she go?

38
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm sorry, I had her
but she ran away.

39
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,510
What a brat! Pretending that toy
gun was real and demanding I
hand over the Silver Crystal!

40
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,430
How did she know that you
had it in the first place?

41
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,370
I don't know! We have to
go find her, what if
she's our new enemy?

42
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,580
Let's not jump to
conclusions just yet.

43
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,510
Hmm.

44
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,600
[Gasps]

45
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,460
Mommy...

46
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,500
Huh?

47
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,570
[Gasps]

48
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,560
Hey little lady.

49
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Oh!

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
So, where do you live?

51
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,480
Come on, I'll walk you home.

52
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,510
But... Mamo.

53
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,590
[Sighs]

54
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,460
[Gasps]

55
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,390
What was that? I think I
just had a vision.

56
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,649
[Gasps]

57
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,559
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,429
It's all my fault.

59
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,649
What's all your fault?

60
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,559
[Gasps] Nothing!

61
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,629
Hey, back off!

62
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:50,539
Uh, I mean, is your name really
Usagi just like mine is?

63
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,559
And can you tell us how you
knew about the Silver Crystal?

64
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:56,547
Hmph!

65
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,427
[Gasping] Jeez kid,
what's your problem?

66
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,397
[Chuckles]

67
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:06,437
Hey Luna!

68
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,437
Welcome home.

69
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,407
Who is that little girl?

70
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:13,447
Well we were at the
park and she kinda just
fell out of the sky!

71
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,377
Usagi? Is that you?

72
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,247
[Grunting]

73
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,437
What're you doing?

74
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:22,347
Oh! Well hello there.

75
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:23,447
Honey! I'm home!

76
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,387
Oh! We've got company.

77
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:28,237
[Giggles] Is she your sister?

78
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,156
Huh?

79
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,146
Well um, no she's actually...

80
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,236
My name is Usagi!

81
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:32,524
Huh?

82
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,004
[Giggles] Usagi? That's
my daughters name!

83
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,120
With her hair in
buns like that she even
looks like our Usagi.

84
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,121
I think you're
right, dear. What a
precious little thing!

85
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:43,101
[Chuckling]

86
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,981
I think...

87
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,141
I'm gonna stay a while
and keep an eye on you!

88
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:49,991
Huh?

89
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,141
[Grunts]

90
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:53,121
[Gasps]

91
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:58,141
[All Moaning]

92
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,191
Oh no you don't!

93
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:02,101
Snap out of it Usagi!
You too, Mamoru!

94
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,991
Mommy! Daddy!

95
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,171
Mommy! Daddy!

96
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,201
You can stay with us
as long as you like!

97
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:11,151
That's right, little one. We
want you to think of this as
your home from now on.

98
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:13,111
Are you nuts?! She
can't stay here!

99
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:15,111
Mmm!

100
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:18,151
What?! Oh, you're gonna
get it now, kid!

101
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:19,991
[Chuckles]

102
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:21,991
[Grunts]

103
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,191
Whatever you did to my
family you're going to
undo it! Right now!

104
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,181
I can't undo it.

105
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:28,201
What do you mean you
can't undo it?

106
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:30,111
[Sighs]

107
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:34,081
Oh! So now you've
got nothing to say!

108
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:37,101
Usagi! Chibi-Usa!
Dinner time!

109
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:39,091
Hey! I'm not
finished with you!

110
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,081
[Gasps]

111
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:42,001
Is that?

112
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:46,131
Usagi, you've still got
the Crystal, right?

113
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:50,001
Yeah! Don't worry Luna, I
keep it on me at all times.

114
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,021
It's still in the
new brooch. See!

115
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:55,021
The crystals power level is
adjusted so it's harder to
detect.

116
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,181
As long as I don't transform,
no one will know it's here!

117
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:00,181
There's something about that
little girl that bothers me.

118
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:04,121
Usagi, I'd like to keep an eye
on her here if that's okay.

119
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,101
Huh?

120
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,131
But even though she messed
with your family, I don't
think she's an enemy.

121
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:11,971
Okay, Luna. If
you say so.

122
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,001
I see.

123
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:16,091
Well if Luna thinks
she's okay then she
probably is, but for

124
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:19,161
all we know she's an
adorable walking time bomb.

125
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,011
You think?

126
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:22,011
Huh?

127
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:24,171
I'll do some digging of my
own. See what I can find.

128
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:28,991
She's a minor. So hopefully I
can check missing child reports
with her description.

129
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:31,011
I doubt Usagi's
her real name.

130
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,181
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:35,091
It's all my fault.

132
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:39,151
Was she trying to tell me
something? What did she do?

133
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:41,101
[Sighs]

134
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,011
[Sighs] Not having to fight
anyone is awesome!

135
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:47,981
It's not awesome
for me at all!

136
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,101
[Laughing] That's right!

137
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:54,111
I forgot about your "little"
problem. So who is this
Chibi-Usa?

138
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:55,991
A secret love child perhaps?

139
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,111
I vote for long lost sister.

140
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:58,181
What?!

141
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,091
Delicious!

142
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,171
Guys!

143
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,991
Look, she's got my mom
and dad wrapped around
her little finger!

144
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,021
But this weird spell only
affects them in regard to
Chibi-Usa.

145
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:10,131
So everything else
is normal, right?

146
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:13,981
I guess so. Shingo's still
his bratty little self.

147
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,981
Rei?

148
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:15,427
Huh?

149
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:16,807
Sorry. Zoned out
for a sec.

150
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:19,727
Oh, hey!

151
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:22,627
Ahem! Everyone!

152
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:28,637
I come bearing gifts! New
transformation pens for Mars,
Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury.

153
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,717
And new communicators
for everyone!

154
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,727
Thank you!

155
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:33,757
Now that the Moon Castle has
been restored, these pens

156
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:36,607
should give you even
more power than before!

157
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,072
That means!

158
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,628
We're Sailor Guardians again!

159
00:09:39,738 --> 00:09:40,738
That's great!

160
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:41,798
Back to work, right!

161
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,578
Our Moon Princess
needs protecting!

162
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:45,718
It's a pretty thankless job.

163
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:46,768
But someone's gotta do it!

164
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:48,638
[Laughing]

165
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,758
[Laughing] You guys are
the best friends ever!

166
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:52,638
We love you too, Usagi!

167
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:54,638
Huh?

168
00:09:57,578 --> 00:09:58,798
What's wrong? Did
you see something?

169
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:00,598
No, it was nothing.

170
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:01,628
Hey Makoto!

171
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,608
Oh, hey Asanuma!

172
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:04,738
Whatcha been up to?

173
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:05,718
Not much!

174
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:08,718
Meet Ito Asanuma from
Moto-Azabu Middle school.

175
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:10,798
I always seem to run into
him when I come here.

176
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:14,778
Oh! So is he the reason
you've got a sweet tooth
all of the sudden?

177
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:17,598
[Giggles] Can't fool you.

178
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:18,788
Look, that's her!

179
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,798
The Pretty one with buns in
her hair. That's Mamoru
Chiba's girlfriend.

180
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:26,608
Asanuma here thinks
Mamoru is the greatest
thing since sliced bread!

181
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:29,738
You know him from school?
What's he like there?

182
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:31,738
Mamoru is the
best of the best!

183
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:35,668
Not only is he the smartest guy
in the whole school, but he's
the top athlete too!

184
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:38,618
Plus, he's super nice! Even to
middle-schoolers like me!

185
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:41,628
Everyone at school
wishes they could be
half as cool as he is!

186
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,618
So cute, he's got
a man-crush!

187
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:45,758
So what if I do?
Nice to meet you!

188
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:49,808
I didn't realize that
Mamo was so popular!

189
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:51,808
I think I'd better
leave too.

190
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,578
I have to go and get things
ready for the school fair.

191
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,738
One of the clubs asked
me to participate.

192
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:58,588
Oh? In what way?

193
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:01,578
As a fortune teller.
I wonder why.

194
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:02,728
You girls should
all come!

195
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:03,748
Wouldn't miss it!

196
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:13,618
I'm club president, Kotono
Sarashina. Welcome!

197
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:15,628
So nice to finally meet you.

198
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:16,658
Nice to meet you, too!

199
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:21,678
Thanks to you, this year's booth
is going to be the best one yet!
Come see what we've got so far!

200
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,578
Sure!

201
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:25,618
She's so beautiful.

202
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:28,768
And a lot more outgoing than
she used to be. She never
did club stuff before.

203
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:32,738
[Gasps] UFO's?

204
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:35,648
What a bunch of dorks.

205
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:36,788
Huh? Did you say something?

206
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:39,758
[Gasps] No nothing! [Giggles]

207
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,618
How could I say that? I
guess Usagi's starting
to rub off on me.

208
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:44,788
Take a look at this.

209
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:47,748
These unretouched photos are
proof of recent UFO activity.

210
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,628
Right here, in the
heart of Tokyo!

211
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,688
There have even been a few
sporadic reports of alien
abductions.

212
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:55,788
Really?

213
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:59,618
You're right. It
appears we really do
have intruders among

214
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:02,668
us and they snuck in
without anyone noticing.

215
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:04,628
I'm so excited!

216
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:08,808
Between that incontrovertible
evidence, my report on
spontaneous human combustion...

217
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:11,668
...and your psychic
ability to predict people's

218
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:13,798
futures, our club is sure
to get a lot of attention!

219
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:16,588
Wait, human combustion?

220
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,748
Yes. Without any
warning at all.

221
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:22,668
A human body will
sometimes burst into
flames and burn to a crisp.

222
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:26,578
The cause remains a
mystery but there have
been several new cases.

223
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:28,578
We've got a big problem!

224
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,758
Another group is also signed up
to have a booth at the fair
about the supernatural!

225
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:35,608
Supernatural Phenomenon
Association.

226
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,598
"The Black Moon."

227
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:39,003
[Gasps]

228
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:50,753
[Screams]

229
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:53,763
[Gasps]

230
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:02,753
Was that a dream?
Or a premonition?

231
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,763
[Grunting]

232
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:23,683
Usagi you look nice.
Going somewhere fun?

233
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,633
Yeah! There's a fair
at Rei's school.

234
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:26,623
A fair?

235
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,910
You can't come
along, pipsqueak!

236
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,631
Chibi-Usa!

237
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,801
[Grunting]

238
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,791
I still don't trust you!
Don't you even dare think
about following me!

239
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,801
Keep an eye on her, Luna.

240
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:41,751
No problem. I won't let
her out of my sight.

241
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:43,741
Bye Mom!

242
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,751
Usagi! Don't slam the door!

243
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:51,641
She seems harmless enough
to me. I wonder
what her story is.

244
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:53,701
Huh?

245
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,581
Hmph!

246
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:02,711
Luna!

247
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:04,721
Here's your milk.

248
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:05,761
[Meows]

249
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:08,641
Huh? Where did Chibi-Usa go?

250
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:09,499
Huh?

251
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,509
[Screams]

252
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,883
Well? Does he?

253
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:23,953
He does. He's been shy up to
now, but he'll ask you out soon.

254
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,823
That's wonderful! Thank you!

255
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,933
Everyone loves your fortunes!
The line's a mile long!

256
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:30,963
[Chuckles]

257
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,873
President Kotono, Miss Hino!
You need to come, quick!

258
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:35,923
Huh?

259
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:41,863
[Sobbing]

260
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,853
The fortune teller from the
other booth is upsetting
everyone!

261
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,973
She's telling them when
they're going to die!

262
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,943
[Gasps] Huh?

263
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,973
I sense that you were born
with a heart defect.

264
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,813
And I'm sorry but you only
have six years to live.

265
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,870
Really?

266
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,871
But there's no need to despair.

267
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:05,628
While you are destined to die
young, I can assure you your
death will be painless.

268
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:09,408
So long as you join us
and become a member of
the Black Moon!

269
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:11,598
That's enough! Stop this!

270
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:16,608
Hello. You're Rei Hino, right?
I'm delighted that you came to
visit me.

271
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:22,508
I am Koan Kurozuki. Would you
like for me to read your fortune
too, Miss Hino?

272
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:26,578
Thank you, but I must decline.
I don't want my fortune told
by the Grim Reaper.

273
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,408
We need to tell the
Mother Superior!

274
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:31,478
This so-called psychic
needs to be stopped!

275
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,568
Hmm.

276
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:36,518
[Grunts]

277
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,418
Are you okay little one?

278
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:42,398
You should watch
out, my child.

279
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:43,608
Sister?!

280
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:48,558
No! She isn't one of the nuns!
And what's that strange mark?

281
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:50,538
[Grunts]

282
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:51,528
Wait!

283
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:52,598
Who's that little girl?

284
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:53,548
Miss Hino!

285
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:57,598
I think I smell something
burning. It's coming from the
direction the sisters went.

286
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:00,854
[Gasps]

287
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,940
Someone's on fire!

288
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,120
Spontaneous human
combustion! How awful!

289
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,930
President Kotono!

290
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,030
That nun! Did she do this?

291
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,950
Rei!

292
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,050
Just in time!

293
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,940
It's bad.

294
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,030
It would seem that we
have a new enemy.

295
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,130
I never thought we'd be
using these so soon.

296
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,050
Once more, the
battle begins.

297
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,140
At least we're all
here. You ready?!

298
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,070
Let's do this!

299
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,100
That brooch!

300
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,100
Moon Crystal
Power! Make Up!

301
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,110
Mercury Star
Power! Make Up!

302
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,940
Mars Star
Power! Make Up!

303
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,980
Jupiter Star
Power! Make Up!

304
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,130
Venus Star
Power! Make Up!

305
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,110
[Screams]

306
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,110
Well they just went
from holy to creepy!

307
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,940
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for
love and for justice!

308
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,960
I am Sailor Moon!

309
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,950
And now in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

310
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:11,940
[Screams]

311
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,140
Mercury Aqua Mist!

312
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,930
[Screams]

313
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,090
Supreme Thunder!

314
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,990
[Screams]

315
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,930
Venus Love Me Chain!

316
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,990
[Grunts]

317
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,110
That was almost easy. I
barely used any energy.

318
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,010
It feels like we've
gotten stronger!

319
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,080
These new powers
are incredible!

320
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,070
[Laughing]

321
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,070
Is that all you've got?

322
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,090
You again!

323
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,010
That's right. But for those of
you who don't know...

324
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,070
I am Koan! The youngest
and most extreme of the
four Spectre Sisters!

325
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,160
That mark again. Tell
me! Why are you here?
What do you want?!

326
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,110
The Legendary
Silver Crystal.

327
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,070
[Gasp]

328
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,160
[Gasp]

329
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,396
Hmph!

330
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:00,480
If you want the Silver Crystal,
you're gonna have to go
through me first!

331
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,480
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights for
love and for passion!

332
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,650
I am Sailor Mars!

333
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,510
In the name of Mars,
I'll chastise you!

334
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,450
Burning Mandala!

335
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,510
[Screams]

336
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,510
[Chuckles] Time to fight
fire with fire! Ha!

337
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,480
[Grunting]

338
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,660
[Screams]

339
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,490
Mars, no!

340
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I thought she'd put up
more of a fight.

341
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,680
Moon Tiara Boomerang!

342
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,640
[Laughing]

343
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,630
[Gasps]

344
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,640
Sailor Moon!

345
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,680
[Grunts]

346
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,520
[Gasps]

347
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,470
Tuxedo Mask!

348
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:50,967
[Gasps]

349
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:52,309
[Screams]

350
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:57,309
Shine Aqua Illusion!

351
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:02,319
Mars! Oh no, it
didn't work!

352
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:04,209
Don't give up!

353
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,349
[Gasps]

354
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,169
What is that?

355
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:26,159
I never thought I'd see
it again! Queen Serenity's
royal scepter!

356
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:27,584
[Gasps]

357
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:34,046
Did this appear because you
and I combined our powers?

358
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,906
It's the Moon Rod!

359
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:39,936
I can feel its power. I
know what I have to do!

360
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:45,894
Moon Princess Halation!

361
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:51,714
[Screams]

362
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,904
Ohh. I guess that
was my new attack.

363
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:04,714
Well done, Sailor Moon.

364
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:05,804
Who said that?

365
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:09,784
Crimson Rubeus of the Black
Moon, Commander of the
Spectre Sisters.

366
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:11,914
Black Moon?
What is that?

367
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:15,804
I don't care who you
are. Let Mars go!

368
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:18,714
[Laughing] Even though
you've destroyed Koan,

369
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:22,734
her flame
barrier can never
be extinguished!

370
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:23,794
Rubeus!

371
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:27,924
I want Sailor Mars alive.
Stop what you're doing
and bring her here.

372
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:32,774
We still need to find the
Legendary Silver Crystal
and she may prove useful.

373
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:37,774
Roger that. I read you
loud and clear. Heading
back to base right now.

374
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:41,894
[Gasps] Where are
you taking her?!

375
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:48,934
No! Sailor Mars!

376
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:32,764
What are you doing here
Chibi-Usa? Were you
watching the whole time?

377
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:34,854
You know something
about this, don't you!

378
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:36,714
Usagi! Calm down!

379
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:37,834
Ami...

380
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:38,914
These new enemies
can disguise
themselves as humans.

381
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:41,874
They may already be among
us hiding in plain sight!

382
00:24:41,884 --> 00:24:45,754
I heard Sailor Moon is really
strong. Is that true?

383
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:47,874
Do you think she
could help my mommy?

384
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:51,914
Act. 16 Abduction.
Sailor Mercury.

385
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:57,704
The moonlight is a
messenger of love!
