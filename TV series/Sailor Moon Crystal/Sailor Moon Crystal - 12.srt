You're lying.

7
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,080
Is it really you, Mamo?

8
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,170
He can't hear you. He's
no longer the Endymion
you used to know.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,050
[Gasps]

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,180
That can't be true.

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,030
I know you're still
in there Tuxedo Mask!

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,070
Answer me, Mamo!

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,130
Calm down, Usagi.
It's just a trick.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Ami's right. Queen Beryl may
have control of him right now,

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,020
but once we defeat
her, he'll be okay.

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,030
I don't think so. Prince
Endymion is dead.

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,170
Dead?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,090
The Prince before you has been
resurrected. Our Great Ruler,

19
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,190
Queen Metalia, brought
him back from the dead.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,130
She has remade him as the
Dark Kingdom's greatest
warrior!

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,130
He will bring all who
oppose us to their knees!

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,200
No!

[Chuckles]

27
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,200
I can't. It's Mamo,
I can't fight him!

28
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,100
Do it, Endymion! Kill her!

29
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,080
Don't Mamo!

a few seconds.

I'm okay...

44

But them?

45
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,170
They're on their own now.

Enough Princess! Tell me now!
What is the secret of the
Legendary Silver Crystal?

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,220
Please Mamo, I need you!

54
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,150
It's been so long, but it was
well worth the wait.

55
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,070
This is the moment I've dreamed
of, since the day I pledged
myself to Queen Metalia!

56
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:07,190
You pledged yourself to Metalia?
Why does that sound familiar?

[Gasps]

58
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,220
What is it Venus?

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,110
I remember now. It all
started because of her!

60
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,140
She sold her soul to the evil
Queen Metalia and turned the

61
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,210
people of the Earth
against the Moon!

62
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,160
We lived in peace and harmony
until she destroyed it all!

[Gasps]

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,000
Endymion?! Have you
turned against us?

65
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,200
Beryl...I remember now. She was
the one I saw that day! She
killed Endymion!

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,000
What kind of fate would
give you a second chance?

67
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,120
Queen Beryl!

68
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,230
Don't you get it? Queen Metalia
is pure evil! She's just using
you!

69
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,020
When she's done,
she'll kill you too!

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,230
[Laughing] I'm not Queen
Metalia's minion anymore!

71
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,130
The Silver Crystal is
mine now and I intend
to keep it for myself!

72
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,080
I, Queen Beryl, shall reign over
this world for all eternity!

73
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,100
With Prince Endymion
by my side, forever!

Did you honestly think
a rusty old sword like
that could hurt me?

Huh?

90
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,010
Alone we're weak. But together
we're strong! Hmph!

91
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,000
Hmph!

92
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,030
[All] Sacred sword, grant
us your power! Hmph!

93
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,160
I found it!

94
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,000
Her necklace! That's the
source of her power! It's
her link with Queen Metalia!

95
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,180
Queen Beryl! You won't win!
We'll defeat you! And we'll get
Mamo back!

96
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,160
Try all you want. You're
efforts are futile! Hah!

97
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,020
Venus Love-Me Chain!

98
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,030
Oh no you don't!

99
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,000
Evil spirit, be gone!

100
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,140
Now, Sailor Moon! Do it!

101
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,100
Ahh!

102
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,160
[All] It's over!

[Grunts]

105
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,180
I told you that sword wouldn't
work. Why don't you give up?

106
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,180
I won't give up! Not
as long as I live!

107
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,160
Not until I get Mamo back!

108
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,150
You're too late! Endymion
belongs to the Dark Kingdom now.

109
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,170
He doesn't belong to you! He
would never fight for evil!

110
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,050
[Gasps]

111
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,150
I know that you're in there!
Remember who you are and come
back to me!

112
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,140
What?!

113
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,110
No! This can't be!

114
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,160
[Gasps]

Endymion...

121
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,010
You never knew it my Prince...

122
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:45,190
But all my life I watched you
from afar. Hoping, wishing we
could be together.

123
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,160
After so many centuries,
for a moment I thought...

124
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,120
My wish had finally come true.

125
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:03,210
[Gasping]

126
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:15,170
[Heavy Breathing]

127
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,210
[Gasps]

128
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,130
What's this writing?

129
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,020
"When this sword shines
brilliantly..."

130
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,230
"The Legendary Silver Crystal
within the Queen, will follow
the wishes of her heart."

131
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,050
"Once the Silver Crystal
has become whole and fully
formed..."

132
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,230
"Raise it aloft to the heavens
and beseech the great power of
the Moon to awaken."

133
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,150
"Offer a prayer to the Moon's
sacred Tower. Then peace will
return to our kingdom."

134
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,080
What does that mean?
What "Great power?"

135
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,160
So Beryl has fallen.

136
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,140
The power of these reborn Moon
People is growing stronger.

137
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,140
Endymion!

138
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,080
[Gasps]

139
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,200
Bring me that sword!

140
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,150
Yes.

141
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,160
[Grunting] Ah!

142
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,060

[Gasping]

146
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,190
Wait, Mamo! Don't go!

147
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,070
[Heavy Breathing]

148
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,150
[Screams]

149
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,180
This is bad!

150
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't follow him!

151
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,020
He's got the sword!

152
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,190
And the Silver Crystal!

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,070
Usagi!

154
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,070
Usagi, stop!

155
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,030
It's too dangerous!

156
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,080
Come back!

157
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:19,040
[Heavy Breathing]

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:30,160
[Heavy Breathing]

159
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,100
I didn't think you
would follow me here.

160
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,090
Endymion! It's me,
it's Serenity.

161
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,080
Serenity?

162
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,190
[Grunts]

163
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,020
[Grunting]

164
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,170
Mamo!

165
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,170
Are you okay? Talk to
me. Mamo? Mamo!?

166
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,070
[Grunts]

167
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,110
[Gasping]

168
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,010
Why?!

169
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,170
This is the Legendary Silver
Crystal. Yet it does not shine!

170
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,230
Tell me what happened to
its power or I'll kill you!

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,090
[Gasping]

172
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,210
Luna, have you pinpointed
Usagi's location?

173
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,220
Not yet. But she's
near the Arctic.

174
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,030
The Arctic?

175
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,210
[Sighs] Blocked again.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,020
Whenever I get close to locking
down her signal, something
disrupts our censors.

177
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,210
Huh!

178
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,230
I know that place!

179
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,020
That's D-point. We've been
watching it for a while.

180
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,060
We think it's the
enemy's stronghold.

181
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,050
Huh?

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,120
Look! Over there!

183
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,070
This must be the entrance
to the Dark Kingdom.

184
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,090
Let's go!

185
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,060
I sense a strong evil here.

186
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,100
[All] Huh!

187
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
The Four Kings of Heaven!

188
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,010
We should have known
you'd be here!

189
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,000
We meet again Sailor Guardians.

190
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,040
Unfortunately this is
as far as you go.

191
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,100
This fight will be
your last one.

192
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,190
Feel the power of the darkness!

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,030
[Screams]

194
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,030
[Coughing]

195
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,010
That really packed a punch.
They're stronger than they were
last time.

196
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,130
Usagi needs us. We have
to help her. We don't
have time for this!

197
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,110
Plus we know! How can
we fight them now!?

198
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,130
We don't have a choice!
They don't remember who
they really are.

199
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:47,030
We're the only ones
who can help them!

200
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,190
[Grunts]

201
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,040
[Heavy Breathing]

202
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,060
[Chuckling]

203
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,230
[Gasps]

204
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,130
[Evil Moaning]

205
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,090
[Gasps]

206
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,070
[Evil Moaning]

207
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,070
[Gasping]

208
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,210
[Screams]

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,140
[Grunts]

210
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,070
[Screams]

211
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,230
Hah! It's no use. Why don't you
just turn around and walk away?

212
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,130
Not a chance! That's
not who we are!

213
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,140
We swore to protect Usagi!

214
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,120
And we won't stop! As long as
we're alive we'll keep fighting
for her!

215
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:34,060
Don't you remember? You're just
like we are. You swore an oath
to protect someone too!

216
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,050
We swore an oath?

217
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,070
Hah! That's ridiculous.

218
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,110
Stop telling stories.
Our job is to stop you.

219
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,170
[Gasping]

220
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,050
Is that creature, Queen Metalia?

221
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:05,010
[Laughing] The last princess of
the Moon Kingdom, brought to her
knees by the man she once loved.

222
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:11,020
My power flows through Prince
Endymion. He will be king of
this new world!

223
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,050
And all will grovel
before the darkness!

224
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,090
[Grunts]

225
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,050
Hmph!

226
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,150
It's over. She's too strong.
There's nothing I can do. I'm
powerless.

227
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,050
Come in Usagi! It's
Luna. Can you hear me?

228
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,220
Huh? Luna?

229
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,120
Listen carefully! A fragment of
the Legendary Silver Crystal is
still inside Tuxedo Mask.

230
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,060
That's why he's so powerful now!

231
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,050
The answer was in the text that
appeared on the Sacred Sword.

232
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,100
In order to seal away Queen
Metalia permanently, the

233
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,150
Legendary Silver Crystal
must be whole!

234
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,080
You need to remove the part
that's inside Tuxedo Mask...

235
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,050
...and combine it with the rest
to make the Silver Crystal
complete again!

236
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,040
You can do this, Sailor
Moon! Trust your heart!

237
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:17,110
Always remember my dear
Serenity, The Legendary Silver
Crystal follows your heart.

238
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:23,130
[Heavy Breathing] I
need to trust my heart?

239
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,150
You've overcome
so much already.

240
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,120
You've filled all of our
hearts with love and courage!

241
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,110
[Heavy Breathing]

242
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,140
You are strong, Usagi! Have
faith in yourself! Endymion's
fate is in your hands.

243
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,060
Only you can free him!

244
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:47,020
Still think you can defeat me,
Princess? How weak and foolish
you are.

245
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,030
You will never leave the Dark
Kingdom. Your corpse will rot
here for all eternity!

246
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,080
You don't scare me,
Queen Metalia.

247
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,170
This world is beautiful! I won't
let you destroy it! [Gasp]

248
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,150
Remember, Mamo? That
day in the park?

249
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,180
You said to hold onto this until
we could meet there again.

250
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,090
You said you were sorry you
couldn't protect me. But you
were wrong.

251
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:28,040
You've always
been there for me.

252
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:28,180
Huh?

253
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,120
You believed in me and gave me
your strength when I needed it
the most.

254
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,110
You watched over me from the
very beginning. You knew my
secret and you kept me safe.

255
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,130
I love you.

256
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,090
And there is only one thing that
I wish for: it's to be with you!

257
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,140
Please Mamo! Come back to me!

258
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,090
Moon Healing Escalation!

259
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,010
[Screams]

260
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,050
Finally had enough? Are
you ready to surrender?

261
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,110
[Panting]

262
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,100
We can't give up! Usagi's
out there alone!

263
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,030
I'll fight for her
until my last breath!

264
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,150
Usagi is the best friend
any of us ever had.

265
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,110
She touched all of our hearts!

266
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,170
She's the one who brought
us all together! We'd be
lost without her!

267
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,080
Remember the Prince? Didn't
you used to feel the same
way about him?

268
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,190
Huh?

269
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,090
Who was that?

270
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,140
I thought I saw...

271
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,120
Now Guardians! Venus Power!

272
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,100
Mercury Power!

273
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,060
Mars Power!

274
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,040
Jupiter Power!

275
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,160
[All] Sailor Planet! Attack!

276
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,030
Zoisite: knight of purity
and healing.

277
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,210
Kunzite: knight of virtue
and affection.

278
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,070
Jadeite: knight of patience
and harmony.

279
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,090
Nephrite: knight of wisdom
and comfort.

280
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,160
Knights? What are
you talking about?

281
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,070
You were once heroic
champions for good.

282
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,200
Those were your titles.

283
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,110
Titles...as knights?

284
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,080
I've never heard
any of that before.

285
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,070
Yes you have, many times.

286
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,050
The only reason we know, is
because you told us.

287
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,080
Was there someone
we were loyal to?

288
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,110
[Gasp]
[All] Master!

289
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,170
I remember now.
We were knights.

290
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,160
We were sworn to
protect our Master.

291
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,200
Then the darkness came,
and it took control of us.

292
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,160
[Sigh] Venus?

293
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,040
Hello Kunzite.

294
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,050
[Screams]

295
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,220
Weak-minded fools!

296
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,130
All those who resist the
darkness, shall perish by
its awesome power!

297
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,100
[Grunts]

298
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,190
[Gasps]

299
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,170
They're gone!

300
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,050
No way!

301
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,170
They can't be.

302
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,140
[Gasping]

303
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,130
[Sobbing]

304
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,220
[Crying]

305
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,180
Please don't cry, Sailor
Guardians. You can grieve
for us later.

306
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,170
You still have to protect the
Moon Princess.

307
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,060
It's your sacred duty.

308
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,220
She needs you. You must
stand up and fight for her!

309
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,180
Of course we will. Absolutely.

310
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,100
We'll never forget you.

311
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,130
They're right. We
can't cry now.

312
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,220
Yeah. Usagi needs us!

313
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,220
[All] Mhm!

314
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,170
[Heavy Breathing]

315
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:17,100
Give up. I have the power
of darkness behind me. You
cannot win this fight.

316
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,100
[Evil Laughter]

317
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:28,090
Impossible! That was the
strongest attack I have! I
put everything into it!

318
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,220
But it still didn't
change him back!

319
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,150
Mamo! I don't know
what else to do!

320
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,110
My dear Serenity.

321
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,010
You are the Sailor Guardian
of Love and Justice.

322
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,080
Take pride in that. Have
confidence in yourself.

323
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:52,120
[Gasps] I am Sailor Moon.

324
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,080
Look! There she is!

325
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,160
[Grunts]

326
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,200
[Grunts]

327
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,140
[Gasps] Usagi! What
are you doing?!

328
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:13,010
I'm sorry Mamo! Please forgive
me! I can't stand seeing you
like this anymore!

329
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,070
Usagi!

330
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,200
[Crying]

331
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,000
No!

332
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,130
Don't do it!

333
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,160
Stop!

334
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,090
Usagi!

335
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,080
Mamo...

336
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:34,020
Are we star-crossed lovers
always destined...

337
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,010
To suffer the same fate?

338
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,200
[All] Usagi!

339
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,140
No! This is too horrible
it can't end like this!

340
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Usagi!

341
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,110
This isn't why we were reborn.
We weren't supposed to suffer
all over again!

342
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,050
This is it! Metalia's darkness
will consume the whole world!

343
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,030
No Artemis,
there's still hope!

344
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,230
Act. 13 Final Battle.
Reincarnation.

345
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,020
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
