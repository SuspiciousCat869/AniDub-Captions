00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:28,200
<i>So,...Super Sailor Moon even</i>
<i>managed to defeat Magus</i>
<i>Kaolinite.</i>

2
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:36,166
No matter. The time has come to
make this Omega Area into our
sacred land.

3
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,733
And so long as we have the
Legendary Silver Crystal,...

4
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:43,233
...no one can stop us. We've got
nothing to fear!

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,833
[slurping smack]

6
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,566
[gasp]

7
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:07,966
Amazing! Such power...I can
feel it welling up from deep
within my body.

8
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:12,566
This energy,...it fills me to
the brim!

9
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,000
Mmmmmm...

10
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:19,900
Is that the power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal flowing
through you?

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,133
Yes, Master Pharaoh 90, it is!

12
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,466
Behold this power that I have
obtained for you!

13
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:29,466
Oh...What brilliance!

14
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:35,233
The Taioron Crystal doesn't even
come close to having such power!

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,766
At last, the time has come for
me to be at my full strength...

16
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:49,833
I am finally able to make this
world our second mother planet.

17
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:54,900
This is it! This is the moment
for my vesselization!

18
00:01:55,633 --> 00:02:04,833
Hear me O' Legendary Silver
Crystal! Give me more! I want
more of your power!

19
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,766
Act.35 Infinity 9 "Infinite
Labyrinth" 2

20
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,066
Chibi‐Usa?

21
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,333
What is going on? What's this
light?

22
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:08,666
[cackling] More...! Release more
of that incredible power!

23
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,600
[gasp]

24
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,866
No! Stop it!

25
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:18,766
This can't go on. You must not
increase its power any further!

26
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:23,000
It doesn't belong to you...Do
not release any more...

27
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,000
...of its power!

28
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:32,100
[cry] My forehead,...it's
burning...

29
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:36,200
It feels like it's goi
ng to split open! [whincing]

30
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,700
Someone is trying to interfere
and control my body from within!

31
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:49,133
But I only have to put up with
it a little longer, just until
Master Pharaoh 90 completes his
vesselization.

32
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:55,100
Then I won't need this body
anymore. I'll chew my way out of
it and rule the world!

33
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,166
I will never allow that!

34
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:01,333
[grunting]

35
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:10,433
Where am I? It's so dark and
scary...

36
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,366
What am I doing in a place like
this?

37
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,066
Oh...

38
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:19,433
What is that?

39
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,233
It's coming this way...

40
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:25,566
[gasp] I'm scared. Someone help
me!

41
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:28,233
Chibi‐Usa...

42
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,400
Hm?

43
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,600
Oh! That's my Legendary
Silver Crystal!

44
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,166
[joyful sighing]

45
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,566
Thank goodness. I felt so
nervous being without it.

46
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,433
Like a lucky charm, it's become
something I always wanna have
with me.

47
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,500
Almost as if it was a part of
me.

48
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:56,333
That's right. That crystal is a
part of you, Chibi‐Usa. It's
like your heart.

49
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,366
Don't ever let it out of your
sight again.

50
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,800
And don't be so eager to show it
to others...Keep it safe and
secure, hidden inside you.

51
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,066
Mommy?

52
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:20,633
<i>No,...I'm not in Mommy's arms.</i>
This is different. But still, I
<i>feel so safe...</i>

53
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,966
It's okay...

54
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,633
I will protect you, Chibi‐Usa.

55
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:35,300
No one is going to lay a hand on
your soul or your Legendary
Silver Crystal...because I won't
let them.

56
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
I will save you. I promise.

57
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,166
Huh?

58
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,966
[gasp]

59
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,466
<i>The Legendary Silver Crystal's</i>
<i>power is weakening?!</i>

60
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,133
The light's fading...

61
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,966
Her hand is warm again.

62
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:56,133
What's going on? Is someone
protecting Chibi‐Usa's soul?

63
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,200
I couldn't find anyone.

64
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,633
Me, neither.

65
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:09,133
It's no good. I can't seem to
get a read on the buildng's
layout.

66
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:12,233
I'm not even detecting any signs
of life.

67
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:16,533
Let's try the basement. Down
there is where most of the
laboratories are.

68
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,166
Then, we should probably split
up.

69
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:25,633
Starting from here, we'll take
the stairs down floor‐by‐floor,
checking each as we go.

70
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,700
Sailor Moon, you, Pluto, Uranus,
and Neptune take the elevator.

71
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:30,533
[grunting]

72
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,566
Be safe.

73
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,533
Don't worry about us, we'll be
fine.

74
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,633
Please look out for our
princess.

75
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,000
Absolutely.

76
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,000
All of you, please be careful.

77
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,366
[grunts]

78
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Mars...Mercury...Jupiter...Venus
...

79
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,533
C'mon. Let's head down.

80
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:57,166
[deep breath] Hm!

81
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,066
[snickering]

82
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:06,633
The little girls protected by
their Guardian Planets are
coming...

83
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:11,133
Too bad the elevator they got on
will take them straight to their
doom.

84
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
The time has come...

85
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,233
<i>...My life‐long dream has</i>
<i>finally reached fruition. And</i>
<i>they will get to see the</i>
<i>results.</i>

86
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,266
My life's work: Super Life
Forms!

87
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:31,433
Beings with intelligence and
stamina a hundred times that of
a human, and with a lifespan
significantly longer.

88
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,300
All it took was: a little gene
manipulation; administering the
right drugs at the right times;

89
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,100
and some cybernetic
enhancements.

90
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,300
I'm giong to make those pompous
academics regret kicking out
such a genius.

91
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Deciding to build my lab and do
my research here, in this Omega
Area,...

92
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,433
...and even the fire...

93
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:59,200
They all turned out to be gifts
from Heaven that helped me get
here!

94
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,533
There I was about to rebuild
Hotaru's body,...

95
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:11,266
...preparing to realize my dream
and, at last, create a Super
Life Form.

96
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,033
But then, in the middle of my
greatest experiment...

97
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,300
Huh? A blackout?

98
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,666
[groaning]

99
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,166
Are you okay?

100
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:31,266
[groans]

101
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:33,766
Kaori!

102
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,766
What the...She's...?

103
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,633
Huh? What's this light? I feel
different.

104
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,366
It appears your vesselization
was successful.

105
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,766
Huh? Vesselization?

106
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:55,200
I am Master Pharaoh 90...

107
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,666
Pledge me your loyalty.

108
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:08,000
If you do, I shall give you even
more power. And grant you the
title of Magus.

109
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,666
[crying]

110
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
[gasping]

111
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,166
[grunting]

112
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,000
I pledge myself. How may I serve
you, Master?

113
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,433
Collect human Hosts and implant
our eggs in suitable vessels.

114
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:34,333
For the sake of our grand
resurrection, and to make this
land into our second mother
planet!

115
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,300
Understood, sir.

116
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,466
If that is your wish, then I
shall fulfill it. I live to
serve you, Master Pharaoh 90.

117
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,000
And so, from their world, they
descended into ours,...along
with their eggs.

118
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,333
At first, I wasn't sure what to
make of them...

119
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:59,500
But then, I was granted the
opportunity to vesselize one of
the alien eggs myself.

120
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:16,000
This is the egg of my former
partner from a previous life,
Mistress 9.

121
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,033
It is imperative you achieve her
vesselization. Do not fail!

122
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:22,733
Yes, sir.

123
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,333
[growl]

124
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,566
<i>And thus,...I chose to use my</i>
daughter, Hotaru, as the vessel
<i>for Mistress 9.</i>

125
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,366
I even managed to produce some
other 'perfect specimens' that
were quite lovely.

126
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,366
[roar]

127
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:47,166
And, then, of course, there are
my beloved Daimons.

128
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:51,333
The Death Busters may have
called you "defects" because you
failed to vesselize,

129
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:55,066
...but you were indispensable to
me and my experiments' success.

130
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:01,733
Even once we've finished with
the Master, I'm going to
continue performing
vessilizations.

131
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,300
And I intend to make more
'perfect specimens', just like
myself!

132
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:13,766
They will be alien‐human hybrids
that constitute an entirely new
form of life, a Super Life Form!

133
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,000
And they will be my creations!

134
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,400
...Which means I am God!

135
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,300
[laughing]

136
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:27,633
Daddy...

137
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,733
That scene of destruction...

138
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:54,500
I don't want to believe that's a
vision of our future.

139
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,966
I have to hurry and stop our
unseen enemy, the Death
Busters...

140
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:05,800
So we can go back to our
lives, and not have to worry
about what lurks in the shadows.

141
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,466
But for that to happen, I need
to first get Chibi‐Usa's sould
back, and her Legendary Silver
Crystal, as soon as possible.

142
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:17,166
And I must also...save Hotaru.

143
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:22,066
If Saturn, the final Guardian,
should again awaken,...

144
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:25,733
...then the world, as you know
it, will meet its end.

145
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:28,400
[grunt]

146
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,900
<i>The elevator's speeding up.</i>

147
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,900
It's like I'm falling endlessly
into a bottomless abyss...

148
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,733
I'm scared.

149
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:42,300
I hope they're okay ‐ the
others.

150
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,733
Don't worry. I'm sure they're
fine.

151
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,133
Aren't you even a little afraid?

152
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:50,733
If I said that I wasn't, I'd be
lying.

153
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,866
[grunt] I'm hopeless when it
comes to being scared.

154
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,133
I still get...freaked out so
easily.

155
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:03,133
Especially when I'm in a
haunted, abandoned building, or
trapped in a moving elevator
that won't stop.

156
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:07,066
[exhale] It's too much for me to
handle.

157
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,033
[exhale] Sailot Moon...

158
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,533
I'm about to go fight a powerful
enemy, and just thinking about
that scares me.

159
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,933
I keep worrying about all the
bad things that could happen.

160
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:25,033
Like what if...I somehow end up
all by myself? Then what?

161
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,733
Does the thought of being alone
scare you?

162
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,766
[light breathing]

163
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:32,966
Oh...

164
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,800
The three of us used to always
be alone.

165
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,033
[gasp] You were, really?

166
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,133
Yes.

167
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,966
We lived where there were no
others...

168
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,100
...All by ourselves...

169
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:55,033
...In very lonely places.

170
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,400
But,...at every moment we
could,...

171
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,333
we would remember our distant
home world,

172
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:07,000
Silver Millennium, and its
beautiful Queen and Princess.

173
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:15,000
For us, alone in the darkness,
just envisioning it was a ray of
light.

174
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:21,433
And, when it shined brightly, we
would feel power grow within us.

175
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:27,433
That light was always our guide.
It would reassure us. And
encourage us not to give up.

176
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,266
[deep breath]

177
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,133
[scream and groans]

178
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,433
[gasp]

179
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,933
[screaming]

180
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:40,933
Sailor Moon!

181
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:45,100
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto!

182
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,133
[gasp]

183
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,433
A field of solid darkness...

184
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,866
I'm scared...

185
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,433
Uranus.

186
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:00,333
Neptune.

187
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:02,033
Pluto.

188
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,333
Venus.

189
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,566
Jupiter.

190
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,033
Mercury.

191
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,333
Mars.

192
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:11,000
Mamo. Chibi‐Usa...

193
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,066
Help me. I can't do anything
without you guys!

194
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,733
What do I do? What can I do?

195
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:25,400
For us, alone in the darkness,
just envisioning it was a ray of
light.

196
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,333
And, when it shined brightly, we
would feel power grow within us.

197
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:30,400
[gasp]

198
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:37,066
That light was always our guide.
<i>It would reassure us. And</i>
<i>encourage us not to give up.</i>

199
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:45,166
They're right. My friends have
always been there for me as the
light that guides me.

200
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:50,166
And, I too, possess a light. One
that's inside of me.

201
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:55,333
It is the power of everyone's
hearts, united as one.

202
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,333
I just need to believe in it.

203
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,800
I am Super Sailor Moon!

204
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:12,333
The Guardian who shines with the
power of everyone's hearts!

205
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,900
I will become...

206
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,433
...the light that illuminates
the darkness!

207
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:20,800
I will not surrender to darkness
of any kind!

208
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:30,900
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

209
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,300
[quivering gasp]

210
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,166
[gasp, inhale]

211
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:47,966
Yes, Sailor Moon.

212
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:51,233
Your light shines in the dark.

213
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,233
And your light is the one that
guides us.

214
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,400
[sigh]

215
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,133
Welcome to my laboratory, Sailor
Guardians.

216
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:02,833
[grunts]

217
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:03,566
Professor Tomoe!

218
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,866
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

219
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:09,966
You see, my precious Daimons are
starving. They have to be fed.

220
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,133
[thud, grunts]

221
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:14,400
[scream]

222
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,400
[roaring]

[gasp, grunt]

226
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:28,166
Chronos Typhoon.

227
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:31,000
[shrieking roars]

228
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,300
Submarine...

229
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,500
...Reflection!

230
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,233
[bellow]

231
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,300
[grunt]

232
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,233
[laughing]

233
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,300
Go ahead and destroy
them. I can always make more!

234
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,466
[roaring]

235
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,300
Please stop this! We did not
come down here looking to fight
with you.

236
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,300
We came to find Hotaru!

237
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:01,366
Hotaru?

238
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,533
Oh!...My former daughter.

239
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:11,233
She's at the sacred temple,
offering the Legendary Silver
Crystal, the light similar to
that of the Taioron Crystal,

240
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:14,900
...to Master Pharaoh 90 for his
grand resurrection!

241
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,233
Master Pharaoh 90? Who is that?

242
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:18,800
[gasps]

243
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:23,133
Feel that? The Master's
quickening has finally started!

244
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:24,366
[gasp] It's below us!

245
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:29,433
Unfortunately none of you will
get to see it because this will
be your grave!

246
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:33,366
You four shall have the honor of
being my first victims!

247
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:42,800
[growling roar]

248
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:43,900
A Daimon?!

249
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:47,033
I'm nothing like those
expendable Daimons.

250
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,233
I am now a Super Life Form! A
hybrid combination of an alien
with a human being.

251
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,033
Die!

252
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:59,466

No!

256
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,933
Sailor Moon!

257
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:13,066
Space Sword Blaster!

[gasp]

262
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,900
Until a few seconds ago that
thing was Hotaru's dad!

263
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:30,366
He's not anymore. He can't turn
back into a human. He's an
enemy!

264
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:32,233
[roaring]

265

Uranus! No!

Sailor Moon! Use your Rod!

Forgive me Hotaru...

274
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:51,466
Return to the darkness!

275
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:04,266
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

276
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,200
[howling]

00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,433

00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,766
Daddy...

279
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,300
Good‐bye.

280
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:18,966
Daddy.

[gasp]

282
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,500
Who's there?

283
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,766
What is it?

284
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,766
For a moment, it felt like there
was someone else here.

285
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,933
[groan] Something's coming.

286
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:39,266
Garnet Ball!

287
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:44,433
[gasp]

288
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:46,433
<i>The others are still upstairs!</i>

289
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,266
My brooch is... [gasping]

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,366
Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Venus!

291
00:21:57,966 --> 00:21:58,366
[gasping] Huh?!

292
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,433
What's that? What's going on?!

293
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,333
[loud gulp] Down there!

294
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,100

[shuddering]

299
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,233
<i>The power that made me Super</i>
<i>Sailor Moon is gone!</i>

300
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,933
The bond of our hearts has been
cut off...

301
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:30,200
[gasp] Something bad must have
happened to the others...

302
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:33,900
[gasp] Up in the sky...!

303
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,100
Look down there!

304
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
[laughing]

305
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,033
[gasp] It's Hotaru!

306
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:32,066
An enemy shadow has appeared...

307
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,700
Is that...Hotaru?!

308
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,800
Next time, "Act.36 Infinity 10
Infinite ‐ Upper Atmosphere"

309
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,400
The moonlight is a messenger of
love.
