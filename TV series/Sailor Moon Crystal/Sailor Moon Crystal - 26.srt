1
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,150
My name, is Death Phantom.

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,180
Take your best shot,
Queen of the Earth!

3
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,110
You cannot defeat me!

4
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,090
Oh yes I can!

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,090
You want the Earth, you'll
have to go through me!

6
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,020
[gasps]

7
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,160
[gasps]

8
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,060
[gasps]

9
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,200
Where did Nemesis go?
Has it been destroyed?

10
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,090
[gasp]

11
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,090
Where's Sailor Moon?!

12
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,080
Oh no! If that attack caused
Nemesis to implode, the

13
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,110
shockwave could've
hit Sailor Moon!

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,140
Oh no!

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,180
Sailor Moon!

16
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,080
She can't be dead, if
she was, I'd know it.

17
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,040
I'm certain she's alive,
but where is she?!

18
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,170
Usako...

19
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,130
What's going on? My
hands feel so warm!

20
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,170
I can feel power
surging through me!

21
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,180
Her power!

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,060
Tuxedo Mask?

23
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,160
[gasps]

24
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,050
He's gone.

25
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,210
[gasp]

26
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,130
The Crystal Palace!

27
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,220
[gasp]

28
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,190
The King!

29
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,060
Huh? Someone's coming out.

30
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,000
It's...

31
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,220
Neo Queen Serenity!

32
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,140
Mommy!

33
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,010
Mommy!

34
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,110
Aw.

35
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,130
Looks like the king got
his body back, too!

36
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,110
Just look at you, my
dearest daughter.

37
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,230
I'm so proud of you. Your
awakening revived me.

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,070
You fought the darkness of
the Malefic Black Crystal

39
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,150
to realize your true
power as a Moon Princess.

40
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,210
I am so sorry. If it weren't
for me, none of this would

41
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,140
have ever happened.

42
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,120
Forgive me, Mommy.

43
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,070
I couldn't protect you
or this planet...

44
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,230
And now Pluto's dead
too, all because of me.

45
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,230
Listen to me. It's
not your fault.

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You did make a few
mistakes. However,

47
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,160
you have learned from them
and grown as a person.

48
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,190
Mommy.

49
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,000
Now that I have fully
recovered from my injuries,

50
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,230
and my body has healed, I
would be honored if we could

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,130
join forces and you would
help me defend this planet.

52
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,120
Really? I always thought you
didn't need me and that I

53
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,220
just got in the way.

54
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,160
Of course I need you.

55
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,210
I love you, Small Lady, more
than anything else in the world.

56
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,200
[whimper]

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,010
I love you, too. But I don't
know how to be a Guardian.

58
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,090
Don't worry. You'll learn.

59
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,010
You are my daughter.
And I believe in you.

60
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,200
[sobs]

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Thank you your help. I am
sorry you girls had to go

62
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,120
through all of this.

63
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,230
My dear Pluto, from this day
forward you will rest in

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,100
peace, forever enshrined
within the Crystal Palace.

65
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,210
For what you did, I
cannot thank you enough.

66
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,030
After I became Neo Queen
Serenity, I lost nearly all

67
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,210
my ability to fight as
a Sailor Guardian.

68
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,000
I take full responsibility.

69
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,200
Had I done a better job of
defeating Death Phantom in

70
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,120
the first place,
Sailor Moon

71
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,040
would not be in
such danger now.

72
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,130
Wait a sec! Does that mean
you know where Sailor Moon

73
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,020
and Tuxedo Mask
disappeared to?

74
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,160
The Nemesis you fought
was just an illusion.

75
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,000
The Malefic Black
Crystal distorts space.

76
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,220
What you saw
was a hologram.

77
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,110
Which means the planet
itself was never really

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,010
here. That being the
case, there's a good

79
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,200
chance Sailor Moon
is now somewhere

80
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,140
near its actual location.

81
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,180
In space?

82
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,030
And if she is there,
Tuxedo Mask could be,

83
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,010
as well. Her power may
have drawn him to her.

84
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,210
Small Lady, you, and
you alone are capable

85
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,200
of finding Sailor
Moon and Tuxedo Mask.

86
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,040
As Death Phantom's hatred
continues to fester and

87
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,020
grow, Nemesis grows
right along with it.

88
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,160
Both must be sealed
away, permanently.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,120
Sailor Moon and Tuxedo
Mask need help,

90
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,230
but I am not able
to assist them.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,180
Will you take this
Space-Time Key, and

92
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,220
use your power to aid
them on my behalf?

93
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,890
I will.

94
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,110
I want to be like Sailor
Moon: someone with a strong

95
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,030
heart, who's not afraid
in the face of evil.

96
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,230
Even though I only
just got my powers,

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,020
and there's still a
lot I have to learn.

98
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,180
I'm a Guardian! If she needs
me, then I have to go!

99
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,150
That's my girl. I
have one more thing

100
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,230
for you, Small Lady.

101
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,230
Mommy's Moon Rod!

102
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,130
[affirmative grunt]

103
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,210
Pluto... Please
show me the way.

104
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,000
Take me to Sailor Moon!

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
But Queen, shouldn't
we go with her?

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
[gasp]

107
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,160
We wait right here...

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,230
Until the three of
them return.

109
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,180
It's so quiet...
and still.

110
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
What a lonely place... It
makes me feel so empty.

111
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,220
I'm not sure where I am.

112
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,190
Usako.

113
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,110
Mamo. Where are we?

114
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,150
I'm not sure. Somewhere
in deep space, I think.

115
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,110
Over there. Look!

116
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,220
[chuckling] This
planet, my host body,

117
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,180
will be your graves!

118
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,100
[gasp]

119
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,060
Then I'll have the
Malefic Black Crystal

120
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,150
and the Silver Crystal!
With their awesome

121
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,070
powers, the entire universe
will belong to me!

122
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,210
[manic laugh]

123
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,190
So much blood has been
spilled because of the

124
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,160
Legendary Silver Crystal.

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,140
Maybe the Crystal shouldn't
exist. Maybe I shouldn't.

126
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,230
The universe might be
better off without us.

127
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,180
I disagree. Think of the
countless lives and souls

128
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,180
both you and the
Crystal have saved.

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,170
Stay focused, Usako.

130
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,180
Remember to believe in
yourself and keep going.

131
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,190
And if you ever feel
lost or uncertain, I will

132
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,120
always be here for you.

133
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,010
You're my life. I exist to
give you the strength to

134
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,230
keep fighting. I am yours:
mind, body, and soul.

135
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,160
You know what, I didn't
realize until just now.

136
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,010
I've never been able to use
the Crystal's full power,

137
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,210
unless you were
somewhere close by.

138
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I couldn't have done any of
this without you. Only when

139
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,170
I'm with you, can
I be who I really am

140
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,170
and become who I
was meant to be.

141
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,160
We are more than soulmates.
You and I are one.

142
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,000
Our bond makes us strong.

143
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,000
And our love gives
us infinite power...

144
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,080
[gasp]

145
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
What's this light?

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,160
It feels so warm...

147
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,120
...like a newborn star!

148
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,210
Sailor Moon!
Tuxedo Mask!

149
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,010
[gasp]

150
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,010
I've come here on behalf
of Neo Queen Serenity.

151
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,170
I may be small,
but I can help!

152
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,220
Chibi-Usa!

153
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,140
[laugh]

154
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,110
Death Phantom.

155
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,020
I am the Pretty
Guardian Trainee!

156
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,210
Who fights for love,
and for justice!

157
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,110
I am Sailor Chibi Moon!

158
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,140
And now in the name of the
future Moon, I'll punish you!

159
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,130
[chuckle] Pathetic little
princess! Now you're

160
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,010
challenging me? You don't
even know what power is!

161
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,180
Don't listen to him!

162
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,110
All you need to do is
believe in yourself,

163
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,220
and you can do it!

164
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,160
Just clear your mind
and try to concentrate.

165
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,150
Trust in your own power.

166
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,200
Focus. Then hit him with
everything you've got!

167
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,020
Let's show Nemesis the true
power of the Legendary

168
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,220
Silver Crystal together!

169
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,020
Moon Princess!

170
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,180
Halation!

171
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,150
[grunting]

172
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,020
[gasps]

173
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,200
The Queen brought the
planet back to life.

174
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,010
It's not my doing.

175
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,010
Sailor Moon
deserves your praise.

176
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,160
She, Tuxedo Mask, and Small
Lady combined their powers.

177
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,000
Together they struck
down Nemesis.

178
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,160
Sailor Moon!

179
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,050
She did it!

180
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,120
Sailor Guardians, I
shall now bestow upon

181
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,140
you new Planet Powers.

182
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,070
Sailor Mercury, The
Guardian of Wisdom.

183
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,020
Sailor Mars, The
Guardian of War.

184
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,130
Sailor Jupiter, The
Guardian of Protection.

185
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,180
And Sailor Venus,
The Guardian of Love.

186
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,020
May these new powers allow
you to fight alongside

187
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,210
Sailor Moon for
centuries to come.

188
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,160
It's so warm!

189
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,070
It feels like
it's overflowing!

190
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,040
Now then, Sailor Moon
will be back soon.

191
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,210
She'll be arriving
shortly at the Door of

192
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,140
Space and Time.
Go to her.

193
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,060
What about you,
your Majesty?

194
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,010
Aren't you going
to come?

195
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,030
I must return to the Crystal
Palace without seeing her.

196
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,020
Why's that?

197
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,090
It's forbidden to
meet one's past self.

198
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,180
Such an encounter
could alter history.

199
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,150
So in order to grant
Sailor Moon new power,

200
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,220
I shall have to bestow
it upon her from here.

201
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,140
Sailor Moon...

202
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,020
The Guardian of Mystery.

203
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,020
I give you this new brooch,
so that you may continue to

204
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,010
keep the Legendary
Silver Crystal

205
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,070
safe and close
to your heart.

206
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,190
And I further grant
you Cosmic Power!

207
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,170
So you can keep
fighting for love and for

208
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,180
justice, with more
courage than ever!

209
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,000
Sailor Moon!
Sailor Moon!

210
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,728
[gasp]

211
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,200
Chibi-Usa, it's
you. And Mamo...

212
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,210
[gasp] And everyone!

213
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,080
You defeated Nemesis,
Sailor Moon. 30th-century

214
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,070
Earth and Crystal Tokyo
are back to normal.

215
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,150
[sigh]

216
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,040
A new brooch?
How'd I get this?

217
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,150
Where's the Queen?!

218
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,230
She's fine.

219
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,160
She's fully recovered and
back home at the palace.

220
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,230
And now that the future
is safe, it's about time

221
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,170
we were headed
home ourselves.

222
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,150
Everybody ready?

223
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,050
Pluto may be gone,
but I'll guide us back,

224
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,210
just like she showed me.

225
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,070
I suppose we should get
going. After all, two

226
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,070
versions of the same
person can't exist

227
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,040
in the same time.

228
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,110
Guess I won't ever be
able to meet the Queen.

229
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,050
Still, I wish I could
talk to her, even if it

230
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,000
was just for a moment.

231
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,040
But I know I can't. To do
that, would change the

232
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,200
course of history.

233
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,010
I have to go...

234
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,060
Sailor Moon?

235
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,210
But I want to see her...

236
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
I want to talk to her...

237
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,170
Even if it does
change history!

238
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,100
[gasp]

239
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,080
Sailor Moon!

240
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,210
Neo Queen Serenity!

241
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,100
Words cannot express
how grateful I am.

242
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,090
Thank you so much!

243
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,030
No, please. I should
be thanking you.

244
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,210
Your Majesty...

245
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,100
I'm so grateful!

246
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,220
There's so much that I wish
I could talk to you about!

247
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,180
[gasps]

248
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,170
[gasps]

249
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,000
This is our future...

250
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,020
Someday that will be us...

251
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Until that day comes,
Goodbye! Goodbye!

252
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,030
Hunh. I'm back
home in my own bed.

253
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,040
The future, the Queen,
and Chibi-Usa.

254
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,070
Was it all just a dream?

255
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,080
Good morning, Usagi!

256
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,190
Time to get up!

257
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,100
Stop going so fast!

258
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,190
You're the one who's
going too slow!

259
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,080
Hey, Chibi-Usa!
What gives?

260
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,230
How come you've got so much
stuff in your backpack?

261
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,010
Are you really gonna bring
all of that to school?

262
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,020
I know it's a lot,
but I just couldn't

263
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,050
leave these
things behind.

264
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,040
Huh?

265
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,230
I gotta go back
to the future.

266
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,030
I wanna take
these with me.

267
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,190
Oh yeah. I guess you
do have to go back...

268
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,020
Oops, uh, I think I left
something at home.

269
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,200
Go on without me. I'll
catch ya later. Bye!

270
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,030
Usagi, wait!

271
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,010
Usagi?

272
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,050
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to upset you.

273
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,120
Please don't be mad.

274
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,050
[crying]

275
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,030
I wish I could stay longer.

276
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,010
It's not like I don't want
to. I really like it here.

277
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,230
I kinda thought you'd be
happy. All I ever seemed to

278
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,120
do was get on your nerves.

279
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,080
That doesn't mean you
have to leave forever!

280
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,230
You're right! You do
get on my nerves!

281
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,040
And you're selfish,
and bratty, and

282
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,100
you're always following me,
but I still want you around!

283
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,080
Please stop crying, Usagi!

284
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,220
I'm not crying!
You're crying!

285
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,050
I can see the
tears on your face!

286
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,140
[crying]

287
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,040
Usagi... [crying]

288
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,090
It will be so lonely here
without you, Chibi-Usa!

289
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,000
[sobbing] Please don't go!

290
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,100
[crying]

291
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,130
Why does she have to leave
now, just when we were starting

292
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,220
getting along? I'll
miss you, Chibi-Usa!

293
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,090
Alright, that's enough
crying for one day.

294
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,050
Let's get you home.

295
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,210
This is where it all
started. Mamo and

296
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,070
I kissed right here.

297
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,110
And then Chibi-Usa
fell out of the sky.

298
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,220
Leaving so soon?

299
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,030
[gasps]

300
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Mamo!

301
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,100
You forgot something.

302
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,060
Now be a good girl.

303
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,090
You're my knight in shining
armor. Even though you wear

304
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,130
a mask and cape.
Thanks, Mamo.

305
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,130
Oh! I'd better hurry up.

306
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,160
Mommy and Daddy
are calling me.

307
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,140
Here, Usagi.
Mommy sent this.

308
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,020
It's for you.

309
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,230
A Heart Moon Rod, to go
with your new powers.

310
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,230
I never said, but I
always liked it when

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,060
you and Mamo would
call me Chibi-Usa.

312
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,100
It made me feel special.

313
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,110
Chibi-Usa...

314
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,030
Staying at your house with
your family, making new

315
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,030
friends, and playing
with everyone.

316
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,140
I loved every
minute of it!

317
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,020
I'm so happy I
got to come here.

318
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,020
Chibi-Usa!

319
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,060
Bye Mamo!
Goodbye Usagi!

320
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,150
Out of everyone, I
loved you the best!

321
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,220
I'm going to miss
you most of all!

322
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,030
Chibi-Usa!

323
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,060
[crying]

324
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,070
Don't cry. We'll
see her again.

325
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,140
After all, she is
our daughter.

326
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,120
Mamo's right. I know
we'll see each other

327
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,100
again someday,
Chibi-Usa.

328
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,070
It's a bit like... I
just woke up from a

329
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,170
really, really
long dream.

330
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,120
Like the kind where it
feels like you're riding a

331
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,110
roller-coaster, you
know what I mean?

332
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,080
Except it wasn't a
dream. It was the future,

333
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,080
and it will be here
before we know it.

334
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,100
I wonder how long it
will be before I have

335
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,040
to use this rod?

336
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,040
I can't stay
depressed forever.

337
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,050
Though it's a long time
from now, the future

338
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,010
I saw will one day be
my life. Before I get

339
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,190
there, I have a
lot left to do.

340
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,040
And no matter what
happens, I know he'll

341
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,050
always be by my side.

342
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,010
Hm?

343
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,180
[groaning]

344
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,010
Hey, I'm back! So
did you miss me?

345
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,080
Chi, Chi, Chi, Chi
Chibi-Usa, you're back?

346
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,030
Here, this is for you! It's
a letter from Mommy!

347
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,200
"Dear all,"

348
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,090
"I can't thank you enough
for allowing Small Lady to

349
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,170
train with you. Please
take good care of our

350
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,110
daughter while she's there.
Sincerely yours, Serenity."

351
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,170
Looks like your handwriting,
and it does sound like

352
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,180
something you'd write.

353
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,120
Yup! I'm back in the past,
and I'm here to stay!

354
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,010
[crying with joy]

355
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,020
Chibi-Usa!
