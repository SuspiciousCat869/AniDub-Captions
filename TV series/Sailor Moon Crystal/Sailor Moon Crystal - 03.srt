1
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,120
Jadeite!

2
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,000
You have already failed
twice. There will be
consequences.

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,160
I'm very sorry.

4
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,090
Well the monsters
you create are just
clay dolls, aren't they?

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,080
[gasp]

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,050
Of course they're
going to be weak.

7
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,060
Queen Beryl, please
allow me, Nephrite,
your loyal general,

8
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,180
to succeed where
Jadeite has failed.

9
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,140
I can gather even more
energy for our Great

10
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,180
Ruler, and do it
more efficiently.

11
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,130
And I'll get my hands
on the Legendary Silver
Crystal.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,120
You can be certain of it.

13
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,150
Certain? Are you sure?

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,020
What if those Sailor
Guardians show up
again?

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,140
Zoisite...

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,090
For all we know, they
may be after the Legendary
Silver Crystal as well.

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Queen Beryl, if I may be
so bold as to ask, what

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,080
exactly is this Legendary
Silver Crystal?

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,170
Why is it so important?

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,180
The Legendary Silver
Crystal is a stone that is
the source of all energy.

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,190
I have been told it has
unfathomable, limitless
power. And that the one

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:44,040
who wields it will
become the ruler of
the entire universe!

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,210
[gasps]

24
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,140
But for now, do
not worry about
it.

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,130
Our priority is to rid
ourselves of those
who would interfere.

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,140
I will give you one last
chance, Jadeite.

27
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,190
Yes, my queen.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,210
I will go myself and
eliminate the Sailor
Guardians.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,160
No matter what.

30
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,060
It's coming. Something's
coming. I can sense it.

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,210
Something evil is
about to unleash
chaos on our world.

32
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,230
Today was fun, Rei!
Can I come back
again tomorrow?

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,220
Sure. Get home safe
now, Mii. Be careful.

34
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,170
I will! Bye!

35
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,070
Have you guys heard the
latest rumor? About
the Demon Bus?

36
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,140
Yeah! I heard it's
the bus that runs
through Sendaizaka!

37
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,140
Demon Bus?
What's that?

38
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,150
How could you not know?

39
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,000
They say the bus that
goes through Sendaizkaue
at 6:00 PM sharp is cursed!

40
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,120
Anyone riding it
disappears never
to return!

41
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,220
They say the bus
driver is Death
himself.

42
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,120
And the final
destination is
Hell!

43
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,210
Knock it off, guys!
You're scaring me.

44
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,210
Wow, kids really do
love to gossip,
don't they.

45
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,230
Hey, Usagi. Wake up!

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,070
[tired groans]

47
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,200
C'mon. Get up. We're
supposed to go meet
Ami after school.

48
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,170
But I'm so sleepy...

49
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,200
Even if we're
meeting at the
arcade?

50
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,220
At the arcade?

51
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,230
Okay!

52
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,160
I still can't wrap
my head around it.

53
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,120
Usagi and I are both
real Sailor Guardians?

54
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,010
Well it's still
brand new to you.

55
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,100
I'm sure you'll
get used to it soon.

56
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,130
Luna, what happens
now? What do we do
next?

57
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,110
We have two missions,
to find and protect our
Princess as well as the

58
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,230
Legendary Silver Crystal.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,210
Alright! I beat
level two!

60
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,180
So that's our mission?
Find a Princess and
a Crystal?

61
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,200
You're going to cram
school again?

62
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,130
Do you have to? It's
no fun without you!

63
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,030
Why don't you come
with me then?

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,100
Uh...

65
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,080
If you do, you might
get to catch a glimpse
of a really pretty girl.

66
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,080
Huh?

67
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,010
I see her a lot when
I take this bus.

68
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,230
Really? What does
she look like?

69
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, she wears a
uniform from the
T.A. Girls' Academy.

70
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,160
"The 66 via Sendaizaka"
Does that mean it's the
Demon Bus?

71
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,100
[nervous laugh]

72
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,140
Couldn't be.

73
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,446
[gasp]

74
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,160
Oh...

75
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,110
What was that?

76
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,150
So pretty...

77
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,210
Usagi, don't stare at
her like that! It's
rude!

78
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,130
Wait! I'm getting off
here too! Bye, Ami!
See ya!

79
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,030
Huh?

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,050
Okay...

81
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,200
What are you
doing Usagi?

82
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,090
Did you get off here
just to chase after
that girl?

83
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,040
She's so beautiful!
And I've got nothing
else to do.

84
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Oh, no! Luna, I've
lost her! It's
all your fault!

85
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,180
Well... She could have
gone into this shrine.

86
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,010
Really? You
think so?

87
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,220
I sense an evil aura.

88
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,060
Could it be a ghost?

89
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,000
No demon or spectre is
going to haunt this
sacred shrine.

90
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,050
Not while I'm here!

91
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,150
[screaming]

92
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,000
Evil spirit, be gone!

93
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,030
Ugh...

94
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
Agh!

95
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,110
Hunh? The girl
from the bus?

96
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,180
Um, Miss Usagi, is it?
I'm so sorry.

97
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,120
I sensed an evil aura
I thought was coming
from you.

98
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,230
An evil aura?

99
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,190
That's weird. But who
cares? She's beautiful
and a shrine maiden!

100
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,020
So cool!

101
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,110
Still it's strange.
Phobos and Deimos don't
usually attack regular

102
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
people unless they've
been provoked.

103
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,100
[giggle]

104
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,180
Did they feel it too?
Is there something
more to this girl?

105
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,190
Can I help you?

106
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,030
Oh Rei! It's Mii!
She's gone missing!

107
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,010
[gasp]

108
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,170
She didn't come home?

109
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,140
You know this has always been
a dangerous neighborhood.
And lately everyone's been

110
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,020
talking about some kind
of demon bus too.

111
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,080
[laughing]

112
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,030
Though that's not to
say you and this
shrine are dangerous.

113
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,060
I think we
should go.

114
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh. Alright then.

115
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,180
I'm telling you that
girl is not normal.

116
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,180
They say she can sense
the supernatural!

117
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,120
Hm?

118
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,220
So, um, this little
girl, Mii, is she
your friend?

119
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,200
Yes. She likes to play
here after school sometimes

120
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,050
while she waits for the
bus to take her home.

121
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,150
The bus?
Do you mean-?

122
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,130
Sendaizkaue has five
hills. Their slopes
intersect near here.

123
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,050
There's an urban legend
about a mysterious sixth
hill, that's invisible.

124
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,070
Huh?

125
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,220
They say it's a gateway,
and that's the reason why

126
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,200
the Demon Bus supposedly
vanishes there.

127
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,230
[gasp]

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,070
Do you know what
they say when
someone disappears?

129
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,040
Hm?

130
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,010
They call it being
Spirited away...

131
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,140
Oh...

132
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,040
Did you guys
see the news?

133
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,010
A first year student has
been missing for four days!

134
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,456
Yeah!

135
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:40,160
You know it's
the Demon Bus!

136
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,060
Has to be! It's
so scary!

137
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,050
Do you really believe
it? That this is all
because of some bus?

138
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,140
Well the kids are
missing. So something's
going on.

139
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,000
Spirited away, huh?

140
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,220
[giggling]

141
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,020
I'm wearing mine too!
How cute! We're
matching!

142
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,080
Hey Luna, let's go
see Rei again. I wanna
go ask her something.

143
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,030
Sounds good. I was
just thinking about
her.

144
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,030
Huh?

145
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,060
Rei's a beautiful and
very mysterious girl.

146
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,010
She has a regal face,
and spiritual powers.

147
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,220
I think perhaps she
could be our missing
princess.

148
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,070
[gasp]

149
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Oh wow!

150
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,220
She's definitely
pretty enough!

151
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,220
Then again, she could
be something else.

152
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,090
[sigh]

153
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,230
How many cram schools
does Ami have to go to?

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,060
She really should be
here. What if something
happens?

155
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,130
Don't worry, Usagi.

156
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,210
You can stay in touch
with her by using your
communicator.

157
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,160
Huh? You mean this?

158
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,180
Isn't it just a
regular old watch?

159
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,060
Meow! Meow! Meow!

160
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,517
[meowing]

161
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:47,090
Luna? What's
the matter?

162
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,200
[frantically meowing]

163
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,050
Why're you talking
to yourself?

164
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,090
Agh! It's you again!

165
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,080
We seem to bump into
each other a lot.

166
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,050
There's no need
to scream.

167
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,020
Uh... Are you in
junior high, too?

168
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,070
No! I'm a high
school student!

169
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,200
Mamoru Chiba, Moto-
Azabu Private High
School?

170
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,000
Hm...

171
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,210
Um... Have you heard
of the Demon Bus?

172
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
Yes I have.

173
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,160
Supposed to be this
bus line, right?

174
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,100
Huh?

175
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,100
Agh!

176
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,070
Meow!

177
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,160
My heart! It's
beating so fast
again!

178
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,030
Please Rei, use your
spiritual powers to
find my daughter.

179
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,110
I beg of you!

180
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,060
I'm so sorry, but my
powers don't work like
that. I can't just

181
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,040
meditate and tell
you where Mii is.

182
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,020
[gasps]

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,080
I think it's best
left to the police.

184
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,090
Her child is missing!

185
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,040
You're supposed to be
psychic! Why don't
you help her?

186
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,090
Maybe you had something to
do with Mii's disappearance!
And this is all your fault!

187
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,200
Hey, wait a minute!

188
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,050
How dare you accuse
Rei! She's a beautiful
girl, both inside and out!

189
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,020
Huh?!

190
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,090
Miss Usagi...

191
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,190
Rei would never do such
a thing! How could you
even think that?!

192
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,060
Where have the
children gone, then?
Do you know?

193
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,210
Uh! Well yeah, that's
a good question...

194
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,210
What are you trying to
say? Are you involved
in this too?

195
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,220
What? No! I-I just...
I-I don't have anything
to do with it!

196
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,060
All of you please...

197
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,210
Just leave now!

198
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,120
Ever since I was a small
child, my spiritual powers
have made me an outcast.

199
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,020
And there were some
who even called me
a freak.

200
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,200
Why was I born this way?
I don't understand.

201
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,110
Oh Rei...

202
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,220
Everything will be
okay. I'll help you
find Mii!

203
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,080
Thank you, Usagi.

204
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,210
But you should stay
away from me and not
come here anymore.

205
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,230
There's nothing we
can do. We should go.

206
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,080
I need to concentrate.
What's going on here?

207
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,040
I know something's about
to happen. But what?

208
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,130
[gasp]

209
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,040
Who is that?

210
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
[gasp]

211
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,220
Usagi's in danger!

212
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,150
Hmph!

213
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,080
[gasp]

214
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,140
You're the one...

215
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,120
[gasp]

216
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh no! It's Rei!

217
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,220
Do you think that
could be the Demon
Bus? Agh!

218
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,150
What's happening to it?!

219
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,100
[gasp]

220
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,030
I gotta go save Rei!

221
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,050
Moon Power!

222
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,150
Why did you change into
a flight attendant? How's
that gonna help?

223
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,010
It's my duty to ensure
the safety and comfort

224
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,000
of all the passengers,
no matter what!

225
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,050
Agh!

226
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,210
[gasps]

227
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,210
[meowing]

228
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,060
Interesting...

229
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,130
She definitely
transformed.

230
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,220
Who is that girl?

231
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Ami, can you hear me?
Usagi is in trouble!

232
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,080
What?!

233
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,150
You should have just
killed them, Jadeite.

234
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Hello, Nephrite. There's
a good reason to keep them
alive.

235
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,140
Living hostages are
better for luring out
the Sailor Guardians.

236
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,000
[whining]

237
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,040
Where am I? I'm scared.
And Luna and Tuxedo Mask
can't save me this time.

238
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,000
[crying]

239
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,150
[sobbing]

240
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,040
Somebody help me!

241
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,070
Oh! The communicator!

242
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,120
Luna!

243
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,150
Help! Where am I?

244
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,020
Well Luna? Can you
track her location?

245
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,040
[frustrated groan]

246
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,170
I need a stronger
signal. This one's
too weak.

247
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,150
Wait, what if she
transformed into Sailor
Moon? Would that help?

248
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,070
Uh... Yeah.

249
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,110
And once we know
where Usagi is, can
we teleport there?

250
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,080
Yes!

251
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,040
Come help me! Please!

252
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,090
Usagi, transform now!

253
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,040
Huh? Okay!

254
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,120
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

255
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,120
Mercury Power
Make Up!

256
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,150
So beautiful...

257
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,090
I'm strangely attracted
to her, like we've met
somewhere before.

258
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,170
Get away from
her! Right now!

259
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,100
You!

260
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,120
I am the Pretty
Guardian!

261
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,090
Who fights for love
and for justice! I
am Sailor Moon!

262
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,140
And now in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish
you!

263
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,050
I am the Pretty Guardian,
who fights for love and
for intelligence!

264
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,060
I am Sailor Mercury!

265
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,110
Douse yourself in
water and repent!

266
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,190
Here at last. I've
been waiting.

267
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,150
Release Rei and the
others you took right
now!

268
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,190
Mr. Uh...
whoever you are!

269
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,060
My name is Jadeite. I'm
one of the Four Kings
of the Dark Kingdom!

270
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,020
Agh!

271
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,190
Mercury Aqua Mist!

272
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,040
Save Rei and the others!

273
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,110
Okay!

274
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,110
Huh? When did it
get so cold?

275
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,140
Is that the best you
Sailor Guardians can
do? Pitiful.

276
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,050
Against me, you
don't stand a
chance!

277
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,140
[screaming]

278
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,110
I will freeze you, and
make you bow down before
our Great Ruler!

279
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,140
No!

280
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,110
Was all this just a
trap to get us here
and take us prisoner?

281
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,070
Usagi? Is that you?
What's going on here?

282
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,040
No, Rei! It's not
me! I'm not Usagi!

283
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,110
Ah...

284
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,110
Why are you
fighting him?

285
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,090
Well I kinda have to
because I'm a Sailor
Guardian. And normal

286
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,030
people can't exactly
fight evil like this!

287
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,100
Ya know, 'cause power
and like responsibility...

288
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,200
Usagi and that other
girl have powers too?
Are they like me?

289
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,190
[screaming]

290
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,170
[gasp]

291
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,110
[gasp]

292
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,100
Stop! Don't get in
my way! Let go!

293
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,150
I won't!

294
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,110
Hmph! I wouldn't do
that if I were you.
You're only human.

295
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,110
No! I'm more
than that!

296
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,050
[gasp]

297
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,120
I'm not an
ordinary human.

298
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,210
I'm special and I won't
let you hurt anyone else.
Anymore!

299
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,090
[groaning]

300
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,548
[gasp]

301
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,160
There is is...
That vision?

302
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,110
There's no doubt
about it now! Rei,
catch!

303
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,569
Huh?

304
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,170
Hold that pen and yell,
"Mars Power Make Up"!
You have to hurry!

305
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,050
[affirmative grunt]

306
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,070
[giggle]

307
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,120
I understand now. It's
up to me. I know what
I have to do.

308
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,170
Mars Power
Make Up!

309
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,170
I am the Pretty Guardian,
who fights for love and
for passion.

310
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,130
I am Sailor Mars.

311
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,060
In the name of Mars,
I'll chastise you!

312
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,210
Amazing!

313
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,180
[giggle]

314
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,180
I knew it, Rei! You
had to be! You are one
of the Sailor Guardians!

315
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,100
You're Sailor Mars!

316
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,120
Watch out!

317
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,180
Is that why I was
born this way? With
these powers?

318
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,180
Was it all so I
could help Usagi?
As a Sailor Guardian?

319
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,180
Usagi!

320
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay!

321
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,220
Moon Tiara Boomerang!

322
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,120
Agh!

323
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,070
Now Sailor Mars!
Finish him off!

324
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,140
An evil being who
abducts innocent
children...

325
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,140
Must not be allowed to
exist in this world.

326
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Evil Spirit,
be gone!

327
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,070
You'll pay for
this, Sailor Mars!

328
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,130
Hello, Mii.

329
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,100
Rei!

330
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,070
Huh? How did...
I get here.

331
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,120
The Sailor Guardians
came. They saved you
and brought you back.

332
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,110
Huh...

333
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,110
Mii!

334
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,160
Mommy!

335
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,200
Mii! Thank goodness!
I was so worried!

336
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,030
There are three Sailor
Guardians now that you're
with us, Rei.

337
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,020
Yeah!

338
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm so glad that we
found you, Sailor Mars.

339
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,230
We're glad you could
join us. We've been
needing someone like you.

340
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,518
[happy laugh]

341
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,190
Another Guardian,
found. Now let's do the
same for our Princess

342
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,190
and the Legendary
Silver Crystal, too.

343
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,010
Yeah! Let's find them.
I know we can do it!

344
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,230
Can you tell us
what's in the box?

345
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,230
[news reporter chatter]

346
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:33,120
Usagi! They're gonna
display the royal treasure
of "D" at the Masquerade Ball!

347
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,230
A Masquerade Ball!

348
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,210
Usagi, you're
missing the
point!

349
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,190
A romantic dance
with Tuxedo Mask!
[giggling]

350
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,190
It could be the Legendary
Silver Crystal we're
looking for!

351
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,140
Moon Power! Change
me into a princess!

352
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,110
Are you listening
to me?!

353
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,190
Act Four, "Masquerade
Dance Party."

354
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,120
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
