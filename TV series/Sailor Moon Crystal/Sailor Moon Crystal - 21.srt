1
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,468
[snicker]

2
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,130
Usako...

3
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,060
No!

4
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,140
Sailor Moon...

5
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,080
Hunh? Where am I?

6
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,100
Mamo?

7
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,518
[gasp]

8
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,080
Chibi-Usa?

9
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,020
Wait!

10
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,030
Where are you going? Come
back! Don't leave me here!

11
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,120
[gasp]

12
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,060
[groaning]

13
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,020
My head is throbbing. What
happened? I can't remember...

14
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,170
[gasp]

15
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,030
Why am I dressed like this?

16
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,050
[gasp]

17
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,060
My brooch!

18
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,170
[sigh of relief]

19
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,170
What... is this place?

20
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,070
That image...

21
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,130
Is that me?

22
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,110
No. It's Neo Queen Serenity.

23
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,030
Admiring my hologram?
Stunning, isn't it.

24
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,080
These are my private
chambers in Black Moon

25
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,090
Castle on the
planet Nemesis.

26
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,110
Welcome, Sailor Moon...

27
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,070
Or should I say the future
Neo Queen Serenity.

28
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,210
That gown appears
to suit you...

29
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,070
I am Prince Dimande of the
Black Moon. Please...

30
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,200
Relax and make yourself
comfortable.

31
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
[grunting]

32
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,120
My body just
moved on its own!

33
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,120
I unleashed the full
force of my Evil

34
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,230
Sight's power upon you.

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,160
And yet you have already
regained consciousness.

36
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,230
The power of the Legendary
Silver Crystal is strong

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,030
with you indeed.

38
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,130
Tell me why you launched an
attack on Crystal Tokyo!

39
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,160
"Why"?

40
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,070
I wanted to prove that the
Legendary Silver Crystal is

41
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,060
not the only invincible
power in the universe.

42
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,150
And I succeeded.

43
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,090
Deluded by the fantasies of
eternal life and limitless

44
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,170
power, the people of
Earth had become

45
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,130
lazy and decadent.

46
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,170
They disgusted us.

47
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,190
Don't like the world?
Then why not remake it?

48
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,180
If you wish to have power
and truly change this

49
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,110
planet, go to Nemesis.

50
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,060
Obtain the Malefic Black
Crystal and anything you

51
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,090
want can be yours.

52
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,000
Nemesis: the untouchable
planet. As long as I control

53
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,000
the supreme power of its
Malefic Black Crystal,

54
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,170
any world in any dimension
is mine for the taking!

55
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,100
Against that awesome power,
the Legendary Silver Crystal

56
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,220
is but a mere stone.

57
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,210
The strong shall
inherit the Earth.

58
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,160
This revolting, utopian world
should never have existed!

59
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,120
Let us send an army into the
past, back to a time before

60
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,110
the Moon Kingdom took over!

61
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,120
History, shall be re-forged,
and the Black Moon will

62
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,210
claim the future!

63
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,110
[horrified gasps]

64
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,170
So that is our grand plan.

65
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,090
Operation Re-play: the
rewriting of history.

66
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,220
Rewrite history!?

67
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,010
Eternal youth and
everlasting peace are

68
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,140
fantasies. Immortality is
against nature. That which

69
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,170
is born is meant to die.

70
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,150
Altering history will
create a proper future.

71
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,090
You're completely insane!

72
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,538
Hmph.

73
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,000
[screaming]

74
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,010
[crying]

75
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,120
Stop crying,
you little brat!

76
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,190
Small Lady!?

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,010
I never dreamed I
would actually see her.

78
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,190
Yet the all-powerful
goddess, always kept

79
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,230
behind palace walls, is
right in front of me.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,190
And she is the most
beautiful thing I

81
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
have ever seen.

82
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,000
But her eyes are
cold and she looks

83
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,130
on me with disdain.

84
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,170
To her, I am less than
human, merely an

85
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,020
enemy to be dealt with.

86
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,000
[gasp]

87
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,190
Surrender! You are
now under my control!

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,130
It was such awesome and
terrifying power...

89
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,000
I saw, for the first
time, what the Legendary

90
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,090
Silver Crystal
was capable of.

91
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,100
Since that day, I have not
been able to forget the look

92
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,170
in those eyes.

93
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,140
I needed to see her again.

94
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,180
I wished to make her
grovel before me.

95
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,010
I had to have her... by
any means necessary.

96
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,090
And now you
are finally mine.

97
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,100
Yes. That's the
look I remember.

98
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,000
The beautiful ruler, of
the beautiful planet.

99
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,090
Neo Queen...

100
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,130
Serenity...

101
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
[gasp] No!

102
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,100
Moon Crystal Power!

103
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,010
Make up!

104
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,476
[gasp]

105
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,140
I can't transform!?

106
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,030
[chuckling] This planet is
made entirely of Malefic

107
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,180
Black Crystal, which absorbs
and nullifies all other

108
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,160
energies, even the
power of the Legendary

109
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,180
Silver Crystal.

110
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,000
No...

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,180
Feel free to move about
the castle as you wish.

112
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,180
Think about this as your
home from now on. You will

113
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,160
be remaining here as my
permanent guest. [laughing]

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,230
The Black Moon... They're not
human. They're demons!

115
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,466
Nemesis...

116
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,150
Once again, it has
vanished from orbit.

117
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,150
King Endymion, if Sailor
Moon and the others are

118
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,200
really on that dark
planet, then we have

119
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,190
to rescue them as
soon as possible!

120
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,230
Yes, I know.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,150
But we have to find Nemesis
before we canget near it.

122
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,200
What we need is the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

123
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,010
It alone can help
us save our friends.

124
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,000
But the only two people
who can use it aren't here.

125
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,230
Without Neo Queen
Serenity or Sailor

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,030
Moon, there's no way.

127
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,120
Hmm... [gasp]

128
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,040
Chibi-Usa...

129
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,160
What about Chibi-Usa? As Neo
Queen Serenity's daughter,

130
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,190
she should be able to use
the Silver Crystal too.

131
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,180
She is the heir of Silver
Millennium, isn't she?

132
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,020
She is of royal blood,
but Small Lady does

133
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,210
not have any power.

134
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,210
[gasp]

135
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,200
How old do you think she
is? Six, seven maybe?

136
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,180
She is in fact nine
hundred years old.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,160
Nine hundred years old?!

138
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,050
One day she just stopped
growing, and has been like

139
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,160
that ever since.
She has no power,

140
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,120
and she cannot
transform.

141
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Poor thing.

142
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,160
What if she never transforms
or learns to use the

143
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,060
Crystal? Will she
still take the throne?

144
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,200
Yes, but I believe one
day she will awaken.

145
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,010
She will grow up. It is her
destiny to protect this

146
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,230
world like her mother has.

147
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,230
King Endymion, is there
anything else you know

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,140
about the Black Moon?

149
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,210
You said the group had a
history of causing trouble.

150
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,070
How did it all start?

151
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,200
There was an incident
several centuries ago.

152
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,050
Crystal Tokyo had become
the most beautiful place

153
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,040
on Earth, a city of
peace and tranquility.

154
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,130
Then a mad tyrant appeared,
bent on inciting havoc and

155
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,180
destruction. His
name was Phantom.

156
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,170
Up to that point, Neo Queen
Serenity had watched over

157
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,220
Crystal Tokyo quietly.

158
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,210
But when the city was
threatened, she intervened

159
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,200
and fought to protect it.

160
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,150
Phantom was captured
and banished to Nemesis.

161
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,010
All access to the
planet was cut off.

162
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,010
Time passed. Harmony
returned. People forgot what

163
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,050
had happened. And
all was quiet...

164
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,170
Until a new group of
radicals showed up out of

165
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,010
nowhere, demanding
death to all the people

166
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,140
of the Moon Kingdom. Like
Phantom, they had dark

167
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,140
crescent marks on
their foreheads.

168
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,140
So I'm assuming these
radicals are the Black Moon?

169
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,010
Is that right?

170
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,070
Do you think they
could possibly be

171
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,220
descendants of Phantom?

172
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,060
I have no idea. But
whether they are or not is

173
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,140
immaterial. I refuse to let
them cause any more harm.

174
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,160
I swear, I will save you...

175
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,070
Hold on, Usako...

176
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,190
[gasp] Mamo?

177
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,000
Mamo, Venus, Luna...
I'm scared...

178
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,230
I'm all alone, and
I can't transform.

179
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,070
But the worst part is-
Someone other than Mamo

180
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,090
kissed me...

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,466
Oh Mamo...

182
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,060
I said such awful things
to you. I wish I hadn't.

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,070
I'm so sorry...

184
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,190
And now I might not ever see you
again, and you'll never know!

185
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,210
Always remember, my dear
Serenity, The Legendary

186
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,170
Silver Crystal
follows your heart.

187
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,090
Is there doubt in my heart?

188
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,090
Is that why I
can't use my power?

189
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,200
Every time Mamo paid more
attention to Chibi-Usa, I

190
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,170
felt insecure. I didn't have
faith in him, because I'd

191
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,200
lost confidence in myself.
I forgot that love cannot

192
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,170
live where there is no
trust. But I do love

193
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,230
Mamo, and we both want
to protect Chibi-Usa...

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,080
Sailor Moon! You're
my only hope!

195
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,060
I'm from the future!

196
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,090
30th-century Earth!
And I need you!

197
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,050
No. I won't lose hope.

198
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,180
I am the future queen:
Neo Queen Serenity.

199
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,000
I swore I would
protect my friends and

200
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,070
everyone else on Earth!

201
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,080
I am loved.
I'm not alone.

202
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,010
Believe in yourself, Usagi.

203
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,060
You can do this.
You have to.

204
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,060
First things first, you
need to rescue the other

205
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,030
Guardians. You know
they're somewhere

206
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,070
nearby. You can feel it!

207
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,010
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter!

208
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,180
Wherever you are,
I will find you!

209
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,000
What happened?

210
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,150
What happened?

211
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,180
We're in our school clothes.

212
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,150
Something broke our
transformation.

213
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,040
What is this place?
Where are we?

214
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,180
My muscles are stiff. How
long have we been here?

215
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,180
So strange. I could swear I
heard Usagi's voice in my

216
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,060
head a moment ago.

217
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,020
You aren't the
only one, Mako.

218
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,140
We should transform. Then
we'll figure things out.

219
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,100
Jupiter Star Power!

220
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,120
Mars Star Power!

221
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,150
Mercury Star Power!

222
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,080
Make up!

223
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,190
We can't transform!

224
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,160
What's going on?

225
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,050
I can't breathe...

226
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,100
[gasping]

227
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,130
All my strength... is
being sucked out of me.

228
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,080
Sailor Moon!

229
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,080
[gasp]

230
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,130
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter!?

231
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,170
[evil laugh] Now that
I have the future Neo

232
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,050
Queen Serenity in my
clutches, I have no

233
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,070
more need of these three.

234
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,160
Leave them in
the Dark Chamber.

235
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,210
They can die and rot
for all I care.

236
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,160
Sailor Moon...

237
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,170
I don't know, Luna P.

238
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,180
Is that girl
really my Mommy?

239
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,220
That's the invincible
Sailor Moon?

240
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,150
But she's a crybaby and she
messes up all the time and

241
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,110
everyone's always
yelling at her...

242
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,110
Huh... Just like me.

243
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,130
The legendary guardian,
Sailor Moon, is invincible.

244
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,230
Nothing can defeat her.

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,020
How come?

246
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,200
She has a strong heart and
true friends by her side.

247
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,210
Those things give her
unbeatable power.

248
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,070
I may be her daughter...
But, I'm powerless...

249
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,210
I'm not brave, and I don't
have any friends...

250
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hey, shrimp! Why don't
you ever get bigger?

251
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,140
You can't be
queen someday!

252
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,190
You don't even
look like her!

253
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,210
I bet you're not
the real princess!

254
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,190
[laughing]

255
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,050
[crying]

256
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,210
Small Lady...

257
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,130
You know, when she was
younger, the queen

258
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,220
was quite the
crybaby too.

259
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,100
Really?

260
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Mm-hm. You're more like
her than you realize.

261
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,100
She named you Small
Lady because it was her

262
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,120
wish that one day you
might become a fine

263
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,050
young lady, fit to
take her place.

264
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,050
That didn't make sense.
I'm not like Mommy.

265
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,220
And I can't grow up.
So I'll never be a lady.

266
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,190
Mommy's so beautiful
and perfect.

267
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,190
I could never
be like her.

268
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,010
And Daddy loves her
more than anything

269
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,110
else in the world.

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,030
[mean laughing]

271
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,000
A real princess of Silver
Millennium would be able to

272
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,220
use the Silver Crystal!

273
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,010
If you are the queen's
daughter, prove it!

274
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,100
Use your power on
us! I dare ya!

275
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,070
There it is. The Legendary
Silver Crystal.

276
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,090
Small Lady?

277
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,070
Small Lady, are
you in here?

278
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,120
[gasp] The Legendary
Silver Crystal is gone!

279
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,100
Small Lady!

280
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,210
What was that? Mommy?

281
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,000
Mommy! Where are you!?

282
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,130
[gasp]

283
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,150
It's all my fault...

284
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,150
[crying]

285
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,010
If I hadn't taken the
Legendary Silver Crystal...

286
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,140
None of this would
have ever happened!

287
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,080
Abra-cadabra. Poof!

288
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,120
Pluto...

289
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,160
Once I ran away from the
mean kids and ended

290
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,200
up in a hallway in the
back of the palace,

291
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,190
where no one was
supposed to go.

292
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,010
That's when I found
the forbidden door.

293
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,130
Hello, Small Lady. I am
honored to meet you.

294
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,110
[gasp] You know who I am?

295
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,170
Only members of the Silver
Millennium family are

296
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,170
allowed to come here.
And you bear a strong

297
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,030
resemblance to other
members of the royal house.

298
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,130
Who are you? How
do you know that?

299
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,200
You may call me Sailor
Pluto. I am the keeper of

300
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,180
the Door of Space and Time.

301
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,100
So, they said you don't look
anything like the queen did

302
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,110
they? Well they're
wrong. You're

303
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,200
her spitting image.

304
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,170
Huh?

305
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,020
No one besides Daddy
had ever said anything

306
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,010
like that to me before.

307
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,130
Listen, Small Lady...

308
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,130
Huh?

309
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,200
If ever you feel sad,
just cast this spell,

310
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,180
Abra-cadabra!

311
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,130
Abra-cadabra?

312
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,180
It will raise your spirits
and make you feel better.

313
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,180
Abra-cadabra...

314
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,020
Poof!

315
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,200
Ahh!

316
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,140
Is that a magical
staff, Pluto?

317
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
You mean my Garnet Rod?

318
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,120
Yes. It is quite
magical indeed.

319
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,010
My mommy has something like
that called the Moon Rod.

320
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,150
She uses it to control the
Legendary Silver Crystal,

321
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,140
and make miracles happen!

322
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,030
As her daughter,
one day that will be

323
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,130
your responsibility.

324
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,220
[gasp]

325
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,180
Yeah. Maybe.

326
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,000
Hey Pluto, can I come
and see you again?

327
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,150
Of course. I will be right
here waiting for you.

328
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,020
Always.

329
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,200
Pluto...

330
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,130
My one and only
true friend...

331
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,180
Maybe if I see her,
I'll feel better.

332
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,150
Hey Pluto! [giggle]

333
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,190
Huh?

334
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,110
Daddy?

335
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,230
I thought for certain
she would be here.

336
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,150
My King, Small Lady has a
far better head on her

337
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,000
shoulders than any of us
give her credit for.

338
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,040
[gasp] Pluto...

339
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,060
She is the princess, not a
helpless infant. Besides,

340
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,220
Luna P is with her.

341
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,210
You're right, Pluto. But the
enemy has Sailor Moon and

342
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,120
we must remain vigilant.

343
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,000
Please do whatever you
can to aid Sailor Venus

344
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,040
and Tuxedo Mask.

345
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,130
I'm counting on you, Pluto.

346
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,020
Yes, of course,
my King. I will.

347
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,120
I've never seen her look
like that. She was so happy.

348
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,150
Not like the Pluto I know.

349
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,020
She's lonely and kinda sad.

350
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,140
And I'm the only one that
can make her smile...

351
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,050
I will always be here,
waiting for you to return.

352
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,230
I'm not the only one
she was waiting for.

353
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm not special
to her either.

354
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,150
A Space-Time Key?

355
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,140
This is the one Small Lady
took to go to the past!

356
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,030
Without a key she
could get lost in time!

357
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,070
Small Lady!
Where are you?!

358
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,050
I've been walking
for a while now.

359
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,070
I wonder where I am.
It's dark and cold here.

360
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,130
It's not like the space-time
portal I usually go through...

361
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,170
[gasp]

362
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,030
Something's not right.
I should go back.

363
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,000
[gasp]

364
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,040
My key is gone!

365
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,000
Lost are we?

366
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,040
[gasp]

367
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,080
I'm impressed you were able
to make it all the way out

368
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,180
here. Poor little Rabbit.
No one to love you.

369
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,220
Nowhere to go.

370
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,030
[gasp] Who are you?

371
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,150
Your fears betray you. I see
the darkness in your heart.

372
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,020
You could not have come to
this forsaken place unless

373
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,220
you had decided to give
up, to walk away from

374
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,020
everything you know and
everyone you care about.

375
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,230
You thought you were
wandering aimlessly, but you

376
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,210
were searching for me
without realizing it.

377
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,050
Someone who wants you.
Someone who needs you.

378
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,030
Come... Come with me...

379
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,130
Sailor Pluto, where's
Chibi-Usa?

380
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,170
Something has happened
to her, I can feel it!

381
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,020
Something so terrible,
it disrupted the space-

382
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,030
time continuum!

383
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,100
Chibi-Usa! Where are you?
Can you hear me?!

384
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,020
Please, Usako, lend
me your strength...

385
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,010
Help me find Chibi-Usa!

386
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,160
Act.22: Hidden
Agenda, Nemesis.

387
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,160
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
