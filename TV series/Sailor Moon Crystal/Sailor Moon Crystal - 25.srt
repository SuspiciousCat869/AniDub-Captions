1
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,010
Not so fast! I've got the
Silver Crystals now!

2
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,160
[gasp] Prince Dimande!

3
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,100
That woman it can't be!

4
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,120
Small Lady?!

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,160
I'm going to end it all! And
take all of you with me!

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,000
No!

7
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,030
[gasp]

8
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,130
This is the end! The
end of everything!

9
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,110
Time!

10
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,060
I command thee. Stop!

11
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,070
Pluto.

12
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,080
Yes, Queen Serenity?

13
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,080
The third law, the
most important one...

14
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,230
Do not stop time. Never. Not
under any circumstances.

15
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,140
Both you and your Garnet Rod
possess tremendous power.

16
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,050
You have the ability to
move space and alter

17
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,180
the flow of time.

18
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,060
You could stop time if
you wanted. One day

19
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,080
you may even be tempted to.

20
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,210
But listen to me, and
heed my warning.

21
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,070
If ever you were to break
this most sacred law...

22
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,220
[gasp]

23
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,200
[gasp] Nothing is moving...

24
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,210
Pluto!?

25
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,220
She didn't. She
stopped time?!

26
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,200
Why is it suddenly so calm?

27
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,220
Everything is completely
motionless.

28
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,070
And not just Nemesis...

29
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,150
The very air itself is
completely still, like it's

30
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,080
all been frozen!

31
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,230
Has time stopped?

32
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,140
Usako...

33
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,210
[gasp]

34
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
[gasp]

35
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,010
[groan]

36
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,456
[gasp]

37
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:01,150
Pluto! Are you alright?

38
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,180
I can't believe you stopped
time! How could you do

39
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,180
something so reckless?!

40
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,140
Pluto has broken the most
sacred law of time!

41
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,190
By stopping it?

42
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,190
Why is that wrong?
She saved us all.

43
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,010
What does breaking "the
most sacred law" mean?

44
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,070
What's going to
happen to her?

45
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,130
Queen Serenity
warned me not to...

46
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,220
Pluto.

47
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,220
If ever you were to break
this most sacred law, it

48
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,000
would cost you your life.

49
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,130
Cost you your life?!

50
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,010
Time has stopped,
but not for very long.

51
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,110
Please hurry,
before it restarts.

52
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Go to Dimande, retrieve
the two Legendary Silver

53
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,170
Crystals from him,
and be very careful

54
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,140
not to let them touch.

55
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,170
Only you can do
this, Sailor Moon.

56
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,150
But Pluto!

57
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,150
Go quickly!

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,180
[gasp]

59
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,170
Pluto!

60
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,000
I got both Silver Crystals
back just like you told me

61
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,000
to. They're right here!

62
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,170
Thank goodness...

63
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes, Pluto. It's
all thanks to you.

64
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,170
I always wanted to serve you
as a Guardian; to be of

65
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,230
help, the way
your friends are.

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,190
I had long hoped to fight
alongside you, and now

67
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,210
that's been fulfilled.

68
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:45,010
Sailor Moon, Future Neo
Queen Serenity... I have

69
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,120
always admired you
for your inner strength,

70
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,100
and the size of
your heart.

71
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,170
So please Sailor
Moon, I beg of you...

72
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,100
...save Small Lady.
She needs you.

73
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,150
[coughing]

74
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,200
Pluto! Please
stay with us!

75
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,030
Let us help you!

76
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,200
No my King, I
broke the law.

77
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,030
I committed this crime
of my own volition.

78
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,130
And now I must
atone for my sin.

79
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,210
Diana.

80
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,180
It's Pluto!

81
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,010
[gasp]

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Pluto!

83
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,210
What happened to you,
Pluto? Are you badly hurt?

84
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,230
Thank you so much, Diana.

85
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,110
You did a fine job of
guarding the door in my place.

86
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,230
Guarding time and being
keeper of the door, they

87
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,030
were my duties, but
I also took a great

88
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,210
deal of pride in them.

89
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,110
King Endymion, I can see
your face so clearly.

90
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Do not be sad my King.
This is as it should be.

91
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,050
I've never seen your cloak
this close up before...

92
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,030
Such a beautiful
lavender.

93
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,140
Like the color
of sunrise.

94
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,220
My King...

95
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,200
I failed you. I wasn't able
to protect Small Lady.

96
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,120
Please forgive me. [gasp]

97
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,190
Small Lady...

98
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,190
[gasp]

99
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,508
Pluto!

100
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:43,150
No! Open your eyes!

101
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,040
[crying]

102
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,190
I am Black Lady.

103
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,230
I have no friends, no
family. No one cares about

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,070
me. I am all alone.

105
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,050
This is a Space-Time Key.

106
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,230
It is a very important key
that can allow someone to

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,210
travel through time.

108
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,210
I- I remember...

109
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,160
Small Lady?

110
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,140
[coughing]

111
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,170
Small Lady!

112
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,190
I'm sorry, Pluto!

113
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,010
That's the key I stole from
her to go to the past.

114
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,140
I love you so much, Pluto!

115
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,150
You're my one
and only friend!

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,190
Mommy got mad at me for
coming to see you. I told

117
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,230
her it was okay. That
you were my friend!

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,180
But she was still
pretty upset.

119
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm her daughter. But
sometimes I wonder if she

120
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,170
even loves me at all.

121
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,180
She loves you.

122
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,010
There are many kinds of love
and many ways of showing

123
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,220
affection. More
than you know.

124
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,220
There are even times, you
cannot show your love at

125
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,070
all, but you can still
watch over them from afar.

126
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,210
These memories why
are they flooding

127
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,060
back all of the sudden?

128
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,220
What's going on?

129
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,090
Why can't I stop crying?

130
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,210
I love you Small Lady.

131
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,000
I love you very much.

132
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,060
Pluto!

133
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,040
You're my best friend...
I love you too!

134
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,160
Pluto!

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,020
[gasp]

136
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,220
Huh? [grunting]

137
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,230
What light is this?!

138
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,180
Chibi-Usa!

139
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,050
[gasp]

140
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,110
[gasp]

141
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,150
Her power has awakened.

142
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,140
She can transform now!

143
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,120
Chibi-Usa harnessed the
power of the Silver Crystal.

144
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,150
It is the birth of a new
Guardian, one to carry on

145
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,130
the Legacy of Sailor Moon!

146
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,100
Chibi-Usa!

147
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,170
Usagi! Daddy.

148
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,140
Pluto.

149
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,180
I did it Pluto! Look at me!

150
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,090
I was finally able
to transform!

151
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,130
See Pluto? Now I'm
just like you!

152
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,120
Come on... Why won't
you open your eyes?

153
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,050
After all these years I can
finally transform, but

154
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,190
what's the point if
you're not here to see

155
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,170
it? Please wake up!

156
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,150
I'm so sorry.

157
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,090
You were given the greatest
power in the universe and

158
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,120
you threw it away.
I had such high

159
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,180
hopes for you, Black
Lady. What a waste!

160
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,210
[crying]

161
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,140
Nemesis! How dare you
toy with the heart of an

162
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,170
innocent girl, and
manipulate her to do

163
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,150
your dirty work!

164
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,010
Her best friend is
gone, all because of

165
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,150
your lust for power!

166
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,100
I'll never forgive you!

167
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,220
Moon Crystal
Power Make up!

168
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,220
You're going to pay for what
you've done to Chibi-Usa,

169
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,070
and for Pluto's
death as well!

170
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,150
I am the Pretty Guardian!

171
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,170
Who fights for love
and for justice!

172
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,170
I am Sailor Moon!

173
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,180
And now In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

174
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,190
Moon Princess!

175
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,150
Halation!

176
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,020
[chuckle] You managed
to repel my darkness?

177
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,000
What marvelous power!

178
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But do you really think
you stand a chance

179
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,080
against me now?

180
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,140
No one else is going
to die on my watch!

181
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,100
Earth is my home! It's my
planet! And I won't let you

182
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,150
keep doing what
you want with it!

183
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,040
Daddy was right. Sailor
Moon really does

184
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,010
have a strong heart.

185
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,090
[chuckles] Puny human!

186
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,180
[grunting]

187
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,020
Mamo! You're back!

188
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,190
I'm so sorry, Usako.

189
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,180
It's okay.

190
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,020
[gasp]

191
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,010
The Moon Rod! Our combined
power is repairing it!

192
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,130
Let's go!

193
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,090
Right!

194
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,130
Shine Aqua Illusion!

195
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,180
Burning Mandala!

196
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,100
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

197
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:59,020
Venus Love Me Chain!

198
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,180
[groans]

199
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,120
So this is what it means
to be a Sailor Guardian...

200
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,150
They fight for their
friends, they fight for this

201
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,130
planet. They're willing
to give their lives

202
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,190
to protect what's most
important to them!

203
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Could I really do that
one day? Will I be able

204
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,190
to stand strong too?

205
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,130
[scream]

206
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,040
[gasp]

207
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,200
[gasp]

208
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,070
Prince Dimande!

209
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,010
Your tricks might fool
them, but they don't fool me!

210
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,140
I know you!

211
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,060
Dimande, why do
you interfere?

212
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,000
I won't let you take what
belongs to me. Sailor Moon

213
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,170
is mine! I'll be the
one to kill her!

214
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,170
And If anyone walks away
from this with the Silver

215
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,220
Crystal, it's
going to be me!

216
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,060
[chuckles] You may
have been bewitched by

217
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,000
the beauty of the queen.

218
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,160
But make no mistake, you are
my puppet and nothing more.

219
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,170
I gave you your power. I can
take it away. And leave you

220
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,170
to be consumed...
by your own darkness!

221
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,180
[pain scream]

222
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,170
Dimande!

223
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,220
Poor Prince Dimande.
So naÃ¯ve. So immature.

224
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,180
Such delusions
of grandeur.

225
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,230
How could he think he ever
stood a chance against me

226
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,150
with that insignificant
level of power.

227
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,180
My Queen...

228
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,080
Die!

229
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,160
[gasp]

230
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,010
[laughs]

231
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,020
One must wait an
overwhelmingly long time,

232
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,210
hundreds of years,
before one first starts

233
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,090
obtaining power.

234
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,200
I gave them dark energy,
guidance, everything that

235
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,010
they needed to reshape
history into the

236
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,080
future of their dreams, and
they squandered it all!

237
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,517
[gasps]

238
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:37,030
What's going on?

239
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,100
I regret to inform you, but
whether you like it or not,

240
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,200
you insignificant
little creatures are

241
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,200
already within my grasp.

242
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,150
Malefic Black Crystal
energy levels are

243
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,100
spiking off the charts!

244
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,000
We're trapped in
distorted space!

245
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,200
The darkness of the
Malefic Black Crystal

246
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,000
is surrounding
us on all sides!

247
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,060
All it would take is the
slightest shift of my mass,

248
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,080
and I could smash
you all into pieces!

249
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,000
The distortion! It's
getting worse and worse!

250
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,100
[gasp]

251
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,080
Now what!
What's happening!

252
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,170
[scream]

253
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,220
The darkness!
It's sucking us in!

254
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,000
[gasp]

255
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,090
[chuckles]

256
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,070
What the hell is that?

257
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,000
What are you Wiseman?

258
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,160
Are we finally seeing
your true form?

259
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,030
My name, is Death Phantom.

260
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,220
That is Death Phantom?

261
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,050
Defeated in battle
for the blue planet;

262
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,010
I was exiled to this
cold, dark place.

263
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,090
Alone in the universe, with
nothing but blackness and

264
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,180
hate; I became the
king of solitude.

265
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,030
But now...

266
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,050
I am the planet! I am
Nemesis. Nemesis is me.

267
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,060
As an invincible planet
filled with Malefic Black

268
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,070
Crystal, I own the greatest
power that exists!

269
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,120
With this power, the past,
the future, and the entire

270
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,080
universe are all
mine! And I will do

271
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,020
with them, whatever I wish!

272
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,190
Death Phantom's
all-consuming hatred soaked

273
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,100
into Nemesis for so
many hundreds of

274
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,060
years, that now it's
fused with the planet?

275
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,080
If that shapeless, evil
thing wants planet Earth,

276
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,220
it's going to have to
go through me first!

277
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,100
Take your best shot,
Queen of the Earth,

278
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,230
future Neo
Queen Serenity!

279
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,190
I am invincible! You
cannot defeat me!

280
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,220
Oh yes I can!

281
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,230
Your evil plans are
going to end right here!

282
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,090
Usako, whenever you feel
lost or uncertain, I will

283
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,020
always be there for you.

284
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,200
I am yours: mind, body, and
soul. My life exists so I

285
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,110
can give you the strength
to keep fighting.

286
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,060
Mamo, I wouldn't be who I am
without you. Only with you,

287
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,080
can I truly become myself.

288
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,150
Your love gives
me infinite power.

289
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:55,070
Act 26: Replay, Never Ending.

290
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,030
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
