1
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,080
My name is Black Lady:
Queen of Darkness.

2
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,070
Wiseman, Ruler of Darkness,
chose me to be at his side.

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,160
And now I am queen
of the dark planet,

4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,120
The Queen of Nemesis!

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,070
She has a dark crescent on
her forehead, just like

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,000
the Black Moon does!

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,010
No! That's impossible!

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,110
She's lying! She
can't be Chibi-Usa!

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,140
She appears to be grown up,
But has she truly awakened?

10
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,130
Oh, my daughter, what
have they done to you?!

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,060
Chibi-Usa! Listen
to yourself!

12
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,040
You're not part of
the Black Moon!

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,190
Do you realize what
you're saying?

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,190
Small Lady! Small Lady!
Small Lady! Small--!

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,090
[gasp]

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,110
Luna-P!

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,110
Stupid toy. How annoying.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,050
Chibi-Usa...

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,140
Small Lady! Come
to your senses!

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,080
[snickering]

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,170
Save your breath!

22
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,190
The Rabbit you knew no
longer exists. She is gone.

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,100
No trace of her remains in
the woman in front of you.

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,060
This is Black Lady!
[evil laughing]

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,120
Chibi-Usa!

26
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,120
Dimande, Saphir!
Show yourselves!

27
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,230
Since Esmeraude is no
longer with us, the

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,190
Beast Hands are mine now.

29
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,130
And I believe, you already
know my Evil Sight.

30
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,230
Feel it's power!

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,070
[gasp]
Watch out!

32
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,170
[screaming]

33
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,170
Venus!

34
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,120
[grunting]

35
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,080
Jupiter!

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,080
[grunting] I can't move!

37
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,190
You're not laying a
hand on Sailor Moon!

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Oh yeah?! Try and stop me!

39
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,090
[scream]

40
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,210
Oh no! Mercury! Mars!

41
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,200
[evil laughing]

42
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,210
[grunting]

43
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,140
Hold on! I'm coming!

44
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,120
This has nothing to
do with you four, so

45
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,050
just sit back and watch.

46
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,060
[scream]

47
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,090
[scoff]

48
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,220
Stop this, Chibi-Usa!

49
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,220
Don't you remember
us at all?!

50
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,230
We don't want to fight with
you. We're not your enemies!

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,130
You were born
here, Chibi-Usa.

52
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,180
This is your home!

53
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,180
And The Black Moon destroyed
it! How can you join them?!

54
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,140
[scoff]

55
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,020
The Earth and
everything on it mean

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,000
absolutely nothing to me.

57
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,090
If you need proof,
just look over there.

58
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,090
[gasp]

59
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,220
See that second Malefic
Black Crystal monolith?

60
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,130
That was my doing.
It produces a distorted

61
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,160
darkness, which warps
time and space even more.

62
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,210
And the effect just grows
and grows. Now anything it

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,100
touches gets absorbed
and disappears.

64
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,210
People, buildings...
everything!

65
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,120
Hundreds, even thousands of
times faster than before!

66
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,180
But that means...

67
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,230
Yes. The Earth will
vanish completely...

68
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,210
It will cease to exist.
[snickers]

69
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,080
I can't believe what I'm
hearing. Chibi-Usa, you

70
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,100
really did this to
your own home?!

71
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,090
My name is Black Lady!

72
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,120
And I couldn't care less
what happens to Earth.

73
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,140
It doesn't matter. I
have what I want.

74
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,150
[gasp]

75
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,070
Tuxedo Mask?!

76
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,020
Mamo!

77
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,150
He belongs to me now.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,090
[gasp]

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,210
[laughs]

80
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,180
I always wanted
him all to myself.

81
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,130
And now, I have him.

82
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,190
Endymion is mine and
mine alone. [laughing]

83
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,110
Mamo, no!

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,010
Make her suffer.

85
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,080
Mamo...
[gasp]

86
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,120
What's wrong with him?
His eyes are vacant.

87
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,150
It's like he can't
even see me.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Huh?

89
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,210
Look out!

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,150
[pain screams]

91
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,170
[gasps]

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,180
We combined our powers and
summoned the Moon Rod

93
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,190
together... And he
struck me with it!

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,200
This can't be
happening! Mamo!

95
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,120
He can't hear you. He
only listens to me.

96
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,130
Sailor Moon!

97
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,230
[laughing]

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Come to me, Endymion.

99
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,100
I have him. As long as he
loves me that's all I need.

100
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,090
You're wrong...

101
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,140
You think this is
love, but it isn't.

102
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,020
It won't make you happy.

103
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,090
Can't you see that?!

104
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,170
She's like me. All I wanted
was Mamo's attention.

105
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,120
I was desperate for it. I
couldn't see straight.

106
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,180
I couldn't think straight.
I was selfish and

107
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,110
incredibly jealous.
And all because...

108
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,120
I know how it feels, loving
someone so much it hurts.

109
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,200
It's overwhelming and
confusing and so intense

110
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,000
you can't handle it.
You're afraid you need

111
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,160
them more than
they need you.

112
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,180
But what scares you the
most is feeling as if

113
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,200
you are not good
enough...

114
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,120
I know, because I
feel the same way.

115
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm sorry I was
mean to you.

116
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,050
Forgive me! I care about
you more than you realize!

117
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,200
I need you, Chibi-Usa!

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,010
You are more like Sailor
Moon than you know.

119
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,020
Shut up! Don't talk to
me like you know me!

120
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,130
You don't know anything!

121
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,100
You and I are nothing alike!

122
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,020
[scream]

123
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,170
Sailor Moon!

124
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,190
Hmph!

125
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,140
She's all yours, Dimande.

126
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,230
Taking someone prisoner and
making them love you...

127
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,140
You're wrong! It
can make you happy!

128
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,150
No... It doesn't work that
way. That's not love!

129
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,000
Be quiet!

130
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,050
[gasp]

131
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,190
[laughs]

132
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,210
[gasp]

133
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,210
My god!

134
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,170
[gasp]

135
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,150
What the--?!

136
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,000
A third one?!

137
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,200
[gasps]

138
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,230
[grunting]

139
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh no!

140
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,060
Chibi-Usa, what
have you done?!

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,190
[laughing]

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,180
Damn the Moon Kingdom
and its palace!

143
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,150
I want the darkness to
swallow up this whole,

144
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,170
wretched planet! Until
there's nothing left!

145
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,000
[chuckles]

146
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,070
Yes, my dear Black
Lady. That's it.

147
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,220
You understand.

148
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,000
Those who control great
power, control the universe!

149
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,030
The people of the Moon
Kingdom taught me that.

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,190
They used the power of the
Silver Crystal to take

151
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,170
over the Earth and remake
it as they saw fit!

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,080
[laughing]

153
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,080
Isn't that right,
Sailor Moon?

154
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,180
[gasp]

155
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,130
My heart is racing.

156
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,220
I've never felt such a
sense of disquiet before.

157
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,010
What's happening
beyond that door?

158
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,170
A spreading darkness blocks
my sight. Small Lady,

159
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,020
King Endymion,
Sailor Moon...

160
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,060
Please be safe,
my friends!

161
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,140
The palace?!

162
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,060
Look! It's glowing!

163
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,140
Sailor Moon?

164
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,230
It's the Legendary
Silver Crystal!

165
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,200
[chuckles]

166
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,180
You would still dare to
fight me, Sailor Moon?

167
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,170
How foolish...

168
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,220
I hold all the cards. I have
everything that is precious

169
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,060
to you, and can crush
them at any time!

170
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,030
If you want them back, both
you and the queen must

171
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,030
surrender and hand
yourselves over.

172
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,100
Along with your Legendary
Silver Crystal from the

173
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,070
past, the one you are
trying to use now!

174
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,080
I'm not giving you anything,
no matter what you do.

175
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,150
I will protect Neo
Queen Serenity's palace

176
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,150
and this planet!

177
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,000
[gasp]

178
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,070
[chuckle] Launch another
Malefic Black Crystal.

179
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,110
[gasp]

180
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,040
You'll destroy the Earth,
and all of us along with it.

181
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,090
So?

182
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,060
[gasp]

183
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,210
The Queen and the second
Legendary Silver Crystal,

184
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,020
are practically
within my grasp.

185
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,080
The rest is of
little importance.

186
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,010
So that's it? We're just
expendable to you?

187
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,010
Prince Dimande!

188
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,020
[laughs]

189
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,010
Wiseman! You would
think this was funny.

190
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,000
It's ironic, really. The
Evil Sight you gave me,

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,040
shielded me from your
mind-control attack.

192
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,210
You didn't know
that did you.

193
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,180
I've never been
under your spell!

194
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,210
Rubeus and Esmeraude are
gone, but they fought

195
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,000
alongside me for years.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,200
If I am to die, it won't
be in vain! I owe them that!

197
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,040
Saphir!

198
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,230
[growl]

199
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,180
This is what it's come to. I
must fight, my own brother.

200
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,100
Saphir, I am ashamed I ever
questioned your loyalty.

201
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,170
You always followed me
despite hating what the

202
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,090
Malefic Black Crystal
had made me become.

203
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,090
Your only act of defiance
was refusing to wear

204
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,000
any of it yourself...

205
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,100
That is, until now,
little brother.

206
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,230
I dragged you into
this. I'm so sorry.

207
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,020
[screaming]

208
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,090
Forgive me.

209
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,030
Now die! Wiseman!

210
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,020
[gasp]

211
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,060
That... is Wiseman?

212
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,050
It's a corpse!

213
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,020
[snicker]

214
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,080
You thought that
was his true form?

215
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,070
Wiseman!
Show yourself!

216
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,210
What the- ?

217
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,220
It can't be!

218
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,220
[gasp]

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,190
The storm died
down. It's clear.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,120
Is it over? Is
everyone alright?

221
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,150
I can't shake this feeling
that my friends are in

222
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,130
danger. If they're fighting,
I want to charge

223
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,180
through that door and
fight alongside them!

224
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,090
But I am the Guardian of
the Underworld, the lone

225
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,000
keeper of the Door of
Space and Time.

226
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,120
I mustn't, I cannot
move from this spot...

227
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,200
Pluto...

228
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,220
Hm?

229
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,220
You are the keeper of the
Door of Space and Time,

230
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,190
the Guardian who watches
over all of Space-Time.

231
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,090
This is a great honor,
but with it comes

232
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,000
great responsibility.

233
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,150
There are three sacred laws
of time you must promise

234
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,230
never to break.

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,170
The first law forbids all
time travel. The second

236
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,150
requires you to always
keep watch at this door.

237
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,180
And the third law, the
most important one...

238
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,190
Wha- What is that thing?

239
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,130
[gasp]

240
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,120
It's huge!

241
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,180
[gasps]

242
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,200
I don't believe it!

243
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,150
It's the Planet Nemesis!

244
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,080
I am Wiseman!

245
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,130
Agh! Where did that
voice come from?!

246
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,190
That sound...

247
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,220
It's deafening!

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,120
[laughing]

249
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,150
What the hell
is going on?

250
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,190
[laughing]

251
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,110
That putrid body is
a relic of the past.

252
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,160
It was something like a
human once, but it drifted

253
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,210
to Nemesis and became
a corpse long ago...

254
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,120
As time went on, my
consciousness merged with

255
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,150
the place meant to be my
prison, until eventually...

256
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,110
We became one!

257
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,100
I am Nemesis!

258
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,100
[gasp]

259
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,000
Wiseman is the planet?!

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,110
This is the true identity
he kept from us?!

261
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,010
[laughing]

262
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,030
[groaning]
Can't stand up...

263
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,230
What is this?

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,020
My whole body hurts!

265
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,120
The darkness! It's
draining our energy...

266
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,140
Sailor Moon...

267
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,130
Jupiter! Mars!
Mercury! Venus!

268
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,190
Hang on, you guys!

269
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,010
[laughs]

270
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,100
Soon the entire
Earth will disappear.

271
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,090
Every last trace.

272
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,000
[snickering]

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,160
Nemesis is getting closer!

274
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,140
The effect of its dark
distortion is spreading!

275
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,010
If I don't do something
quick, what's left of the

276
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,180
Earth will die and
vanish forever!

277
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,020
I can't let that happen!
I have to stop it!

278
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,110
At any cost!

279
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,190
We were toys, puppets
he manipulated...

280
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,030
Insignificant specs in
Nemesis' shadow. Nothing

281
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,000
more than tools to be
used and tossed away.

282
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,220
[gasp]

283
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,230
That light?

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,230
I feel a gentle power...

285
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,150
The palace is shining.

286
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,040
It's getting brighter
and brighter!

287
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,000
It's so beautiful.
Such a comforting glow.

288
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,230
The power of the Silver
Crystal is even stronger now.

289
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,050
It defies logic. Sailor Moon
is using her own Legendary

290
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,110
Silver Crystal
here in the future.

291
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,160
She is performing
some kind of miracle!

292
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,160
Is that... Sailor
Moon's true power?

293
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,160
[gasp]

294
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,150
Oh no you don't.
Wiseman!

295
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,220
[grunting]

296
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,140
The Crystal Palace!

297
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,170
It'll be crushed!

298
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,010
Sailor Moon!

299
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,120
Hmph!

300
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,030
[scream]

301
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,160
[gasp]

302
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,060
Pluto!

303
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,040
Diana?

304
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,190
Please, help them!
Before it's too late!

305
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
What's happening?

306
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,200
It's Small Lady!
She grew up!

307
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,150
Huh?

308
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,180
Something awakened
her power...

309
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,020
And she's become queen
of the Black Moon!

310
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,050
[gasp]

311
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,150
She opened a wormhole and
the entire planet Nemesis

312
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,180
came through it! It's about
to crush the Palace!

313
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,040
It might really be the end
of the Earth this time.

314
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,180
I'm not sure Sailor
Moon can save it.

315
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,190
If only I wasn't
bound here...

316
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,180
If only I could
do something...

317
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,180
Pluto...

318
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,010
Don't you think I want
to help them, Diana!?

319
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,170
Small Lady is in trouble,
and she's my friend.

320
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,140
I wish I could go to her...

321
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,130
But I cannot...

322
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,030
Oh Small Lady...

323
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,170
What if I were to stay here
and keep watch in your

324
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,220
place? Then could you go?

325
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,180
I may be tiny, and I don't
have powers like you do. But

326
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,020
I can still guard the Door
of Space and Time, at least

327
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,170
for a little while.

328
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,230
Diana...

329
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,190
Okay? So go. Save our Small
Lady. I love her too.

330
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,170
Go through the door, Pluto.

331
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,150
Cross the threshold. It's
time. It's not a question of

332
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,160
whether or not you
want to, you have to!

333
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,160
Diana...

334
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,000
You're so kind and
thoughtful, just like Small

335
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,020
Lady. Thank you, my friend.

336
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
[meow]

337
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,180
Good luck, Pluto! I
know you can do it!

338
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,000
The true power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal...

339
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,230
Such pure, beautiful energy.

340
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,020
With a light that
pierces through the

341
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,200
dark veil of time...

342
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,030
I could use the Malefic
Black Crystal to rewrite

343
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,200
history again and again.
But that gleaming

344
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,230
power will always
reign supreme!

345
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,090
Can nothing surpass it?

346
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,000
Is there no way to
achieve what we dreamed?

347
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,190
I wonder which is going
to give way first.

348
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,190
Will it be this planet?
Or will it be you and

349
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,190
your pathetic
white light?

350
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,160
If you're asking yourself
whether you can hold

351
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,160
on, I can answer
that for you: No!

352
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,050
[laughing]

353
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,020
I am Black Lady, Queen of
Nemesis! Bow down to me!

354
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,200
The fate of planet earth
and its entire future...

355
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,230
All of it rests in my hands!

356
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,100
I can't keep this up
for much longer...

357
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,030
[laughing]

358
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,160
Chibi-Usa...

359
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,100
Hmph!

360
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,040
Take it then!

361
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,030
[gasp]

362
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,040
Take the Legendary Silver
Crystal. Take my life if you

363
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,230
want it! All that I have,
all I ever cared about.

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,160
I'll give it to you!

365
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,200
Just stop being Black Lady!

366
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,210
That's not who you are.
You are Chibi-Usa!

367
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,010
You are sweet, and
lonely, and you always

368
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,090
drive me crazy...

369
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,200
But I can't go
on without you!

370
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,100
I've had enough
of this future!

371
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,070
I don't want to
see it anymore!

372
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,210
[scream]

373
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,040
Endymion. Go!

374
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,180
[surprised gasp]

375
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,050
Mamo...

376
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
[gasp]

377
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,180
[screams]

378
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,210
Sailor Moon!

379
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Mamo...

380
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,120
Mamo!

381
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,100
Endymion?
Endymion!

382
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,100
[chuckles]

383
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,040
Two Silver Crystals.

384
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,210
One from the future
and one from the past.

385
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,120
[chuckle] And
they're both mine!

386
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,210
[laughing] [gasp]

387
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,060
Not so fast! I've got
Silver Crystals now!

388
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,100
[gasp] Prince Dimande!

389
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,110
What's he doing?

390
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,080
[gasp]

391
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,010
That woman it can't be!

392
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,200
[shocked gasp]

393
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,190
Small Lady?!

394
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,040
Listen up Black Lady!
You too Wiseman!

395
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,220
The Malefic Black Crystal
has unrivaled power.

396
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,230
Or so you said.

397
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,070
But does it stack up against
two Legendary Silver

398
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,090
Crystals, whose power can
overcome space-time?

399
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,080
I no longer trust
anything anymore.

400
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,010
I believe in nothing.
I follow no one.

401
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,120
I am my own master!

402
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,030
Calm down, please! You don't
want to do anything rash!

403
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,090
The two Crystals must not
touch each other! If they

404
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,120
do, it will destroy the
entire universe!

405
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,230
Give them back!

406
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,090
No, Small Lady!

407
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm going to end it all! And
take all of you with me!

408
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,090
[gasp]

409
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,050
[gasp]

410
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,140
I am Black Lady,
Queen of Darkness!

411
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,220
I am not Small Lady!

412
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,070
I don't have friends or
family. I am all alone.

413
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,110
So what is going on?
What is this feeling

414
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,080
and why does it
hurt so much??

415
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,110
Why can't I stop crying?

416
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:55,040
Act.25, Showdown:
Death Phantom.

417
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,110
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
