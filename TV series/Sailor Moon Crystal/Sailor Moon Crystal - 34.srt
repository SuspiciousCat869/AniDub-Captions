1
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:23,700
I am Cyprine.

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,333
And I am Ptilol.

3
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:28,000
And together, we
are one witch.

4
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,166
She split in two?!

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,866
So Cyprine, where's
the power similar to

6
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,733
the Taioron Crystal?

7
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,933
Was that it?

8
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,733
C'mon guys, snap out of it!

9
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,366
Stop this fighting!

10
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:46,100
Pink Sugar Heart Attack!

11
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,933
Stay out of the way, brat!

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,400
Tuxedo Mask!

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Chibi Moon!

14
00:00:58,766 --> 00:00:59,866
[giggling]

15
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,266
Why are we
fighting like this?

16
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,500
Why are we
against each other?

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,433
Deep down, do we really
think of ourselves as enemies?

18
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,000
No!

19
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,100
<i>At one time or</i>
<i>another they've saved us!</i>

20
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,900
<i>Those three have</i>
<i>always watched over us!</i>

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,433
They want to protect
what is precious to them,

22
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,300
just like we do!

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,900
We all fight for
the same reason!

24
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,433
We must unite our
hearts as one...

25
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,166
[gasp]

26
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,800
Please, everyone...

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,633
Lend me your power!

28
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,933
I will bring everyone's
hearts together

29
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,366
and unite them as one.

30
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,166
The Holy Grail...

31
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,366
It's shining!

32
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,033
And so is Sailor Moon!

33
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,300
My friends...

34
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,366
[gasp]

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,100
Uniting our hearts to
fight as one is what

36
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,100
makes us Sailor Guardians!

37
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:11,933
She's calling to us.

38
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,800
Sailor Moon
needs us, all of us.

39
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,166
[gasp]

40
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,966
My Talisman, the
Deep Aqua Mirror,

41
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:22,666
is starting to resonate.

42
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,266
[gasp]

43
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:34,133
My Talisman, the Space Sword,
is starting to resonate, too.

44
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:37,966
[gasp]

45
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:44,133
My Talisman, the Garnet Orb,
is also starting to resonate.

46
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,300
They're answering her call!

47
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,333
We give you our
power Sailor Moon!

48
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,100
Sailor Moon!

49
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,366
Sailor Moon!

50
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,766
What are those bright lights?

51
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:26,366
Moon Crisis Make Up!

52
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,033
[gasp]

53
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,300
Our brooches...

54
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,333
They've all
become heart‐shaped.

55
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,400
Sailor Moon?

56
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,433
Is that you?

57
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:11,833
It's Super Sailor Moon!

58
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,366
The legendary
Guardian, Sailor Moon,

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,666
is invincible.

60
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,066
Sailor Moon really is
invincible, Mommy!

61
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,900
Just like Daddy said!

62
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:26,333
She saved you, and she
saved Crystal Tokyo, too!

63
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,966
Someday I'm going to
become a Sailor Guardian, too.

64
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,666
Just like her!

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I know you'll train
hard and do your best,

66
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,266
Small Lady.

67
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,333
And one day, you will get to
see something very special.

68
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:41,766
You will witness Sailor Moon
transforming into an even

69
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:44,000
more powerful Guardian.

70
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,866
She will become
Super Sailor Moon.

71
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,833
Super Sailor Moon?

72
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,166
Super Sailor Moon?

73
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,100
[gasps]

74
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,866
I don't believe it...

75
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,666
...Sailor Moon powered up!

76
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,700
What a truly
incredible amount of energy!

77
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:09,233
How can she be at the center
of so much power and not

78
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,100
take any damage from it?

79
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,200
Unbelievable...

80
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,833
Sailor Moon, what
is your secret?

81
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,133
You can't come out.

82
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,300
Stay in!

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,200
What a massive
vortex of light!

84
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,233
What an enormous aura!

85
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,766
I see a towering pillar
of energy piercing

86
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,633
through the heavens.

87
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:44,333
Even when the power of the
Taioron Crystal was at its

88
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,800
peak back on
our home planet,

89
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,366
its energy was
nothing like this.

90
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:53,033
This is tens of
thousands of times greater!

91
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,133
What is this?!

92
00:07:56,233 --> 00:08:00,100
What is this energy that
gives power to everything?!

93
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,866
I know the answer to
that, Master Pharaoh 90.

94
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,433
It's the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

95
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,366
[chuckle]

96
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,366
No, I won't hesitate.

97
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:21,366
And I won't be led
astray, ever again!

98
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:37,200
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

99
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,233
Damn that Sailor Moon!

100
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,300
She bested
Cyprine and Ptilol,

101
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,066
the last and most powerful
of my precious Witches 5.

102
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,800
Such a defeat should
have been impossible!

103
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,833
I was supposed to make quick
work of those anomalies and

104
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,700
become the Master's
partner, then together,

105
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,933
we were going to remake this
planet into our new world!

106
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,200
[laugh]

107
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,933
A mere Magus, as a worthy
partner for our Master?

108
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,666
Kaolinite, have
you lost your mind?

109
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:23,800
[gasp]

110
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,933
What just happened?

111
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,166
Oh, my head!

112
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,133
It hurts!

113
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,000
I powered up?

114
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,600
Super Sailor Moon!

115
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,666
The Moon Chalice, the
Legendary Holy Grail.

116
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,300
Did it do this to you?

117
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,666
No.

118
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,800
The power came
from all of you.

119
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,300
It came through
the Holy Grail,

120
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,100
and then it poured into me.

121
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,666
Our Talismans gave their
power to Sailor Moon...

122
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,933
They're resonating in a way
that I've never seen before.

123
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,266
The Talismans could do this?

124
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,100
I had no idea.

125
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:10,800
Hold on!

126
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,733
But aren't the Talismans
supposed to be the keys to

127
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,233
awakening‐‐ Uranus!

128
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:16,733
I wished for all of
our hearts to unite

129
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,100
and become one...

130
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,700
...and that you would
lend me your power.

131
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,333
For a moment, it came true,
and our hearts did connect.

132
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,233
We shared the same feelings.

133
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,633
We all wanted to help
one another and take

134
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,733
down our enemies.

135
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:38,800
It wasn't any one power, but
the power of all of us that

136
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,133
summoned the Moon Chalice
and Super Sailor Moon.

137
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,200
And that proves we can
work together as a team.

138
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,400
We're different, but
we're all Sailor Guardians.

139
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:51,300
More than that,
we're friends.

140
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,300
You really think
of us as friends?

141
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,133
No matter how
hard we resisted,

142
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,300
our Talismans still listened
to Sailor Moon and readily

143
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,133
gave her their power.

144
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,433
Maybe it's a sign that we
should tell Sailor Moon the

145
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,933
truth about our
ultimate mission.

146
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,866
Oh wow, looks like Cyprine
really did a number on

147
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,700
Uranus's place, didn't she?

148
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,633
I'm scared to imagine
all the repair bills.

149
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:34,166
The windows, plus the
damaged furniture...

150
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,700
I bet fixing it all
will cost a fortune.

151
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
[chuckle]

152
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,266
Looks like an
expensive place.

153
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,200
Yeah.

154
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,066
The rent here is one
million yen a month.

155
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,833
A million?!

156
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,000
How can you
possibly afford that?

157
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,133
We've got
patrons and sponsors.

158
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,300
So we don't worry
much about cash.

159
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,733
What are those?

160
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,000
Haruka!

161
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,000
Super Sailor Moon.

162
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,833
Or rather, Princess.

163
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:01,466
About the Talismans, the
three of us know what they

164
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,433
do and we've
seen them activate.

165
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:07,033
But only just once, a
very long time ago.

166
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you remember
your previous life?

167
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:13,700
Can you recall what happened
thousands of years ago,

168
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,300
the day Silver
Millennium fell?

169
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,966
Back then...

170
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:23,366
Each of us was assigned
to protect a different

171
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,033
territory, in the
far reaches of space.

172
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:28,000
We had to stay at out posts.

173
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,800
To leave was forbidden.

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,133
All we could do was
watch from a distance,

175
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,333
as our home,
Silver Millennium,

176
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:37,933
came to an end.

177
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,700
Please stop.

178
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,766
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

179
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,266
Even now, it
breaks my heart.

180
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,266
But there's more...

181
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,800
In the midst of the
tragedy, our Talismans,

182
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,966
the most powerful weapons
in the Outer Planets,

183
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:02,300
began to resonate in a
way we'd never seen before.

184
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,466
The three of us were
brought together...

185
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:10,366
And, in that moment,
our beautifully shining

186
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:12,000
Talismans...

187
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,833
...summoned the Guardian
from the forbidden planet;

188
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:16,666
the final Guardian.

189
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,633
The one who must
never be awakened.

190
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:44,725
Protected by Saturn, the
Outer Planet of Destruction.

191
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,691
The Guardian of Silence.

192
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,694
She was Sailor Saturn.

193
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:55,060
That's when we knew the
end had finally come.

194
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,727
We watched as Sailor Saturn
slowly brought down her

195
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:09,294
Silence Glaive, in
one devastating swing.

196
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:14,727
Then, as the
strength drained out of us,

197
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
Silver Millennium
quietly fell to ruin.

198
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,627
When all three of the
Talismans come together,

199
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:30,060
they become the keys to
awakening Sailor Saturn.

200
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
That is their true function.

201
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:35,560
As Guardians of
the Outer Planets,

202
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:38,394
each of us protects
one of those keys.

203
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:41,094
When all three of
us come together,

204
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,560
and our three
Talismans activate,

205
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,527
it will cause the
awakening of Sailor Saturn.

206
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:50,794
If Saturn, the final Guardian,
should again awaken then the

207
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:54,627
world, as you know
it, will meet its end.

208
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,427
[gasp]

209
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,094
The three Talismans that
will bring destruction...

210
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:03,427
So this is what
the dreams meant.

211
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:09,694
The areas we usually protect
are so distant from one another.

212
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:12,794
Under normal circumstances,
we would never meet.

213
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:17,127
And, yet, fate decided to
bring us together again,

214
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,994
..reborn as
humans here on Earth.

215
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,094
However, so too, was the
Guardian of Destruction.

216
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:27,627
[gasp]

217
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:30,294
No way...

218
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:33,327
So you're saying it's her?

219
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,494
Hotaru is Sailor Saturn?

220
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,327
Awaken...

221
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:45,660
The time has come for
the light guided by

222
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,094
the three Talismans.

223
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:50,194
Gather the
three Talismans...

224
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:52,460
And let the
destruction begin...

225
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,327
[gasp]

226
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:59,260
So that was Saturn's soul
calling out for the Talismans?

227
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,827
The time of Sailor Saturn's
awakening is approaching fast.

228
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:07,094
Her body is preparing itself,
and she is starting to feel it.

229
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:08,060
[gasp]

230
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:10,594
Since you all have
been to the future,

231
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:12,360
you know it already exists.

232
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:14,194
Which is why,
no matter what,

233
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:16,727
Sailor Saturn cannot
be allowed to awaken.

234
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:19,427
So what are you going to do?

235
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:21,727
We must kill Hotaru.

236
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,560
And then seal
Saturn's soul away for good.

237
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,360
Kill her?

238
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,594
How could you?!

239
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:32,694
We don't know the three
Talismans will activate.

240
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:34,494
Maybe they won't.

241
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,227
The Talismans
resonated so much,

242
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:41,060
generating all that energy
to summon Super Sailor Moon.

243
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,427
I can feel them
overflowing with power.

244
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:53,094
Just like back when Silver
Millennium was destroyed.

245
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:58,194
The day they activate, and
call Sailor Saturn to awaken

246
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,327
here on Earth, is near.

247
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,594
But you're
talking about murder!

248
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,560
There has to be another way!

249
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,460
There's not.

250
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:07,660
Besides, even if we
don't kill her now,

251
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,660
she'll die soon enough.

252
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,594
She can't live much longer.

253
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:14,094
Her body is
already failing her.

254
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:15,660
You've seen it, Chibi‐Usa.

255
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,460
[gasp]

256
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:22,794
When she was eight‐years‐old...

257
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,427
Hotaru was severely injured.

258
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:29,060
She ended up in a coma, but
miraculously she woke up.

259
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,060
Despite his brilliant mind, her
father, Professor Souichi

260
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Tomoe, was kicked out of the
academic community.

261
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,327
Hotaru became the embodiment
of his life's work.

262
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,760
The professor remade her
into a fusion of man and

263
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,760
machine, as if she was a
doll for him to play with.

264
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:53,060
Her small body is artificial,
and her fragile life is

265
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,994
already slipping away.

266
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,260
Isn't there any
way to save her?

267
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,394
Does she have to die?

268
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:04,160
At this point, there's only
one thing that could save

269
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,827
her body or her life.

270
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:09,727
She would need to
awaken as Sailor Saturn,

271
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:12,327
with the powers
of a Guardian.

272
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,360
However, we cannot
allow that to happen.

273
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:20,060
No...

274
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,360
Don't you see
that it's wrong!

275
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,060
You can't kill Hotaru!

276
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,060
You just can't!

277
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,127
Why isn't there
some other way!

278
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:28,660
Maybe Saturn won't wake up.

279
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,060
After all, the future exists!

280
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,827
You said so yourself!

281
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:34,494
The world isn't going to end.

282
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:36,394
We will all
live through this.

283
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:39,327
We can save
everything, I know it!

284
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,460
So please!

285
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,194
She doesn't have to die!

286
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,227
That's exactly what we
thought you would say.

287
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,494
Which is why we
can't work together.

288
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:54,660
And why we
cannot be friends,

289
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:57,327
regardless of
how we might feel.

290
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,794
You can hate us.

291
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:02,560
If you'd rather think of us as
enemies, so be it.

292
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,560
We have our own
mission, and duties,

293
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,727
to save the world.

294
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,727
And we're going
to carry them out.

295
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,360
And The Death Busters,
we'll get them, too.

296
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,427
Don't go!

297
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:16,694
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto!

298
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,727
Hotaru is Sailor Saturn,
the Guardian who will

299
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,594
bring destruction?

300
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,727
The same Hotaru that has
mysterious powers and deep

301
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,427
dark eyes? And who
always looks so lonely?

302
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:36,560
I won't tell anyone.

303
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,560
It stays between us.

304
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,227
Pinky promise.

305
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,627
Hotaru is Saturn.

306
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,260
We must kill her.

307
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:50,527
[gasp]

308
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:53,394
Chibi Moon!

309
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,727
I won't let anything
happen to Hotaru!

310
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,527
I have to save her!

311
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:14,227
Wait!

312
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,427
Is that Sailor Chibi Moon?

313
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,094
This time, I won't run away.

314
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,394
I don't care how she
looks, or who she might be,

315
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:27,094
or what her fate is...

316
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,760
None of that matters to me.

317
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,594
Hotaru is my friend!

318
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:42,360
Hotaru!

319
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,394
Hotaru!

320
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:46,594
[gasp]

321
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:00,060
What's going on?

322
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,194
Chibi Moon!

323
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,160
What's that?!

324
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:18,294
[scream]

325
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:20,494
We have to help!

326
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
What happened?

327
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,094
Are you okay?

328
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
[gasp]

329
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,327
Chibi Moon!

330
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:42,160
[gasp]

331
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:43,694
Small Lady!

332
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:50,327
Chibi‐Usa!

333
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,394
Sailor Moon!

334
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:03,427
Who's that?

335
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:05,660
I think it's Hotaru.

336
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
[chuckling]

337
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:15,060
[chuckle]

338
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:17,494
Is that Sailor Saturn?

339
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:19,094
She's awake already?

340
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:20,760
But our Talismans are quiet.

341
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,327
Then, who is that?

342
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:28,660
[chuckle] I finally have it.

343
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,194
I have the
Legendary Silver Crystal!

344
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
At last, I have awakened.

345
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,060
Master Pharaoh 90, I'm here!

346
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:38,760
[laughing]

347
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:44,594
Chibi‐Usa!

348
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:47,527
Chibi‐Usa, please
open your eyes!

349
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,494
Wake up!

350
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:51,560
[gasp]

351
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:54,660
She's not breathing!

352
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:31,834
Chibi‐Usa!

353
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:32,598
No...

354
00:24:32,698 --> 00:24:34,198
Please! Come back to us!

355
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:40,798
Next time, "Act.34 Infinity
8 'Infinite Labyrinth' 1."

356
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,165
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
