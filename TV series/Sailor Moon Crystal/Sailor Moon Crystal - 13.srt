1
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,180
I'm sorry, Mamo!
Please forgive me!

2
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,150
I can't stand seeing you
like this anymore!

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,040
Mamo...

4
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,040
Are we star-crossed lovers
always destined...

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,040
...to suffer the same fate?

6
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,090
Mamo...

7
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,150
I love you.

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,170
[Gasping]

9
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,090
Endymion...

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,170
You are my one and
only true love.

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,060
No matter how many lifetimes
we live, I know we will always
find one another.

12
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,120
And we'll fall in
love all over again.

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,020
Our souls will transcend space
and time eternally, until the
day comes when we can at last...

14
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,200
...be together.

15
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,060
Hmph!

16
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,220
Usagi!

17
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,230
This can't be real!

18
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,070
Oh no!

19
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,130
It's not fair.
This is wrong!

20
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,160
Why would fate give us new
lives if it was just going to
end like this all over again?

21
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,130
That light!

22
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,200
The Legendary Silver Crystal.

23
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,140
It's become whole!

24
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,110
[Gasps] No!

25
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,160
We can't allow it to grow here!
Not in the Dark Kingdom!

26
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh, what a brilliant light!

27
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,100
Such energy! Such power! it
fills the Dark Kingdom!

28
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,220
Queen Metalia!

29
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,110
[Screaming]

30
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,230
At last, everything I wanted is
mine! I have all the energy

31
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,120
I need and I shall
have the Crystal too!

32
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,000
No you won't!

33
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,150
[Grunts] Luna!

34
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,230
Stay out of my way!

35
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,020
[Screams]

36
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,090
Usagi!

37
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,220
[Laughing] Foolish cat!

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,080
Luna!

39
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,230
Queen Metalia, she's
enveloped the whole
thing, it's inside her!

40
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,100
[Grunts]

41
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,080
Luna!

42
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,180
Please forgive me.

43
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,160
Luna, promise me that you'll
watch over the Princess forever.

44
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,090
Even if she should
one day be reborn.

45
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,200
[Whimpering] I couldn't
protect her.

46
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,120
I failed my princess and my
queen. I'm so sorry.

47
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,130
Yes! The power! I can feel
it coursing through me!

48
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,010
[Screams]

49
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,130
Queen Metalia's gone.

50
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,190
She took Usagi and
Mamoru with her.

51
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,160
What do we do now?

52
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,190
There's still hope.

53
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,170
[Gasps]

54
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,220
The princess is with the
Crystal. It will protect
her and Endymion.

55
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,090
Mhm.

56
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,130
Mhm.

57
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,140
Artemis is right! It's
not over yet. There's
still time to save them!

58
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,200
Queen Metalia
must be stopped!

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,090
We can't just let her
have the Crystal. We
have to get it back!

60
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,010
Okay. Let's get going!

61
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,040
Hmph!

62
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,230
Hmph!

63
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,220
Hmph!

64
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,220
Hmph!

65
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,010
Hurry girls! Everything's
up to you now!

66
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,230
[Grunting]

67
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,220
Luna!

68
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,100
It's all my fault, Artemis. I
forced Usagi to fight the man
she loves!

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,220
[Gasps] I've got you!

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,160
Take me to the Moon, Artemis,
to Silver Millennium.

71
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,010
I need to go to the Chamber of
Prayer in the Moon Castle.

72
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,020
Alright.

73
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,190
[Gasps]

74
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,150
We're in the Arctic Circle!
Shouldn't there be ice?

75
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,150
It's a barren wasteland!

76
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,130
It feels eerie, like a
massive graveyard.

77
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,000
The rock here is like the ruins
of Silver Millennium.

78
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,180
It's been so long!

79
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,020
For ages I languished
underground, suffocating in

80
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,170
the prison where Queen
Serenity sealed me.

81
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,190
[All] Queen Metalia!

82
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,230
But I am reborn! Reinvigorated
by the power of the Legendary
Silver Crystal now within me!

83
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,000
This time nothing
will stop me!

84
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,180
[Gasps]

85
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,120
If she keeps feeding off the
Crystal's power, she'll get
even bigger!

86
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,050
Hmph!

87
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
Everyone ready? Power up!

88
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,160
Jupiter Power!

89
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,040
Mercury Power!

90
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,230
Mars Power!

91
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,010
Venus Power!

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
[All] Sailor Planet Attack!

93
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
[Chuckles]

94
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,200
You cannot hurt me!

95
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,020
[Screams]

96
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,050
[Grunts]

97
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,160
[Grunts]

98
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,020
[Gasps]

99
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,000
[Gasps]

100
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,010
It's no use. She's
too powerful!

101
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,140
At this rate Queen Metalia will
engulf the whole planet.

102
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,010
All energy makes me grow
stronger! Even the power
of your attack!

103
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,050
As long as I have the power of
the Legendary Silver Crystal,
I'm invincible!

104
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,130
She's taken all we ever cared
about, and we're not strong
enough to get it back from her.

105
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,220
[Gasps]

106
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,130
[Groaning]

107
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,160
[Attacking Grunt]

108
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,070
[Screams]

109
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:06,010
[Groaning]

110
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:14,050
[Laughing] Miserable little
humans! They're all mine now!
Their whole planet is mine!

111
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,140
[Grunting]

112
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,180
Luna.

113
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,020
[Gasps]

114
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,230
Your Majesty, Queen Serenity.

115
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:29,150
It's Luna, your humble servant.
I beseech you! Please! Show
yourself once more, my Queen.

116
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,140
I need you to release what
remains of the Moon Power.

117
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,020
It is the last hope that Planet
Earth and the humans have.

118
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,020
Help me, my
Queen, I beg you!

119
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,000
Take my life
if you have to!

120
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,030
Just please, save Usagi!

121
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,060
[Groaning]

122
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,060
So, it's all over then.
There's no way to stop her.

123
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,030
Queen Metalia's evil darkness
will swallow this whole planet.

124
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,070
The Earth...will it fall to ruin
like the Moon Kingdom did?

125
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,190
Yes, it's possible. But there's
nothing else we can do.

126
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,040
[Gasps]

127
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,150
[Gasps]

128
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,070
You're not alone anymore,
Minako. You don't have to do
everything by yourself!

129
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,000
Huh?

130
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,220
Has anybody ever told
you how cute you are
when you smile, Ami?

131
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,000
[Gasps]

132
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,080
How dare you accuse Rei!
She's a beautiful girl,
both inside and out!

133
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,080
[Gasps]

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,040
Scared of a pretty girl with
cute earrings and perfume?
That's ridiculous!

135
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:52,010
[Giggling]

136
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,040
[Gasps] I can hear
Usagi's voice!

137
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,080
Same here.
I heard it too!

138
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,170
That must mean
she's still alive.

139
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
She's calling out to us.

140
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,230
Usagi always believed in us.
She gave us the courage
to be the best we could!

141
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,190
She's the heart of our
team. Her spirit is
a ray of sunshine!

142
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,170
We can't give up! Not until
we see her smile again!

143
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:21,210
I can feel the Legendary Silver
Crystal protecting her. She is
still alive! I'm sure of it!

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,030
Ridiculous! Sailor Moon is
inside me. She belongs to the
Darkness now!

145
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,110
You're wrong! Usagi is alive!
All four of us know it! We
have no doubt!

146
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,230
How can you be so certain?

147
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,170
Because we can feel her in our
hearts. She's always with us.

148
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,090
We love you, Usagi!

149
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,000
What? The Sacred
Sword of Light?!

150
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,220
The Silver Crystal is waiting
for us to set it free.

151
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,130
Waiting for the right moment
to strike down Metalia!

152
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,080
We lack the strength to seal
Queen Metalia and her darkness
ourselves!

153
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,200
But there is one
last thing we can do.

154
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,060
We can give Usagi a fighting
chance to save this planet!

155
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,000
But if we're going to do
it, we have to do it now!

156
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
These pens are not just
for transformation.

157
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,020
They contain our sacred
power as Guardians,
our very life force.

158
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:33,110
We can send them to Usagi to
help her, but that means making
the ultimate sacrifice.

159
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,120
O Sacred Sword! Take all
of our power as Guardians!
For the Princess!

160
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,210
Venus Power!

161
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,200
Mars Power!

162
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,130
Mercury Power!

163
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,190
Jupiter Power!

164
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,190
Please
Princess! Awaken!

165
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,220
Make up!

166
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,000
Hah! Are you pitiful little
Guardians from the Moon Kingdom
still trying to fight back?!

167
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,020
[Screams]

168
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,140
Princess!

169
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,020
[All] Usagi!

170
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,210
[Laughing]

171
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,150
What a waste!

172
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,010
To just throw away
their lives like that!

173
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,210
Princess!

174
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,100
[All] Usagi!

175
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Hmm? Where am I?

176
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,130
I remember...

177
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,010
...a fight, and the sword...

178
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,220
I'm alive? How is
that possible?

179
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,000
[Gasps] The Legendary
Silver Crystal!

180
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,130
[Gasps] Mamo!

181
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,230
His pocket watch.

182
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,230
It stopped the sword from
running me through.

183
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:28,190
Mamo, even now, you're
still saving my life.

184
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,120
[Crying] But why?

185
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,010
Why couldn't you
take me with you?

186
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,160
The Legendary Silver
Crystal is mine!

187
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,200
[Gasps]

188
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,190
[Moaning]

189
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,170
[Moaning]

190
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,180
[Gasps] Stop it!

191
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,160
[Grunting]

192
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,200
I don't wanna hear anymore!

193
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,000
The voices of humanity's
darkness!

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,030
Such a beautiful
cacophony of bitterness
and malice!

195
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,050
Now that I have the Legendary
Silver Crystal, every living

196
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,190
thing on Earth will become
part of my darkness!

197
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,220
Please no more! Stop!

198
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,140
The royal line of the Moon
Kingdom ends here!

199
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:26,180
I have you in my clutches,
Princess! You will become part
of me! There is no escape!

200
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,130
No, don't!

201
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,210
[Laughing] Scream and cry all
you like! There's nothing you
can do about it!

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,070
If I don't do something soon,
the darkness will consume me. I
have to get out of here!

203
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:48,130
Please, Legendary Silver
Crystal, lend me your power. I
don't want to die like this!

204
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,020
I want...

205
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,060
...to be with my friends,
the Sailor Guardians!

206
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,160
The power, I can feel it!

207
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,080
Wait, what's happening?
My body's getting hot.

208
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,180
What have you done!?

209
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:31,020
[Grunting] We're free.
We actually managed
to escape from her.

210
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,070
The Legendary Silver Crystal,
it did what I asked.

211
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,060
Hmm? [Gasps]

212
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,060
His hand!

213
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,090
It feels warm again!

214
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,150
Did the Crystal do this too? Is
it giving him back to me?

215
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,070
[Gasps]

216
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,070
[Gasps] Usako...

217
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,190
[Gasps]

218
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,000
[Gasps]

219
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,030
He's alive!

220
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,230
[Grunting]

221
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,030
Mamo.

222
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,230
Usako.

223
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,200
[Sighing]

224
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,150
[Sighs] It's a miracle!

225
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,070
Yes it is, and it's
all because of you.

226
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,000
[Growling]

227
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,200
Metalia!

228
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,040
[Grunting]

229
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,010
[Growling]

230
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,080
[Sighs] I won't let
you have them!

231
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,060
Not the Princess, or the
Legendary Silver Crystal!

232
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,160
[Sighs] Mamo!

233
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,100
Usako, listen to me. Take
the Legendary Silver
Crystal and use its power!

234
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,210
Vanquish Queen Metalia!

235
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,100
I will!

236
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,080
Give it to me! The Legendary
Silver Crystal is mine!

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Queen Metalia!

238
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,030
I won't let you win!

239
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,170
What incredible energy! It's
even more powerful than when it
was inside me!

240
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,090
[Growling] I want it!
I must have it!

241
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,110
No! Why isn't this working?!

242
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,090
I can't! [Gulps]

243
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,220
I can't do it! She's too
powerful, I can't seal
her all by myself!

244
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,220
[Growls]

245
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,180
Where are the Guardians?
I need them!

246
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,180
I can't do it alone! Without
their help she'll suck me back
inside her!

247
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,000
Luna, Artemis!

248
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,110
Mercury! Mars!
Jupiter! Venus!

249
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,100
I don't know what to do!
I'm lost without them!

250
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
I can't!

251
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,050
Huh?

252
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,110
Sailor Moon.

253
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,110
[Grunts]

254
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,020
[Gasps]

255
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,050
Master Endymion, we
are reunited at last.

256
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,080
Kunzite?

257
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,180
Master, it is time to destroy
that evil once and for all.

258
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,180
Queen Metalia is a
terrible monster.

259
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,230
She devours the life force of
all living things and transforms
it into darkness, leaving worlds

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,110
turned to stone in her wake.

261
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,230
The star mark on Metalia's
head, that is her weak point.

262
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,220
If you strike her there, with
an attack from the Legendary
Silver Crystal...

263
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,050
We can end her for good!

264
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,130
Master.

265
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,210
It's good to see you again.

266
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,190
This time we hope you
and the Princess...

267
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,080
...can live happily
ever after.

268
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,120
I understand now.

269
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,130
The stones, they were you! You
stopped the sword from piercing
my heart!

270
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:15,220
You gave your lives to protect
me, just like you promised! My
loyal Knights, thank you.

271
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,060
[Growling]

272
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,110
I can't hold on, not
on my own! [Grunts]

273
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,080
It's okay, I've got you.

274
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,010
[Sighs]

275
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,120
Sailor Moon!

276
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
[Sighs] Mamo, it's you.

277
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,200
Nothing can replace your
friends. But you're not alone.

278
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,040
I'm here, right beside
you. You can do this!
You're Sailor Moon!

279
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,030
[Gasps] I am!

280
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Sailor Moon.

281
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,080
That's right.

282
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,010
Serenity.

283
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,020
Endymion.

284
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,010
My love, you've always
given me strength.

285
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,220
Your support and
courage make me
believe in myself.

286
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,130
When I'm with you, I feel
confident, like there's
nothing I can't overcome.

287
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,130
Like I can do anything!

288
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,030
I am...

289
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,060
...the Guardian of justice...

290
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,060
Sailor Moon!

291
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,000
What!? You're just a child! How
can you possibly control the
Legendary Silver Crystal?

292
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,010
Hmph.

293
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,040
Give it everything you've got,
Sailor Moon. Don't hold back!

294
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,100
Remember, aim for the star
on Queen Metalia's forehead.

295
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,100
Hmph.

296
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,230
No matter what happens
next, I'm right here with you.

297
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,020
Hmph.

298
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,230
Give me the Crystal's power or
I'll rip you into little pieces!

299
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,010
No, Queen Metalia!

300
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,140
I'll never let you have it!

301
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,020
Legendary Silver Crystal! Grant
me the strength to triumph over
Queen Metalia!

302
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,090
And rid the world of her evil!

303
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,050
Usagi!

304
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,160
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice!

305
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,230
I am Sailor Moon, and
Princess Serenity!

306
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,230
By the power of the Moon...

307
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,150
...and the Silver Crystal...

308
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,120
I banish you! Forever!

309
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,150
You did it, Usako.
I'm so proud of you.

310
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:36,100
Oh, Mamo! I'm so happy
you're alive, and that
we're finally together again!

311
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,150
Serenity...

312
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,210
Endymion...

313
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,000
You are my soul mate, my
destiny. We were born to be
together.

314
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,100
I love you, Mamo! I'll never let
anything separate us again!

315
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:52,060
Act. 14 Conclusion and
Commencement.
Petite Étrangére.

316
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,211
The moonlight is
a messenger of love!
