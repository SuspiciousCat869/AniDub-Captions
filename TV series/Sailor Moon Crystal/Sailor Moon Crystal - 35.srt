1
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,066
Her heart is
no longer beating.

2
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,066
She's gone.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,733
It's not true...

4
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,700
she can't be...

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,066
[stunned groan]

6
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:39,933
(USAGI TSUKINO) Chibi‐Usa...

7
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,733
[sobbing] Chibi‐Usa!

8
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,733
(HARUKA TENOH) Her soul's been
taken.

9
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:45,766
Huh?

10
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:47,733
Haruka...

11
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:48,900
[gasp]

12
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:53,733
<i>You mean Hotaru, or rather</i>
<i>Sailor Saturn...</i>

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,733
...she killed her?

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,133
That wasn't Sailor
Saturn. She hasn't
awakened, yet.

15
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:06,133
If she had, the three
Talismans would have
activated. But so far,
they have not.

16
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,133
There is a way to
save Chibi‐Usa, but...

17
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:09,733
[gasp]

18
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,633
How? What way?
How can we
save her?

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,933
We must kill Hotaru.

20
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:16,966
[gasp]

21
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,000
(TENOH) That girl...

22
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,133
...she isn't
Hotaru anymore.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,300
She has become their vessel.
She's an enemy now.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,966
Chibi‐Usa's soul and the
Legendary Silver Crystal are now
in her hands.

25
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:35,133
To save Chibi‐Usa we must get
them back and that means
destroying our enemy.

26
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,633
Destroying?

27
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,233
There must be
some other way.

28
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,633
Sailor Saturn may not be
awake yet, but, if we don't
act, the Earth will be
destroyed.

29
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,800
So the three of us are going,

30
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:52,800
...not only for
Chib‐Usa, but to save
all of human kind.

31
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,933
[stunned breath]

32
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,066
Usagi?

33
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,200
[emotional grunt]

34
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:08,900
She's right... I know she is. We
<i>have to save the planet.</i>

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,700
But still...

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
[sigh]

37
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,866
Her little body
is getting so
cold...

38
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,033
[holding back tears]

39
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:30,033
Her heart's stopped,
and her blood's not
circulating.

40
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:35,866
Even if we retrieve her
soul, we won't be able to
revive her, not if we leave
her here.

41
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,233
What do you
mean?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,233
Her body is dying. If we don't
get Chibi‐Usa's soul back fast,
she could be gone forever.

43
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,200
[shocked gasps]

44
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,466
[stunned breath]

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Act.34 Infinity 8 "Infinite
Labyrinth" 1

46
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,190
(MAMORU CHIBA) I'm going to link
my body with Chibi‐Usa's.

47
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:37,528
That way...

48
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,194
Instead of machines, I'll
be her life support. And my
body can keep hers alive.

49
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:44,194
that[s pobutbi angn ]in

50
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,728
credible
strain on your body?

51
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:52,228
I'll be fine.
Right now, Chibi‐Usa
and I are one.

52
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,394
Hey, you guys, could you please
give us a moment alone?

53
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:58,861
Mhm...

54
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:06,428
Chibi‐Usa's life,
Hotaru's... or everyone
on Earth...

55
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:08,828
How can I possibly choose?

56
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:16,928
[sigh]

57
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:25,328
I can feel your heart beating
through her, Mamo. It's as if
Chibi‐Usa's alive and still with
us.

58
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,961
[crying and sniffling]

59
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,428
What should I
do?

60
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:33,928
How can I...?

61
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:35,794
(MAMORU) Usa.

62
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:36,928
Huh?

63
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:48,594
[gasps]

64
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,994
(MAMORU) Her soul and the
Legendary Silver Crystal...

65
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:54,794
[gasp]

66
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:58,761
You have to
get them back.
Focus on that,
Usa.

67
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:03,328
Right now that's
all you can do.
You must go.

68
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:05,661
Don't lose hope.

69
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,328
[agreed sigh]

70
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:13,994
[reassuring sigh]

71
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:15,494
That vision...

72
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:20,828
Was that the Messiah?... or
the God of Destruction?

73
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,328
Such a small, inconvenient
vessel..

74
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,994
So uncomfortable...

75
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:33,394
Hm?

76
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,394
[gasp] Mistress 9!

77
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:40,661
We have been
awaiting your arrival
for some time...

78
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:48,594
[satisfied sigh] You're finally
here. It's been so long since
the day I implanted your egg
into my daughter, Hotaru.

79
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:52,594
But it remained
undifferentiated, so I thought
you might never wake up.

80
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:54,661
So that's it...

81
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:57,661
[gasp] Huh?

82
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:01,061
Why did she have to awaken now?

83
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:02,728
(MISTRESS 9) Kaolinite.

84
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:03,061
[gasp]

85
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:07,394
Thank you for your loyal
service. You've worked very
hard.

86
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:14,561
However, since I am Master
Pharaoh 90's partner from our
old world, I shall now be taking
over his care.

87
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:15,394
[angry grunt]

88
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,561
(MISTRESS 9) <i>You have other</i>
things to attend to. Our master
<i>gave you an important mission.</i>

89
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:22,561
And I need you to carry it out
immediately.

90
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,728
Eliminate the anomalies!

91
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:27,894
Failure is not an option.

92
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:31,394
Of course. I understand.

93
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:39,061
If she thinks I'm going to back
down that easily, she's got
another thing coming!

94
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,728
(MASTER PHARAOH 90) Ah...

95
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:48,394
Mistress 9. I've been eagerly
awaiting you.

96
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,628
I have something for you
Master.

97
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:52,894
Take it.

98
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:57,561
Mmmm... what is this power?

99
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:01,961
I have never
seen such a
Host!

100
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:10,194
Actually, sir, this isn't a
Host. It is the light of one who
is protected by a Guardian
Planet.

101
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:15,794
It is a source of great power!
The Legendary Silver Crystal!

102
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:25,128
Such a mysterious light...
almost as if something resides
within. A sacred glow that is
strong, yet soothing.

103
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:26,794
(HOTARU TOMOE) Of course it is!

104
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:26,994
[gasp]

105
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:32,794
That crystal is protected by a
pure soul, the beautiful soul of
a girl.

106
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,128
Who said that?!

107
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:35,461
[regaining composure]

108
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:36,794
I'm hearing things.

109
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:43,794
[waking up]

110
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:46,161
"PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE"

111
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:50,628
Hear me, O loyal minions, my
Witches 5...

112
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:56,161
I command you to rise from the
dead, and curse the anomalies!

113
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:03,194
Bind them with your spells for
eternity!

114
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,694
[snickering]

115
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:09,861
[gasp]

116
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:12,028
Guys...

117
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:16,228
Are you ready?
We're all going
to get Chibi‐Usa's
soul back.

118
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:19,594
The only thing
we can do now
is to keep
moving forward.

119
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:25,528
[agreed sigh] Let's go... to
Mugenzu!

120
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,970
(MINAKO AINO) When did Mugen
Academy turn into that?!

121
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,170
There's a massive
evil aura here.

122
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:40,970
Abnormal power is covering this
place like a dome...

123
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,670
Or rather, in the shape of the
letter Omega.

124
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:44,603
Let's go!

125
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,170
Mhm!

126
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,670
[running exertion]

127
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,303
Huh?

128
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,136
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto...

129
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,636
Will our hearts never be able to
unite and become one?

130
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:02,370
Hm? Sailor Moon?

131
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:03,636
[gasp]

132
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,370
[heavy breathing]

133
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,170
(HARUKA TENOH) I'm sorry, Sailor
Moon.

134
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:13,136
But Neptune, Pluto, and
I are going into that school
to kill Hotaru...

135
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,470
There's no other way...

136
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:17,436

[chuckling] Finally.

139
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:27,203
The Sailor Guardians are here.

140
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:30,003
We've been expecting you.

141
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,170
[gasp]

142
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:34,536
Enjoy your stay at the Infinate
Labyrinth.

143

Your manners are
the worst I've
ever seen.

147
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:51,303
As Mugen Academy's
prefect of etiquette,

148
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,303
I, Yuko Arimura,
shall have to
discipline you.

149
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,336
Eudial!

150
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,636
[charging]

151
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:01,070

[gasp]

156
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:10,036
I don't really think you
wanna keep on having all
these battles.

157
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,270
What?

158
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,203
(EUDIAL) Y ou lack a fighting

00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:17,236
[agreed grunts]

323
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:18,870
Let's go!

324
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:23,636
This ends now!

325
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:29,570
[groan] So you managed
to undo my greatest
spell as Magus
Kaolinite?

326
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:34,736
Well that's the last time! No
more interference!

327
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:38,070
[roaring]

328
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,870
[gasp] A daimon?!

329
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,636
[roaring]

330
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,570
[dodging grunts]

331
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:43,970
I don't think so!

332
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:48,303
Jupiter Coconut Cyclone!

333
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:50,736
Venus...

334
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:57,303
Wink Chain Sword!

335
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:00,803
[roars and screams]

336
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,803
Mercury Aqua Mirage!

337
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,136
Mars... Snake Fire!

338
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:19,136
[screaming]

339
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:24,836
{woozy growls and roar]

340
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:25,370
[gasps]

341
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,136
Take this!

342
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:29,836
[groans and grunts]

343
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:34,870
Hurry! Finish her! Now, Sailor
Moon!

344
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:38,803
We are going to save this
planet!

345
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:41,803
I won't let it suffer the
nightmare of destruction!

346
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:52,303
Rainbow... Moon... Heartche!

347
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:57,303
[growl]

348
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,636
[screaming]

349
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,036
No matter what sort of labyrinth
I may wander into... I swear...

350
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,436
... I will never lose hope!

351
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:15,436
Come on guys, let's hurry.

352
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,370
Let's find Hotaru!

353
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:24,370
[MISTRESS 9] So... Super Sailor
Moon even managed to defeat
Magus Kaolinite.

354
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:32,203
No matter. The time has come to
make this Omega Area into our
sacred land.

355
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:36,103
And, so long as we have the
Legendary Silver Crystal...

356
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:39,036
...no one can stop us. We've got
nothing to fear.

357
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:55,036
[licking lips]

358
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:34,336
(USAGI TSUKINO) No more
hesitating! I'm going to save
Chibi‐Usa and Hotaru, no matter
what!

359
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,303
Next time, "Act.35 Infinity 9
'Infinate Labyrinth' 2"

360
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:43,336
The moonlight is a messanger of
love.
