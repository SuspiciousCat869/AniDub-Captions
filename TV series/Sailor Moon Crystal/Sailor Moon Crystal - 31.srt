1
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:25,400
Protected by Neptune,
the outer Planet of the Seas.

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,333
Guardian of the Deep Sea.

3
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:30,066
I am Sailor Neptune!

4
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,333
Protected by Uranus,
the outer Planet of the Wind.

5
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,133
Guardian of Heavens.

6
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,666
I am Sailor Uranus!

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,166
Sailor Neptune?

8
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:43,200
And Sailor Uranus?

9
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,366
No way!
What's going on?

10
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,366
Are you new Guardians?

11
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:48,666
You don't need to know.

12
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:49,766
[gasp]

13
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,500
I recognize
that hand mirror!

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
It's a Talisman!

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,433
[gasps]

16
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,366
A Talisman?

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,233
Are you sure Chibi Moon?
That's what it is?

18
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,700
Hello there, Little Usagi.

19
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,200
We meet again.

20
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,800
Sailor Neptune...

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,766
Is she the same lady
who flew me home

22
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,233
in her helicopter?

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,533
Does that mean you're the
ones who made us all have

24
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:13,466
the same nightmare, about
collecting the Talismans?

25
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:14,366
Nightmare?

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,766
I see.

27
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:18,233
So, you're all starting
to feel it as well...

28
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:23,066
Your dreams of Talismans
are dark premonitions.

29
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,733
If you know something,
you need to tell us.

30
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,366
What's this looming
disaster all about?

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,466
Don't get the wrong idea.

32
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,100
We have no intention of
teaming up with any of you.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,066
[gasp]

34
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,166
But just now...

35
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:35,400
You helped us.

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,633
Saving you once does
not mean we're friends.

37
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:38,600
Wait!

38
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,633
You're clearly after
The Death Busters,

39
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,833
same as we are.

40
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,266
Can you tell us about them?
Who are they?

41
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:46,100
Again, you
don't need to know.

42
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:48,433
[gasp]

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,233
Michiru Kaioh!

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
My ears are splitting!

45
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,066
It's too loud!

46
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,133
Is it you two?

47
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,400
The destruction?!

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,133
Are you the cause of it?

49
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:03,466
Answer me!

50
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:05,500
World...

51
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:06,466
Shaking!

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,766
[gasp]

53
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,166
You're awake.

54
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:05,933
Are you alright, Usagi?

55
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,933
I can't believe those two!

56
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,166
They just attacked
us for no reason!

57
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,366
Luna, we've
confirmed they're Guardians.

58
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:13,600
What else do you know?

59
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,800
This doesn't make sense.

60
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,866
Neptune and Uranus
aren't like you.

61
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,966
They shouldn't be here.

62
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:22,466
They are Sailor Guardians
but more like Pluto was.

63
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:25,333
They have their own mission
and separate domains.

64
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,866
Given how far out
those domains are,

65
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,766
we never should
have met them.

66
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,666
They are
legendary Guardians,

67
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:32,866
shrouded in mystery.

68
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,433
It was said they protected
Silver Millennium from the

69
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,300
far reaches of space.

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,300
I didn't ever expect
for them to be reborn.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,933
But if we're in a crisis,
that might explain why.

72
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,333
They do seem to be
after the Death Busters.

73
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,433
Okay, so that means
they're on our side!

74
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,500
They're our
fellow Guardians, right?

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,466
They attacked us, unprovoked
and without explanation.

76
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:54,466
To me, that
makes them enemies.

77
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:56,633
They clearly said
they weren't friends.

78
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,966
So, reasoning with them
most likely isn't an option.

79
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,866
At this point they've both
threatened and attacked us.

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,566
If it happens again, we've
got no choice but to fight back.

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,566
Saving you doesn't
mean we're friends.

82
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Hey, Mamo.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,266
I know what everyone
said, but I don't think they

84
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,366
really wanna fight us.

85
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,033
They're good.

86
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,233
I'm sure of it.

87
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,866
Let's hope so.

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,366
But if they're
not our enemies...

89
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:39,400
What are they after?

90
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,866
Where am I?

91
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,233
What happened here?

92
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,333
Who are you?

93
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,400
Are you the God
of Destruction?!

94
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,733
[gasp]

95
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,100
What was that?

96
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,933
We had the same
dream didn't we, Mamo?

97
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,933
The God of Destruction.

98
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,966
Three Talismans...

99
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,966
Prophesized to
bring destruction.

100
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,833
One of them we know:
Sailor Neptune's mirror.

101
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,000
But what are the other two?

102
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,633
And, where are they?

103
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:24,900
[sigh]

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Mamo is late today.

105
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,966
The God of Destruction.

106
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,000
[giggle] Mamo!

107
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,966
I've gotta stop
bumping into you.

108
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,766
If we keep
meeting like this,

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
who knows what might happen?

110
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,800
Sailor Uranus!

111
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,000
Please don't go!

112
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,500
I know who you are.

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,933
I figured it out.

114
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,900
I could sense
it in the wind.

115
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,500
I don't understand.

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,766
We're all Guardians.

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,900
Why won't you and
Neptune talk to us?

118
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,533
How come you won't turn
around and look at me, Haruka?

119
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,966
If only things could
have been different, Usagi.

120
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,866
I wish you knew
me as I am now...

121
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:12,633
If only.

122
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,700
Tell me, Haruka.

123
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,133
Are you a man?
Or are you a woman?

124
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,466
I'm confused.
How should I treat you?

125
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,633
Is my sex that important?

126
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,066
Can't you just see me as me?

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,566
Usa! [gasp]

128
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:40,800
And the prince
arrives just in time.

129
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,400
Usa, are you alright?

130
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:58,466
What's wrong with me?

131
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,433
I don't understand
why I'm crying.

132
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,966
Why does it hurt so much?

133
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:07,566
Hey, everybody!

134
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,766
Is Mamo here?

135
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,533
Nope. Haven't seen him.

136
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:11,233
Darn.

137
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,866
I was hoping he'd be here.

138
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:15,066
I could use his
help with my homework.

139
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,200
What homework?

140
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,133
This.

141
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,733
Is that supposed to be...

142
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,100
Some sort of coffee mug?

143
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,566
No, it's not.

144
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,033
It's more special,
The Legendary Holy Grail.

145
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,066
What's that?
I've never heard of it.

146
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,733
The Legendary Holy
Grail is a sacred chalice.

147
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:34,766
Neo Queen Serenity is said to
have used it when she was young.

148
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,633
According to the stories,
during periods of great

149
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:40,566
danger or crisis, the Grail
would endow the Queen with

150
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,133
wondrous powers so she
could save all her people.

151
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,066
I've only ever seen the
painting of it that hangs in

152
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,066
Mommy's room.

153
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,600
But, it's decorated
with lots of jewels...

154
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,600
It's so sparkly!

155
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,133
I used to dream about
having one of my very own.

156
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,133
Wow.

157
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,800
Maybe it was a something
she used as a weapon?

158
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:01,600
I don't know.

159
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,633
I never asked about it.

160
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,033
I kinda wasn't allowed
to go in Mommy's room.

161
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,300
But we sneaked
in lots of times, anyway.

162
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,833
Didn't we, Diana?

163
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:10,866
Meow!

164
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,033
Her room was full of
rare and precious objects.

165
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:17,533
Books, treasures, all
sort of interesting things.

166
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:20,766
And her bed was so
white and fluffy...

167
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,600
Do you wanna go home?

168
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,700
I promised I wouldn't until I
was a true Sailor Guardian.

169
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,966
I meant it.

170
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,500
Mamo is probably back
at his apartment by now,

171
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000
so we'll go check there.

172
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,800
Want some coffee?

173
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,966
Sure...

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,966
I wonder what Mamo
thought when he

175
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,533
saw me with Haruka...

176
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,166
Is he mad at me?

177
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:56,966
<i>But, it's not like I planned</i>
<i>to meet Haruka in the park.</i>

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,166
He just happened
to be there...

179
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,266
And we...

180
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,933
‐Listen Mamo, I‐‐
‐Hi, Mamo!

181
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:09,133
The door was open, so we
just let ourselves in and...

182
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,266
Were you and Mamo fighting?

183
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,766
Why would you think that?

184
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,633
Well, look at him.

185
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,133
He seems kinda grumpy.

186
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,833
He does, doesn't he?

187
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:23,933
What happened?

188
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,800
Did you do something
to make him mad?

189
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,866
Like maybe...

190
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,533
Cheat on him?

191
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:29,600
[embarrassed grunt]

192
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,600
Chibi‐Usa, is there a
reason you came to visit me?

193
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,166
Oh, I almost forgot.

194
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,933
I wanted you to help
me with my homework.

195
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:36,833
Huh?!

196
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:38,533
Oh, no! My assignment
for English class!

197
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:39,866
It's due tomorrow!

198
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,666
I'd better get
home and finish it!

199
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,533
Don't go!

200
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,966
It's important.
I need you to help, too!

201
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:46,533
Please?

202
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,166
I'm making a replica of
the Legendary Holy Grail,

203
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,300
for art class.

204
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,866
Can you help me out?

205
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,133
What's a Holy Grail?

206
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,600
It's a sacred goblet.

207
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,633
Often used in
religious rites.

208
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,266
The ancients would put
wine or holy water in it for

209
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:01,933
ritual ceremonies.

210
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,066
They believed drinking from
the grail would purify their

211
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,100
bodies and empower
them spiritually.

212
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,233
So basically,
it's a special cup.

213
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,700
That's it!

214
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,600
That's the one!

215
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:12,666
Could you help me
make something like it?

216
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:13,866
Let's see, now.

217
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,266
What if we decorated it with
beads and rhinestones so it

218
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:17,833
looks more authentic?

219
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,200
That's a great idea!

220
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,266
[giggle]

221
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:28,666
There!

222
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:29,900
Look, Chibi‐Usa.
It's done!

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
What do you think?

224
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,266
Mamo, I'm sorry.

225
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:50,733
I didn't mean to be
so close with Haruka.

226
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,033
Don't be silly, Usa.

227
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,266
I trust you.

228
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,433
I trust you, too.

229
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,266
But, even the other
day, when I saw you

230
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,966
talking with Michiru.

231
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:06,100
It still made
me feel jealous.

232
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,766
Guess that was stupid, huh?

233
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,100
It's not.

234
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,666
I feel the same way.

235
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,000
I've been jealous.

236
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,666
Part of me doesn't like
all the attention that guy's

237
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:17,900
been giving you.

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,266
But, I'm sure he
has his reasons.

239
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,233
The way he
always looks at you.

240
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,000
It's like he wants to tell
you something but he can't.

241
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,766
As if some huge burden
is weighing on him...

242
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,133
On both of them.

243
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,100
Yeah, you're right...

244
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,266
They're in pain.

245
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,666
While my heart will
always belong to Mamo,

246
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,166
something did happen
back there in the park.

247
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:42,400
I could sense
Haruka's anguish and sorrow.

248
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,766
It was so intense
it made me cry.

249
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,933
We should probably
go wake Chibi‐Usa.

250
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,000
Let her sleep.

251
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,800
Huh?

252
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,966
Both of you can
stay here tonight.

253
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:00,233
Looks like they
finally made up.

254
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,333
That's good.

255
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,333
So much rain
this time of year.

256
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,400
It's depressing.

257
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,733
No kidding!

258
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,700
Mid‐terms,
pre‐tests, and finals?

259
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,500
how's a girl
supposed to be happy?!

260
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,833
All these tests
are quite necessary.

261
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,066
High school
entrance exams are soon.

262
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,533
Don't remind me.

263
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:32,666
[chuckle]

264
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,166
Hey, have you guys heard
about the new prep school?

265
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,333
Huh?

266
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,066
Do you mean the
Mugen Prep School?

267
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,166
Yeah.

268
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:42,333
They allow any student
to take their mock exams.

269
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,800
Not merely those enrolled.

270
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,166
But there's one girl
there I just can't beat.

271
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,000
What?!

272
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,166
She actually
scores better than you?

273
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:50,366
Who is this girl?!

274
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,066
Her name is Yui Bido.

275
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,633
She goes to Mugen Academy.

276
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,566
I'm eager to meet her.

277
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,233
They all look so focused!

278
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,433
I was wondering who got
those perfect marks on the

279
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,800
placement exam.

280
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,600
You must be Ami Mizuno.

281
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:09,466
Tales of your
genius precede you.

282
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:11,133
I'm Yui Bido.

283
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,266
It's nice to make
your acquaintance.

284
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:15,266
I suppose you could
say that I'm the genius

285
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,733
of Mugen Prep.

286
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,133
Pleased to meet you.

287
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,933
Of course Mugen Prep
is a fine institution.

288
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:23,566
But nothing compares to the
comprehensive structure of

289
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,733
Mugen Academy.

290
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,266
No other school could hope
to imitate our curriculum or

291
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,433
our environment
for learning.

292
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:32,600
Miss Mizuno, You wouldn't
be interested in a trial

293
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,466
enrollment, would you?

294
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,766
You're actually going to
attend Mugen Academy?!

295
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,866
But it's dangerous and
you'll be all alone.

296
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:41,933
Don't worry, guys.

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,766
If anything happens, I'll
contact you immediately.

298
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,733
Alright, then.

299
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:47,900
Be careful, okay?

300
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,266
Ah, yes, Miss Mizuno.

301
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,900
Here for the trial
enrollment, correct?

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,966
The middle school is on
the thirteenth floor.

303
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,266
Please report to the
third year science class.

304
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:19,866
[gasp]

305
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,533
I was waiting for you.

306
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:33,466
For a moment I thought that
thing was gonna suck me in.

307
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,433
What is that?

308
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,766
Beautiful, isn't it?

309
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,833
That's the Tau Star System.

310
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,700
It's a perfect miniature
universe created

311
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,466
by our science class.

312
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,200
Very impressive.

313
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:46,966
Excuse me.

314
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,433
I'd love to discuss further
but I have another class.

315
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,200
Wait here for me, would you?

316
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,266
Sure.

317
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,866
The Tau System?

318
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:57,833
Never heard of it.

319
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,366
I'm sensing unusual
power from this girl.

320
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:07,033
Could she be protected
by a guardian planet?

321
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,400
A Sailor Guardian?

322
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,600
Yes, I believe she is.

323
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,066
If my theory is correct, her
attraction to the miniature

324
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,600
universe does prove that
she is a Sailor Guardian.

325
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:23,500
Allow me to drop my diguise
as Yui Bido so I can deal

326
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,766
with her as Viluy.

327
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:27,566
Considering Mimete
was only a Level 40,

328
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,700
and Eudial a Level 78,
the odds were against

329
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,766
them before their
fights even began.

330
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,600
I, however, am a Level 202.

331
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,533
And, by using my
special system,

332
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:40,033
I will obtain the Host
of a Sailor Guardian.

333
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,366
I'm sure such a prize would
be very pleasing to our Master.

334
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:46,733
The Host of one of
the Sailor Guardians...

335
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,700
I can only imagine
the immense energy

336
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,733
it would have.

337
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,600
[gasp]

338
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,833
Should we follow?

339
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,433
[animal roars]

340
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,500
An animal
research facility?!

341
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,400
What's that back there?

342
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,433
It's the same type of
monster that attacked us!

343
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,066
This school is the source.

344
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,133
There you are.

345
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:32,966
[gasp]

346
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,466
Class is in
session and you're late.

347
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
[chuckle]

348
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,433
You didn't
miss much, though.

349
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:42,800
Things just got under way.

350
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:46,400
You can see my
computer program's nano

351
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,600
machines at work.

352
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
Watch how fast they suck the
Hosts out of these students.

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,333
Using my ingenious system,
not only can I offer Master

354
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:59,400
Pharaoh 90 Hosts, but I
can also utilize their empty

355
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,033
shells as Vessels!

356
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,700
It's so hard being a genius.

357
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,566
[gasp]

358
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,033
That's enough!

359
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,133
Class has been canceled.

360
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:14,200
Haruka?

361
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,133
Michiru?!

362
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,033
Who are you?

363
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,566
What is it, Ami?

364
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,833
It's just as we suspected.

365
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,066
The Death Busters
control Mugen Academy!

366
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,466
You're not getting away!

367
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,400
Mercury Planet
Power Make Up!

368
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,966
Protected by Mercury,
The Planet of water,

369
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,400
Guardian of Wisdom.

370
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,400
I am Sailor Mercury!

371
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:47,133
Oh don't get so
high and mighty,

372
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:48,133
Miss Genius!

373
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,533
I knew who you were!

374
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,466
And you're no match for me!

375
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,566
I am Viluy, Level 202!

376
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,733
Mercury Aqua Mirage!

377
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:07,100
You're not so smart.

378
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,933
I can predict
all your attacks.

379
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,633
But, now, it's my turn.

380
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,966
Mosaic Buster!

381
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,466
[scream] Something's
eating into my body...

382
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,933
[chuckle]

383
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,233
Hurts doesn't it?

384
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,700
By now, my computer
program's nano machines

385
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,533
have worked their way
into your body,

386
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:28,600
and are slowly breaking it
down from the inside out.

387
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,533
Soon there will be nothing
left except your beautiful

388
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,133
soul, your Host.

389
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,600
Now, then, your
demise is imminent.

390
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,033
So why not offer up your
Sailor Guardian soul to our

391
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,100
Master and be done with it?

392
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:41,766
[laughing]

393
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:45,466
Mars Snake Fire!

394
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,800

00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,800
Mercury!

396
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,866
Daimons, Attack!

397
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,033
[growl roars]

398
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:09,100
I think we're gonna have
to drop out of this school.

399
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,566
Oh, well.

400
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,533
Haruka!

401
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:12,633
Michiru?

402
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,966
Uranus Planet Power Make Up!

403
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:37,066
Neptune Planet
Power Make up!

404
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,933
Protected by Uranus, the
outer Planet of the Wind.

405
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,266
Guardian of Heavens.

406
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:02,533
I am Sailor Uranus!

407
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:08,300
Protected by Neptune,
the outer Planet of the Seas.

408
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,166
Guardian of the Deep Sea.

409
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,533
I am Sailor Neptune!

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
[gasp]

411
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,533
My magical tool...

412
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:22,166
My Talisman!

413
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,966
Show thine power
and protect me!

414
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,533
Space Sword Blaster!

415
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,166
[death screams]

416
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,266
Sailor Uranus's
Space Sword...

417
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,700
Could that be the
second Talisman?

418
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:56,133
Uranus, Neptune,
come back!

419
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,166
They came to help us again?

420
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,766
I don't understand!

421
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,733
Reika! Hey!

422
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,866
A bunch of us are
going drinking.

423
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:08,666
Wanna come?

424
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,266
Sorry, Motoki,
I wish I could.

425
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:12,733
But I've got
Mineralogy club tonight.

426
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,066
Aw, too bad...

427
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,733
[chuckle]

428
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,766
Looks like somebody's
finally moving into that old

429
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,100
lab space down the hall.

430
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,066
Are you a new
research assistant?

431
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,733
Huh? Oh, no.

432
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,033
I'm just a student in
the science department.

433
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,066
But, they're letting me
help out with this lab.

434
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,066
So, I'm getting
my station set‐up.

435
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,666
You're in the
science department?!

436
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:38,833
So am I!

437
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,900
I'm Reika Nishimura, a
sophomore going for my B. S.

438
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:43,166
My Mineralogy Club
meets next door.

439
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:44,900
So, hi there neighbor!

440
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,233
I'm a freshman.

441
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,266
Physics major.

442
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,766
Specializing in
theoretical physics.

443
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,866
My name is Setsuna Meioh.

444
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,266
Nice to meet you.

445
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:30,233
Uranus!

446
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,300
Neptune!

447
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:33,666
<i>Aren't we all</i>
<i>fighting for the same thing?</i>

448
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:39,900
<i>Next time, "Act.31 Infinity</i>
<i>5 Setsuna ‐ Sailor Pluto ‐."</i>

449
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,200
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
