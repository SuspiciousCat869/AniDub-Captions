1
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:22,566
Who are you?

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,866
You're cute, Bun‐head.
But don't get in our way,

3
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:26,000
or you'll be sorry.

4
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:28,900
Some of the games we play...

5
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,333
...are dangerous.

6
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,033
Sailor Moon, are you okay?

7
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:47,000
Could she possibly be
a Sailor Guardian?

8
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,066
You made contact with this
supposed Guardian?!

9
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,133
Mmhm...

10
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,033
What happened?

11
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,133
She said don't
get in their way.

12
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,133
That's it?

13
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,000
Did she mention her name?

14
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,333
Was there anything else?

15
00:02:58,433 --> 00:02:59,333
[gasp]

16
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,266
No. That was it.

17
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,800
Like Luna said, we
still don't know that

18
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,433
she's really a Guardian.

19
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,133
We need to nail down
her true identity.

20
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,100
Haruka Tenoh...

21
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,733
He does look like her...

22
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,300
Hey, Bun‐head!

23
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,900
[gasp]

24
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
[gasp]

25
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,266
Who are you?

26
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,700
[snicker]

27
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,433
Wait!

28
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,700
Why are you always
running away?

29
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:58,066
We don't have much time. We
have a mission to complete.

30
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,300
We must gather...

31
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,766
Huh?

32
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:03,966
The Talismans...

33
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,100
The Talismans...

34
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,133
We must gather
the Talismans.

35
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,133
The three...

36
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:12,866
Talismans...

37
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,466
For the God of Destruction.

38
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:21,966
[gasp]

39
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,433
Talismans?

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Destruction God?

41
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,000
That nightmare again.
What does it mean?

42
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,666
Something seems to want
us to gather those

43
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,033
Talismans. But I have a
bad feeling about it.

44
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,700
We must gather
the Talismans.

45
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,933
The three Talismans...

46
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,866
For the God of Destruction.

47
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,700
What did that mean?

48
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,033
Good Morning, Usa.

49
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,100
You're late again.

50
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,733
Sorry, Mamo.

51
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,166
Michiru Kaioh...

52
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,766
[gasp] It's her!

53
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,866
Oh wow. I didn't realize
she was a professional.

54
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,066
Mamo?

55
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,333
Is he thinking
about Michiru?

56
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,166
Is he interested in her?

57
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,100
"The multi‐purpose hall,
erected on the grounds of

58
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,333
Mugen Academy, is
finally complete."

59
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,866
"Plans to build hotel and
condominium complexes

60
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,100
adjacent to the dome are
also in the works."

61
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,766
"In recent months, the
entire Mugenzu area has

62
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,000
experienced a
construction boom."

63
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,733
Interesting.

64
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,333
Your friends were pretty
clear they didn't want me

65
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,900
anywhere near you.

66
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,000
So I wasn't going to
come here anymore.

67
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,766
But then, I missed you.

68
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,800
What's going on? Why
is my heart pounding?

69
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,133
It's strange, but for some
reason I can see him as

70
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,100
both a boy and a girl.

71
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,100
Hey...

72
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,900
I never did tell you
my name, did I?

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,100
You don't have to.

74
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:37,400
I already know it's
Haruka Tenoh.

75
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,966
Turns out you're famous. You
both are, you and Michiru.

76
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:46,933
Hear her play just once...

77
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,133
and you'll wish you
could listen forever.

78
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,400
The way she breathes
life into her instrument

79
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,066
it's like magic.

80
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,100
If you're interested,
you should come.

81
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:01,333
So you know my name,
tell me yours.

82
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,800
Usagi... Tsukino.

83
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,900
Usagi Tsukino.
That's a cute name.

84
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:10,133
Haruka, wait!

85
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,333
He vanished...

86
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:21,966
Here one moment and gone
the next. Just like the wind.

87
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:26,066
Who are you, Haruka Tenoh?
I want to know more...

88
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,300
Hey guys, what's wrong?

89
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,133
You all look so serious.

90
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,733
We were talking about a
dream we had last night.

91
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,033
It was kind of upsetting.

92
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,466
What? Did it have to
do with Tailsmans?

93
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,200
So you had it too?

94
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,866
All of us having the same
dream on the same night...

95
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:52,000
Can't be coincidence.

96
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,000
Look! Mimi Hanyu is giving a
concert at the new dome!

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Aw! But it's only
for Mugen kids.

98
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
If I could, I'd transfer
to Mugen Academy

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,266
just to be able to go!

100
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,900
That is a perfect idea!

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,066
What're you talking about?

102
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,466
The very first act to grace
the stage of the new Mugen

103
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:10,200
Academy Dome will be none
other than the ultra‐fabulous

104
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,933
superstar, Mimi Hanyu!

105
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,366
Who's Mimi Hanyu?

106
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:14,466
[gasped scream]

107
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,400
What?! Are you
serious, Usagi?!

108
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,366
She's only like the
best‐selling teen pop idol

109
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:21,066
in Japan! You had to have
seen her commercials!?

110
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,700
I have to go to her concert!
It'll be so awesome!

111
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,433
Mina! Now is not the time
to be a rabid fangirl.

112
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:29,200
Why not? If I can sneak into
her concert and spy on Mugen

113
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:32,433
Academy at the same time, it
kills two birds with one stone!

114
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,866
Hey, look at the
other poster.

115
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,400
Michiru Kaioh is
performing too, apparently

116
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,400
on the same day.

117
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,700
Maybe I should go.

118
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,933
To see Mimi Hanyu's concert?!

119
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,066
Uh, no. I meant to
Michiru's recital.

120
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,366
You already have tickets?

121
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,133
Yeah, somebody gave me
a whole bunch. See?

122
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:52,133
There's enough for
everyone to go.

123
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:55,033
Michiru plays so beautifully.
I'd love to hear more.

124
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,966
Yeah, me too. Let's
all go check out.

125
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,800
I'm in. And who knows,
maybe we'll learn something

126
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,266
about the Talismans.

127
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:04,200
As long as we're
together, we'll be fine.

128
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,266
Absolutely.

129
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,033
But I wanna see Mimi Hanyu!

130
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,166
Mina...

131
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,966
The Sailor Guardians...

132
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:16,766
They defeated Eudial so easily,
their strength is formidable.

133
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,333
Especially this one,
and the power of the

134
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:23,966
light she possesses...

135
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
A power like that of our
Taioron Crystal. I must

136
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,166
obtain it and give
it to the Master.

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,266
First, however, I need to
identify the three Talismans

138
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,133
I saw reflected in my water
mirror, the Talismans

139
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,000
foretold to bring destruction.

140
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,866
It is imperative I
seize and destroy

141
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,633
them as soon as possible!

142
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,833
I am here, Magus Kaolinite.
How may I be of service?

143
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:55,433
Eudial failed us, Mimete.
You must make up for it.

144
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:59,133
Of course, leave it to me,
Mimete of Witches 5.

145
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,433
As class prefect of Mugen
Performing Arts, and a teen

146
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,366
pop sensation, complete
with her own fan club,

147
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:09,966
I, Mimi Hanyu, will use my
lyrical and angelic singing

148
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:13,833
voice, to collect many Hostes
for Master Pharaoh 90.

149
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't forget the Sailor
Guardians will try to

150
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,033
interfere. So make sure
you are prepared.

151
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,833
[giggle] Not to worry!

152
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,333
Chibi‐Usa!

153
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,100
Look! I brought some
of the photos we

154
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,433
took at Mugen C park!

155
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,766
[chuckles]

156
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:31,133
I'm making such
a weird face!

157
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:32,466
You scared me, ya know.

158
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,833
When you left the park to
find your hat, and didn't

159
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,766
come back, I got really
worried about you.

160
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,333
Oh! I'm sorry.

161
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:42,266
That reminds me... I still
have her handkerchief.

162
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:44,133
I never gave it back to her.

163
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,966
Hey Hotaru!

164
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,166
I wanted to return your
handkerchief. Thank you for

165
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,933
helping me the other day.

166
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:04,166
You came all the way
here just to return this?

167
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,166
[chuckle]

168
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:11,200
It's cold out here. Would
you like to come in for a bit?

169
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,333
Wow...

170
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:17,700
You have so many lamps
in here... [gasp]

171
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:21,233
They make your room feel
like a romantic fairy tale.

172
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,033
I like dimly lit places.

173
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:26,366
You also like wearing dark
clothes, don't you?

174
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,233
I just noticed you wear
black tights all the time.

175
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,233
When I was little, I
was badly injured.

176
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,833
And I still have
a lot of scars.

177
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,900
Hotaru! Are you okay?

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,200
It's just one of my
attacks, don't worry.

179
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,933
Do you need anything?

180
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,366
My amulet, that helps.

181
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,766
It's sitting over on my desk.

182
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,400
Could you please
get it for me?

183
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,100
Here. Will you be okay?

184
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,066
You should go now.

185
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,166
Hotaru...

186
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,900
I'm not normal.
You don't want to be

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,266
around someone like me.

188
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:13,266
Please leave! Pretty soon I
won't even be me anymore.

189
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:26,000
Here, Hotaru. Give
me your hand.

190
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,800
It's my turn to be the
one to help you.

191
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:46,733
My body stopped hurting.
I feel so warm now.

192
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,266
Somehow it's giving me
my strength back...

193
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,833
Is the stone on this
necklace your amulet?

194
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,266
I'm not sure what you mean.

195
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:00,066
Amulets are good luck charms
that are supposed to protect

196
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,366
you. They have mystical
powers to keep you safe.

197
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,233
Wow! You know, that's
exactly what it is!

198
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,233
But it can protect more than
just me, It's got lots of

199
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,833
power, enough to
protect you, too.

200
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:18,733
You know, I haven't even
asked you your name yet.

201
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,300
My real name is Usagi
Tsukino. But all my friends

202
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,133
call me Chibi‐Usa.

203
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,300
That's pretty. And hey,
don't worry,

204
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,666
I won't tell anyone
you're Chibi‐Moon.

205
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,400
Your secrets will be
safe with me.

206
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,400
[chuckle]

207
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,066
Also, about the other day,
I owe you an apology.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,666
The creature that
attacked you out in front of

209
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,800
the school... I'm
sorry about that.

210
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,133
I think it might have been
one of the test subjects

211
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,966
from my father's lab.

212
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,800
Daddy is kind of eccentric.

213
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,800
His research and
experiments are creepy.

214
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,666
Please don't tell,
almost no one knows.

215
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,866
He's really not a bad
person. I wouldn't want him

216
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,400
to get into trouble.
Back when I got hurt,

217
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,466
the one who saved
me was him.

218
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,300
I won't tell anyone.

219
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:07,066
It stays between us.
Pinky promise.

220
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:29,633
It's darker than I realized.
I should call Usagi or Mamo.

221
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:34,800
Need a lift Little Bun‐Head?

222
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,433
If you're going back to Usagi's,
we'll give you a ride.

223
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:39,933
Who are you? Are you
guys friends of Usagi's?

224
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:42,700
I don't think she knows us,
but we know her very well.

225
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,233
You might say we were...
friends in another life.

226
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,733
This is so cool!

227
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:52,700
[giggle] I've never gotten
to fly in a helicopter before!

228
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:55,700
[chuckle] I saw you
were visiting Hotaru.

229
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,900
‐Are you and she friends?
‐Mmhm!

230
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,266
Hey wait, does that mean
you know Hotaru, too?

231
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,933
Kind of... So, you two discuss
anything interesting?

232
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,933
That's a secret.

233
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay then...

234
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,933
[chuckle]

235
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,433
Well, one thing we talked
about was amulets.

236
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:16,500
Like good luck charms?

237
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,166
You know what they are!
Does that mean you have one?

238
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,766
I suppose you could say my
hand mirror is an amulet.

239
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:29,166
[chuckle] It is much more
than just a simple trinket.

240
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,866
This mirror is a Talisman.

241
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,166
A Talisman?

242
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
What is that?

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,866
Goodbye, Little Usagi.

244
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,200
Don't tell anyone what we
talked about, okay?

245
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,200
It's a secret.

246
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,166
Chibi‐Usa!

247
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,433
What's going on Here?

248
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,266
Isn't it cool? They gave
me a ride home in their

249
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,766
helicopter after I went
to visit Hotaru!

250
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,300
I almost didn't go with
them. But they said they

251
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,833
knew you, so I
figured it was okay.

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,333
Till we meet again...

253
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,866
Goodnight, Bun‐heads.

254
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,233
That's one of the
girls who flew me

255
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,000
home in the helicopter.

256
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,833
She's a professional
violinist?

257
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,266
Chibi‐Usa.

258
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,133
Coming, Mamo.

259
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,366
Is that Chibi‐Usa?

260
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:38,900
She's with Mamoru?

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,166
[gasp] You guys are here, too!

262
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,066
Mamo, I didn't know
you were coming.

263
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,166
Michiru gave me a
couple of free tickets.

264
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,700
I had originally planned
on asking you, but I

265
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,733
heard you say you
were already coming.

266
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:53,200
So that's what happened...

267
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:16,733
â™ª

268
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,033
The melody reminds me of an
ocean current, with rolling

269
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:28,300
waves that ebb and flow...

270
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,066
It's as if I'm at the
bottom of the sea.

271
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,600
There's Haruka...

272
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:44,133
Hey, Minako's gone.

273
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,966
Do you think she went
to the restroom?

274
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,733
I don't care about some
stupid violin. I'm going to

275
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,300
that Mimi Hanyu
concert. Usagi's not

276
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,266
the only one with
something up her sleeve.

277
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,333
Ta‐da!

278
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,766
My special compact from
back when I was Sailor V.

279
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,833
Moon Power!

280
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,166
Change me into a Mugen
Academy student! A boy one!

281
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,966
All right!

282
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:11,333
[cheering]

283
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,133
Thank you everybody!

284
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,766
I'm so happy to be
performing for you all today

285
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,700
on our brand new stage.

286
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,966
Oh‐my‐gosh! Oh‐my‐gosh!

287
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,400
Oh‐my‐gosh! She's
even cuter in person!

288
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,300
I love our dear
Mugen Academy,

289
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,300
and all my fellow students.

290
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,366
Are school is the best and I
would do anything for it.

291
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:31,233
Even offer up my own body.

292
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,633
You feel the same way, right?

293
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,900
[cheering]

294
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,866
Alright everyone, I would
like you all to quiet down

295
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:43,800
for this next song. I
wrote it just for you.

296
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,633
Give over your bodies, your
souls, your hearts and

297
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:49,700
minds. Offer them up to me...

298
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,866
...and to our Master Pharaoh 90!

299
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:57,966
[gasp]

300
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,966
What's happening to my body?

301
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,366
[chuckle]

302
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,200
What's going on?

303
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,933
It's over already?

304
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,700
Usagi!

305
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,966
Where are you Minako?

306
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:23,000
Mimi Hanyu is one of
the Death Busters!

307
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,233
Get over here, quick!

308
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:28,866
Venus Planet Power Make Up!

309
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm onto you, Mimi Hanyu.

310
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,700
Beneath that glitz and
glamour lies the face of evil!

311
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,400
Wake up! Don't let
this siren fool you!

312
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,800
And who are you?

313
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,166
Protected by Venus,
the Planet of Beauty.

314
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,700
Guardian of Love.

315
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,133
I am Sailor Venus!

316
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:23,366
In the name of Venus, I
will punish you with love!

317
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,933
This is a private
performance!

318
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,033
Get off my stage!

319
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,133
Sorry! No encore for you.

320
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:36,966
Venus Wink Chain Sword!

321
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,033
Daimons!
