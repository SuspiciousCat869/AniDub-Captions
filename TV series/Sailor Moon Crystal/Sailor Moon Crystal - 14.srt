1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,080
I am...

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,040
Sailor Moon!

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,130
Give me the Crystal's power
or I'll rip you into little
pieces!

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,140
Legendary Silver
Crystal...

5
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,160
Grant me the strength to
triumph over Queen Metalia!

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,040
And rid the world
of her evil!

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,030
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,050
I am Sailor Moon and
Princess Serenity!

9
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,070
By the power of
the Moon...

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,050
And the Silver
Crystal...

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,130
I banish you!
Forever!

12
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,010
I am Sailor Moon.

13
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,090
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish
you!

14
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,080
It's not effecting
her at all!

15
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,230
[evil laughter]

16
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,210
[gasp]

17
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,150
Always remember my dear
Serenity, The Legendary

18
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,060
Silver Crystal
follows your heart.

19
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,050
Beseech the great power
of the Moon to awaken.

20
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,210
Offer a prayer to the Moon's
sacred tower. Then peace will
return to our kingdom.

21
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,110
Sailor Moon! Don't
hesitate! Just pray!

22
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,100
Believe in yourself!

23
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,060
Mamo's right!

24
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,070
Luna!

25
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,030
Ami!

26
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,060
Rei!

27
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,130
Mako!

28
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,010
Minako!

29
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,210
For everyone!

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,110
I won't give up!

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,230
O Great Power of the
Moon, Awaken!

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,120
Lend me your strength! And
I will match it with every

33
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,050
ounce of energy
that I have left!

34
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,000
Usagi.

35
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,140
Usagi.

36
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,140
Usagi.

37
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,090
Usagi.

38
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,100
[gasp]

39
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,050
The Tower! It's
regenerating!

40
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,160
[gasp]

41
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,180
Luna...

42
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,230
I have something
to show you.

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,130
This is the Chamber of
Prayer: A sacred place, at

44
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,090
the very heart of
the Moon Castle.

45
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,150
And there stands the
sanctuary's holy monument:
The Crystal Tower.

46
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,020
If there should come a
time when our kingdom,

47
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,130
or those that we love,
are ever in danger...

48
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,090
Offer a prayer to
this tower...

49
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,010
And the Moon's power,
will protect them.

50
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,000
Prayer is the key!

51
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,030
That's what's activating
the tower! Someone is
praying to it!

52
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,010
A resolute and heartfelt
prayer... Could it be?

53
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,130
Sailor Moon!

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,130
She's free of Metalia and
fighting to save the Earth!
She's praying!

55
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,180
What?!

56
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,050
You're not alone, Sailor
Moon. I will pray with you.

57
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,150
Two hearts are
stronger than one!

58
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,120
Together, we will release
the great power of the
Moon!

59
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,020
The power!

60
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,140
Such brilliant white light!
I've never seen the Moon
shine like this!

61
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,010
It's gleaming just like
the Legendary Silver
Crystal!

62
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,100
Oh! What luminous
radiance!

63
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,040
The supreme power I have
been thirsting for! At
last!

64
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,150
What's going on? I cannot
reach it. What is this
force?

65
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,090
It is... pushing
me back!

66
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,010
Be gone Queen Metalia!

67
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,080
By the power of this
sacred moonlight...

68
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,110
I will vanquish you!

69
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:47,180
[screaming]

70
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,130
Sailor Moon?

71
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,180
Sailor Moon!

72
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,070
Luna?

73
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,040
Huh?

74
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,020
Oh Artemis! We did it!

75
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,150
Luna, just now, beside the
tower, you looked almost
divine.

76
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,040
I could see you praying
with Princess Serenity.

77
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,150
It was like you had become
Selene, the moon goddess
herself.

78
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,140
[gasp]

79
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,070
Look Artemis!
Over there!

80
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,100
Huh?

81
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,050
[gasp]

82
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,130
The Moon Castle... and
Silver Millennium, our
beloved kingdom!

83
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,210
When Usagi used the power of
the Legendary Silver Crystal,

84
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:46,070
it returned everything
to its former glory!

85
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,150
The moonlight is soft
again. Just like it
always was.

86
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,070
She saved the
Earth. She did it.

87
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,140
Sailor Moon?

88
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,220
Her body is cold.
Did using all her
power like that-?

89
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,180
Wake up. Come
back to me. Usako!

90
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,060
It's you Endymion.

91
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,090
Serenity.

92
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,120
We're together.
At last...

93
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,160
I can see them.

94
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,120
The prince woke the princess
with a kiss. True love does
conquer all!

95
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,130
I'm so happy. I
missed you Mamo!

96
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,200
Usako, I've wanted to
hold you for so long.

97
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,170
We are soul mates. We were
born for one another, meant
to be.

98
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,060
I love you Mamo,
so very much!

99
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,170
And I won't ever
let you go again.

100
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,100
Way to go Usagi!

101
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,150
Congratulations!

102
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,130
We wish you the best!

103
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,150
Be happy!

104
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,100
[gasp]

105
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,210
My friends...
Where are they?!

106
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,090
Don't worry.

107
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,190
I'll find them for you.

108
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,230
But how?

109
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,110
[gasp]

110
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,120
A vision! Just by holding
Mamo's hand like this I

111
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:50,070
can see images from
all over the world.

112
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,100
Endymion... Is
this your power?

113
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,070
It feels like... the
Earth's energy is
flowing through you.

114
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,130
[gasp]

115
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,140
My friends!

116
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,080
Oh no!

117
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,010
Usagi...

118
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,112
[gasp]

119
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,200
Usagi... Can
you hear me?

120
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,020
Luna? Is that you?

121
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,210
Where are you, Luna?

122
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,521
The moon.

123
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:27,000
Huh?

124
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,110
If you come here,
you can save the
others.

125
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,200
I can't. My brooch
is broken, Luna.

126
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,140
I lost the ability to
transform. In fact,
I lost all my powers.

127
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,010
There's still a
way for you to get
here.

128
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,010
Huh?

129
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,060
You have the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

130
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,210
It's fused with the
Moon Stick. Use that.

131
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,090
Silver Crystal, please
take us to the Moon.

132
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,190
It's the Moon Castle.

133
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,230
That's right, Usagi.
Silver Millennium has
been restored.

134
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,000
Luna! Artemis!

135
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh Usagi! I'm so
proud of you!

136
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
It's beautiful.

137
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,010
You are the master of
the Moon Castle now,
Usagi.

138
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:14,180
From here you will reign
over all of Silver Millennium
as the new Queen Serenity!

139
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,150
Luna, I can't stay and be
queen. I have to go home.

140
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,140
My family and friends
are waiting for me.

141
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,190
Usagi?

142
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,020
Even though I remember
now that I'm Serenity,
I'm also Usagi Tsukino.

143
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,040
My home is on Earth with
Mamo. I belong there with
those I love.

144
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,230
What're you saying?

145
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,140
It sounds like you've
made your decision, my
Serenity.

146
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,030
Queen Serenity...

147
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,030
Yes. I've decided. I want
to go back, to my life
on Earth.

148
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,150
You see, I figured out
the real reason I was
reincarnated.

149
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,120
I was meant to live my life
with those I care about:
Mamo, my family, my friends.

150
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,150
Especially the ones I came
to save, they gave their
lives for me!

151
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,120
What I want, is to be an
ordinary girl to live and

152
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,170
laugh and cry, with
the boy I love...

153
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,030
On the planet I've always
cherished, on Earth.

154
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,210
I have only one wish
for you, Serenity...

155
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,050
Be happy. Live with
the ones you love.

156
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,160
[gasp]

157
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,180
What's this?

158
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,010
It's a new brooch,
but it's different.

159
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,130
Place the Legendary Silver
Crystal inside and shout
these words:

160
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,190
"Moon Crystal Power
Make Up!"

161
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,140
That's your new
transformation phrase. Go on.

162
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,200
Try it! You will be
stronger and more
powerful than ever!

163
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,210
Thank you, Mother.

164
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,150
I will transform into
Sailor Moon again...

165
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,140
And go save my
friends!

166
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:15,070
Moon Crystal Power
Make Up!

167
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,060
I am the Pretty Guardian!

168
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,040
Who fights for love,
and for justice!

169
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,150
I am Sailor Moon!

170
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,030
Ami! Rei! Mako!
Minako!

171
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,060
And every living
being on Earth!

172
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,150
Moon Healing Escalation!

173
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,100
Huh?

174
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,170
[groaning]

175
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,050
When did it
get so late?

176
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,160
This is weird. What
the heck happened here?

177
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,230
How are we alive?

178
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,010
Hey! Everyone!

179
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,040
[gasps]
Usagi!

180
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:48,090
[crying]

181
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,210
I thought I would never
see you girls again! I
love you all so much!

182
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,090
Usagi!

183
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,090
Everyone's alive
and back to normal.

184
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,090
But does this mean they
can never transform into
Sailor Guardians again?

185
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,230
Come here Artemis!

186
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,210
Silly artemis. You should
know by now that we'd never
die that easily.

187
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,080
Yeah... we're
tougher than
that.

188
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,200
After all, we still
have a job to do.

189
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,120
We're sworn to protect
our princess. Now,
and forever...

190
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,050
It's not just a new
day, it's a new world.

191
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,220
Come on. Let's
go home.

192
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,020
Back to where
we belong.

193
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,190
Bye Artemis!

194
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,120
I'm off to school!
See you later!

195
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,010
Mornin' Ami!

196
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,070
Oh! Good Morning,
Mako!

197
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,030
Usagi! Time to wake
up or you'll be late!

198
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,100
[giggling]

199
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,210
Surprise! I'm
already awake,
Mom!

200
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,010
Oh my!

201
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,010
Usagi's ready for
school on time? That's
a first.

202
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,050
I guess pigs must
be flying now.

203
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,230
Shingo!

204
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,140
Don't tease your sister!
It's good that she's being
more responsible.

205
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,110
Come have some
breakfast, dear.

206
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,000
Agh! I forgot about
my homework!

207
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,040
Ugh...

208
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,200
I'm supposed to
turn it in today!

209
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,120
Oh! Good Morning,
Usagi!

210
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,050
Morning, Naru!

211
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,100
[gasp]

212
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,020
What was that?
A bad omen?

213
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,020
Please, let me be wrong.

214
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,150
Things are finally peaceful.

215
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,070
Can't they just stay
that way for a while?

216
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,050
[giggle]

217
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,050
You're late, Usako. You
had to stay for detention
again didn't you?

218
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,160
Detention? Me?

219
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,100
Nah, I stopped to
pick this up.

220
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,130
Remember your broken
pocket watch?

221
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,140
I took it to the jewelers
and had it fixed for you!

222
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,090
Listen!

223
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,060
See? You hear that?
It's ticking again?

224
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,020
Huh?

225
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,130
[screaming]

226
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,010
[groaning]

227
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,070
[screaming]

228
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,080
My neck! What the
hell was that! Oww!

229
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,150
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?! Get away
from my Mamo right now!

230
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,160
Mamo?

231
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,030
Uh? A little kid.
Who're you?

232
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,060
My name is Usagi!

233
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,170
You're... Usagi?

234
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,110
Yeah! Who the heck are
you? And how come you're
wearing buns like that?

235
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,010
Are you copying me?

236
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,140
What are you talking
about? I'm the Usagi
here! Usagi Tsukino!

237
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,080
[gasp]

238
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,160
You're... Usagi Tsukino?

239
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah...

240
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,010
If you are who you say you
are, then you should have
the Legendary Silver Crystal!

241
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,000
[gasps]

242
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,080
Hurry up and hand it
over! Now! Or I'll shoot!

243
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,200
Hey Chibi Usagi! Tell us
who you really are! Oh!

244
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,170
So now you've got nothing
to say?! Well that's not

245
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,090
gonna fly!
Out with it!

246
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,060
We're not gonna let you
off easy just cause you're
a kid! Right, Rei?

247
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,040
I'm not sure, but I think
we may have an intruder
among us.

248
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,010
Huh?

249
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,090
I have a bad feeling
about this.

250
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,160
Rei, what's wrong?
What is it?

251
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,130
Act. 15 Infiltration
Sailor Mars

252
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,180
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
