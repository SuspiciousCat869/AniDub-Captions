1
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,866
It's Pluto!

2
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,166
Am I dreaming?

3
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,200
Is it really you?

4
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,833
Yes, Small Lady, or rather,
Sailor Chibi Moon, it is I.

5
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,800
I have been reborn
into this world.

6
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,133
Through the
power of you mother,

7
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,000
the great Neo
Queen Serenity,

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,666
I live once more.

9
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,700
And I have a new
mission to fulfill.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,600
Sailor Moon?

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,766
Somehow Pluto seems
different than she was before.

12
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:12,133
She looks stronger
than I remember.

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,233
Like she's part of
something greater, now.

14
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:22,733
Princess Serenity, who, one day,
shall become our new queen.

15
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,566
We are honored to meet you.

16
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,566
Protected by Uranus,
Planet of the Wind.

17
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,100
I am the Guardian
of the Heavens,

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,966
and the Outer Planets.

19
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,800
I am Sailor Uranus.

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,666
And I am
protected by Neptune,

21
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:41,200
Outer Planet of the Seas,
Guardian of the Deep Sea.

22
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,966
I am Sailor Neptune.

23
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:47,866
And I am protected by Pluto,
Outer Planet of the Underworld.

24
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,733
I am Sailor Pluto.

25
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,100
The three Sailor
Guardians of the

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,066
Outer Planets, have arrived.

27
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,766
My Princess...

28
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,766
Our actions have been
disrespectful and we are

29
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,733
prepared to atone for
them in any way you see fit.

30
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,033
But please, know this: we
only did what we did to

31
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,433
protect you, and this planet.

32
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,133
Forgive us.

33
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,100
Back in ancient times,
our task as Guardians,

34
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,166
was to watch over
Silver Millennium from afar,

35
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,466
and to protect it against
threats and invaders from

36
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,200
the far reaches of space.

37
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,200
That was then.

38
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,000
And now, you
have been reborn,

39
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,000
dear Princess, and so
has our Silver Millennium.

40
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:22,833
Like all the
Sailor Guardians,

41
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,000
we too were
promised rebirth.

42
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:28,200
And, thus, we have awakened
anew on this planet to

43
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,866
fulfill our duties once more.

44
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,966
However, it seems
we were too late.

45
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,333
By the time we fully
awoke and sensed the threat,

46
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:38,800
the invasion had
already happened.

47
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,033
Our enemies were
already among us.

48
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:44,433
With nothing to stop them,
they quietly established

49
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,966
themselves deep
within that stronghold.

50
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,366
We take full responsibility.

51
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:52,166
They snuck in right under
our noses and we didn't see.

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,333
So the Death Busters...

53
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,966
What exactly are they?

54
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,333
They're aliens.

55
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:58,866
From the Tau System.

56
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,033
They came from a
far‐off dimension to

57
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,366
take over this world.

58
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,933
The Tau System?

59
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,900
We still don't
know much about them.

60
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,400
But the Mugenzu area is
surrounded by an enormous

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,100
aura, a powerful one, and
we believe that's what drew

62
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
them to this world.

63
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,066
The space‐time in
the area is distorted.

64
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,766
Whether by
accident or design,

65
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:20,766
I cannot say.

66
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,400
However, it seems to be
their point of entry.

67
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:26,233
If we do not mend this tear
in the fabric of space‐time

68
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:29,566
quickly, the invasion
will only get worse.

69
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,933
We were posing as
Mugen Academy students,

70
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,933
to try and keep
an eye on things.

71
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,933
Unfortunately, we can no
longer keep up that faade.

72
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,166
We're sorry you ended
up in the middle of it.

73
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,166
We never meant
for that to happen.

74
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,233
That's all right, I‐

75
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,400
These Death Busters
are our enemies.

76
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,333
We'll deal with them.

77
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,766
By ourselves.

78
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:48,933
Let us help.

79
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:49,933
We can fight with you!

80
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,366
Stay out of it!

81
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,833
This is our job.

82
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,000
We'll handle it.

83
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,566
Princess, for the rest of
this mission to go smoothly,

84
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,566
I'm afraid we can't afford
to waste any more time.

85
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,400
I agree.

86
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,133
That's why we're
all saying that you

87
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,133
should let us help you!

88
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,466
Do you really wanna be
in danger that bad?!

89
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,100
Once the Death Busters
realize we've left the

90
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,966
academy, they may
try to come after us!

91
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:16,300
The three of us each live in
one of the condo towers that

92
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,966
surround Mugenzu.

93
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,100
We keep it under
constant surveillance.

94
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,300
We won't fail.

95
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,466
Please don't look
so sad Princess...

96
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,000
Honestly, I didn't
mean to confuse you.

97
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,233
Uranus is not one
gender or the other,

98
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,333
she is both.

99
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,466
As a Sailor Guardian, she
possesses the strength of

100
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,133
both a man and a woman.

101
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,066
[gasp]

102
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,933
We three aren't like you.

103
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,433
We all have special
abilities that the

104
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,000
rest of you don't.

105
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,500
Our powers are greater,
and our items are stronger.

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,166
We're better equipped to
deal with these threats.

107
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,000
So just leave it to us.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
These "items"...

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,300
The ones that you
claim are stronger,

110
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,500
are they the three Talismans
that will bring destruction?

111
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:07,666
[gasp]

112
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:09,533
The Oracles have
warned us repeatedly.

113
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,466
They don't want us to
collect the Talismans.

114
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,300
So what are you hiding?

115
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,900
Are they just weapons?

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,566
Tell us your true mission.

117
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,233
Why are you really here?

118
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,066
These Talismans are
more than just weapons.

119
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,133
They are the keys to
fulfilling our ultimate mission.

120
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,066
Which is to put an end to
our greatest enemy:

121
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,066
the God of Destruction.

122
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,333
[gasp]

123
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,066
The God of Destruction?

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,466
[yell]

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,633
Stupid Mom!

126
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,200
Why didn't you wake me up?!

127
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Now, I'm gonna be
late for school!

128
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,766
Now our next story...

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,666
<i>Parents and legal guardians</i>
<i>of children who attend Mugen</i>

130
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:47,500
Academy, have been voicing
concerns about the number of

131
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
students who've
gone missing.

132
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,233
In response, the school
is now closed and

133
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,900
its grounds sealed off.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,900
Oh?

135
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,133
Is that mad scientist
causing trouble again?

136
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,400
What has he done this time?

137
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,300
It's Hotaru's dad!

138
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Hey Dad, do you know
about that guy from work?

139
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:07,266
Yeah, he used to be a
world‐renowned scientist in

140
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,300
the field of
genetic engineering.

141
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,133
But that was
quite a while ago.

142
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,600
We found info on Tomoe's past.

143
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,266
His life's work was
developing super life‐forms.

144
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,600
"His unethical experiments,
including gene manipulation,

145
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:25,433
got him expelled from
the academic community."

146
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,733
"He sold his data ' to
several foreign companies.

147
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,200
"And using those funds, he
purchased what is now the

148
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,133
Mugen District."

149
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,966
"Two years later, a major
fire occurred during one of

150
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,566
the construction projects."

151
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,533
Hotaru!

152
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,266
"Soon following, he
founded Mugen Academy

153
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,700
and became its headmaster.

154
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,600
He has not made any
public appearances since."

155
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,300
Chibi‐Usa...

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,133
I need you to do something.

157
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,433
I want you to keep an
eye on Tomoe's daughter.

158
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,366
[gasp]

159
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,533
I don't believe
Hotaru is a Death Buster.

160
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,133
But, her home seems to
be right in the center

161
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,266
of Death Buster activity.

162
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,666
We need to search that
area if we wanna learn

163
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:02,533
more and stop them.

164
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:05,433
Hotaru may be okay, but I'm
suspicious of her father.

165
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,333
[gasp]

166
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
Chibi‐Usa, listen...

167
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,766
I know this won't be an
easy mission for you.

168
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,533
You up for it?

169
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:21,366
I am.

170
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,633
As a Guardian,
I'll do my best.

171
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,666
[snarling]

172
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,533
Did you hear me?

173
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,500
Sorry.

174
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,766
I got distracted.

175
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,333
Can you please repeat that?

176
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:42,033
There should be only one
thing on your mind right

177
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:45,300
now, and that's eliminating
the Sailor Guardians for

178
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,300
our Master. Pity.

179
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,166
The Master was quite
clear and you keep

180
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:51,633
disappointing him.

181
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,633
Perhaps they're too
much for you and those

182
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,366
witches of yours to handle.

183
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,633
[chuckling]

184
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,466
[grumble]

185
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,433
Our life‐source,
the Taioron Crystal,

186
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,433
continues to waste away!

187
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:06,433
[gasp]

188
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:09,133
We must hurry and
obtain the light similar

189
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,800
to that of our crystal!

190
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,433
Time is running out!

191
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:15,333
Get me the power of
those Guardian Planets!

192
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:16,833
I want it, now!

193
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:20,500
I have finally found
safe haven on this world...

194
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,166
I will not give
it up to anyone.

195
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,333
More and more lights
are gathering

196
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,533
throughout the area.

197
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:39,533
One, two, three new lights
of Guardian Planets...

198
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,833
How ominous!

199
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,533
<i>These new lights are</i>
<i>the strongest I've seen, yet!</i>

200
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,800
[gasp] What was that?

201
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,266
The Sailor Guardians'
are so powerful.

202
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,533
The lights they produce
are constantly disturbing

203
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,033
my water mirror.

204
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,400
Perhaps it is they and their
lights who have caught us,

205
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,766
and we are the ones
unable to escape.

206
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,400
Yes, Magus Kaolinite?

207
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,266
How may I serve you?

208
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,233
Cyprine.

209
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,433
The failures of your
fellow witches have

210
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,200
brought shame upon me.

211
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,700
My wish is for you to
make up for that disgrace.

212
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,766
As the last member
of the Witches 5,

213
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,500
rest assured, I, Cyprine,
shall eliminate

214
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,266
the Sailor Guardians.

215
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,766
I will gather
their fine Hosts.

216
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:33,833
And, I will also succeed in
obtaining the power similar

217
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,433
to that of the
Taioron Crystal.

218
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,200
Trust me, Magus Kaolinite.

219
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,233
Master Pharaoh 90
will be pleased.

220
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,566
I leave it to you.

221
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,733
But before you
get on with that,

222
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:45,566
there are two students
who rewrote the academy's

223
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,333
computer data
and disappeared.

224
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,766
They are dangerous.

225
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:52,166
They might have
made perfect vessels,

226
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:54,233
but now we've seen
their treachery.

227
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,766
Find and get rid of them!

228
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:58,600
As you wish.

229
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:05,725
Mommy Ikuko!

230
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,159
I'm going to go see a movie
with my friend tomorrow,

231
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,525
so I'll be home late.

232
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,825
Oh yeah?

233
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,292
Who are you going with?

234
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:13,292
Hotaru.

235
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:14,492
Huh?

236
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,659
<i>Chibi‐Usa, would you like</i>
<i>to go to the movies with me?</i>

237
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:21,825
Or, we could do
something else if you want?

238
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:23,525
I just wanna see you.

239
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,192
Let's go somewhere fun.

240
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:29,359
I don't know why Hotaru
asked me to hang out.

241
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,559
Maybe...

242
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,525
There's something she
wants to talk about.

243
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,325
I'll try to get her to
open up about her father.

244
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:36,792
Hopefully, she will.

245
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,159
Hey, Chibi‐Usa!

246
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,325
This is pretty neat.
What is it?

247
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:44,559
You like it, Daddy Kenji?

248
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,459
Usagi and Mamo
helped me make it.

249
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,459
It's the
Legendary Holy Grail!

250
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,659
Wow, really?

251
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,559
Uh, huh.

252
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:51,892
Do you know what that is?

253
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:53,325
Look at her.

254
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,192
She's becoming a
fine Guardian.

255
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:56,492
Isn't she, Mother?

256
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,825
I think she is.

257
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,459
Hotaru's running late.

258
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,225
Where is she?

259
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,225
We were supposed to
meet up an hour ago.

260
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:23,892
Here's my phone number.

261
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,525
She's not answering...

262
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,525
Maybe she's not in her room?

263
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:31,659
Oh no...

264
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:34,525
<i>What if she's having</i>
<i>another one of her attacks?</i>

265
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,792
Hotaru!

266
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:45,725
The sky is so
full of dark clouds.

267
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,692
How do you like
your new parts?

268
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:52,359
Do they feel alright?

269
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:53,759
They're fine, Daddy.

270
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:55,692
I'm getting used to them.

271
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:58,859
I just developed the
cells and neurons in those.

272
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:01,592
So, now you're equipped
with the latest technology,

273
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:04,625
which should put an end
to those rejection pains.

274
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,792
I wonder if Chibi‐Usa gave
up and went home already?

275
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,992
[gasp]

276
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,825
Chibi‐Usa?!

277
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:24,525
I was worried.

278
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,592
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,292
I didn't mean to
barge in on you.

280
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:44,425
Hotaru!

281
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,292
Mommy!

282
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:47,792
It's so hot!

283
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:54,759
Daddy?

284
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:56,292
Good morning.

285
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:57,459
You're awake.

286
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,492
How are you feeling?

287
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,859
Any discomfort?

288
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:10,359
What is this?

289
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,525
I didn't want
anyone to know...

290
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,059
My body is so
cold and bloodless.

291
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,592
I wanted to
keep it a secret.

292
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:23,525
That's why I
kept it to myself.

293
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,492
I thought I'd
give it to you,

294
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,559
Hotaru, as a token
of our friendship.

295
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:29,692
[gasp]

296
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:31,659
Chibi‐Usa...

297
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:35,025
<i>Just when I thought I</i>
<i>finally made a friend...</i>

298
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:39,992
If this is what I
am, what my body is,

299
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:41,859
what's the point of living?

300
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,025
Does my life still
have any meaning?

301
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,659
My forehead... hurts!

302
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:55,925
Who are you people?

303
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,359
Do I know you?

304
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,125
Why are you
looking at me like that,

305
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:03,625
with pity in your eyes?

306
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,125
It hurts.

307
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:14,925
It feels like...

308
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,159
There's something inside of me.

309
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,925
And whatever it is,
it's trying to break out.

310
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,592
What should I do?

311
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,759
I get the feeling she
didn't want me to see that.

312
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,925
When I was little, I
was badly injured.

313
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,425
And I still have
a lot of scars.

314
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:41,992
I was just so surprised.

315
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,092
I had to run away...

316
00:16:44,892 --> 00:16:46,159
What do I do?

317
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,592
I didn't mean to hurt her.

318
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:52,825
Hail?

319
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:01,559
My body is going numb.

320
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:03,125
This hail isn't normal!

321
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,792
[gasp]

322
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,192
What's going on?

323
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,625
Usagi!

324
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:11,859
Chibi‐Usa!

325
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,559
[groans]

326
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:26,059
It stopped?

327
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,492
[gasp]

328
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:29,792
You thought you could
escape Mugen Academy,

329
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:31,059
Haruka Tenoh.

330
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,659
But I found you!

331
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:34,892
[attack yell]

332
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:37,992
Haruka!

333
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,659
I was expecting
you, Death Buster!

334
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,792
How did you manage
to dodge my attack?

335
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:45,992
What are you?

336
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:50,859
Uranus Planet
Power Make Up!

337
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:09,592
Protected by Uranus, the
Outer Planet of the Wind.

338
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:11,692
Guardian of the Heavens.

339
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,725
I am Sailor Uranus!

340
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:16,925
Uranus!

341
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:17,859
Neptune!

342
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,192
Pluto!

343
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,259
Well this is
certainly a surprise.

344
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,792
I didn't realize you
were Sailor Guardians.

345
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:25,625
But this is perfect!

346
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:28,025
Now I can kill three
birds with one stone!

347
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,225
This is bad!

348
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:33,792
The city's in chaos!

349
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:35,692
That strange hail has
to be the cause of it!

350
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,025
Look over there!

351
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,259
Uranus and the others
are fighting on

352
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,225
a rooftop in Mugenzu!

353
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:45,592
They're on their own.

354
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,959
They don't need our help.

355
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,259
C'mon everybody!
Let's go!

356
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:50,125
Usagi...

357
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:52,792
We have to help this
city, and that includes

358
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:54,059
the three of them!

359
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:56,225
I am Cyprine, Level 999.

360
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:58,192
No one escapes my magic!

361
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:00,992
I am the strongest Mugen
Academy Witch Training

362
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:02,292
Class professional!

363
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:04,359
Ribbon Buster!

364
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:09,825
Uranus! Neptune!

365
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:16,159
Ribbon Buster!

366
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:20,792
Mars Snake Fire!

367
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:28,992
What are you doing?

368
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,125
Why are you here?

369
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:31,425
Beat it!

370
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,825
Oh no you don't!

371
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:35,959
[gasp]

372
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,625
So...

373
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:52,259
It would seem you
girls are eager to die.

374
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,192
If you have a death
wish, we're happy to oblige.

375
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,092
We'll gladly kill you all.

376
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,925
I'd like to see you try!

377
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:04,925
What's going on?!

378
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:05,859
Stop this!

379
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:08,625
Come back!

380
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,292
Mercury Aqua Mist!

381
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:25,659
Burning Mandala!

382
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,292
Venus Love Me Chain!

383
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,825
Please Uranus!

384
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,125
Neptune!

385
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:38,159
Pluto!

386
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,659
Stop it!
Stop it now!

387
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:44,125
My magic amplifies the
dark desires deep within a

388
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:46,625
person's heart and
brings them to the surface.

389
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:50,325
So let your feelings out,
and destroy each other!

390
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:51,759
[laughing]

391
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:55,792
Neo Queen Serenity!

392
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:57,859
Lend me your strength!

393
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:01,359
Lend your power to
my Heart Moon Rod!

394
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:12,192
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

395
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:24,425
I am Cyprine.

396
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,225
And I am Ptilol.

397
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:28,492
And together, we
are one witch.

398
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:29,992
She split in two?!

399
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:33,059
So Cyprine, where's the
power similar to that

400
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,725
of the Taioron Crystal?

401
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:35,892
Was that it?

402
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:37,859
C'mon guys, snap out of it!

403
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,259
Stop this fighting!

404
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:47,059
Pink Sugar Heart Attack!

405
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,759
Stay out of the way, brat!

406
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:55,825
Tuxedo Mask!

407
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:57,192
Chibi Moon!

408
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:01,125
[giggling]

409
00:22:02,092 --> 00:22:04,225
Why are we
fighting like this?

410
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,492
Why are we
against each other?

411
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,559
Deep down, do we really
think of ourselves as enemies?

412
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:11,559
No!

413
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,225
<i>At one time or</i>
<i>another they've saved us!</i>

414
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:16,892
Those three have
always watched over us!

415
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:19,559
They want to protect
what is precious to them,

416
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,392
just like we do!

417
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:24,092
We all fight for
the same reason!

418
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,759
We must unite our
hearts as one...

419
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:44,159
[gasp]

420
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:52,092
Please, everyone...

421
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:53,459
Lend me your power!

422
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,089
Uniting our hearts to fight
as one is what makes us

423
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:34,589
Sailor Guardians!

424
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:40,803
<i>Next time, "Act.33 Infinity</i>
<i>7 Transformation ‐ Super</i>
<i>Sailor Moon ‐."</i>

425
00:24:40,903 --> 00:24:43,137
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
