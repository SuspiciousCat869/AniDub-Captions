1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,100
Hmph.

2
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,010
The prince already
has the other two.

3
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,150
This is just needlessly cruel.

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,130
[gasp]

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,070
Jupiter!

6
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,150
That's impossible!
What happened?

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,000
I had a lock on her
and she vanished!

8
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,120
[gasp]

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,120
What's going on?
Where's Jupiter?

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,020
They took her!

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,080
[crying]

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,040
We couldn't stop them.

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,050
Luna! Look at that!

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,100
What is that?

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,120
Is that the best you can do?

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,180
I've seen that type
of crystal before.

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,160
The Black Moon had
stones like that.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,060
I want a sample.
Artemis do you copy?

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,030
Get that thing in a
containment module.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,467
On it!

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,030
Take it. Perform
your analysis.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,090
Hopefully you'll
be able to gain

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,060
something useful
from it...

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,030
...to make up
for my failure.

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,080
[crying]

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,170
I'm so sorry, Usagi. I
should've saved her.

27
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
I've been investigating
these so-called UFOs that

28
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,120
the Black Moon used
to abduct Mars,

29
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,030
Mercury and Jupiter. They're
actually worm-hole like

30
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,190
portals through space.

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,080
But I haven't been able to
identify their point of

32
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,120
origin, or the place
and time the next one

33
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,170
might appear.

34
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,220
If the Black Moon came from
space through these portals,

35
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,030
does that mean
they're aliens?

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,120
Not necessarily, but that's
the most logical assumption.

37
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,200
There must be
some reason that

38
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,110
they're targeting
the Earth.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,230
Are they trying to kill us
because we're in their way?

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,060
They don't know who
they're messing with!

41
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,190
Kill us? Does that
mean the others are?

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,090
No Usako...

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,230
Jupiter, Mercury, and
Mars. They're all

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
alive, I'm sure of it.

45
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,110
I can't take it anymore!

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
It's like they're
toying with us!

47
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,200
I've had it!
Enough is enough!

48
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,200
We have to confront
Chibi-Usa about the Black

49
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Moon. And make her tell
us everything she knows.

50
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,220
Let's settle it, once and
for all, whether she's our

51
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,180
enemy or our friend.

52
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,000
How are you feeling? Are you
sure you're up to this?

53
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,220
Yeah. I'll be okay.

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,150
Welcome home!

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,110
[giggling]

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Oh! Minako, and Mamoru!

57
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,220
[chuckle] Sorry
about all the noise.

58
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,050
Chibi-Usa brought a little
friend home with her after

59
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,160
school for a play date!

60
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,100
Come meet her, Mamo!

61
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,200
Don't call him that!

62
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,140
She's in the same class as
me! And her name is Momo!

63
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,120
And her family
owns that really

64
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,070
good Chinese restaurant
in the shopping district!

65
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,130
Going to school has been
good for her. It's like

66
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,170
she's just a regular,
happy little girl.

67
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,120
Look at that face... She
just couldn't be an enemy.

68
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,120
Hi Momo! Nice
to meet you!

69
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,200
So what were you guys
doing? Can I play too?

70
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,180
Sure!

71
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,190
[happy giggling]

72
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,000
[gasp]

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,180
[screaming]

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,060
Huh?

75
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,140
What's wrong?
What is it?

76
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,210
It's okay! I'm right here!

77
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,080
No!

78
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,150
It's just Mamoru, Chibi-Usa.

79
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,140
No! Keep it away!
Keep it away! [crying]

80
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,220
What is it about this
Black Crystal earring?

81
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,000
It's like she's
scared for her life!

82
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,220
We should just
kill those Sailor

83
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,150
Guardians and be
done with it.

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,080
And you, Rubeus. Three of
your subordinates have met

85
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,070
their demise. How can
you be so laid-back?

86
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,100
Casualties are inevitable. I
just follow my orders.

87
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,140
Ugh... All of you are out of
your minds if you ask me.

88
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,190
Esmeraude!

89
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,130
Did I say that out loud?

90
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,090
Saphir, don't get yourself
all bent out of shape over a

91
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,110
few minor setbacks.

92
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,220
With any plan of
attack, there are

93
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,150
bound to be some losses.

94
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,080
We have the Planet Nemesis
and its supply of

95
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,180
Malefic Black Crystal.
So what if we lose a

96
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,020
few battles. We'll
still win the war.

97
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,160
Is there still a
war to be won?

98
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,170
Brother, the world already
knows the fearsome power of

99
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,090
the Malefic Black Crystal.

100
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,190
You used it to unleash
an apocalypse!

101
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,160
Everything you wanted
is already yours.

102
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,160
The planet is dead.

103
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,140
Why are we continuing
to spend time on this?

104
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,120
Not everything.

105
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
This isn't over.

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,120
We have yet to make our
grand ambitions clear.

107
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,020
The planet may
be dead but

108
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,170
it's still not fully
within my grasp.

109
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,010
Not until the queen's corpse
is stretched out before me.

110
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,110
Wiseman.

111
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,120
As long as the Legendary
Silver Crystal exists, our

112
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,100
Malefic Black Crystal will
never be invincible.

113
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,000
However, at this very
moment, I sense that

114
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,170
detestable stone is in the
hands of the Rabbit.

115
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,150
Seize the opportunity to
capture them both!

116
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,230
Make the true power of the
Black Moon known to all!

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Get the Legendary
Silver Crystal

118
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,220
and use the Malefic Black
Crystal to destroy it!

119
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,020
Without delay.

120
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,100
I think I'll retire
for the evening.

121
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,040
Wiseman again. Why does
he trust that creepy

122
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,200
fortune-teller?

123
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,170
We don't know anything
about that old man.

124
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,210
He just appeared one
day out of nowhere.

125
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,000
And yet he's managed to
completely manipulate the

126
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,130
Prince, with his slick
tongue and cheap tricks.

127
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,200
Wiseman did grant Prince
Dimande the power of

128
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,090
"Evil Sight." Not
exactly a cheap trick.

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,110
It's no wonder our Prince
hangs on his every word.

130
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,200
The Prince didn't care about
the Legendary Silver Crystal

131
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,180
until Wiseman brought it up.

132
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,000
It's like he can't think
for himself anymore.

133
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,190
One day I'm going to
rip the cloak off that

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,000
old man's back and find
out what's underneath.

135
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,000
Sisters, I will avenge you
so you can rest in peace.

136
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,020
Master Rubeus...

137
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,170
Channeling the
dead, are we?

138
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,050
Please don't let
me interrupt.

139
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,200
I regret what happened to
your sisters, Calaveras.

140
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,040
But they did manage to split
up the Sailor Guardians.

141
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,180
And without a complete unit,
those girls are powerless.

142
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,140
Like it or not, Planet Earth
belongs to the Black Moon.

143
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,120
They should accept
it and fall in line.

144
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,130
Please let me go to Earth.

145
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,200
They were my sisters.
This is my fight.

146
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,130
I will use the power of my
slain sisters to punish

147
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,010
those who destroyed them.

148
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,230
Code "Zero-Zero-Four".
Operation Re-birth.

149
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,030
[crying]

150
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,180
Please, Chibi-Usa, we
need you to talk to us.

151
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,010
Tell us what's wrong.

152
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,160
Why are you scared of this
Black Crystal earring?

153
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,220
Is it the stone?

154
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,140
Because of that
stone... My mommy...

155
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,170
Yes. What about your mom?
Did something happen to her?

156
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,230
No more stalling Chibi-Usa.
Tell us everything you know!

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,060
The Black Moon, we
need information!

158
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,200
I don't know
anything! I swear!

159
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,220
What happened
wasn't my fault!

160
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,200
That's enough for
today. Leave her be.

161
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,160
Okay. We'll stop. But I just
need to know one thing.

162
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,010
Chibi-Usa, can you prove
you're not our enemy?

163
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,070
I'm not! I swear! It's not
anything like that--

164
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,130
How can I believe you when
you won't cooperate?!

165
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,120
I can't take your
word. If you want

166
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,070
my trust, you'll
have to earn it!

167
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,130
[gasp]

168
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,120
I took it for granted they
would always be here with

169
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,160
me. Rei, Ami, Mako...

170
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,200
But now they're gone.

171
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,150
Usagi!

172
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,180
Why don't we have
lunch together today?

173
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,020
[giggling]

174
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,210
It's true! The
stores were all sold

175
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,220
out but I was still
able to get it.

176
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,130
Get what? What are
you talking about?

177
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,220
Just the hardest DVD
to find in town.

178
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,050
Is it a movie?

179
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,080
It's a program about
psychic channeling.

180
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,090
Hunh,what's that?

181
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,190
I'm surprised you haven't
heard of it before.

182
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,150
It's the biggest
craze right now.

183
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,190
Since you don't know,
I'll fill you in.

184
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Channeling is when
a medium goes

185
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,130
into a trance and
ghosts or beings

186
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,010
from other dimensions
inhabit their

187
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,030
body and talk to
us through them.

188
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,180
Other dimensions? I have a
bad feeling about this...

189
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,060
The world-famous medium,
Miss Calaveras, has now

190
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,140
entered her trance.
So let us begin

191
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,180
the interview. To
whom am I speaking?

192
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,020
My name is Crimson
Rubeus of the Black Moon.

193
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,200
The Black Moon!?

194
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,070
I come from a race of beings
that are not unlike humans.

195
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,020
Though our home
is far away, some

196
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,220
of us have come to earth.

197
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,050
But do not fear us. We
are not your enemies.

198
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,060
We come in peace and
wish only to help

199
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,080
guide you to
your true path.

200
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,210
She's lying!

201
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,180
Huh?

202
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,060
Usagi? Is
something wrong?

203
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
Wait a minute!

204
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,140
Where are you going?

205
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,180
Usagi...

206
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,180
I've suspected for a
while that you've

207
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,070
been leading a double
life. I know there are

208
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,220
things you have
to keep hidden

209
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,070
and a side of you I
can't be a part of.

210
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,070
But still, you're my
friend and. I wish

211
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,090
there was something I
could do to help.

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,150
Miss Calaveras, do you
believe these beings of the

213
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,080
Black Moon truly
mean us no harm?

214
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,190
I do. I channel those beings
often. I sense their

215
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,030
feelings towards us
are benevolent.

216
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,030
The beings from the White
Moon are the ones who have

217
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,210
sinister intentions.

218
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,070
White Moon?

219
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,190
Is she implying
that that's us?

220
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,180
"Guide the people of Earth
to their true path"?

221
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,000
These aliens, they're
beginning to sound

222
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,060
less like invaders
and more like a cult.

223
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,080
I understand you have plans
for a public sÃ©ance in Tokyo.

224
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,200
That's right. This
weekend in the park.

225
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,110
I invite skeptics and
believers alike to attend,

226
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,180
and learn the truth.

227
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,100
They've declared war
on us and now they

228
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,040
want people to
choose sides?

229
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,060
Minako, it's a trap.

230
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,020
Don't worry. They won't
catch me. I am Sailor Venus!

231
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,080
If the Black Moon
wants a fight,

232
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,230
then I'll give 'em one.

233
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,180
You're right. It appears we
really do have intruders

234
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,190
among us and they snuck in
without anyone noticing.

235
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,130
Miss Hino... where are you?

236
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,100
You're right. We're not
like other people. We have

237
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,120
special abilities and a
destiny as guardians.

238
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,170
Makoto... I haven't seen
her since that night.

239
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,180
Master.

240
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,230
Hello Kunzite,
Jadeite, Nephrite

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,220
and Zoisite, as well.

242
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,200
We've had a dire
premonition.

243
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,080
We sense something ominous
behind your enemy's grand

244
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
scheme. Their plan
is larger, more

245
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,160
nefarious than we
initially believed.

246
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,220
A strange distortion
of time and space

247
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,170
is emanating
from that stone.

248
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,050
Wait... Are you telling me
that they're time-travelers?

249
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,130
We're not certain.

250
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,180
Whatever they are,
they're very dangerous.

251
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,060
Master, as your loyal
knights, we are still here

252
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,160
to advise and support
you, but we cannot be

253
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,060
with you, so
use your power.

254
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,230
Protect the Princess.

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,070
I see visions through touch.
How's that going to help?

256
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,230
It's no good in a fight.

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,150
Sometimes I wonder why I
was even reborn at all.

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
Usako is in danger,
and I am still

259
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,160
powerless to
protect her.

260
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,140
Master, do not doubt
yourself. You are powerful.

261
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,180
This is your destiny.

262
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,080
You were not reincarnated
by accident!

263
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,070
Events have been set in
motion. The day draws near

264
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,010
when the Princess
will become Queen

265
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,190
and you the King.

266
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,140
[gasp]

267
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,230
My brooch! It's gone!

268
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,180
The Earth is entering a new
era. This is the dawning of

269
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,190
the Age of Aquarius,
the Water Bearer.

270
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,140
Peace will guide the
planets, love will steer the

271
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,180
stars, and the mystic
crystal revelation will

272
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,080
free the minds of man.

273
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,190
Usagi! Where are you?

274
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,210
Minako!

275
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,150
My transformation brooch is
gone! Someone stole the

276
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,150
Legendary Silver Crystal!

277
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,180
What?! Are you sure?

278
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,000
Chibi-Usa must have taken
it. I'm going after her to

279
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,120
get it back. I'll be
there as soon as I can!

280
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,170
Great. Perfect timing.

281
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,210
Minako!

282
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,130
Something's wrong.

283
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,190
We shall bring a grand
reformation and lead the

284
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,210
people of Earth down the
path of righteousness.

285
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,090
Be cautious of those who
bear the mark of the White

286
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,140
Moon, they wish to destroy
these golden dreams,

287
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,200
...with their evil
Legendary Silver Crystal!

288
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,150
The Legendary Silver
Crystal is evil, and the

289
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,170
mark of the White Moon
is not to be trusted.

290
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,200
This is bad!

291
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,150
Everyone stop! None of this
is real! She's a fraud!

292
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Don't listen to her!

293
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
[gasp]

294
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,190
Quit wasting your breath.

295
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,120
You can't get through to
them. I am Calaveras,

296
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,030
second eldest of the
four Spectre Sisters.

297
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,180
My mind control is absolute
and soon it will reach

298
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,100
everyone on Earth.

299
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,080
[gasp]

300
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,080
Minako! Now!

301
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,190
Venus Star Power
Make up!

302
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,170
I am the Pretty Guardian...

303
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,030
Who fights for
love and beauty!

304
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,120
I am Sailor Venus!

305
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,010
In the name of Venus,
I will punish you!

306
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,200
With the power of love!

307
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,100
There you are. It's about
time you showed up.

308
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,200
I knew you'd be coming so I
prepared something special.

309
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,010
[gasp]

310
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,160
Venus, my guardian planet!

311
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,120
Bestow on me the
power of Love!

312
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,140
Rolling Heart Vibration!

313
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,020
[gasp]

314
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,020
You cannot kill what's
already dead. Spirits of the

315
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,230
four Spectre Sisters,
Energy Attack!

316
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,030
[scream]

317
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,060
Venus!

318
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,010
My body... It's
being torn apart!

319
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,040
[chuckling]

320
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,120
And so the last two Sailor
Guardians meet their end!

321
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,140
"The Last two"!?

322
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,000
Crimson Rubeus himself
should be doing away with

323
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,030
both Sailor Moon and
the Rabbit as we speak.

324
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,220
No! He can't! Usagi!

325
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,050
Found her. Chibi-Usa!

326
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,040
[gasp]

327
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,190
I knew you were the one
who stole my brooch.

328
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,040
That's not yours!
Give it back now!

329
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,180
[gasps]

330
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,140
How nimble.

331
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,140
Just what I'd expect from
the ever-evasive Rabbit.

332
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,120
Though she did have help.

333
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,050
You were a worthy
opponent, Sailor Moon.

334
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,160
But now it's time to die.

335
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,140
[gasp]

336
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,200
[gasps]

337
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,200
Tuxedo Mask!

338
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,020
I've been hit. That
doesn't happen a lot.

339
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
I would have given you all
a quick death, but now

340
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,220
you'll feel the full
power of my flames!

341
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,180
What now?! He's
going to kill us!

342
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,180
Usako!

343
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,170
Use your power, Tuxedo
Mask. You can protect them!

344
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,080
[gasp]

345
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,190
Concentrate.

346
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,170
Focus your energy.
And release it!

347
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,160
What's going on? I feel
power in my hand...

348
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,050
Hah!

349
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,060
Tuxedo La
Smoking Bomber!

350
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,456
[gasp]

351
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,130
Damn him! How was he
able to repel my fire?!

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,180
What was that power?

353
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,170
And where did that
voice come from?

354
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,170
You saved us.

355
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,060
Usako! Are you
girls both okay?

356
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,070
Yes. Thanks to you.

357
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,060
Chibi-Usa, give Usako
back her brooch.

358
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,160
Please Chibi-Usa, I've lost
three friends already.

359
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,170
I don't want to lose Venus
too! Let me save her!

360
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,170
Moon Crystal
Power! Make up!

361
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,190
[screaming]

362
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,070
[giggling] You'll be seeing
your friends very soon,

363
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,150
Sailor Venus.

364
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,456
[gasp]

365
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,110
[gasp]

366
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,080
Hey, what took you so long?

367
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,020
I don't know what you are or
where you came from, but you

368
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,040
won't be hurting anyone I
care about ever again!

369
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,000
I am the Pretty Guardian!

370
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,170
Who fights for love,
and for justice.

371
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,100
I am Sailor Moon!

372
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,060
And now In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

373
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,090
Stay out of my way!

374
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:33,000
Moon Princess Halation!

375
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,020
[death scream]

376
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,210
Chibi-Usa, you
took my brooch.

377
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,070
Were you planning to
do something with the

378
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,180
Legendary Silver Crystal?

379
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,170
I knew it was hopeless. No
matter how many Legendary

380
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,190
Silver Crystals I have, I'm
still not able to use them.

381
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,140
Huh?

382
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,030
I knew it, but I
took yours anyway.

383
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,220
I know the Legendary Silver
Crystal from the past, has

384
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,100
no power except in the past.

385
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,220
And the one from the
future only works there.

386
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,210
I was taught that if both
Crystals were ever in the

387
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,190
same time, it
could be dangerous.

388
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,230
Even so... I didn't care.

389
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,190
I had to try it anyway.

390
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,080
With the power of two
Legendary Silver Crystals,

391
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,080
I thought, maybe, I
could do something.

392
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
A Silver Crystal from the
future and one from the

393
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,190
past... I don't
understand.

394
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,090
What does that mean?

395
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,010
Chibi-Usa...

396
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,210
What are you trying
to tell us?

397
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,190
Sailor Moon! You're
my only hope!

398
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,230
I'm from the future!

399
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,010
30th-century Earth!
And I need you!

400
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,180
[gasp]

401
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,180
Beyond this door,
lies the 30th Century...

402
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,040
Halt! None shall pass!
It is forbidden!

403
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,100
I am the keeper of the
Door of Space and Time.

404
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,120
My name is Sailor Pluto,
Guardian of the Underworld!

405
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,050
Any intruders beyond this
point will be eliminated!

406
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,100
Act.19 Time warp-
Sailor Pluto.

407
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,100
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
