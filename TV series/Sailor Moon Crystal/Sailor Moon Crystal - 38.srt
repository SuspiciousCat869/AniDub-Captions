[gasp] Mamo!

00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,866
It's Tuxedo Mask!

5
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,566
The barrier is failing! You have
to act fast! Otherwise, the

the Earth!

00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,600
You must transform into Super
Sailor Moon!

Moon Chalice...

00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,866

She is so strong. Someday, I
hope...

12
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,466
...that I can be strong, as
well,...

13

Is that another...Moon Chalice?!

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,466
Her deep desire to be strong has
triggered a new awakening.

17
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,733
Sailor Chibi Moon, are you
ready?

18
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:30,633
Hm.

Master Pharaoh 90 must

her energy!

63
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:45,133
At the rate he's growing, he
could soon engulf the entire
Earth!

00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:50,333
C'mon, guys! We've got to stop

(Master Pharaoh 90) [grunt] I
can't move.

104
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,600
Is this a barrier?

105
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,700
We are not letting you out of

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,066
We have to stop him, or else

What is this repulsive light?!

The glow of the moon...

[inhale]

145
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,000
It feels so warm.

00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:30,400
(Usagi) Just like Mamo...and my
friends, who are always there
for me.

147
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:37,900
(Usagi) You have all watched

She's alive in our hearts!

153
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,900
So she's still here.
She'll always be with us.

154
00:12:54,466 --> 00:13:00,966
(Usagi) Now it's my turn. This
time, I'll be the one...who will
protect all of you!

155
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:03,200
I still have power.

156
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:11,066

means, I'm the last chance we've

157
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,333
I'm the only one left
who can fight...

158
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:18,233
Just me and the power of
the Legendary Silver Crystal...!

159
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,033
Now, Moon Chalice,...

Lend me your power!

O' Legendary Moon Chalice,

00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,300
Hm!

00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,633
Sailor Moon...

168
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,133
(Usagi) I will stop him...

169
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:05,933
...by releasing the power of the
<i>Moon Chalice and the Legendary</i>
<i>Silver Crystal from inside his</i>
<i>body!</i>

170
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:21,600
(Usagi) I will stop him...

171
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,300
...by releasing the power of the
<i>Moon Chalice and the Legendary</i>
<i>Silver Crystal from inside his</i>
<i>body!</i>

172
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:32,400
No dont! Usa!

173
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,366
[gasp] Sailor Moon...!

174
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,133
Where did she just go?!

175
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:41,100
[grunt] Super Sailor Moon!
[growl]

176
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:42,466
[grunt]

177
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,133
She vanished.

178
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,533
Are you sure?‐Did she really
disappear?

179
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:48,066
No way!

180
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
[grunt]

181
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Usagi, come in!

182
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:56,433
[gasp]

183
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,766
[exhale]

184
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:02,166
(Artemis) Sailor Moon's
signal,...it's gone!

185
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:07,866
[shaky breaths...sniffle] Usa...

186
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:13,500
(Mamoru) I let you die alone,
right in front of me...

187
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,766
I didn't protect you.

188
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:18,200
[gulp...shaky breaths]

189
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,300
Sailor Moon...Mommy!

190
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,600
[grunt] No...

191
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,766
Not this...It can't be!

192
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,700
Hey...

193
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,266
Huh?

194
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,433
I never did tell you my name,
did I?

195
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
(Usagi) You don't have to.

196
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,366
[gasp]

197
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,266
(Usagi) I already know it's
Haruka Tenoh.

198
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:41,033
Turns out you're famous. You
both are, you and Michiru.

199
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,766
I know who you are. I figured it
out. I could sense it in the
wind.

200
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:52,133
(Haruka) I just...All I wanted
to do was protect her, with my
own hands.

201
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,600
That's the only thing...I ever
wanted.

202
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:01,100
[choking cry] How could we
allow this...

203
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:04,400
[gulp] Sailor Moon...

204
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,333
[deep breaths]

205
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,333
[small sobs, gasp]

206
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,566
[deep breaths, gasp]

207
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,766
[deep breaths...gasp]

208
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,100
(Haruka) The Talismans...

209
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,366
[gasp]

210
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:20,400
<i>(Michiru)...they're</i>
<i>resonating!</i>

211
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:54,666
(Master Pharaoh 90) What is this
light emanating from my body?
[building roar]

212
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,166
[grunts]

213
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:05,233
[grunt] Now what?

214
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,400
[grunts]

215
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,266
[gasps]

216
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,466
[gasps] Oh no!

217
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:24,800
It can't be...

218
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,666
I am an emissary from the abyss
of death.

219
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:03,366
Protected by Saturn, the Outer
Planet of Destruction.‐The
Guardian of Silence.

220
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,133
I am Sailor Saturn.

221
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,466
[deep breathing]

222
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,133
Sailor Saturn?

223
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,300
Again she has awakened...

224
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,666
[gasps]

225
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,700
She's here...

226
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,133
[deep breaths]

227
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:19,066
We failed...

228
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,033
[deep breaths, gasp]

229
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,733
So then, is this the end?

230
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:33,333
From where I stand, it doesn't
feel like much time has passed
since the last crisis, which
triggered my previous awakening.

231
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:45,233
[sigh] It seems as though I
remain the uninvited guest.

232
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:56,133
The gradual overlap of
coincidences, has caused a
dangerous aberration in the
course of events.

233
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:59,666
As a result, history itself has
been slightly altered.

234
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:02,266
[grunt]

235
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,300
[scream]

236
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:11,200
I can't...move. [long howling]

237
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:18,100
(Sailor Saturn) What happened in
Mugenzu was supposed to be
Hotaru's end. She should have
found eternal rest.

238
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,233
Instead, she was forced to live
an inconceivable life as a
cyborg.

239
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,066
It was a huge shock to her
body...

240
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:35,200
It also caused a considerable
disturbance to my soul, which
should have stayed asleep.

241
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,366
Professor Tomoe's twisted heart
is what attracted these alien
beings to this world.

242
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:50,133
This eventually led to our
survival inside a vesselized
body.

243
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,633
Alas, it could not be helped.

244
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,566
There's a reason why we were all
<i>drawn to this place, and why a</i>
<i>gateway from another world</i>
<i>opened up here.</i>

245
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,600
This is the chosen land.

246
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,800
The path we are on was
predestined long ago ‐ the path
of destruction.

247
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,233
And now that I have awakened...

248
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,366
[yowl]

249
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,100
I must fulfill that destiny, and
swing this Silence Glaive.

250
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:27,033
That glaive is the scythe of the
Goddess of Death!

251
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:30,533
All she has to do is swing
and it's total annihilation.

252
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,266
Dammit! I refuse to let this be
our fate! Not again!

253
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,300
(Chibi‐Moon) No...Does this
mean...there's no future?

254
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,600
[gasp] No, Saturn! Don't do it!

255
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,100
Death Reborn Revolution!

256
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,266
(Master Pharaoh 90) [groaning]

257
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:14,766
My power...It's being
sucked out of me!

258
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:28,600
[grunts]

259
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,033
[groan] This massive negative
aura...

260
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:39,166
It's the same dormant power,
which surrounded the Omega Area!

261
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:45,600
I now see that power has
awakened as the light that
brings destruction!

262
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,533
It was you!

263
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:54,266
[bellowing]

264
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:58,266
She pulled him off the planet's
surface. What frightening power!

265
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,700
Abominable existence! You
Invader!

266
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:03,833
I condemn you...

267
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,600
...and Earth, to total
annihilation!

268
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:13,366
[yell]

269
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,666
This is the end. We can't stop
it!

270
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:21,333
(Mamoru) She's about to swing
her Silence Glaive,...

271
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,833
...which will destroy the alien
and the world along with it!

272
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:36,500
[gasps]

273
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:47,033
[whimpering] Sailor Moon!

274
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:32,328
Sailor Saturn has finally
awakened.

275
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:34,495
And she has swung her Silence
Glaive.

276
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:40,062
Next time, "Act.38 Infinity 12
Infinite ‐ Journey ‐."

277
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:43,262
The moonlight is a messenger of
love.
