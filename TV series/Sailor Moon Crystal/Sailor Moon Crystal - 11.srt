1
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,180
Where am I?

2
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,000
Is this the
Moon Castle?

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,050
[gasp]

4
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,100
Is that-?!

5
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,140
Wait!

6
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,050
Tuxedo Mask!

7
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,150
I know it's you
Tuxedo Mask.

8
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,190
Please Mamo, just
say something.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,010
Usagi...

10
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,130
Usagi!

11
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,080
That doesn't sound
like him?

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,030
Usagi!

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,070
Agh!

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,030
Darn it. It's only
you, Luna.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,200
Only me?! Well 'good
morning' to you too!

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,070
I didn't mean it like that.
You just woke me right when
my dream was getting good.

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,050
Tuxedo Mask's, I
mean, Mamo's watch...

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,170
It stopped again, after
we came back from the
Moon.

19
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,140
Does that mean
something? Is he safe?

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,080
Fine. Ignore me then.

21
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,060
Huh?

22
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,020
It's not like I'm
important or anything.

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,060
Oh Luna...

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,040
You know I love you.

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,130
Are you sure you're
okay, Usagi?

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,070
It looked like you were
having a nightmare.

27
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,090
Aww. Really? Well,
don't worry, Luna.
I'm fine now.

28
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,180
There ya go. I'm
gonna change for
school.

29
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,040
Usagi...

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,030
So much has happened.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,190
And now all these memories
from the past are flooding
back too. I know it hasn't

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,210
been easy. Yet you
put on a brave face.

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,030
Okay, I'm good to go.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,020
Hey Usagi, remember you
can talk to me about
anything okay?

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,220
Don't forget. We're
partners. We're in
this together.

36
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,070
Yeah. I know
we are.

37
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,060
But I'm alright.
Really.

38
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,180
The Legendary
Silver Crystal...

39
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,230
On the Moon, Queen
Serenity said its power
comes from my heart.

40
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,060
If that's true, then I
can't keep being so sad.

41
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,060
If I want the Silver
Crystal's light to

42
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,210
come back, then I
have to be strong.

43
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,120
I'll be at the command
center if you need me,
Usagi.

44
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,070
Sure. Let me know if
anything happens, okay?

45
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,435
[gasp]

46
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,130
Huh?

47
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,090
[gasp]

48
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,210
It moved?!

49
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,080
Huh?!

50
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,100
From behind, he almost
looks like... But, no.
It couldn't be...

51
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,210
Still... why did the watch
start ticking again?

52
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,210
Hey, there!

53
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,070
Are you the new part-
timer my uncle sent?

54
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,210
Oh! You're that high
school kid who was with
Usagi the other day, right?

55
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,010
Usagi...

56
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,190
Endo, why don't you
go on in. I'll just
be a sec.

57
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,140
Sure.

58
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,477
Huh?

59
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,140
What happened? What
am I doing in front
of the arcade?

60
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Wait Endo! Where
are you going?

61
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,230
That guy who just left
isn't Endo anymore. I am
your best friend now.

62
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,180
Understand?

63
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,090
Yes. You're Endo.

64
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,200
Hey Motoki! Are
you here?

65
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,110
Hey Reika!

66
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,140
I'm over here!

67
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,090
Your book came. So I
thought I'd drop it
off.

68
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,080
Oh thanks.

69
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,180
Oh? Is this the new
guy you're training?

70
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,210
What are you
talking about?

71
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,210
It's Endo. He's been
my best friend for
years.

72
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,080
Uh, that's Endo?

73
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,120
That's for geology class.
We have to write a term
paper on it.

74
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,210
Are you interested
in precious stones?

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
Jadeite, Nephrite,
Kunzite, Zoisite...

76
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,030
Wow. You know your
minerals pretty well.

77
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,120
Just those four.
They're special to
me.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,140
Oh my goodness!

79
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,140
Ami's place is
incredible!

80
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,130
[giggling]

81
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,040
Everything is so
shiny and clean!

82
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,170
[gasp]
There's even marble
in the lobby!

83
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,180
Quiet! Please lower
your voice, Usagi.

84
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,120
You're embarrassing us.

85
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,210
And why did you insist
on bringing so many
snacks?

86
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,230
We can't possibly
eat them all.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,230
Ah, come on! We're having
a slumber party, right?

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,020
So we're supposed to
stuff our faces!

89
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,190
Usagi! We're not here
for a party. Ami wants
to have a meeting.

90
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,180
[giggling]

91
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,220
Can't we do both?

92
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,110
Uh. Hey guys? Can I
ask you something?

93
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,030
Do I look too suspicious
carrying this sword around?

94
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,220
I don't want to get
stopped by security.

95
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,230
Uh, yeah you
look suspicious!

96
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,100
Come on!

97
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,210
This is a diamond. The
hardest natural substance
on Earth. Even its name

98
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,050
comes from the Greek
word for "unbreakable".

99
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,120
Okay, Minako, now I
want you to hit it
with the stone sword.

100
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,020
Sure!

101
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,030
[gasps]

102
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,120
Oh no, Minako!
You broke it!

103
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,110
What do I do? I didn't
mean to! I'm so sorry
Ami!

104
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,210
Don't worry about it,
Minako. This is what
I thought would happen.

105
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,120
But it didn't
just break.

106
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,010
It's the hardest stone
on Earth and it shattered
into little pieces.

107
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,140
Both the sword and the rock
fragment we brought back
from the Moon are composed

108
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,030
of very strong elements
not found here.

109
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,030
I still don't know
what they are exactly.
But they're toxic.

110
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,130
They're toxic?

111
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,190
But didn't Queen Serenity
say it was a sacred sword?

112
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,150
That is a legendary sacred
sword, intended to protect
the princess...

113
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,110
Yes, but I suspect that
the sword and possibly
the entire Moon

114
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,140
Kingdom was turned
into this toxic stone.

115
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,020
The Moon Castle... I can
still picture it. So
beautiful.

116
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,130
It gleamed like crystal.

117
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,180
Even the moon itself
was brighter then. It's
so desolate now.

118
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,010
Ami are you trying to
tell us that the enemy

119
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,040
turned our kingdom
into a dead planet?

120
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,040
Possibly.

121
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,160
Aww. Look at Usagi.

122
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,130
Let's let her sleep
for a while.

123
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,070
Something like this happened
to me once before.

124
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,020
I woke up at sunset
in someone else's bed.

125
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,190
Only then, I was
with Mamo...

126
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,010
So strange... Why
did I come here?

127
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,140
And why is my
heart racing?

128
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,150
Huh?

129
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,050
[gasp]

130
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,160
Oh! Hey there Usagi!

131
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,130
I don't believe it!

132
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,070
Hello. Nice to meet you.

133
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,030
Mamo? Is that you?

134
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,230
Mamo? Is that you?

135
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,030
Usagi, this is my
best friend Endo.

136
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,090
He just started working
here part time. Come say hi!

137
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,050
Huh?

138
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,220
Furuhata and I go
to the same college.

139
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,080
You're not Mamo,
are you.

140
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,010
Sailor Moon wears buns
like these in her hair
too.

141
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,130
I guess it's popular look.

142
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,080
That voice though...
And it feels so much
like him.

143
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,230
So I heard you're very
good at the Sailor V game.

144
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,100
Perhaps you could
give me a lesson.

145
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,100
I'm not really that
good, but I'll give
it a try.

146
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,200
Something's not right.

147
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,040
He's that same guy
from this morning!

148
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,040
Ami, are you all
there? It's urgent.

149
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,210
We're here. Is
something wrong?

150
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,200
Mamoru Chiba?!

151
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,000
Impossible. The Dark
Kingdom kidnapped him.

152
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,030
They wouldn't
just let him go.

153
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,200
But the face...
It must be him.

154
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,130
Look closer, at his
eyes. They're different!

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,120
Something doesn't
feel right.

156
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,010
That's not Mamoru Chiba.
We need to go warn Usagi.

157
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,030
Oh no...

158
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,050
Usagi, wait!

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,110
Are you going to the
arcade to see him
again?

160
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,160
That guy is not
Mamoru Chiba.

161
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,110
I know. You don't
need to tell me that.

162
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,210
Then why are you going?

163
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,050
Just leave me alone!
I know what I'm doing!

164
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,030
Usagi!

165
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,210
I did it again. My concern's
just making things worse
for her.

166
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,130
You lied to me before. You
are good at this game.

167
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,090
It's like you know
everything about Sailor V.

168
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, she's really
strong and loyal, too.

169
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,010
It sounds like you've
actually met her.

170
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,050
Believe it or not, I
once saw Sailor V
myself.

171
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,030
Really?

172
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,040
Yeah. I saw her fighting
some bad guys once. She
seemed pretty cool.

173
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,100
I know right? You can
count on her.

174
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,020
She's a lot more responsible
than me for sure.

175
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,230
You mean more than
Sailor Moon.

176
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,160
You wear your hair
just like she does.

177
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,100
Makes you seem a lot
like Sailor Moon to me.

178
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,110
I wonder where she is.
I haven't heard much
about her lately.

179
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,040
Perhaps she's at a
secret command center?

180
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,020
[gasp]

181
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,090
Command Center?

182
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,040
I, uh... have
to go home now.

183
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,140
Usagi...

184
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,080
Your bag.

185
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,150
Come back tomorrow.
Let's you and I get
better acquainted.

186
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,230
I want to know everything
about you, Usagi.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,020
Goodbye!

188
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,050
The mind control
didn't work.

189
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,070
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh! I almost
told him all my secrets!

190
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,140
Usagi...

191
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,100
No. It's Usako. Please
Mamo... Call me Usako
again.

192
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,040
She doesn't look
okay. I'm worried.

193
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,020
Yeah. Me too.

194
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,170
Seriously?! Motoki's
with him again?!

195
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,150
What makes him so special?
He's just the new guy.

196
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,030
Mako, did you hear
that? Let's talk
to her.

197
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,477
Yeah.

198
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,000
Um, excuse me...

199
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,100
You were talking about
Furu just now. Are you
a friend of his?

200
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,160
You heard that? Oh!
I'm so embarrassed!

201
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,040
You wouldn't happen to
also know his friend
Endo, would you?

202
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,190
Because he looks an
awful lot like someone our
friend's been looking for.

203
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,000
Well I know Motoki. He and
I go to college together.

204
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,070
But I only met that guy
with him recently.

205
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,020
There was an Endo that he
used to hang out with a

206
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,180
lot but that was a
different person.

207
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,060
A skinny guy,
who wore glasses.

208
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,180
I haven't really
seen him lately.

209
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,070
That guy supposedly
goes to our college
too.

210
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,080
But I've never seen him
there and my friends
haven't either.

211
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,040
Hm?

212
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,010
I'll get into the command
center. One way or another.

213
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,010
Mind if I interrupt
your game?

214
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,110
What exactly are
you playing at
with Usagi?

215
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,050
Hmph!

216
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,060
What happened Mako?

217
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,000
We got your call and
raced here as fast
as we could.

218
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,120
What's the emergency?

219
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,010
Usagi. Thank goodness
you're here.

220
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,190
Stay away from that
new guy at the arcade!

221
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,200
So you confronted him?
Did you find out what
he wants?

222
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,050
Looks like he is our
enemy! He's after the
Legendary Silver Crystal.

223
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,130
You still have it,
don't you Usagi?
It's safe?

224
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,020
But, he can't be bad.
Because...

225
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,030
He never touched the
Crystal. It's still
around my neck.

226
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,190
The alarm's going off?
Is there an intruder?

227
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,040
Impossible! We're the
only ones who can enter.

228
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,200
The command center's shielded.

229
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,020
Usagi! Look out!

230
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,030
Mako?!

231
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,100
Oo. So close.

232
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,110
That girl is useless!

233
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,020
Tuxedo Mask!

234
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,080
So the entrance to your
secret Command Center
was right under the

235
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,060
Sailor V game!

236
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,030
But because of its
powerful shield, we
couldn't detect it.

237
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,140
Luckily we didn't
have to.

238
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,170
I hypnotized that pathetic
girl easily. She led us
right here.

239
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,060
That can't be right.

240
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,060
It's impossible!

241
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,110
Enough! Time
to transform!

242
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,040
Venus Power
Make Up!

243
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:07,050
Mercury Power
Make Up!

244
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,170
Mars Power
Make Up!

245
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,190
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
beauty!

246
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,120
I am Sailor Venus!

247
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,200
In the name of Venus,
I will punish you!

248
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,180
With the
power of love!

249
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,100
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
intelligence!

250
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,060
I am Sailor Mercury!

251
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,210
Douse yourself in
water and repent!

252
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,060
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for passion!

253
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,150
I am Sailor Mars!

254
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,080
In the name of Mars,
I'll chastise you!

255
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,120
[attack yell]

256
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,456
Venus!

257
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,190
I must have the
Crystal! Give
it to me!

258
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,090
Usagi!

259
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,090
That's no way to treat
a girl! Time for some
tough love!

260
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,070
Venus Love Me Chain!

261
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,100
[screaming]

262
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,120
Agh! No you don't!

263
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,160
Agh!

264
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,170
He's too powerful!

265
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,110
He's going to destroy the
whole command center!

266
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,110
[gasp]

267
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,070
The Silver Crystal!
Mercury Aqua Mist!

268
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,190
[scream]

269
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,160
[evil chuckling]

270
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,000
At last! I have it!
The Silver Crystal
is mine!

271
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,000
Not so fast!

272
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,160
[grunting]

273
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,160
You underestimate me!

274
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,150
[scream]

275
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,100
Why...

276
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,170
Why is everyone
fighting Tuxedo
Mask?

277
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,120
Usagi!

278
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,080
You have to fight him!
Hurry! What are you
waiting for?!

279
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,000
[gasp]

280
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,100
[evil laughter]

281
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,190
Fight?

282
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,230
Fight Tuxedo Mask? This
isn't real. It can't
be happening!

283
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,080
He was kidnapped!

284
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,160
Listen to me, he's
not who you think
he is.

285
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,130
That's not the real
Tuxedo Mask! He's
a fake!

286
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Now Princess, take my
hand and come with me!

287
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,150
Take his hand...

288
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,140
Snap out of it, Usagi!
That's not the man you
love!

289
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,170
I'm sorry. I know I've
let you down before. But
please!

290
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,040
You have to believe me!

291
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm your partner, Usagi. I
know who your true love is.

292
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:48,100
That man is an impostor and
I will not let him hurt you!

293
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,000
[gasp]

294
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,150
Get off me filthy beast!

295
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,190
[screaming]

296
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,120
Luna!

297
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,200
Hang on, Luna!

298
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,160
Hmph! As if a pathetic
little cat could hurt me!

299
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,110
Luna was right! You're
not Tuxedo Mask!

300
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,230
You're not the
man I love!

301
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,230
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

302
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,110
Luna. Please open
your eyes, Luna.

303
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,210
I'm so sorry.

304
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,040
I love you.

305
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,120
What the-?

306
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,050
Sailor Moon!
Quickly!

307
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,190
If you hurry, you can
heal everyone with
the Moon Stick!

308
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,020
Moon Healing Escalation!

309
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You are an impostor!

310
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,180
You are my enemy!

311
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,200
You hurt Luna! And you
hurt my other friends
too!

312
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,230
I will never
forgive you!

313
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,200
[chuckling]

314
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,080
[gasp]

315
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,040
No! Not her again!

316
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,170
You have done well,
Tuxedo Mask.

317
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,180
Now that I have obtained
the Legendary Silver
Crystal,

318
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,040
We can dispose
of these girls.

319
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:07,050
Sailor Guardians, your
secret command center
will be your grave!

320
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,130
But why? What did
we do to you?

321
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,230
[snickering]

322
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,080
No matter what life we
meet in, it seems you are
always a weak little girl.

323
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,210
She couldn't be...

324
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,070
Allow me to introduce
myself. I am Queen Beryl,
ruler of the Dark Kingdom.

325
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,170
Unlike the last time we
met, there won't be
any survivors.

326
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,150
Does she really not
remember me?

327
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,080
Then again, I'm a very
different person now.

328
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,170
Poor little Princess
Serenity, you missed
your beloved Endymion,

329
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,190
didn't you?

330
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,170
Well now he's going
to kill you.

331
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,220
Did you say,
Endymion?

332
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,180
You're lying.

333
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,040
The man I'm looking
at, is really Mamo?

334
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,110
Mamo! Do I really
have to fight you?!

335
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,040
No! I can't do it!

336
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,180
But... what choice
do I have?

337
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,010
If this is our destiny,
the reason we were reborn,
then so be it!

338
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,230
Act. 12 Enemy
Queen Metalia

339
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,080
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
