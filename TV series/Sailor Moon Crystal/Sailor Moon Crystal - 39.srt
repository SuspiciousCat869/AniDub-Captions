1
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:36,033
(Master Pharaoh 90) Behold! I am
about to engulf this planet, and
<i>make it one with myself!</i>
<i>[maniacal laughing]</i>

2
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,333
I still have power.

3
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:45,000
The power I have from my friends
<i>is still with me, which means,</i>
<i>I'm the last chance we've got.</i>

4
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,366
I'm the only one left who can
fight...

5
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:52,400
Just me and the power of the
Legendary Silver Crystal...!

6
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,100
Hm!

7
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:03,166
I will stop him...

8
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:09,400
...by releasing the power of the
<i>Moon Chalice and the Legendary</i>
<i>Silver Crystal from inside his</i>
<i>body!</i>

9
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:31,466
I am an emissary from the abyss
of death.

10
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:36,133
Protected by Saturn, the Outer
Planet of Destruction.‐The
Guardian of Silence.

11
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,733
I am Sailor Saturn.

12
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,833
[deep breathing]

13
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,000
Sailor Saturn?

14
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,833
Again she has awakened...

15
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,466
[grunt]

16
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,466
(Master Pharaoh 90) [scream]

17
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,100
I can't move. [groan]

18
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,833
And now that I have awakened...

19
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,800
[long howling]

20
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:06,800
I must fulfill that destiny, and
swing this Silence Glaive.

21
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:11,066
No...Does this mean...there's no
future?

22
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,333
Death Reborn Revolution!

23
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:23,900
(Master Pharaoh 90) [gasp] This
massive negative aura...

24
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:30,000
It's the same enormous, dormant
power, which surrounded the
Omega Area!

25
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:36,166
I now see that power has
awakened as the light that
brings destruction!

26
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:39,066
It was you!

27
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,800
[bellow]

28
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,733
Abominable existence! You
Invader!

29
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,900
I condemn you,...

30
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,400
...and Earth, to total
annihilation!

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,900
[bellow]

32
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,800
This is the end! We can't stop
it!

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,400
(Mamoru) She's about to swing
her Silence Glaive,...

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,400
...which will destroy the alien
and the world along with it.

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,133
[whimper] Sailor Moon!

36

[groaning]

38
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,233
Tch...

39
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:49,166
(Mamoru) It's over...All of it.

40
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,633
The whole world is...

41
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,800
Tch...

42
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,100
...coming to an end.

43
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,633
[gasp] Sailor Moon...

44
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,900
[gasp] Sailor Moon!

45
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:20,633
Uh?

46
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,300
Um!

47
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:30,666
[groaning]

48
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,000
Huh? Everyone! Look there!

49
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:44,933
[gasps]

50
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,166

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,100
[gasps]

52
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,633
What on Earth is going on?

53
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,300
Uh?

54
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,800
[gasps]

55
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,066
Is that...?

56
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,300
No way!

57
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,566
Sailor Moon...

58
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,233
Uh...Super Sailor
Moon...[whimper...sigh]

59
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,800
Hah!

60
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,300
[sighs]

61
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,900
[sighs]

62
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:57,966
Huh?

63
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,800
Our costumes...

64
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,266
...they've all changed!

65
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,900
[gasps]

66
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:16,933
[gasp]

67
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,200
What happened...?

68
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:36,766
(Master Pharaoh 90) [groaning]

69
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,733
At least,...let me die in my
home star system.

70
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:57,866
The graveyard of gravity, which
swallows total darkness! My
homeworld of death, the Tau
Star System! [groaning]

71
00:08:57,966 --> 00:09:03,700
So beautiful...the deep agony of
destruction...[grunt]

72
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,933
[scream]

73
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,200
For you, the end is near!

74
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:13,300
As the Guardian of Silence,...

75
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,200
I, Sailor Saturn, will lead
you...into a world of
nothingness!

76
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:20,700
Saturn!

77
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,166
What is she doing? If she keeps
going, she'll get sucked into
that portal, too!

78
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:32,866
Saturn!

79
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,700
No!

80
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,866
What's she thinking?

81
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,866
Don't Sailor Saturn!

82
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:42,133
[gasp]...Hotaru...

83
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,833
Do not despair. There is no
need.

84
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:53,200
With every end comes a new
beginning,...one filled with
hope and rebirth.

85
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,000
[gasp]

86
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,100
(Sailor Saturn) <i>And the one to</i>
<i>bring that forth is you,...</i>

87
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,866
Super Sailor Moon.

88
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,866
Sailor Saturn...?

89
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:13,266
You released the powers of the
Moon Chalice and the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

90
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:17,666
So now, thanks
to you, this planet can
be saved.

91
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,800
It can? Really?

92
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:26,833
(Sailor Saturn) I am the
Guardian who brings death, but
only to create rebirth.

93
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:36,800
This chosen land is where the
future Silver Millennium will
eventually be built. Its sacred
power is your ally.

94
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,166
[inhale] Saturn?!

95
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:41,333
Hm.

96
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:48,300
Sailor Pluto! Close this portal
to the other world! It mustn't
exist!

97
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,833
Sailor Saturn!

98
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:50,300
Hurry!

99
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:52,533

100
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:58,866
O' Guardian god of space
and time, our great father, O'
Chronos!

101
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
Grant me power!

102
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,933
Shut this door that was wrenched
open‐ forever!

103
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,233
Dark Dome Close!

104
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:26,233
[death scream]

105
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,200
No! Don't go!

106
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,066
Hm.

107
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,200
[whimper]

108
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:56,833
[crying] Saturn! [crying]

109
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:08,100
(Sailor Saturn) With every end
comes a new beginning,...one
filled with hope and rebirth.

110
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,066
And the one to bring that
forth...is you,...

111
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,166
Super Sailor Moon.

112
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,000
[gasps]

113
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,266
Hey, is that...?

114
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:33,000
[gasp]

115
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,300
Neo Queen...Serenity?!

116
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:52,300
(Luna) The city,...

117
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,000
...she's restoring it!

118
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,300
The Messiah...[gasp]

119
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,300
(Mamoru) It was you all
along,...Serenity.

120
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,000

[gasps]

122
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,633
A baby?

123
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:47,233
[gasp]

00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,833
Wah...

00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,300
Wuh?

127
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,333
Wah...

00:13:57,433 --> 00:14:00,733

129
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,400
[gasp]...Hotaru?

130
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,633
She's been reincarnated!

131
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,966
(baby) [cooing]

132
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,766
Uh?...Hahaha!

133
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,866
[sigh] Since this child is here
all alone, I think that we
should raise her.

134
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:26,800
We will be her parents, all
three of us.

135
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:27,900
Hm.

136
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:29,300
Agreed.

137
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:35,633
[gasp]

138
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,566
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto!

139
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:45,633
Princess.

140
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,800
[exhale] Who is that baby?

141
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,233
It's time for us to leave.

142
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,233
Hm.

143
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:54,866
Uh?

144
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,066
<i>(Haruka) We've been bestowed</i>
<i>with a new mission...</i>

145
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,700

146
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:02,366
[gasp]

147
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:04,300
Hm.

148
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:08,000
[inhale] Where will you go?

149
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,833
[exhale] Not sure.

150
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,633
Could be somewhere far away,
or maybe real nearby.

151
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,866
Will we meet again?

152
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,200
Yes, of course, Super Sailor
Chibi Moon.

153
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,533
(Setsuna) We're friends. Always
and forever.

154
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:33,033
We'll see each other again. I'm
certain of it.

155
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,200
Hm.

156
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:35,866
Hm.

157
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:42,133
Hm. [sniffle] I know you're
right. [sniffle]

158
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:51,033
(Chibi‐Usa) We're all friends.
We're all Sailor Guardians. So
we'll definitely see each other
again. For sure!

159
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,866
[gasp] Don't cry, Little

160

[gasp]

161
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,033
We love you.

162
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,133
So we'll come back. That's a
promise.

163
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:06,366
And as a token to remind you of
that promise, I want you to have
this.

164
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:07,766
[gasp]

165
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:13,766
[gasp] Thanks, Neptune.

166
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,600
(Michiru) Look at yourself in
that mirror often.

167
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,200
[sniffle]

168
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:26,266
And until we meet again, work
hard, And become an even
stronger Guardian, Small Lady.

169
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:31,566
Also, please protect our
precious princess. Keep her
safe.

170
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,233
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto!

171
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,000
[gasp]

172
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,633
(Usagi) I know we'll all see
each other again.

173
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:08,166
Haruka, Michiru, Setsuna,...

174
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,266
...and you, too, Hotaru...

175
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:15,300
We will,...someday...

176
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,906
(Chibi‐Usa) " Dear Father and
Mother,

177
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:31,773
Thanks to everyone's help, I,
Usagi Small Lady Serenity,

178
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:37,740
have become a full‐fledged
Sailor Guardian: known as Super
Sailor Chibi Moon.

179
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:46,073
Now that my training is
complete, I've decided to return
to the 30th Century. I'll be
coming April 1st.

180
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:47,573
"TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OCCURS
TODAY"

181
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:49,273
Can't wait t see you!

182
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,006
Please be sure you're there when
I get back."

183
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,540
How do I look?

184
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,040
Great! [laughing]

185
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,940
Hey, guys!

186
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,340
Huh?

187
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,706
Morning, everyone!

188
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:00,706
Hi, Chibi‐Usa!

189
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:01,806
Good morning.

190
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:06,340
Hey, wait. Where's Usagi? [gasp]

191
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:07,840
(Gasp)

192
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,840
Hey, Usagi!

193
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:11,773
Huh? [laughing]

194
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,473
[laughing]

195
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,940
Let me guess, you're happy,
right?

196
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,940
[giggle] Of course I am!

197
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:23,740
I get to wear the new Juban High
School uniform, with all of my
friends!

198
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,640
Uh, well except for Rei.

199
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:26,840
[growl]

200
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,606
But the point is, we all got
into our first choice high
schools!

201
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:34,306
We should be celebrating! C'mon,
you guys!

202
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:38,973
Uhh...We had to cram like
crazy after that last fight, but
we did it.

203
00:18:39,073 --> 00:18:39,840
Uh‐huh! Uh‐huh!

204
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,906
How'd Usagi get in? She can't
even write kanji.

205
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:45,073
Think maybe the Silver Crystal
helped her?

206
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:46,806
That or a grading error.

207
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:47,440
Gak!

208
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:51,906
Now, Rei, people can do amazing
things when they're desparate.

209
00:18:52,006 --> 00:19:01,740
[groaning...sob] Come on, you
guys. Do you really have to be
so harsh? [sob]

210
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:02,873
(Mianko) Usagi.

211
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:04,540
[sobbing]

212
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,706
I'm thrilled. I'm so happy to be
going to Juban High School with
you. I can hardly wait!

213
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:13,806
[gasp]

214
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:15,706
[gasp] Minako!

215
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:17,740
We'll take makeup tests, just
you and me.

216
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:18,340
Wha‐?

217
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,540
It's so great to know I'll have
a buddy for those!

218
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:21,373
[choking]

219
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:26,306
This time, things will be
different. I'm gonna join the
volleyball club!

220
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:30,640
And then, on weekends, I'll do
every idol audition I can find!

221
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:34,040
A club, huh? Maybe I should join
the cooking club?!

222
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,040
You should. I'm joining the
computer club.

223
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:38,040
What about you, Rei?

224
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:44,640
Hm? I'm doing archery. It's what
I've always planned on. And you?

225
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,373
Oh, me? I'm gonna join the manga
and illustration club,...so I
can read lots of manga!

226
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,540
That's the spirit, Usagi! Manga
before studying!

227
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,506
(Minako) Yep! You know it takes
priority!

228
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:58,873
(Usagi) Well, I don't know about
that...

229
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:01,406
(Minako) C'mon! You don't wanna
<i>miss the one about the talking</i>
<i>cats...</i>

230
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:01,873
Hi Mamo!

231
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:03,706
[chuckling]...Hey.

232
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,873
[giggling]

233
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,040
And now Mamoru is going to
college...

234
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,306
I'll have to study hard to keep
up.

235
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,473
We'll catch up with you later,
after we're done seeing
Chibi‐Usa off, okay?

236
00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:21,506
Oh, yeah...Today is the day you
have to go back to the 30th
century, isn't it?

237
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:23,406
[chuckle]

238
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,406
I bet you'll be back in no time
at all. And next time, be sure
to bring us some gifts from the
future, 'kay?

239
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,706
We'll be waiting. Don't be long.

240
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,840
When you come back, you can stay
at my place. We'll have a blast!

241
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,873
Say hello to your parents for
us.

242
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,306
Hm. See ya later, everyone!

243
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,473
Be careful on your way home.

244
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:43,806
And come back soon.

245
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:45,006
Promise you will.

246
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:46,873
Good‐bye, Chibi‐Usa.

247
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:48,373
[giggling]

248
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:57,806
(Mamoru) So, should we head to
Ichinohashi Park?

249
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:58,806
(Usagi and Chibi‐Usa) Yeah!

250
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:06,806
My Prince, and Princess...

251
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,540
Thank you both so much for
everything that you've done.

252
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:13,040
Come back soon, Diana.

253
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,706
[gasp] Sure!

254
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,540
Hey,...by the way,...

255
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:18,473
Where are Luna and Artemis?

256
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,050
They were too sad to say
good‐bye so they didn't come.

257
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,450
[whimpering]

258
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,750
Diana!

259
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,017
Please don't stay away long!

260
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:30,183
(Usagi) Oh, silly Luna...It's
not good‐bye forever.

261
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:32,417
(Mamoru) [chuckling] That's
right.

262
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:32,950
(Chibi‐Usa) Yeah!

263
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:33,517
<i>(Diana) Yeah!</i>

264
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,083
<i>(Usagi, Chibi‐Usa and Diana)</i>
<i>[chuckling]</i>

265
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:44,050
Wow. Why are there so many
people?

266
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:44,417
Oh!

267
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:45,017
Huh?

268
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,017
I know why. The news this
morning said there was gonna be
a total solar eclipse today.

269
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,017
(Mamoru) The best one of the
century.

270
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,450
Huh? What's a "solar eclipse"?

271
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,083
It's when the new moon crosses
in front of the Sun and covers
the whole thing up for a little
while.

272
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:05,583
Looks like we should be able to
see the big event from right
here, so we're in luck.

273
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,150
(Usagi) The new moon...covers up
the Sun?

274
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,817
Here, why don't you use these
special eclipse glasses. They'll
let you see clearly.

275
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,950
(Chibi‐Usa) Thank you.

276
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:18,850
Oh!

277
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:24,783
(Chibi‐Usa) Wow...!

278
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:27,817
It's really going in front of
the sun!

279
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,783
And look, it's starting to get a
little dark, too.

280
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,017
Uh?

281
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:37,783
Huh?

282
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,183
(Chibi‐Usa) Was that a bell?

283
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:44,317
The sound is so clear and
beautiful...

284
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:49,417
Huh?

285
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,783
(Usagi and Chibi‐Usa) Huh?

286
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:54,350
[gasps]
