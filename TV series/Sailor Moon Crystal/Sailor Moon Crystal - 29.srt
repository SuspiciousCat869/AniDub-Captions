1
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:22,800
[gasp]

2
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:23,900
Who's there?!

3
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:28,066
Maybe the battles not over.

4
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,233
[gasp]

5
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,733
Did you see that?

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,166
It almost looks
like they're...

7
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,333
Usagi!

8
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,333
My wound, it's healing.

9
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,233
It disappeared!

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,066
Creepy, right?

11
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,766
It's just something I
could do, ever since

12
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,400
I was a little girl.

13
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,233
Now go...

14
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,100
You're not supposed to
be here, especially this

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,966
late. The security
guards are very strict.

16
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,466
Wait! Before you leave...

17
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:18,733
Do you think you could
tell me your name?

18
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,666
It's Hotaru Tomoe.

19
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:33,233
Hotaru...

20
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,066
Hotaru?!

21
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,966
Is it another attack? Let me
help you back to your room.

22
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,633
I don't need your help!
Get away!

23
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,933
Care to tell me what's
going on, Hotaru?

24
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,600
Kaori? Can you explain this?

25
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,100
Professor Tomoe!

26
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,733
It's nothing out of
the ordinary, sir.

27
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,733
I was offering her help,
but she didn't want it.

28
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,366
Hotaru...

29
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:58,266
Ever since your mother
passed away, Kaori's helped

30
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,866
take care of you.

31
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:02,333
You will show her some
respect, and not waste her

32
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,366
time being selfish.

33
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:08,133
I know what you're trying
to do. Keep sucking up

34
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,433
to him all you want.

35
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,166
I don't care if you're my
father's assistant, his

36
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,166
secretary, or whatever
it is that you are to

37
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,966
him, you're not part
of our family!

38
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,933
Apologies for my daughter.

39
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,966
I'm afraid I spoil
her too much.

40
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,666
Don't worry, professor.

41
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,033
Hotaru?

42
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:39,533
Daddy?

43
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,933
I see this attack still
hasn't abated.

44
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,633
Did you take your medicine?

45
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,833
Yes, Daddy. But
it isn't working.

46
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:50,633
It will, just give
it a little time.

47
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,700
Here. I brought
something for you.

48
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,333
This is a special amulet
will protect you.

49
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,233
It's been in our
family a long time.

50
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:05,766
Hold it close, and
you'll be able to sleep

51
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,200
soundly through the night.

52
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,066
There now.

53
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,033
You should feel better soon.

54
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,900
I'll check on you
in a little while.

55
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,100
Rest well.

56
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,100
Daddy...

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,166
When did his hands
become so cold?

58
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,600
How strange... The
attack suddenly stopped.

59
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,366
I'm scared. My attacks
have never been this bad.

60
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:43,200
And I can't contain my emotions.
I keep lashing out at people.

61
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,833
Am I running out of time?

62
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,733
How long can my
body hold out?

63
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,033
Unbelievable!

64
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:59,566
The question is are they
Sailor Guardians?

65
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,300
We only saw them
from a distance.

66
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,333
We can't jump
to conclusions.

67
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:05,733
If they are Guardians, why
would they disappear?

68
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,733
Why wouldn't they come
join our team?

69
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,733
Good point.

70
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:10,766
Which means it's more
likely they're enemies.

71
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,300
Whatever they are,
I'm certain they'll

72
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,800
show up again.

73
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,133
You should all be careful.

74
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,133
And don't forget, these
guys are suspicious, too.

75
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,833
So lookout for them, as well.

76
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:20,733
[gasp]

77
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,933
You are bold.

78
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,666
But be careful. It could
cost you your life.

79
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,133
But get in my way, and
there will be trouble.

80
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,066
They were suspicious.

81
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,300
Making threats like
that is pretty hostile.

82
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,800
[sigh]

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Chibi‐Usa?

84
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,566
Something on your mind?

85
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,166
I was thinking about Hotaru,
that girl we met.

86
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Her skin was snow white,
and it seemed like I could

87
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,900
almost see through it.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,933
She was pretty,
don't you think?

89
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,366
She seemed mature
for her age, too.

90
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,033
And then of course there
was the way she healed

91
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:16,133
Chibi‐Usa's arm. What
was that strange power?

92
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,700
It's been an interesting
evening, indeed.

93
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,900
Those Sailor Guardians
destroyed another defect

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
right before Hotaru's eyes.

95
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,200
The power one of them used
could that be what Master

96
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,133
Pharaoh 90 spoke of? The
"light similar to that

97
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,033
of the Taoiron Crystal"?

98
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:34,166
No. What she wielded was
far more powerful.

99
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,700
I shall try to obtain it for
the Master. Such awesome

100
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:41,166
energy would surely
please him. But first...

101
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,200
I must hurry and find the
other light the Master

102
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,733
warned me of... The light
that brings destruction.

103
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:51,033
I cannot allow it to threaten
our sacred ground.

104
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,066
Water Mirror!

105
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,166
Show me what you see.

106
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:03,933
Spirals of light? One...
Two... Three...

107
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,266
Awaken...

108
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,433
[gasp]

109
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,933
The time has come for the
light guided by the three

110
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:17,233
Talismans. Let the
destruction begin!

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,766
Those three lights...
I was so close to figuring

112
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,100
out what they were.

113
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,033
But someone interfered
with my sight.

114
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,066
That strange dream again.

115
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:39,900
A voice calling to someone.
Imploring them to wake up.

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,733
Destruction?
Three Talismans?

117
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,866
Is this dream trying to
tell us to collect them?

118
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,066
Or not to...

119
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,066
What is it?

120
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:59,600
I was trying to look for new
information, but then

121
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,133
something blocked my
gaze and clouded the mirror.

122
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,866
Don't worry, I was
able to wipe it clear.

123
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,766
Michiru.

124
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:14,933
What you and I are
attempting to do here...

125
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,866
It might be a waste of
time. We may already be

126
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:20,633
too late, and none of it
is going to matter.

127
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:23,866
But we knew that could be
the case before we ever

128
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,800
started this, didn't we.

129
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:30,333
The wheels of fate are in
motion. Once they begin to

130
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:33,100
turn, there is no
stopping them. A new

131
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,033
awakening will come soon.
All we can do is prepare.

132
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:41,700
We don't have any choice but
to collect the three Talismans.

133
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:52,800
Look at this!

134
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,200
Both Mugenzu and the Mugen
Academy are owned by the

135
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,800
same individual: A geneticist
named Souichi Tomoe.

136
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,600
Souichi Tomoe...

137
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,700
Considering a transfer
to Mugen Academy?

138
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:10,866
Professor Tomoe doesn't just
own the school, he's a

139
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,266
world‐renowned instructor.

140
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:15,866
Though I heard, he's been
expelled from the academic

141
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,633
community for some time.

142
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,033
What? Why?

143
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:22,300
Who knows? There is a rumor
Mugen Academy is a training

144
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,266
school for sorcerers.

145
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:25,833
Crazy, right?

146
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:29,166
Perhaps they say that
because of the myriad of

147
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,100
talented students who
attend. Or perhaps...

148
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,833
Um, excuse me...

149
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,133
But are you the famous violin
soloist Michiru Kaioh?

150
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,200
Yes.

151
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,000
[scream]
You're an absolute virtuoso!

152
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,166
May I please get
your autograph?

153
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,166
A violinist? Interesting.

154
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:51,833
"Virtuoso", huh? So does
that mean you're one of the

155
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,800
talented sorcerers, too?

156
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,600
[chuckle]

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,833
Could be. Why not come
judge for yourself?

158
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,166
Here are some tickets
to my next recital.

159
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,366
You should bring a friend.

160
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:08,933
It's Mamo...

161
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,066
[gasp] And that girl I
saw playing the violin!

162
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,766
What's he doing with her?

163
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,600
[gasp]

164
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:22,566
Wait a second...

165
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:29,166
Hey Bun‐head!

166
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:33,033
What's up? We meet again.
I guess you come

167
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,933
to this place often, huh?

168
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,900
Haruka Tenoh. He kind of
looks like that masked

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Guardian from
the other night.

170
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:47,066
Hey... Can I ask...
Are you by any chance

171
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,900
a Sailor Guardian?

172
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,233
[laughing]

173
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,733
A what? Sailor Guardian?

174
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:59,233
What the hell are
you talking about?

175
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,900
[scream] Why did I say
that? Dumb Usagi!

176
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,933
He can't be a Guardian!
He's a boy!

177
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,300
Is that like playing
super‐hero?

178
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Like you're in a video game?

179
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,233
Hey! What we're doing
isn't a game!

180
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,800
Stay away from Usagi!

181
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,800
Fine. Whatever.
Have it your way.

182
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,733
Wow, Chibi‐Usa. You were
selected to be the class

183
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,533
president of your
new homeroom?

184
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:42,233
Yeah! I got to go to the
entrance ceremony for the

185
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,000
first‐graders.

186
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:47,166
The class president?
Really? You?

187
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,433
I can't believe she's a
second grader...

188
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,100
And we've started our final
year of middle school.

189
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,466
I know... It's so awful.

190
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,533
We'll have high
school exams soon.

191
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,033
Hey now, gloomy gus, turn
that frown upside down!

192
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,400
You can be depressed later.

193
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,200
'Cause tomorrow is April
17th, Rei's birthday!

194
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,733
Let's throw a big party
for her to celebrate.

195
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,333
Uh... Where is she?

196
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,700
She left early yesterday
to go do some

197
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
training in the mountains.

198
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,266
In the mountains?!

199
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,666
She said she wanted to
spend her fifteenth

200
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:17,466
birthday purifying herself.

201
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,633
But I was gonna bake a cake!

202
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,966
Yes, Magus Kaolinite. I am
at your command.

203
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,966
Both as Eudial
of the Witches 5.

204
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,733
And also as Yuko Arimura,
Philosophy and Etiquette

205
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,366
prefect. Leave
everything to me.

206
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:39,566
I will ensure all the
incoming Mugen students

207
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,200
quickly learn the academy
rules, and in the

208
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,466
process, I shall make
offerings of many Vessels

209
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,466
and Hostes to our Master.

210
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,666
It is in your hands, Eudial.

211
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:02,766
What's this?!

212
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,466
Eudial isn't alone!
There's another light!

213
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,133
Awaken...

214
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,300
The time has come. Let
the destruction begin.

215
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,566
Gather the three Talismans!

216
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,633
[gasp]

217
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:19,966
Gather three?

218
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,366
Talismans?

219
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,433
Are the Talismans the true
identity of the light that

220
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,033
will bring destruction?

221
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,200
If so, where are they?

222
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,700
I must find and
destroy them, quickly.

223
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,633
What does "destruction"
mean? Is something about to

224
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,066
happen? And Three
Talismans...

225
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,200
Are they a clue to how we
can defeat our new enemies?

226
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,100
Could they be the key?

227
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,533
Earth to Rei!

228
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,700
Uh? Mako?!

229
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,066
Yup! It's me!

230
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,100
Next time could you
maybe pick a shorter

231
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,733
mountain to train on?

232
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,466
What are all of
you doing here?

233
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:58,300
Happy Birthday dear Rei!
Happy Birthday to you!

234
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,700
Cheers!

235
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,566
Uh, thanks you guys.

236
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,033
And, voila! I still managed
to bake a cake for you.

237
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,333
No need to thank me for
carrying it up the mountain.

238
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,300
I brought Casa Blanca
Lilies. I remembered they

239
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,066
were your favorite flower.

240
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
And I got you this tea set!

241
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,733
You can use together
with your grandpa!

242
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:16,233
Now that you're older
you don't want

243
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,533
your brain to get lazy!

244
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,666
I got you a workbook
to help you study!

245
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:20,833
Please don't
mention studying.

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,733
I don't want to think about
that. We're supposed to be

247
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,266
on vacation!

248
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,666
On behalf of the Mugen
Academy faculty, I would

249
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:31,533
like to welcome you
all to our annual

250
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,466
orientation for new students.

251
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,433
Hold on a minute...

252
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,033
You didn't know about
this, did you, Rei?

253
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,266
Mugen Academy is hosting
a retreat for their new

254
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:42,066
students, right there in that
building across the valley.

255
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,166
Yes. I knew.

256
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,333
Honestly, it's a big part of
why I decided to come

257
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,433
meditate here.

258
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,266
And you came alone? Why
wouldn't you let the rest of

259
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,433
us in on it?

260
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,100
Because I had a bad feeling
that it might not be safe.

261
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
[gasp]

262
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,133
After all, above everything
else, our first priority

263
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:59,400
remains protecting Usagi.

264
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:02,333
The way I see it, if it's
something we can take care

265
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,166
of, without her having
to get involved

266
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:05,766
that's always best.

267
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,566
[screaming]

268
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,233
What was that?

269
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,300
Some Mugen Academy students
are staying in that complex

270
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,200
over there. It sounds like
they are having judo practice.

271
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:29,433
Oh hey there, Bun‐head. I
keep running into you.

272
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,400
No kidding! It's like I'm
seeing him everywhere!

273
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,166
Are you following me? Or is
this a coincidence?

274
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,733
For your information we
are up here training!

275
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,466
Oh, I didn't realize...

276
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,433
Well, if that's the case,
anyone want to spar with me?

277
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,100
We can train together.

278
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,166
[angry grunt]

279
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,700
That is, if you
girls know judo.

280
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,666
[growl]

281
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,500
Okay, wise guy, bring it on!

282
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
You don't know judo!

283
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,433
[scoff] He's not so tough.
I can take him easy.

284
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,566
Careful, Mako.

285
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,133
[attack yell]

286
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,600
[gasp] Mako!

287
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:17,733
Are you okay?

288
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,166
Is anything broken?

289
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:23,033
You jerk! What's the matter
with you? How dare you

290
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,533
throw a girl that hard!

291
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:28,133
So? Why should I treat her
any differently? Her gender

292
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,733
doesn't matter. She's weak,
because she's weak.

293
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,600
There's no excuse. You can
either protect what's

294
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,666
precious, or you can't.

295
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,133
What is going on in here?!

296
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,600
[nervous screams]

297
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:45,900
Nothing, Miss Arimura.

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,100
I was just practicing with some
girls from another school.

299
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,466
I see.

300
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,300
Rei? You're awake?

301
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,066
Shh!

302
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,133
Huh?

303
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,100
It's a little late to be
having a student assembly,

304
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,533
don't you think?

305
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:16,200
Good evening. Let us begin
the official Mugen Academy

306
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,066
welcome ceremony.

307
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,333
To start your academic
experience off on the right

308
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,200
foot, please pay
attention and listen

309
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,066
carefully, this is the
school's creed.

310
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,533
Article one: Love thy
school, and devote

311
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:30,066
yourselves entirely to it.

312
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,366
Article two: To Master
Pharaoh 90, the school's

313
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,366
illustrious founder,
you will freely give

314
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,233
both your minds and bodies.

315
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,466
And finally, for our
Master's survival and our

316
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:46,566
own continued existence,
you will work hard to

317
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,066
temper and forge yourself
into excellent Vessels.

318
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,733
And you will offer up your
very souls, your Hostes, in

319
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,233
support of this noble cause!

320
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,300
I'm afraid the party's over!

321
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,233
What the‐‐?

322
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:05,266
Mars Planet Power Make Up!

323
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:36,400
Jupiter Planet Power
Make Up!

324
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,066
I thought you Sailor
Guardians might show up.

325
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,266
[gasp]

326
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:09,033
You don't know me, but that
will change. I'm a Level 78

327
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:12,033
Death Buster, Eudial
of the Witches 5.

328
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:15,400
And I'm about to level up by
taking the two of you down.

329
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,700
A Death Buster?

330
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,466
[attack yell]

331
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,700
Mars Snake Fire!

332
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,933
[scream]

333
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,133
[evil chuckling]

334
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:36,433
Burn to ashes!

335
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,366
Usagi! Usagi, wake up!

336
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,066
What is it, Ami?

337
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,700
Rei and Mako are gone! I
can't find them anywhere.

338
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:49,533
[gasp]

339
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:50,700
Guys, look outside!

340
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,033
‐What?!
‐Oh no!

341
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,300
[scream]

342
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,633
[chuckle] Didn't even break
a sweat. Time to end you!

343
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:04,533
[gasp]

344
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:08,466
Mercury Aqua Mist!

345
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,466
What?!

346
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,000
That was close!
Are you two okay?

347
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,966
Yes.

348
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,100
We're fine.

349
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,400
Neo Queen Serenity!

350
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,300
Lend me your strength!

351
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Lend your power to
my Heart Moon Rod!

352
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,366
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

353
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,933
[death scream]

354
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,066
Welp, there goes Eudial.

355
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,566
She didn't deserve to call
herself one of the Witches 5.

356
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,500
So much for Eudial. There
goes our Fire Warrior.

357
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,500
They're strong those
Sailor Guardians.

358
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,433
A Death Buster, that's
what she called herself.

359
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,066
Are you sure?

360
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,166
[affirmative grunts]

361
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,366
Death Busters...
Our new enemies.

362
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,033
It's her!

363
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,100
Come back!

364
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,333
Sailor Moon!

365
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:27,666
She's like the wind. So
fast! I can't catch her!

366
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
I lost her.

367
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,166
I didn't think that you'd be
able to keep up with me.

368
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,000
I underestimated you.

369
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,433
Who are you?

370
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,333
You're cute, Bun‐head. But
don't get in our way, or

371
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:47,533
you'll be sorry.

372
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
Some of the games
we play...

373
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:53,933
Are dangerous.

374
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,233
What just happened?
How could I kiss

375
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,733
someone besides Mamo?

376
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,866
Next time, "Act.29 Infinity
3 Two, New Guardians."

377
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:42,633
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
