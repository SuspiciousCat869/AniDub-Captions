1
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

2
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,791
- Nadeshiko: ALL RIGHT, CLASS,

3
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,708
SUMMER SCHOOL IS NOW
OFFICIALLY OVER.

4
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,583
- YAY! I DID IT!

5
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,083
- I HOPE ALL OF YOU ENJOY THE
REST OF YOUR SUMMER BREAK.

6
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,500
HAVE FUN, BUT DON'T GO
TOO CRAZY, OKAY, YOU GUYS?

7
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,041
- GOTCHA. BYE, MISS N.

8
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,458
- WAIT. I'M NOT DONE YET. HEY!

9
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,333
DON'T FORGET TO DO YOUR
SUMMER BREAK HOMEWORK,

10
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,625
OR I'LL MAKE YOU
SQUAT HOP FOR FIFTY LAPS.

11
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,833
- 'KAY!

12
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,083
WOO-HOO!

13
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,666
MY ENDLESS DAYS OF
SUFFERING ARE FINALLY OVER.

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,500
SO LONG, SUMMER SCHOOL.

15
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,500
AS OF THIS MOMENT, THE
ONLY THING ON MY AGENDA

16
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,041
IS TO HAVE SOME FUN.

17
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,500
- ( both exclaiming )

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,416
- WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

19
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,541
MAYUMI, WOULD YOU GET OFF
OF ME? YOU'RE IN MY WAY.

20
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,416
- WHAT? "IN YOUR WAY"?
SERIOUSLY?

21
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,750
IS THAT WHAT GUYS SAY

22
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,208
WHEN THEY GET A CLOSE
LOOK AT A GIRL'S PANTIES?

23
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,833
- BUT I DIDN'T WANNA SEE THEM.

24
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,708
COULD YOU JUST
GET OFF ME ALREADY?

25
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,875
- IF YOU KEEP SAYING
MEAN THINGS LIKE THAT,

26
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,500
I'LL LOSE ALL SENSE OF DIGNITY.

27
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,875
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

28
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,833
WE'RE ALREADY WELL
PAST THAT POINT.

29
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,458
BESIDES, SEEING SOMEONE'S
UNDERWEAR'S NO BIG DEAL.

30
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,500
- OH?

31
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,250
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,
LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT THEN.

32
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,791
I'M GONNA EXPOSE
YOUR WHITEY TIGHTIES

33
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:15,791
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE.

34
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:16,875
NO BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

35
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,875
- NO, WAIT. HEY, STOP IT.

36
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,166
- HEY, COME ON,
IT'S ONLY FAIR, ISN'T IT?

37
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,000
YOU GOT TO SEE MY UNDERWEAR,
SO I SHOULD GET TO SEE YOURS.

38
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,333
DON'T BE SUCH A HYPOCRITE.

39
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,625
- STOP IT. COME ON, MAYUMI.

40
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,083
ARE YOU GUYS GONNA HELP,
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA WATCH?

41
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,208
- HUH?

42
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,458
- UM, HEY, WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING, EXACTLY?

43
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,666
- UH, WELL, WE WERE, UH...

44
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,625
WE'RE PLAYING DOCTOR,
THAT'S ALL.

45
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,666
- ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO COME SWIMMING WITH US?

46
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,708
- NO THANK YOU,
I THINK I'LL PASS.

47
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,541
I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE
BEING ON SCHOOL GROUNDS

48
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,750
ANY LONGER THAN I HAVE TO
BE TODAY AND BESIDES THAT,

49
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,666
I DIDN'T BRING MY
SWIMSUIT WITH ME.

50
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,208
- THAT'S NO PROBLEM,
RIGHT, NERINE?

51
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,583
- I'VE GOT AN EXTRA SUIT
THAT YOU COULD BORROW.

52
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,791
- OH?

53
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,500
- Girls: MMM.

54
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,708
- WHAT IS IT?

55
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,958
- UH, OH, NEVER MIND.
IT'S NOTHING.

56
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,375
- ( Mayumi grunts )

57
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,125
IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY, THEN SPIT IT OUT!

58
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,416
- YOU HEAR ME, RIN?

59
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,708
- YOUR RIBS. THEY'RE
CRUSHING MY EAR.

60
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,750
- WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY?

61
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,333
( grunts )

62
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,791
- ( groaning )

63
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,500
- RIN!
- RIN!

64
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,666
- Nerine: ARE YOU OKAY?

65
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,041
- EXCUSE ME FOR NOT
HAVING BIG BOOBS.

66
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,458
SURE, BEING FLAT CHESTED

67
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,958
DEFINITELY PUTS ME
IN THE MINORITY,

68
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,916
BUT IT ALSO MAKES ME UNIQUE.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,208
PERSONALLY, I THINK
YOU SHOULD FEEL LUCKY

70
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,291
TO KNOW SUCH A RARE SPECIMEN.

71
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,541
STUPID RIN. I'M INSULTED.

72
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,583
I WISH I HAD HURT
HIS OTHER EAR, TOO.

73
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,750
HEY, WHAT IS IT, KIDDO?

74
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,916
( gasps )

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,083
- HEY, LOOK, LADY,
YOU GOT STRIPES.

76
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,291
- HEY!
- ( chuckles )

77
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,875
- ( scoffs )

78
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,916
RIN'S OBVIOUSLY GOT
TO BE OUT OF HIS MIND.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
I MEAN, COME ON,

80
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,708
EVEN THAT LITTLE KID WANTED TO
SEE MY PANTIES, BUT RIN DIDN'T?

81
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,416
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT BOY?

82
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,625
DOES BEING FLAT CHESTED

83
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,250
MAKE MY CUTE PANTIES
LESS INTERESTING, TOO?

84
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,291
- HEY, WAIT, I KNOW THAT LOOK.

85
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,875
YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT RIN, RIGHT?

86
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,125
- HUH?

87
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,541
- I NEVER KNEW YOU FELT
THAT WAY, TOO, MAYUMI.

88
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,500
SO FIRST THERE WERE THREE
GIRLS, THEN IT BECAME FOUR,

89
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,833
AND NOW THERE ARE FIVE
GIRLS IN LOVE WITH RIN.

90
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,916
- HEY! I DON'T LOVE
THAT DUMB JERK.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,291
- ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE
NOT QUITE READY

92
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,833
TO PROFESS YOUR
LOVE OUT LOUD YET.

93
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,125
HOWEVER, I'M SURE YOU
HAVE PASSIONATE EMOTIONS

94
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,958
HIDDEN IN THAT TEENY BOSOM.

95
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,625
- WAS THAT "TEENY BOSOM"
CRACK REALLY NECESSARY?

96
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,791
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK. TSUCHIMI?

97
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,708
I DON'T SEE HOW A GIRL
COULD FALL IN LOVE

98
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,875
WITH A GUY LIKE HIM.

99
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,541
- OH, COME ON NOW.
HE'S SUCH A SWEETHEART.

100
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,041
- RIN A SWEETHEART? THAT GUY?

101
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,666
- ( munching noisily )

102
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,208
- Mayumi: OH! IT'S NOT HERE!

103
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,750
NOT HERE. NOT HERE.
NOT HERE. MY WALLET. ARGH.

104
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,958
- IT'S NOT HERE, EITHER.
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

105
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,791
- ( groans )
SO, THIS SUCKS.

106
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,541
I GUESS IT'S A GOOD THING THAT
THERE WASN'T MUCH IN IT, HUH?

107
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,166
WELL, IT'S GONE FOR GOOD.

108
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,500
( grunts )

109
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,750
KAREHA, PLEASE.

110
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,083
DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY
YOU COULD LEND ME?

111
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,833
- SORRY. I DON'T.

112
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,333
- THEN HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO PAY FOR THAT PARFAIT?

113
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,541
- HMM.

114
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,916
OH! HEY, I THINK I KNOW HOW.

115
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,041
- I FINALLY ESCAPED
FROM SUMMER SCHOOL

116
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,708
AND NOW I'M FORCED
INTO WAITRESSING,

117
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,625
THE LOWEST FORM OF MANUAL LABOR.

118
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,333
- ( church bells ringing )

119
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,541
- OH, DEAR GOD,
I HUMBLY BEG THEE,

120
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,958
PLEASE FREE ME FROM THIS BURDEN

121
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,916
AND ALLOW ME TO ENJOY
MY SUMMER BREAK.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,958
UGH! I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

123
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,541
JUST GET IT OVER WITH AND
GET OUT OF HERE QUICK.

124
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,958
( grunting )

125
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,333
WAIT. I GUESS I DIDN'T NEED
TO TAKE EVERYTHING OFF, DID I?

126
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,708
BUT, HAD TO PSYCH
MYSELF UP SOMEHOW.

127
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,708
SINCE I'VE GOTTA WEAR SOMETHING
FRILLY LIKE THIS THING.

128
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,625
- ( munching noisily )

129
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,875
- UH, HEY, MAYUMI?

130
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,333
- WHAT? OH! YES?

131
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,750
- OH, MY. THAT UNIFORM,
IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

132
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,166
- YOU REALLY THINK SO? BUT...

133
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,291
- WELL, IT DOES LOOK LIKE

134
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,291
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE
ON THE SMALL SIDE.

135
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,750
BUT THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.
YOU STILL LOOK ADORABLE IN IT.

136
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,291
- REALLY? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

137
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,708
- OF COURSE I AM.

138
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,750
JUST COME ON OUT AND
JOIN ME WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

139
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,666
- JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES.

140
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,083
OKAY?

141
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,500
- Woman: KAREHA, ORDERS ARE
STARTING TO STACK UP.

142
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,583
- OH, OKAY,
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

143
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,833
WELL, TIME'S UP.
WE'VE GOTTA HUSTLE.

144
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,458
- OH, NOW? BUT... OH.

145
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,958
THIS IS BAD. THIS IS BAD.

146
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,708
THIS IS SO SERIOUSLY BAD!

147
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,541
WHAT AM I GONNA DO? WAIT!
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT?

148
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,250
THEY'RE ALL LOOKING AT ME.

149
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,458
OH, NO! DO THEY...

150
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,791
DO THEY NOTICE I'M NOT
WEARING ANY PANTIES?

151
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,500
- HEY, SO WHO'S THE NEW GIRL?

152
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,791
- YEAH, KAREHA.
SHE'S REALLY CUTE.

153
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,291
- ( Mayumi exhales )

154
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,541
- Woman: MAYUMI, TABLE 3 IS
READY TO ORDER. COME ON.

155
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,208
- Mayumi: I'M ON IT.

156
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,083
- MAY I...

157
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,125
( gasps )

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,833
CRAP.

159
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,541
UH...

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,375
MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER?

161
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,583
( giggles nervously )

162
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,250
- UH...

163
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,916
- THIS IS BAD.
PULL IT TOGETHER QUICK, GIRL,

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,458
BEFORE THEY NOTICE
YOU'RE NOT WEARING PANTIES.

165
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,791
YOUR ORDERS, SIRS?

166
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,000
- Men: WHOA!

167
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,250
- Mayumi: I REMEMBER READING
THAT BACK IN THE OLD DAYS,

168
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,625
UPPER CLASS WOMEN WOULD

169
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,000
WALK WITH BOOKS BALANCED
PRECARIOUSLY ON THEIR HEADS.

170
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,666
THIS TAUGHT THEM HOW
TO CARRY THEMSELVES

171
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,291
WITH BOTH GRACE AND POISE.

172
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,708
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

173
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,083
I HAVE TO CHANNEL
THIS GRACE AND POISE.

174
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,833
I HAVE TO KEEP MY BODY STRAIGHT.

175
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,666
I HAVE TO CARRY MYSELF LIKE A
YOUNG LADY OF THE UPPER CLASS.

176
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,708
- ( glass shattering )
- ( Man groans )

177
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,500
- OW, HOT.
- I'LL GET THAT, SIR.

178
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,583
- UH!

179
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,458
- UH! OH, STUPID!

180
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,291
- DON'T WORRY. I'LL WIPE IT UP.

181
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,666
( groans )

182
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,000
- UH, I'M SO SORRY, MISS.
MY HAND JUST SLIPPED.

183
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,916
- OH, GOD, WHAT DID I
DO TO DESERVE THIS?

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,958
- OH-LA-LA.
WOW, WHAT A MESS.

185
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,458
- HERE, I'LL CLEAN THAT UP.
- THANK YOU!

186
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,083
- I'LL DO THAT AND
YOU CAN DO THIS. OKAY?

187
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,958
- DO WHAT?

188
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,500
- THAT LIGHT WENT OUT,

189
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,791
SO I NEED YOU TO SCURRY
UP THERE AND CHANGE IT.

190
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,208
- ( crying )

191
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,583
- ( bell dinging )

192
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,166
- Mayumi: THANKS. COME AGAIN.

193
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:59,750
MAN, I NEVER IMAGINED BEING A
WAITRESS WOULD BE THIS TOUGH.

194
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,833
- Masato: LADY,
YOU'VE GOT LIGHT BLUE.

195
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,208
- NO, NO, NO.
YOU BAD, LITTLE BOY.

196
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,125
- Woman: MASATO, STOP THAT.

197
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,958
- UGH. THAT KID AT TABLE 5 IS...

198
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,708
- ( laughs )

199
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,083
- OH, NO.

200
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,416
- Woman: MAYUMI, TABLE 5.
LET'S GO.

201
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,416
- WHA!

202
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,375
AH, HERE YOU GO, FOLKS.

203
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,833
ONE HOT LEMON TEA
AND ONE CREAM SODA.

204
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:31,791
WITH BOTH OF MY HANDS FULL, I'VE
GOT NO WAY TO DEFEND MYSELF.

205
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,208
THAT LITTLE PERV.
HE'S GOT THE ADVANTAGE.

206
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,375
IF I MAKE THE FIRST MOVE,
I'M GONNA LOSE.

207
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,541
- HEY, LADY.
- HUH?

208
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,666
- HURRY UP! I'M THIRSTY!

209
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,041
- UH, OKAY.

210
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,166
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

211
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,291
( sighs )

212
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,000
BOY, THAT WAS CLOSE.

213
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,208
WELL, I GUESS AT HIS AGE, FOOD
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN GIRLS.

214
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,041
- Kareha: WELCOME!

215
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,583
- ( wind blows )

216
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,583
- ( people gasping )

217
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,458
- ( exclaiming )

218
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,833
( screams )

219
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,041
- ( Eustoma snoring )

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,458
- ( sighs )

221
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,208
TODAY WASN'T MY DAY.

222
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,041
UH, TSUCHIMI.

223
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,875
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD?

224
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,666
- HERE, THESE ARE FOR YOU.

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,375
- IT'S MY WALLET, IT MUST
HAVE FALLEN OUT WHEN WE...

226
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,250
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

227
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,541
- YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
TO BRING IT TO ME?

228
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,375
- WELL, YOU NEED IT, DON'T YOU?

229
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,791
- YEAH, I DO, BUT...

230
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,000
- WELL, I MADE SURE
IT GOT TO YA, SEE? TAKE CARE.

231
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,500
- HEY, RIN. HOLD ON.

232
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,583
- HMM?

233
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,333
- THANKS SO MUCH.

234
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,375
- SURE.

235
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,291
- OKAY, NOW I SEE IT.

236
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,333
HOW A GIRL COULD FALL FOR HIM.

237
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,833
OH, WAIT. WHAT'S THIS HERE?

238
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,666
HOW...

239
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,791
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

240
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,583
- Nadeshiko: ALL RIGHT, CLASS,

241
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,583
SUMMER SCHOOL IS
NOW OFFICIALLY OVER.

242
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,333
- YAY! I DID IT!

243
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,750
- I HOPE ALL OF YOU ENJOY
THE REST OF YOUR SUMMER BREAK.

244
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,208
HAVE FUN, BUT DON'T GO
TOO CRAZY, OKAY, YOU GUYS?

245
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,666
- GOTCHA. BYE, MISS N.

246
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,208
- WAIT. I'M NOT DONE YET. HEY!

247
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,000
DON'T FORGET TO DO YOUR
SUMMER BREAK HOMEWORK,

248
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,250
OR I'LL MAKE YOU
SQUAT HOP FOR 50 LAPS.

249
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,291
- 'KAY.

250
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,500
- HUH?

251
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,583
YES?

252
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,166
- CAN I GET YOUR ADVICE?

253
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,583
- YOU WANNA BE LIKE ME?

254
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,083
- WELL, YEAH.

255
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,500
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE SO COOL.

256
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,041
ALL THE GUYS WANNA BE WITH YOU,

257
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,625
ALL THE GIRLS WANNA
BE YOU AND, I JUST...

258
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,416
I WANT THAT.
I WANNA BE POPULAR.

259
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,000
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
HELP ME, PLEASE, I...

260
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,458
- WAIT, STOP RIGHT THERE.

261
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,375
LISTEN, BEING POPULAR ISN'T
WHAT IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE.

262
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,750
- WHAT?

263
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,000
- SURE, AN ATTRACTIVE
WOMAN IS POPULAR WITH MEN,

264
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,625
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THEY'RE NICE MEN.

265
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,125
ALL YOU EVER GET
ARE THE KIND OF MEN

266
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,416
WHO ARE ONLY ATTRACTED
TO YOUR LOOKS,

267
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,541
AND NEVER TO WHAT'S INSIDE YOU.

268
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,208
INSTEAD OF BEING POPULAR,

269
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,500
FIND A GUY WHO WILL FALL
IN LOVE WITH THE REAL YOU.

270
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,708
- REAL ME?

271
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,041
- LOOK, BEING POPULAR
MEANS BEING LIKED BY

272
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,416
LOTS OF STRANGE GUYS THAT
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MET.

273
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,000
YOU WANTED MY ADVICE,
SO HERE IT IS, OKAY?

274
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,291
STOP TRYING TO ATTRACT
THE ATTENTION OF STRANGERS,

275
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,583
AND GO AFTER SOMEONE
YOU KNOW AND LIKE.

276
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,166
A NICE GUY, FOR INSTANCE.

277
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,916
A NICE GUY, RIGHT.

278
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,916
- ( laughing )

279
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,958
- Sia: RIN.
- Rin: RIGHT HERE.

280
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,916
- WELL, AT LEAST
SOMEONE'S HAPPY.

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,208
- ( munching noisily )

282
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,583
- HUH?

283
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
THAT AIRHEAD.

284
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,250
SHE'S GONNA BE IN TROUBLE
WITHOUT HER LITTLE PURSE.

285
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,625
- Rin: MISS NA?

286
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,208
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

287
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,500
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE
MAYUMI LOST HER WALLET.

288
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,750
- MAYUMI?

289
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,708
UH, I GUESS IT MUST'VE
HAPPENED WHEN WE...

290
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,333
- UH, WHEN YOU WHAT?

291
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,708
- UH, IT'S UH, NOTHING.

292
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,458
HERE, I'LL TAKE IT TO HER.

293
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,625
- SO WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND MAYUMI?

294
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,291
- OH, NOTHING. I PROMISE.

295
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,375
- RIN AND MAYUMI
WERE PLAYING DOCTOR.

296
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,583
- QUIET, PRIUMLA.

297
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,916
- DOCTOR? TSUCHIMI!

298
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,916
- ( munching noisily )

299
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,958
- Nadeshiko: HONESTLY,
IF IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT,

300
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,625
HE SHOULD HAVE SAID
SO AT THE BEGINNING.

301
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,166
BUT NO, HE HAD TO
TRY AND COVER IT UP.

302
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,375
( sighs )

303
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,083
- Man: HEY, BABY,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

304
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,750
WHAT SAY, YOU AND ME
GET OUT OF THIS HEAT?

305
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,000
- TWO POINTS.
- HUH?

306
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,916
- I HEAR HUNDREDS
OF PICK UP LINES,

307
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,291
AND I GRADE THEM ON
THEIR ORIGINALITY.

308
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,958
NORMALLY, YOU'D GET ZERO POINTS,

309
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,291
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU TWO POINTS

310
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,583
JUST FOR MAKING AN EFFORT
IN THIS SCORCHING HEAT.

311
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,791
GET LOST!

312
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,083
- HEY, DON'T BE LIKE THAT, BABY.

313
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,333
I'M SURE THAT YOU AND ME
COULD HAVE LOTS OF FUN.

314
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,416
UH...

315
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,750
- HOLD THAT STILL.

316
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,416
- ( gasps )

317
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,500
- I CAN DO TWO AT ONCE.

318
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,208
AND I'M WORKING ON DOING
THREE AT THE SAME TIME.

319
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,375
- ( exclaims in fear )

320
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,166
- I TAKE IT BACK.
ZERO POINTS, LOSER!

321
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,166
- Itsuki: NICE BUNS.
ARE YOU A BAKER?

322
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,791
- Forbesii: ( chuckles )
SOMEONE BETTER CALL HEAVEN.

323
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,875
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
AN ANGEL MISSING.

324
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,625
- ( sighs ) FIFTEEN POINTS.

325
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,750
( gasps )

326
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,791
- ( Both gasp )

327
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,958
- ITSUKI.

328
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,666
FIFTY LAPS AROUND THE SCHOOL
GROUNDS DRAGGING A TIRE,

329
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,458
OR THIRTY ROUND TRIPS
SQUAT HOPPING THE STAIRS.

330
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,208
WHICH DO YOU PREFER?

331
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,791
- ( Eustoma snoring )

332
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,250
- Nadeshiko: TELL ME, ASA.

333
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,625
WHY IS IT THAT ALL THE MEN
I MEET ARE SO DISAPPOINTING?

334
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,250
- Asa: OH, COME ON.
THEY CAN'T ALL BE THAT BAD.

335
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,625
MAYBE IT'S NOT THEM.

336
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,291
MAYBE YOUR STANDARDS ARE
JUST TOO HIGH. YOU KNOW?

337
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,916
- SO, WHAT DID YOU MAKE
FOR YOUR CLUB TODAY?

338
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,833
- SOME HOMEMADE SAUSAGES.

339
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,500
- OH, YUMMY. GIVE ME ONE.

340
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,833
- WELL, THEY DON'T
REALLY LIKE IT

341
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,416
WHEN YOU BRING IN OUTSIDE
FOOD HERE, BUT, SURE.

342
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,791
- THANKS, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

343
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,875
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO
NO ONE IS EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR.

344
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,416
- OKAY, SURE.

345
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,791
BUT TELL ME, JUST WHAT KIND
OF MAN ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

346
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,583
- JUST A REGULAR GUY,
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

347
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,375
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING
MORE THAN THAT.

348
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,291
WOW, THIS IS GOOD.

349
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,333
- A REGULAR GUY?
THAT IS A PRETTY HIGH STANDARD.

350
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,083
PLUS, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND A GUY LIKE THAT.

351
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,791
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M IN
ANY KIND OF A RUSH OR ANYTHING.

352
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,541
- OH, WAIT.
COME TO THINK OF IT,

353
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,666
THERE MIGHT BE ONE NORMAL
GUY OUT THERE I KNOW.

354
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,458
- YEAH? WHO?

355
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,625
- Kareha: THANK YOU.
PLEASE COME AGAIN.

356
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,750
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, SIR.

357
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,333
OH, HEY, RIN.

358
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,500
- HELLO, RIN.

359
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,041
- OH, RIN,
SO DID YOU SEE MAYUMI?

360
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,208
- NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO FIND HER.

361
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,125
- OH, IF YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR MAYUMI,

362
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,125
SHE WAS WORKING HERE
A LITTLE EARLIER.

363
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,958
- All: HUH?

364
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,250
- Kareha: YOU JUST MISSED HER.

365
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,958
HEY, WILL ANY OF YOU
BE SEEING HER LATER?

366
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,625
SHE FORGOT SOMETHING. MAYBE YOU
COULD GIVE IT TO HER FOR ME?

367
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,083
- NOT AGAIN.

368
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,291
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME SHE
FORGOT SOMETHING HERE, TOO?

369
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,833
- UH-HUH, AND IT'S
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

370
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,583
- IT WASN'T NECESSARY
FOR YOU TO COME.

371
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,708
I COULD HAVE DELIVERED THOSE
THINGS TO HER MYSELF, YOU KNOW.

372
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,083
- OH, YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S
TRUE, BUT IT'S OKAY.

373
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,875
I TOLD KAREHA
I'D DO THIS FOR HER.

374
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,416
SO, I DON'T MIND.

375
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,875
- ALL RIGHT.

376
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,875
ARE THINGS GOING WELL?

377
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,041
- HUH?

378
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,333
OH, YEAH.

379
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,125
- REALLY? THAT'S GOOD.

380
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,208
- IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S NOT HOME.

381
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,333
I DON'T MIND WALKING
AROUND AND WAITING.

382
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,791
- WHAT ABOUT HER PARENTS?

383
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,625
COULDN'T YOU JUST LEAVE
THOSE THINGS WITH THEM?

384
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,208
- WELL, I'VE COME THIS FAR.

385
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,750
SO I'D RATHER GIVE THEM
TO HER IN PERSON.

386
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,541
ESPECIALLY SINCE
THEY'RE IMPORTANT.

387
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,541
- ALL RIGHT. JUST BE
CAREFUL GETTING HOME.

388
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,625
- SURE.

389
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,541
- ( answering machine beeps )

390
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,708
- Automated voice:
YOU HAVE ONE MESSAGE.

391
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,666
- HI, HONEY, IT'S MOM.
HOW ARE YOU?

392
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,791
ARE YOU STILL EXERCISING?
HAVE YOU BEEN EATING RIGHT?

393
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,375
- YES AND YES, MOM.

394
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,958
- TRUST ME, IF YOU DON'T
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

395
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,583
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU'LL PAY
FOR IT WHEN YOU GET OLDER.

396
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,666
- MMM-HMM.

397
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,166
- HAVE YOU MET ANY NICE MEN?

398
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,083
- NOT YET.
- YOU'RE GETTING TO THAT AGE

399
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,583
WHERE YOU NEED TO START
THINKING ABOUT SETTLING DOWN.

400
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,583
A FRIEND OF MINE JUST GAVE ME
A PICTURE OF HER SON,

401
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,875
AND I JUST MAILED IT TO YOU.

402
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,750
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
PROBABLY THINKING,

403
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,708
BUT JUST KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

404
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,291
MY FRIEND SAYS HE'S
SUCCESSFUL AND SINGLE.

405
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,541
DOESN'T HE LOOK LIKE
A NICE YOUNG MAN?

406
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,458
NOW, I KNOW PLENTY OF COUPLES
WHO'VE MET ON BLIND DATES

407
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,166
AND LATER GOTTEN MARRIED.

408
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,083
OKAY, CALL ME WHEN YOU
HAVE A CHANCE. LOVE YOU.

409
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,541
- Automated voice:
END OF MESSAGE.

410
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,791
- ( exhales )

411
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,791
- Automated voice:
MESSAGE DELETED.

412
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,250
- ( humming )

413
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,541
( laughs )

414
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,291
- THANK YOU, SIR.
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

415
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,666
WELCOME. THANK YOU.

416
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,125
- Kid: ( chuckles ) TAKE THAT.

417
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,750
- HEY, YOU LITTLE BRATS,
YOU BETTER KNOCK THAT OFF.

418
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,875
GET DRESSED, OR I'M GONNA THROW
YOU OUT WITH THE BATH WATER.

419
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,125
- GOTCHA!
- HEY, THAT HURT!

420
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,458
- UH. MISS NA?

421
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,750
- OH, I GUESS YOU'RE
CLOSED, HUH?

422
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,291
- YEAH.

423
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:18,375
- WELL, OKAY, I'LL JUST,
COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME.

424
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,166
- MISS NA!

425
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,583
I'M GOING IN MYSELF.
WANNA JOIN ME?

426
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,958
( sighs ) THIS FEELS SO GOOD.

427
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,208
- YEAH, A NICE BATH ALWAYS
SEEMS TO WASH AWAY

428
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,375
THE STRESS IN MY LIFE.

429
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,833
- DO YOU GET STRESSED OUT,
TOO, MISS NA?

430
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:51,583
- OH, WELL OF COURSE. AND PARTLY
BECAUSE OF YOU UNRULY STUDENTS.

431
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,291
- ( giggles )

432
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,416
THE ONLY THING THAT
COULD MAKE LIFE BETTER

433
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,291
IS IF THERE WERE A NICE
GUY IN IT RIGHT NOW.

434
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,625
- WELL, THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

435
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,208
UNFORTUNATELY, NICE
GUYS ARE USUALLY TAKEN.

436
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,458
- I SUPPOSE SO.

437
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,083
- ( water bubbling )

438
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,041
( gasps )

439
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,291
- Both: HEY, NICE GUYS,
WHERE ARE YOU?

440
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,958
( laughing )

441
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,750
- ( theme song playing )

442
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

443
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,125
- Sia: I FOUND A
RHINOCEROS BEETLE.

444
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,000
- Rin: WOW.
AT THE END OF SUMMER, TOO.

445
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,125
- Nerine: AREN'T YOU
AFRAID OF IT?

446
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,708
- Sia: NO! THEY'RE COOL.

447
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,416
THE LARVAE MIGHT LOOK GROSS,
BUT THEY'RE REALLY NUTRITIOUS.

448
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,750
- Rin: NUTRITIOUS?
- Nerine: NUTRITIOUS?

449
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,000
- Sia: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE,

450
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,291
EPISODE 12, FROZEN SUMMER.

451
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,875
- Rin: DON'T TELL ME
YOU EAT THOSE THINGS?

452
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,291
- Sia: YEAH. WHY NOT?
