1
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,166
- Nerine: THAT'S THE
RESEARCH LAB.

2
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,208
- SO, THAT'S WHERE
PRIMULA IS, HUH?

3
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,291
- WHAT A DESOLATE PLACE
THIS IS.

4
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,041
- IT HAD TO BE, DUE TO
THE DANGER OF THE RESEARCH.

5
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,125
- WELL, RIN?

6
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,083
- YEAH, LET'S GO.
PRIMULA'S WAITING.

7
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,875
- SO, YOU ACTUALLY CAME.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

8
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,750
- WE'RE ALL HERE
TO SEE PRIMULA.

9
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,666
- AND WHAT IF WE SAY NO?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,458
- YOU WOULDN'T DARE FORCE YOUR
WAY PAST THE KING OF THE GODS

11
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,916
AND THE KING OF THE DEMONS,
WOULD YOU? WELL?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,750
- DON'T DO THIS, FATHER.

13
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,916
- RIN'S NOT YOUR ENEMY.
HE JUST WANTS TO SEE PRIMULA.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,875
- AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOUR MAJESTIES, YOU...

15
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,500
YOU HAVE TO LET RIN SEE RIMU.

16
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,625
PLEASE.

17
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,666
- ( Eustoma laughing )

18
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,500
THAT'S OUR RIN FOR YOU.

19
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:41,083
HE'S A BRAVE ONE. NO WONDER
SIA WANTS HIM FOR HER HUSBAND.

20
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,416
- WELL, SHIN? SHALL WE?

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,416
- AS IF WE HAVE A CHOICE.

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,708
BOTH OF US ARE PUSHOVERS
WHEN IT COMES TO OUR DAUGHTERS.

23
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,208
- THANKS, DAD.
- THANKS, FATHER.

24
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:54,041
- WE NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY
NO TO THEM, HAVE WE? COME.

25
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,291
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

26
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,208
- OH, DON'T THANK US.
THANK OUR DAUGHTERS.

27
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,083
- WELL, PRIMULA'S WAITING
FOR US INSIDE.

28
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,083
- THANK YOU.

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,666
- IS ALL THIS
SECURITY NECESSARY?

30
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,250
- YES, UNFORTUNATELY.
WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.

31
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,250
EVEN THE WALLS
HAVE BEEN FORTIFIED.

32
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,958
THEY MIGHT LOOK LIKE STONE,

33
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,708
BUT THEY'VE BEEN IMBUED WITH
POWERFUL PROTECTIVE MAGIC.

34
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,625
- THE LAST TIME WE TRIED
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

35
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,458
THE LAB WAS BLOWN TO BITS.

36
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,875
IF THAT HAPPENS AGAIN,

37
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,708
THEY'LL BE MOPPING WHAT'S
LEFT OF US OFF THE WALLS.

38
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,916
- THAT'S GROSS, DAD.
DON'T JOKE AROUND LIKE THAT.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,375
- FOR ONCE, YOUR FATHER'S
NOT JOKING, SIA.

40
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,375
THIS IS A VERY
DANGEROUS SITUATION,

41
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,541
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE
DID NOT WANT ANY OF YOU TO COME.

42
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:57,750
- EVEN SO, I COULDN'T JUST SIT
BACK AND NEVER SEE RIMU AGAIN.

43
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,625
- I SEE.
THAT'S SO LIKE YOU, RIN.

44
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,458
- Eustoma: YES, IT IS.
HOWEVER, THAT'S ALSO THE REASON

45
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,083
WHY WE NEED YOU TO
PROMISE US SOMETHING.

46
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,250
- Rin: WHAT'S THAT?

47
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,666
- Forbesii: WELL, IF PRIMULA'S
CONDITION SHOULD HAPPEN

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,666
TO WORSEN WHILE YOU'RE HERE,

49
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,458
THEN YOU'LL ALLOW US TO
IMPLEMENT OUR FINAL SOLUTION

50
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,250
AS A LAST RESORT.

51
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,833
- BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT...

52
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,541
- IT MEANS THAT WE'LL HAVE TO
RESET PRIMULA'S EMOTIONS.

53
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,291
- FATHER, NO! YOU CAN'T!

54
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,375
- THIS IS THE ONE THING
WE NEED YOU TO ABIDE BY

55
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,041
IF WE ALLOW YOU TO SEE HER.

56
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,916
- LOOK, RIN, THIS IS DANGEROUS.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
YOU DON'T WANT SIA, NERINE,

58
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,375
OR THE LITTLE MISSY TO
GET HURT NOW, DO YOU?

59
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,458
- FORGET IT, RIN.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

60
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,708
I'LL BE FINE
AS LONG AS I'M WITH YOU.

61
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,666
- THAT GOES FOR ME
AND NERINE, TOO.

62
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,000
- Rin: IT'S OKAY.
YOU HAVE MY PROMISE.

63
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,833
- RIN, WAIT, BUT...

64
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,125
- WHAT THEY'RE ASKING
ISN'T UNREASONABLE.

65
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,625
- BUT...

66
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,708
- EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.
WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE FAITH.

67
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,125
- IN MIRACLES, RIN?

68
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,458
- NO, SIR. IN OUR BOND WITH HER.

69
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,416
- SIRES, WE'VE BEEN
EXPECTING YOU.

70
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,291
- GOOD. OPEN THE DOOR.
- YES.

71
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,500
- CAN SHE HEAR ME?

72
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,625
- RIMU.

73
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,875
- PRIMULA?

74
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,625
PRIMULA!

75
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,375
- SHE'S BEEN LIKE THIS
THE ENTIRE TIME.

76
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,916
WE'VE TRIED
DIFFERENT TREATMENTS,

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,250
BUT SO FAR, NOTHING'S
PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE.

78
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,375
- SO NOTHING'S WORKED AT ALL.

79
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,916
I WAS HOPING MAYBE
THERE WOULD BE A SLIM CHANCE.

80
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,083
- PRIMULA!

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,791
- Kaede: RIMU.
- PRIMULA.

82
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,125
- OH, RIN...

83
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,291
- KAEDE.
- PLEASE.

84
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,625
- PRIMULA!

85
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,666
- OPEN YOUR EYES.
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR US!

86
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,708
- PRIMULA.

87
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,833
- I'M REALLY SORRY, RIN.
THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ANY OF YOU.

88
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,166
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE...
- BUT IF SHE'S ALIVE...

89
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,500
- WHAT?

90
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,666
...THEN JUST MAYBE SHE CAN HEAR
WHAT WE'RE SAYING.

91
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,875
THERE'S A BOND BETWEEN US,
ALL OF US.

92
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,833
TOGETHER, WE'RE ONE BIG FAMILY.

93
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,625
- RIN.

94
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,208
BUT OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN MISSING
ONE OF ITS MEMBERS, THOUGH.

95
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,833
WE'VE ALL MISSED YOU, PRIMULA.

96
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,833
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK TO US,
ALL RIGHT?

97
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:40,375
SO, LET'S JUST GO HOME,
TO OUR HOME, OKAY?

98
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,750
YOUR HOME. DO YOU HEAR ME?

99
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,416
- WHAT?
- WHAT WAS THAT?

100
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,625
- SHE CAN HEAR US.
- RIN.

101
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,166
RIN.

102
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ME. IT'S RIN.

103
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,375
- RIN.

104
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,375
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN.

105
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,833
SHE'S BEEN COMATOSE SINCE...

106
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,791
- SHIN, DO YOU KNOW?

107
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,583
- YEAH. I KNOW. IT'S A MIRACLE.

108
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,958
- PRIMULA.
- RIMU.

109
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,875
( screaming )

110
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,708
- MISSY.

111
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,666
- NERINE! SIA!

112
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,625
- WHAT THE...

113
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,375
- POWER LEVELS ARE RISING FAST.

114
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,083
JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECT NUMBER ONE.

115
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,958
- WELL THEN, DO SOMETHING.

116
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,125
- THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE
IS TO RESET, SIRES.

117
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,583
- DAMN.
- RIN.

118
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,166
- RIN, DON'T GET UP. STAY DOWN.

119
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,125
- IT'S JUST AS I EXPECTED.
MIRACLES DON'T HAPPEN SO EASILY.

120
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,708
- PRIMULA.

121
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,166
- THIS IS OUR ONLY OPTION.
FORGIVE ME, RIN.

122
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,625
- NO. PLEASE WAIT.
- WE CAN'T.

123
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,833
- I'M BEGGING YOU.

124
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,708
NOT AGAIN.

125
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,833
I WON'T LOSE PRIMULA AGAIN!

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,916
PRIMULA!

127

HOW TO SING THAT?

- HERE. I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.

143

YOU HAVE TO GO
BACK TO, REMEMBER?

- EVERYONE, SHE'S AWAKE NOW.

149

150
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,958
- IT'S OKAY. WE'RE ALL HERE.

151
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,375
- WATCH OUT.

152
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,083
THAT CHAMBER IS THE ONLY THING
HOLDING HER ENERGY BACK.

153

I'M REALLY SORRY, RIN,
BUT WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER!

158
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,833
- NOW'S YOUR CHANCE, RIN.

159
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,041
- PRIMULA.
- RIN.

160
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,958
- PRIMULA.
- RIMU!

161
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,083
- RIMU!

162
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,083
- RIMU, COME BACK!

163
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,833
- RIN.

164
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,583
- RIN.

165
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,125
- RIMU. YOU'RE BACK.

166
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,166
- RIN.

167
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,291
- SHE'S LEARNED
TO CONTROL HER MAGIC.

168
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,625
- WELL, RIN. THANK YOU.

169
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,250
- UH, NERINE?
- I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, RIMU.

170
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,208
- NO, ITS... LYCORIS?

171
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,500
- LYCORIS?

172
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,416
- I'M GLAD I COULD SEE YOU,
ONE LAST TIME.

173
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,083
- HUH?
- GOODBYE NOW, RIN.

174
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,958
- BIG SIS. DON'T GO.

175
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,583
- RINA.

176
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,083
- LYCORIS.

177
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,958
- GOODBYE, BIG SIS. I LOVE YOU.

178
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,208
- SO, TELL US WHAT THAT MEANS.

179
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,583
- IT MEANS THAT SHE'S PROBABLY
IN NO DANGER OF LOSING CONTROL.

180
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,041
- ALL RIGHT! ( laughs )

181
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,916
WE WERE WORRIED. SO MUCH.
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,958
- THAT'S ONE WAY TO SAY 'HI.'
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

183
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,041
- IT'S BEEN A HAPPY DAY
FOR ALL OF US, HASN'T IT?

184
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,708
- Researcher: ...BUT PERHAPS
IN UNDERGOING THAT CHANGE,

185
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,458
HER MAGIC GREW OUT OF CONTROL.

186
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,125
CONSIDER IT A TEMPORARY GLITCH.

187
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,041
- A TEMPORARY GLITCH?

188
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,708
THAT'S AN INTERESTING WAY
TO PUT IT.

189
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,625
IT COULD HAVE BLOWN US
TO PIECES, CORRECT?

190
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,250
- YES. IN FACT,
I'M AMAZED WE'RE STILL HERE.

191
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,208
THE ODDS OF SURVIVING WILD MAGIC
ARE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT.

192
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,083
- MAYBE MIRACLES DO EXIST.

193
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,541
REGARDLESS, THAT'S TWICE NOW

194
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,541
THAT GIRL HAS SAVED
US FROM DISASTER.

195
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,166
- SIRES, DO YOU REALIZE THAT

196
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,541
WE FINALLY HAVE A PERFECT
TEST SUBJECT NOW?

197
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,791
IN HER CURRENT STATE,

198
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,916
WE CAN RESTART PROJECT
YGGDRASIL WITH PRIMULA!

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,708
- NO, WE'RE TAKING
PRIMULA BACK HOME.

200
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,750
- YOU CAN'T. DON'T BE ABSURD.

201
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,833
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH TIME AND EFFORT

202
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,458
HAVE GONE INTO THIS PROJECT?

203
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,000
WE CAN'T LET THE FEELINGS
OF ONE HUMAN DERAIL IT.

204
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,041
UH, RIGHT, SIRES?

205
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,958
- WE GIVE UP. AGAIN.

206
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,916
- YOU HAVE OUR PERMISSION, RIN.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,541
TAKE PRIMULA BACK
TO THE HUMAN WORLD.

208
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,041
- EVEN IF WE KEPT HER HERE,
WE HAVE NO GUARANTEE

209
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,833
THAT PRIMULA'S MAGIC WON'T
GO OUT OF CONTROL AGAIN.

210
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,833
- EXACTLY. AND IF IT DID
AND RIN WASN'T HERE,

211
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,541
WE'D HAVE NO WAY OF STOPPING IT.
- BUT, SIRES...

212
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,791
- IF PRIMULA CAN GAIN A
RICHER RANGE OF EMOTIONS

213
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,375
BY LIVING IN THE HUMAN WORLD,

214
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,250
THEN THAT MEANS SHE'LL
BE ABLE TO CONTROL

215
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,666
HER MAGIC EVEN BETTER.

216
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,416
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MABOH.
UNTIL SHE GETS TO THAT POINT,

217
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,375
THE SAFEST PLACE FOR HER
IS WITH RIN.

218
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,500
THERE, IT'S SETTLED.

219
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,291
- WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT, RIN,

220
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,666
JUST TAKE GOOD CARE
OF PRIMULA FOR US.

221
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,583
- I WILL. THANK YOU. PRIMULA!

222
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:52,083
- ( laughing )
THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT DAY.

223
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,666
( slurring ) I THINK
IT CALLS FOR A LITTLE DRINK.

224
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,541
- NOT ANOTHER ONE!
DAD, YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH!

225
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,958
- ( slurring ) COME ON, SIA,
DON'T BE UPTIGHT. OKAY?

226
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,125
CARE FOR SOME, RIN?
- UH, NO.

227
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,750
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, OUR SAKE'S
NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

228
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,041
FINE, MORE FOR ME!
- ( Sia grunts )

229
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,333
YOU'VE HAD TOO MUCH, DAD!

230
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,083
- I'VE GOT MORE SNACKS,
YOU GUYS!

231
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,583
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT
OUT HERE?

232
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,958
- JUST LOOKING AT
THE STARS, RIMU.

233
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,833
AND WONDERING WHICH ONE
IS LYCORIS' STAR.

234
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,416
- HER STAR? WHY?

235
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,708
- TODAY WAS THE SECOND TIME
I WASN'T ABLE TO THANK HER,

236
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,208
AND THE SECOND TIME
I WASN'T ABLE TO SAY GOODBYE.

237
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,583
SHE'S DONE SO MUCH FOR ME,
BUT I...

238
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,958
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
FOR HER IN RETURN.

239
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:49,250
- THAT'S NOT TRUE. SHE KNOWS.
I'M SURE BIG SIS LYCORIS KNOWS.

240
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,458
- YOU'RE RIGHT. I HOPE.

241
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,291
- Asa: REALLY? THAT'S GREAT.

242
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,333
- NERINE, SIA, AND KAEDE WERE
SUCH A BIG HELP TO ME.

243
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:09,333
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT THEM, AND THIS RIBBON.

244
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,125
WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY
TIMES IT ENCOURAGED ME.

245
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,375
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR IT, ASA.

246
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,625
- YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

247
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,500
- OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.
YOU'RE TOO NICE.

248
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,583
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
ALL I DID WAS LOAN YOU A RIBBON.

249
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,333
- NO, IT REALLY MEANT A LOT.

250
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,500
WHEN THINGS GOT TENSE,
HAVING THAT RIBBON WAS LIKE

251
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,875
HAVING YOU THERE SAYING,
"GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!"

252
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,250
ALMOST AS GOOD AS A SLAP
ON THE BACK.

253
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,375
- ( laughs ) WAS IT SCARY?
- WITH THAT RIBBON I WAS FINE.

254
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,708
IT REASSURED ME,

255
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,666
MADE ME FEEL LIKE YOU WERE
WITH ME THE ENTIRE TIME.

256
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,333
- HEY. FLATTERY WILL GET YOU
NOWHERE. YOU HEAR ME, RIN?

257
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,416
- OW. OKAY. I GET IT.
- ( laughing )

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,750
- WELL, IT APPEARS YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER, UNFORTUNATELY.

259
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,750
- YEP. I'M NOT
COMPLETELY MYSELF YET.

260
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,500
BUT I HOPE I CAN BE
BACK AT SCHOOL NEXT WEEK.

261
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,833
- HAVE YOU TRIED HEALING MAGIC?

262
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,916
- WELL, MAGIC IS A LITTLE...

263
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,500
COME ON, GUYS, I'M NOT THAT
SICK. I JUST NEED A LITTLE REST.

264
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,125
- WE JUST WANT YOU TO GET WELL.

265
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,416
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

266
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,833
- IS THAT SO? AND WHY IS THAT?

267
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:18,291
- OH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
HMM, YOU SEE...

268
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,708
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO KEEP A SECRET

269
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,666
FROM YOUR TRUSTY BIG SISTER?

270
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,833
- I GUESS IT'S JUST THAT

271
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,291
I KNOW MY LIFE IS
BETTER WITH YOU IN IT.

272
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,166
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME.
YOU'VE ALWAYS HELPED ME.

273
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,750
WHETHER IT WAS
THIS THING WITH RIMU

274
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,708
OR ANY OTHER TIME
I HAD A PROBLEM.

275
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,416
YOUR WORDS ALWAYS ENCOURAGED ME

276
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,166
AND GOT ME THROUGH THE
ROUGH TIMES IN MY LIFE, ASA.

277
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,250
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
THE BEST WAY TO SAY THIS,

278
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,375
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I APPRECIATE ALL YOU'VE DONE.

279
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,416
- SO, IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY

280
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,541
YOU SEE ME AS YOUR
LITTLE HELPER, HUH?

281
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,791
- YEAH. I GUESS SO.

282
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,125
- WELL, DON'T WORRY.

283
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,500
YOUR "LITTLE HELPER" PROMISES
TO KEEP LOOKING AFTER YOU.

284
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,208
BESIDES, SOMEONE HAS TO DO IT,

285
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,583
WHAT WITH YOU BEING
SO HOPELESS AND ALL.

286
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,458
- OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME
FOR BEING SO HOPELESS.

287
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,666
- ( laughing )

288
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,458
( coughing )
- ASA? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

289
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,208
I'LL GO GET YOU SOME WATER.

290
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,875
- UH... IF YOU'RE IN PAIN,
I COULD...

291
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,000
- NO MAGIC.

292
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,458
SORRY. I'M OKAY.

293
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,916
I JUST LAUGHED A LITTLE
TOO HARD, THAT'S ALL.

294
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
RIN WAS JUST SAYING
THOSE WEIRD THINGS.

295
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,750
WHAT'S WRONG?

296
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,166
- ASA, TELL ME...

297
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,875
I'M SORRY TO BE SO FORWARD,

298
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,250
BUT YOU HAVE FEELINGS
FOR RIN, DON'T YOU?

299
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,833
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE...

300
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,333
- WELL, NOW THAT ASA'S
FEELING BETTER

301
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,458
AND PRIMULA'S BACK WITH US,

302
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,208
IT'S LIKE A HAPPY
ENDING FOR EVERYONE.

303
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,791
SORRY. GUESS I SHOULD HAVE
SAID ALMOST EVERYONE.

304
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,375
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
SO QUIET TONIGHT, RIGHT, NERINE?

305
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,291
- WELL, NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
- HUH?

306
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,291
- CAN I HAVE A FEW MOMENTS
OF YOUR TIME?

307
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:22,208
SO. TELL ME, YOU DO REMEMBER
THIS PARK, DON'T YOU?

308
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,875
- SURE. WE MET HERE FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

309
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:30,125
- NOT QUITE. YOU SEE, YOU AND I
NEVER ACTUALLY MET AS KIDS, RIN.

310
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,958
- WAIT, WE MET EIGHT YEARS AGO
AND AGAIN RECENTLY, RIGHT?

311
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,333
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG,
WE DIDN'T MEET,

312
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,166
BECAUSE THAT DAY YOU
SAW ME SINGING HERE,

313
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,250
WELL, THAT WAS THE FIRST DAY I'D
EVER BEEN IN THE HUMAN WORLD.

314
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,458
- HUH?

315
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,375
- YOU DID MEET A GIRL
AT THIS PARK RIN,

316
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,958
BUT IT WASN'T REALLY ME.

317
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

318
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,291
- ON THAT DAY, EIGHT YEARS AGO,

319
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,958
I WAS SICK
AND COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE,

320
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,916
SO INSTEAD, LYCORIS WENT TO
THE HUMAN WORLD IN MY PLACE.

321
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,500
WHEN SHE GOT HOME,

322
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,791
SHE COULDN'T WAIT TO TELL ME THE
STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

323
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,750
AND ABOUT THE BOY SHE MET.

324
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,916
EVEN THOUGH SHE ONLY SPENT
A FEW HOURS WITH HIM,

325
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,750
SHE TREASURED EVERY SECOND.

326
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,416
THAT BOY TURNED OUT TO BE HER
ONE AND ONLY TRUE LOVE.

327
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,333
- Lycoris: HE WAS SO NICE.

328
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,375
HE PLAYED WITH ME UNTIL FATHER
FOUND ME. HIS NAME IS RIN.

329
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,125
- RIN?
- THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.

330
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,833
THAT SOUNDS KIND OF
LIKE YOUR NAME, DOESN'T IT?

331
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,416
SO, I THINK FROM NOW ON,

332
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,750
I'M GONNA CALL YOU RINA,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

333
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,333
- RINA? OKAY.

334
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,208
- YEP. THAT'S YOU.

335
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,625
IT'LL BE LIKE HE'S ALWAYS WITH
ME, EVEN IF I CAN'T SEE HIM.

336
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,666
- YOU COULD GO SEE HIM AGAIN?

337
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,583
- NO. ACTUALLY I CAN'T.

338
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,833
- WHY NOT?

339
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,708
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

340
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,000
YOU COULD SEE HIM IF YOU
EVER WENT TO THE HUMAN WORLD.

341
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,458
OH, RINA, YOU HAVE TO
MEET THIS BOY.

342
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,166
PROMISE ME YOU WILL. OKAY?

343
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,166
- SHORTLY AFTER THAT,
LYCORIS GAVE HER LIFE FOR ME.

344
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,208
- IF YOU GIVE HER MY
REMAINING LIFE ENERGY,

345
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,416
THEN SHE'LL HAVE ENOUGH
STRENGTH TO RECOVER.

346
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,125
- YES, LYCORIS WAS CLONED BY
EXTRACTING VITALITY FROM NERINE.

347
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,666
IF WE RETURN THAT ORIGINAL
LIFE FORCE TAKEN FROM HER,

348
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,833
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE HER.
- YES.

349
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,875
WAIT. IF WE DO THAT,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO...

350
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,125
- I KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN.

351
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,375
BUT ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME

352
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,375
IS SAVING THE LIFE OF
SOMEONE I CARE ABOUT.

353
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,958
- EVERY SINGLE THING THAT MADE
LYCORIS SPECIAL IS INSIDE OF ME.

354
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,000
ALL OF HER LIFE ENERGY.

355
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,166
HER MAGIC, THAT BEAUTIFUL
SINGING VOICE OF HERS,

356
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,291
AND ALL THE FEELINGS
THAT SHE FELT FOR THAT BOY.

357
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,166
- FEELINGS?

358
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,625
- HER FEELINGS FOR A BOY
NAMED RIN TSUCHIMI.

359
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,083
THAT'S WHY I DECIDED
TO LIVE AS LYCORIS.

360
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,125
TO LET THAT PART OF HER
THAT'S INSIDE ME TAKE OVER.

361
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,333
SHE GAVE ME HER LIFE,

362
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,333
SO I WANTED TO HONOR
HER FEELINGS FOR YOU.

363
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:55,416
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY
I CAME TO THE HUMAN WORLD, RIN,

364
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,250
TO MAKE HER LOVE COME TRUE.

365
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,041
BUT I... BUT I...

366
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:07,458
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT
THE FEELINGS THAT ARE INSIDE ME.

367
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,583
LYCORIS'S FEELINGS. I WONDER IF
THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE MY OWN?

368
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,041
I ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH YOU,
RIN, I REALLY DO,

369
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,125
BUT THAT'S WHAT'S GOT ME
SO CONFUSED.

370
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,916
DO I ONLY LOVE YOU BECAUSE
OF THE WAY LYCORIS FELT?

371
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,208
OR HAVE I FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH YOU MYSELF?

372
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,666
I DON'T KNOW.

373
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,625
I REALLY HAD INTENDED
TO BECOME LYCORIS, BUT...

374
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,208
BUT WHEN SHE APPEARED TO US
AT THE LAB...

375
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,458
Lycoris: WELL, RIN, THANK YOU.

376
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,375
LYCORIS' WISH TO SEE YOU AGAIN

377
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,958
HAD FINALLY BEEN FULFILLED
AND THAT'S WHEN...

378
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,208
WHEN I REALIZED SHE JUST WANTED
TO SAY THOSE FEW WORDS TO YOU

379
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,875
BEFORE SHE LEFT FOREVER.

380
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,958
- SO, DOES THAT MEAN
THAT SHE'S...

381
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,750
- YES, BUT I THINK SHE
WAS HAPPY TO SEE THE BOY

382
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,291
SHE LOVED SO MUCH
ONE MORE TIME.

383
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,416
- I SEE.

384
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,333
- SO NOW I BELIEVE
THE FEELINGS I HAVE ARE MY OWN.

385
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,791
THE LYCORIS PART OF ME
IS VANISHED.

386
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,958
BUT MY OWN LOVE REMAINS.

387
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,875
THESE FEELINGS ARE MINE
AND MINE ALONE.

388
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,166
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD,

389
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,041
MY LOVE FOR YOU IS NOT
SOMEONE ELSE'S, SO...

390
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,291
- SO?

391
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,375
- SO, I MIGHT FALL
MORE IN LOVE WITH YOU.

392
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,333
THAT IS, OF COURSE,
ONLY IF YOU'LL LET ME.

393
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,500
- WELL, I, UM... I, UH...

394
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,125
- HEY, DON'T WORRY.

395
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,125
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME
AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW.

396
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,458
FOR ALL I KNOW,

397
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,208
YOU MIGHT ALREADY HAVE A
SPECIAL GIRL IN YOUR LIFE.

398
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,416
- NO, I DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

399
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,333
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A LOT LIKE ME, RIN.

400
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,750
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR FEELINGS VERY WELL YET.

401
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,916
( laughs )

402
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,333
YOU AND I STILL HAVE A LOT OF
GROWING UP TO DO, DON'T WE?

403
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,958
AND SPEAKING OF GROWING,

404
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,708
THAT'S SOMETHING I NEED TO DO
WITH THE LOVE I FEEL FOR YOU.

405
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,625
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I LOVE YOU NOW,

406
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,416
BUT I WANT THAT LOVE
TO GROW TO THE POINT THAT...

407
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,458
WELL, TO THE POINT THAT
NO ONE LOVES YOU MORE THAN ME.

408
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,125
- I SEE.

409
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,958
- SOMEDAY I'LL BE ABLE
TO SING MY OWN SONG.

410
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,208
SO, WHEN THAT DAY COMES,
I HOPE YOU'LL LISTEN TO ME SING.

411
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,250
WILL YOU, RIN?

412
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,208
- OF COURSE. I SURE WILL.

413
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,083
- THEN THIS IS MY PROMISE TO YOU
UNTIL THEN.

414
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,791
- ( theme song playing )

415
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

416
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,625
- Sia: WE FINALLY HAVE
OUR EVERYDAY LIVES BACK,

417
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,083
BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE,

418
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,333
I FEEL THAT SOMETHING IS
DEFINITELY CHANGING.

419
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,458
AND SO AM I.

420
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,916
- Rin: WHAT'S WRONG, SIA?
YOU SEEM DOWN.

421
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,583
- Sia: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE.
EPISODE 16, "KIKYOU."

422
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,916
IT'S WRONG FOR ME
TO DO THIS ALONE? RIGHT?
