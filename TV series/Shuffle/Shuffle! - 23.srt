1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,916
- ( breathing deeply )

4
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,416
- WE'RE GOING TO NEED
AN OXYGEN MASK HERE, STAT!

5
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,541
- ON IT.

6
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,000
- SHE'S MUCH WEAKER THAN
I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED.

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,375
SHE WASN'T THIS BAD
WHEN SHE WAS IN LAST TIME.

8
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,083
- I AGREE. AND NOTHING'S
SHOWING UP IN HER BLOOD WORK.

9
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,416
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

10
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,958
- WE'RE JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO KEEP HER HERE

11
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,833
AND WATCH HER CLOSELY.

12
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,375
- EXCUSE ME?

13
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,333
- ARE YOU A MEMBER
OF HER FAMILY?

14
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,458
- WELL, NO.

15
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,166
DOCTORS?

16
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,791
CAN YOU JUST TELL ME HOW SHE IS?

17
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,750
SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY,
RIGHT, DOCTORS?

18
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,541
- IT'S HARD TO SAY FOR SURE.

19
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,666
- WHAT NOW?

20
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,166
- ASA!

21
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,666
- I WAS THERE.

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,166
AND COULDN'T HELP.

23
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,541
- ( breathing deeply )

24
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,250
- Doctor 1: THE SYMPTOMS
YOUR DAUGHTER IS EXPERIENCING

25
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,625
ARE LIKE NOTHING
WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

26
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,916
ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS
KEEP HER ON THE IV

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,833
AND UNDER CLOSE OBSERVATION.

28
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,583
BUT I'M AFRAID, IF THINGS
CONTINUE LIKE THIS...

29
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,666
- YOU THINK SHE MIGHT
NOT SURVIVE?

30
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,541
- WE'LL KNOW MORE
AFTER WE GET HER TEST RESULTS.

31
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,500
UNTIL THEN, WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT.

32
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,166
- WHAT? IS THAT ALL YOU CAN SAY?
WE HAVE TO WAIT?

33
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,541
- PLEASE, CALM DOWN.

34
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,125
- YOU'RE A DOCTOR, AREN'T YOU?

35
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,291
SO WHY AREN'T YOU DOING
ANYTHING TO MAKE HER BETTER?

36
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,583
- Ama: RIN, PLEASE.

37
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,833
- I'M SORRY, DOCTOR.

38
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,166
- HEY, RIN, LET'S CHAT
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

39
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,625
I WANTED TO THANK YOU.

40
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,666
- FOR WHAT?

41
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,583
- FOR BRINGING HER
TO THE HOSPITAL, OF COURSE.

42
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,458
FOR BEING THERE, WHENEVER
SHE NEEDED YOUR HELP.

43
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,583
IT'S NOT EASY, IS IT?

44
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,416
- NO.

45
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,750
IT'S JUST, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

46
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,166
- TELL ME SOMETHING.

47
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,416
ARE YOU IN LOVE
WITH HER YET? WELL?

48
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,041
I KNOW THAT I'VE
ASKED YOU BEFORE...

49
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,708
BUT, WELL?

50
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,458
- I LOVE HER.

51
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,750
- WONDERFUL.

52
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,125
- NOW I CAN TELL YOU.

53
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,125
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF PROJECT YGGDRASIL?

54
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,625
- YEAH, I HAVE.

55
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,750
- THAT SHOULD MAKE THIS
EASIER THEN.

56
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,791
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
THE SUBJECTS THEY USED

57
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:16,916
FOR THEIR EXPERIMENTS?

58
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,375
- YES.

59
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,541
- LOOK AT ME, RIN.

60
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,166
IT'S TIME YOU FINALLY
KNEW THE TRUTH.

61
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
- YOU'RE FROM THE WORLD
OF THE DEMONS!

62
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,166
- THIS NEEDS TO BE OUR SECRET.

63
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,333
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE, OKAY?

64
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,166
- WAIT, BUT THE KING
OF THE DEMONS SAID

65
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,916
THAT THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL
SUBJECT DIDN'T SURVIVE.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,291
- SO HE TOLD EVERYBODY THAT
I WAS DEAD ALL THIS TIME.

67
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,791
THAT REALLY DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

68
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,333
AT THAT POINT IN MY LIFE, I
WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED IT REALLY,

69
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,083
IF I HAD DIED.

70
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,791
- WHAT? BUT WHY?

71
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,083
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

72
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,375
I NEVER HAD A FAMILY

73
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,458
WHEN I LIVED IN THE WORLD
OF THE DEMONS.

74
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,500
AND EVERY DAY
I FELT TRULY ALONE.

75
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,875
SO I VOLUNTEERED
FOR THE EXPERIMENT.

76
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,708
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
GIVE ME SOME PURPOSE.

77
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,958
IT NEVER OCCURRED
TO ME TO WORRY

78
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,250
THAT THE EXPERIMENT MIGHT FAIL.

79
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,500
RISKING EVERYTHING SEEMED
BETTER THAN HAVING NOTHING.

80
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,916
I JUST NEEDED TO ESCAPE
FROM THE LIFE I HAD.

81
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,708
AND THEN, WHEN I CAME TO,

82
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,833
I FOUND MYSELF
IN THE HUMAN WORLD.

83
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,583
IT WAS BEFORE PEOPLE KNEW
THAT THE WORLD OF THE DEMONS

84
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,250
AND THE WORLD
OF THE GODS EXISTED.

85
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,166
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

86
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,000
I COULDN'T TELL ANYONE WHO I
WAS OR WHERE I CAME FROM.

87
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,333
- ( tires screeching )

88
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,250
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THAT NIGHT WOULD BE.

89
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,791
THE NIGHT I MET HIM.

90
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,666
- THIS MAN, HE'S ASA'S FATHER?

91
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,125
- MM-HMM.

92
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,125
HE'S THE PERSON I ADMIRE
MORE THAN ANYONE IN THIS WORLD.

93
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,958
- I CAN SEE WHY HE WOULD MEAN
SO MUCH TO YOU.

94
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,208
- WHEN I NEEDED SOMEONE MORE
THAN ANYTHING ELSE,

95
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,500
HE WAS THERE.

96
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,041
I AM WHO I'VE BECOME TODAY

97
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,166
BECAUSE HE WAS THERE FOR ME
AT THAT MOMENT.

98
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,291
WITH HIM I FINALLY FOUND
SOMEWHERE TO BELONG.

99
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,541
THAT ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN
ENOUGH TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

100
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,625
BUT IN THE END, HE GAVE ME
SOMETHING EVEN BETTER

101
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,250
THAN I'D EXPECTED.

102
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,083
HE GAVE ME MY ASA.

103
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,041
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT ASA'S A DEMON?

104
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,041
- NO. ASA'S A HUMAN,
LIKE HER FATHER.

105
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,583
BUT IT ISN'T THAT SIMPLE.

106
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,708
SHE INHERITED HER HUMAN BODY
FROM HER FATHER.

107
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,750
AND HER MAGIC FROM ME.

108
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,250
DUE TO THE EXPERIMENT
I WAS PUT THROUGH,

109
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,250
THE MAGIC INSIDE ASA
WAS INTENSIFIED,

110
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,583
MAKING IT TOO STRONG
FOR HER HUMAN FORM TO CONTAIN.

111
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,000
- ( moans )

112
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,250
- YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

113
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,125
- HI, RIN.

114
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,458
- HEY, ASA. WELCOME BACK.

115
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,500
- WHERE AM I?

116
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,166
- THE HOSPITAL.

117
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,875
YOU COLLAPSED
AT THE APARTMENT.

118
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,083
- OH, RIGHT.

119
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,500
THANK YOU, RIN.

120
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,458
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING HERE
WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME?

121
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,791
- I DIDN'T MIND WAITING.

122
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,166
- WELL, STOP IT.

123
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,833
I'M GONNA BE JUST FINE NOW.

124
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,291
- YOU'RE NOT READY
FOR THAT YET.

125
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,625
COME ON. STAY IN BED.

126
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,500
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG.

127
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,833
I GUESS THE MOVE
MUST HAVE TIRED ME OUT.

128
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,958
- Ama: RIGHT NOW,
THE MAGIC LIVING INSIDE HER

129
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,916
IS GETTING READY TO OVERFLOW.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,958
NOTHING ON THIS PLANET
CAN SAVE HER.

131
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,000
SHE HAS TO DO IT.

132
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,208
- RIGHT. BUT CAN'T WE
DO SOMETHING?

133
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,625
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
FOR HER TO SURVIVE THIS.

134
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,666
SHE HAS TO GET RID OF ALL
THE MAGIC THAT'S INSIDE HER.

135
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,750
- THE MAGIC.
SO THAT'S ALL SHE HAS TO DO?

136
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,958
- WELL, WAIT.

137
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,791
GETTING RID OF THE MAGIC
WON'T BE THAT EASY.

138
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,208
- ASA, PLEASE.

139
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,291
- WHAT IS IT, RIN?

140
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,250
- YOU HAVE TO USE
YOUR MAGIC, OKAY?

141
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,583
PLEASE JUST DO IT.

142
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,500
- SO YOU FOUND OUT.

143
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,083
- YOU ONLY HAVE TO USE IT ONCE.

144
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,958
AND THEN YOU'LL BE
TOTALLY CURED.

145
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,500
- THEN WE CAN JUST GO HOME!
- NO!

146
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,000
- BUT WHY NOT?

147
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,208
- I WON'T!

148
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,041
I WON'T EVER USE MY MAGIC.

149
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,458
BESIDES, IT WOULDN'T WORK
EVEN IF I DID TRY.

150
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,500
I'M A HUMAN, JUST A HUMAN!

151
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,791
- LISTEN, YOUR MOM SAID
THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY.

152
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,916
- I'M A HUMAN!

153
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,708
MAGIC IS JUST...

154
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,916
- ARE YOU OKAY?

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,166
- ( coughing )

156
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,333
- Nurse: NURSES' STATION.

157
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,375
- HURRY, PLEASE!
SOMETHING'S WRONG!

158
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,416
- YES, SIR!

159
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,416
- HANG ON, ALRIGHT?
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY!

160
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,250
- Kaede: RIN!

161
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,833
KAEDE, PRIMULA.

162
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,208
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

163
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,666
- WE CAME TO SEE ASA.
AMA CALLED.

164
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,083
- I HOPE YOU'RE ALRIGHT, RIN.

165
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,750
YOU LOOK REALLY TIRED.

166
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,833
SO, HOW'S ASA DOING?

167
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,500
RIN?

168
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,000
- SHE'S BETTER.

169
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,625
SHE'S SLEEPING RIGHT NOW.

170
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,166
DON'T WORRY.

171
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,208
SHE'LL BE UP ON HER FEET
IN NO TIME, REALLY.

172
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,333
- THAT'S GOOD.

173
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,458
PLEASE PROMISE ME
THAT YOU'LL BE CAREFUL.

174
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,666
AND DON'T LET THIS
WEAR YOU OUT, OKAY?

175
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,875
SORRY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'LL BE OKAY, TOO.

176
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,000
- I'LL BE FINE.

177
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,916
- ALRIGHT. JUST
PROMISE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,041
WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING AFTER HER?

179
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,625
- SURE.

180
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,750
- THE HOSPITAL ISN'T LETTING
ANY MORE VISITORS IN TONIGHT.

181
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,000
WHY DON'T WE
COME BACK TOMORROW?

182
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,916
- KAEDE?
- YES.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,041
- OF COURSE
WE'LL COME BACK TOMORROW.

184
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,291
AND THIS TIME WE'LL INVITE
SIA AND THE OTHERS AS WELL.

185
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,666
- 'KAY?
- OF COURSE.

186
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,791
- I'M SORRY.

187
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,833
I KNOW YOU GUYS CAME
A LONG WAY.

188
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,541
- BUT WE'LL COME BACK.

189
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,250
YES.

190
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,375
- PLEASE GIVE HER THESE.

191
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,666
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'LL
BE ABLE TO SAVE HER LIFE.

192
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,791
DON'T GIVE UP ON HER, RIN.

193
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,583
- WHY DOES EVERYONE
THINK THAT?

194
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,833
WHY ME?

195
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,500
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO
TO HELP HER.

196
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,791
SHE WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

197
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,416
- JUST THINK FOR A WHILE.

198
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,958
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
THAT ONLY YOU CAN DO.

199
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,958
- IF THERE IS,
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

200
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,875
ASA.

201
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,041
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

202
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,583
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
I CAN DO.

203
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,666
- THAT POOR GIRL IN 501, YOU
MEAN THEY STILL HAVEN'T

204
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,166
FIGURED OUT WHAT'S
WRONG WITH HER?

205
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,541
- NO, THEY STILL HAVE NO IDEA.

206
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,541
AND SHE'S HAVING ATTACKS
MORE FREQUENTLY, TOO.

207
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,208
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD DO FOR HER.

208
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,583
- THEY'LL RUN MORE TESTS
AND CONTINUE TO OBSERVE HER.

209
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,541
- I JUST HOPE
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH.

210
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,500
- OH, GOOD, YOU'RE BACK.
THANKS, RIN.

211
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,250
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU
SHOULD BE LYING DOWN?

212
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,875
- NO, I'M FEELING MUCH
BETTER NOW. I'M REALLY FINE.

213
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,166
SO CAN I HAVE MY JUICE NOW?

214
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,166
LET'S SEE. I THINK I'LL
TAKE THE APPLE.

215
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,458
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU'RE NOT DRINKING YOURS.

216
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,125
- ASA, PLEASE.
JUST USE IT ONCE.

217
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,916
- NO WAY.
SAVE YOUR BREATH, RIN.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,083
- JUST ONCE!

219
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,500
- I SAID NO, SO DROP IT, OKAY?

220
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,333
- NO, I WILL NOT.
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DIE

221
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,208
BECAUSE YOU'RE IRRATIONAL
AND STUBBORN.

222
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,625
- I'M NOT LISTENING
AND YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.

223
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,916
THANKS FOR THE JUICE.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,541
- SHE WON'T USE HER MAGIC.
WHAT NOW?

225
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,708
WHAT CAN I DO?

226
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,291
HOW DO I CONVINCE HER?

227
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,541
HOW?

228
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,375
- Asa: I'M MISSING
SO MUCH SCHOOL.

229
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,541
I'M GONNA BE REALLY BEHIND
WHEN I GET BACK.

230
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,166
THEN YOU SHOULD HURRY UP
AND GET BETTER.

231
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,875
THE SOONER YOU DO,
THE SOONER YOU CAN GO BACK.

232
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,916
- YOU'VE ALREADY MISSED
THREE WHOLE DAYS.

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,166
AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO GET
ANY FURTHER BEHIND.

234
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,000
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

235
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,833
AMA SPOKE WITH THE SCHOOL AND
EXPLAINED I'D BE ABSENT

236
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,833
FOR A WHILE.

237
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,583
- THEY UNDERSTAND.
- BUT STILL...

238
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,458
BESIDES, YOU KNOW I WAS
ALREADY PLANNING

239
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,583
TO MISS A FEW DAYS
BECAUSE OF THE MOVE.

240
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,000
- I ALMOST FORGOT.

241
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,625
I PROMISED TO COOK YOU
SOMETHING AT THE NEW APARTMENT

242
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,125
TO MAKE IT FEEL MORE LIKE HOME.

243
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,291
- YOU CAN DO THAT
WHEN YOU GET OUTTA HERE.

244
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,041
- ( chuckles )
AS SOON AS I GET OUT

245
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,458
I PROMISE I'LL COOK YOU
SOMETHING REALLY GOOD.

246
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,916
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,291
- I KNOW THAT ANYTHING YOU
MAKE WILL BE DELICIOUS, ASA.

248
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,791
- YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T
HELP ME VERY MUCH.

249
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,583
HMM, NOW LET ME THINK.

250
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,083
HAMBURGER STEAKS,
OR MAYBE A CASSEROLE!

251
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,500
SINCE IT'S GETTING
TO BE COLD SOON,

252
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,416
BEEF STEW WOULD BE GOOD, TOO.

253
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,333
OH, THAT REMINDS ME, WE NEED TO
GET OUT AND DO SOME STUFF,

254
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,000
BEFORE WINTER COMES.

255
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,791
WE SHOULD GO FOR WALKS TOGETHER,
MAYBE HANG OUT AT THE PARK.

256
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,416
JUST AS LONG AS
WE'RE TOGETHER, 'KAY?

257
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,708
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO FIRST, RIN?

258
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,666
WHAT IS IT?

259
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,833
NEVERMIND, I'M SORRY.
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

260
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,458
- HEY, WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING JUST NOW?

261
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,583
- IT WAS NOTHING.

262
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,083
- DON'T WORRY.

263
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,375
I'M NOT GONNA DIE,
I PROMISE.

264
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,916
- SO...
- BUT I'M NOT GONNA USE MAGIC.

265
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,666
I MIGHT DIE IF I DON'T USE IT.

266
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,500
BUT AS FAR AS ANYONE KNOWS,

267
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,750
THERE'S A CHANCE I
WON'T DIE, RIGHT?

268
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,041
- AND YOU'RE WILLING
TO BET YOUR LIFE ON THAT?

269
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,208
- IT'S MY LIFE TO BET,
NOT YOURS.

270
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,291
WHEN I START TO GET SCARED,
THERE'S THIS DREAM I REMEMBER.

271
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,000
- WHAT DREAM?

272
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,125
- A DREAM I HAD ABOUT THE TWO
OF US WHEN WE'RE BOTH VERY OLD.

273
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,375
IN THE DREAM YOU HAD TAKEN
ME BACK TO THAT OVERLOOK.

274
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,000
THAT PLACE WHERE YOU
FIRST TOLD ME YOU LOVED ME.

275
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,416
AND IN THE DREAM,
YOU WERE TELLING ME AGAIN.

276
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,416
AND IT STILL FELT LIKE
THE FIRST TIME.

277
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,791
WE HELD EACH OTHER AND WERE SO
THANKFUL WE HAD A LIFE TOGETHER.

278
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,416
AND SO GLAD WE STILL HAD MORE TO
LOOK FORWARD TO WITH EACH OTHER.

279
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,166
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT GOING TO DIE.

280
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,166
OH, YEAH!
CAN I OPEN THE GIFTS NOW?

281
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,291
I CAN'T GET IT OPEN.

282
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,500
WILL YOU SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
SOMETHING TO CUT THIS WITH?

283
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,625
- SURE.

284
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,875
EXCUSE ME. WE'RE TRYING
TO OPEN HER GIFTS.

285
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,708
DO YOU HAVE A PAIR OF SCISSORS
I COULD BORROW?

286
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,625
- UM, LET ME SEE IF
I HAVE SOMETHING

287
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,041
THAT YOU CAN USE IN HERE.

288
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,833
THERE, I THINK
I FOUND SOMETHING.

289
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,666
RIGHT. HERE YA GO.

290
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,375
- ( Asa coughs )
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

291
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,916
- ( machine buzzing )

292
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,166
- DOCTOR!

293
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,500
- WE NEED A STABILIZER
AND OXYGEN! RIGHT NOW!

294
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,083
- WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN FOR HER.

295
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,166
UNFORTUNATELY, AT THIS POINT,
IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS.

296
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,208
I'M AFRAID HER BODY'S
DETERIORATING

297
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,375
AT AN ALARMING RATE.

298
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,875
YOU SHOULD PREPARE YOURSELVES.

299
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,750
- AMA, SHE...

300
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,208
SHE CAN'T HANDLE THIS
FOR MUCH LONGER.

301
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,708
- COME ON, LET'S GO, RIN.

302
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,291
- WHAT... WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

303
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,333
AMA, WAIT!

304
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,916
WHY ARE YOU LEAVING? SHE NEEDS
YOU NOW MORE THAN EVER.

305
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,500
AREN'T YOU WORRIED ABOUT HER?

306
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,208
- HOW DARE YOU...

307
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,125
- WELL, THEN?
- AM I WORRIED?

308
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,750
ANY MOTHER WOULD BE
SCARED TO DEATH RIGHT NOW, RIN!

309
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,208
SHE'S FRIGHTENED
AND IN SO MUCH PAIN.

310
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,208
OF COURSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.

311
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,166
- AMA.

312
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,458
- IF I COULD TAKE HER PLACE,
I WOULD IN A HEARTBEAT.

313
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,875
IF DOING IT WOULD
MAKE HER BETTER,

314
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,041
BELIEVE ME, I'D DO IT,

315
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,333
AND NOT CARE FOR ONE
SECOND ABOUT MYSELF.

316
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,291
I'D GLADLY GIVE ASA MY LIFE!

317
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:14,125
I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE THERE
FOR HER, LIKE ANY MOTHER WOULD.

318
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,583
BUT, I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO CAN HELP HER.

319
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:20,083
I'M SORRY. BUT, RIN,
ASA DOESN'T NEED HELP FROM ME.

320
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,000
THE PERSON SHE NEEDS IS YOU.

321
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,375
- WHAT?

322
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,750
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN SAVE HER!

323
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,083
- I'VE TRIED.
BUT ASA WON'T LISTEN.

324
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,875
- ASA'S STUBBORN,
BUT PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP.

325
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,916
SHE'LL COME AROUND,
JUST KEEP TRYING.

326
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,041
THE TWO OF YOU SHARE
A SPECIAL BOND OF LOVE.

327
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,583
THAT'S WHY SHE'LL LISTEN.

328
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,208
- YOU ALL KEEP SAYING THAT.

329
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,666
IT'S NOT TRUE.

330
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,125
I CAN'T DO ANY MORE FOR HER
THAN YOU CAN.

331
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,666
- YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT.

332
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,000
I THINK PART OF YOU
KNOWS IT EVEN NOW.

333
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,083
ASA IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR LIFE,

334
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,333
AND YOU'LL FIND A WAY
TO SAVE HER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO.

335
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,208
- IF I CAN, I WILL.

336
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,083
- RIN, SAVE ASA.

337
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,000
I KNOW YOU CAN.

338
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,583
I LOVE HER SO MUCH.
BRING HER BACK.

339
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,250
- I'M SORRY, RIN.
I CAN'T GET RID OF THIS COUGH.

340
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,875
COME ON, CHEER UP.

341
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,958
I HATE TO SEE YOU
LOOKING SO SAD.

342
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,791
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

343
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,708
- JUST TELL ME.

344
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,041
WHY ARE YOU STILL
REFUSING TO USE MAGIC?

345
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,000
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST IT?

346
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,833
- I DON'T WANNA HURT HER,
MY MOTHER.

347
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,416
SHE ALWAYS HAS A SMILE
ON HER FACE.

348
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,875
BUT I'VE SEEN HER CRY ONCE.

349
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,291
- WHY IS MY BODY LIKE THIS?

350
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,541
WHY AM I DIFFERENT
THAN EVERYONE ELSE?

351
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,416
- AND SHE TOLD ME
SHE WAS A DEMON.

352
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,125
SHE ENDED UP HERE IN THE HUMAN
WORLD BECAUSE OF AN EXPERIMENT.

353
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,541
I FOUND OUT EVERYTHING THAT DAY.

354
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,875
- ( sobbing ) IT'S MY FAULT.

355
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,333
I'M SO SORRY, ASA,
IT'S MY FAULT.

356
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,666
IF I WEREN'T A DEMON,

357
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,125
THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
SUFFER THE WAY YOU ARE.

358
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,583
I'M SORRY FOR BEING
SUCH A BAD MOTHER.

359
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:16,000
I'M SORRY, ASA. I'M SO SORRY.

360
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,000
- Asa: THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME
I'VE EVER SEEN MY MOTHER CRY.

361
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,708
THIS WOMAN
WHO HAD ALWAYS SMILED,

362
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:28,250
NO MATTER WHAT TERRIBLE THINGS
I SAID TO HER, WAS NOW CRYING.

363
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,166
I FINALLY REALIZED HOW MUCH
I WAS HURTING MY MOTHER,

364
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,416
WHO LOVED ME
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

365
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,833
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
ASKED HER THAT QUESTION.

366
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,666
I CAUSED HER NOTHING BUT PAIN.

367
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,708
SHE DESERVES BETTER THAN THAT.

368
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,916
THAT'S WHY I WON'T USE MY MAGIC.

369
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,458
I'M ONLY A HUMAN
IN A HUMAN BODY.

370
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,166
I'M A NORMAL CHILD BORN TO
A NORMAL MOTHER AND FATHER.

371
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,458
I'M NOT A DEMON.
I'M JUST A REGULAR GIRL.

372
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,416
I WON'T HURT MY MOTHER LIKE
THAT AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE.

373
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,458
I WON'T DO IT!

374
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,416
- ( coughing )
- ARE YOU OKAY?

375
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,625
- I WON'T USE MAGIC.

376
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,458
DON'T ASK THAT OF ME, PLEASE.

377
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,125
( crying )

378
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,375
- ( grunts )

379
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,541
ASA.

380
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,083
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP.

381
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:53,166
I... I'M GOING TO FAIL YOU
WHEN YOU NEED ME MOST.

382
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,416
FORGIVE ME.

383
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,916
- STILL HERE.

384
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,458
- I HAVE TO SAVE HER.

385
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:12,000
HOW? HOW DO I SAVE HER
FROM THIS? WHAT DO I DO?

386
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,583
- ( coughs )

387
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,375
THIS IS IT. I THINK I'VE
REACHED MY LIMIT.

388
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,916
I'M SORRY, RIN. GOOD-BYE.

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,125
- DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

390
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,500
( gasps )

391
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,833
- ( breathing deeply )

392
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,000
- ASA!

393
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,833
WHERE ARE YOU?

394
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,125
- ( theme song playing )

395
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

396
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,666
- Rin: I DON'T CARE IF I CAN
BECOME A GOD OR A DEMON.

397
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,666
I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING.

398
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,791
IF I CAN JUST SAVE HER,
THAT'S ALL I NEED!

399
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,291
- Primula: NEXT TIME
ON SHUFFLE...

400
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,458
THE FINAL EPISODE,
"AND... WHAT IS IMPORTANT."
