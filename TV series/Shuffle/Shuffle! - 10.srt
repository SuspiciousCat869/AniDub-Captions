- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,916
- Sia: THERE'S NO ONE BUT US.

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,708
IT'S KIND OF LIKE WE'RE THE ADAM
AND EVE OF THIS WORLD, ISN'T IT?

5
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,125
- LET'S TRY TO MAKE OUR
LIFE TOGETHER A HAPPY ONE.

6
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,416
EVEN HERE.

7
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,250
- ( both gasp )

8
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,666
- WELL, WELL, THOUGHT YOU
COULD PULL ONE OVER ON US, EH?

9
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,833
- YOU SURE ARE ONE
HEARTLESS GUY, RIN.

10
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,083
- CONGRATULATIONS, YOU TWO.

11
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,000

15
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,333
( giggles )

16
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,625
OH, RIN.

17
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,958
I DO.

18
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,333
( chuckles )

19
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,833
RIN'S WIFE.

20
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,291
- I GUESS MY LITTLE GIRL
IS ALL GROWN UP NOW.

21
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,750
( chuckles )

22
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,583
IT SEEMS LIKE SHE WAS IN
DIAPERS JUST THE OTHER DAY.

23
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,083
( snorts )

24
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:54,291
BUT NOW SHE'S A WOMAN, AND SHE'S
GOING TO MARRY RIN TSUCHIMI!

25
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,291
- Rin: SIA!

26
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,500
- ( giggles )

27
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,791
HI!

28
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,625
- ( panting )

29
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,833
BEEN HERE LONG?

30
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,958
- NOPE, NOT REALLY.
JUST A FEW MINUTES. THAT'S ALL.

31
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,666
- SORRY.
- NO PROBLEM.

32
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,333
- Primula: FATHER, THANK
YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS

33
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,375
AND TAKING CARE OF
ME ALL THIS TIME.

34
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,291
- Eustoma: I'VE ONLY DONE WHAT
ANY GOOD FATHER WOULD DO.

35
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,541
AND EVEN THOUGH
WE WON'T BE LIVING

36
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,375
UNDER THE SAME ROOF ANYMORE,

37
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,875
DADDY WILL NEVER
FORGET YOU, SIA.

38
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,750
WAIT, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
NEVER GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN.

39
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,541
MAYBE THAT WAS A
TAD TOO SERIOUS.

40
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,958
( laughs )

41
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,833
YES, OF COURSE IT WAS.
I NEED TO LIGHTEN UP.

42
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,708
NOW SWEETIE, IF
THINGS DON'T WORK OUT,

43
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,625
YOU CAN CRASH AT DEAR
OLD DAD'S PLACE ANYTIME.

44
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,250
WAIT. THAT ONE WASN'T SERIOUS
ENOUGH, THOUGH, WAS IT?

45
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,416
OH, WHAT AM I WORRYING ABOUT?
IT'S JUST SIA'S WEDDING.

46
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,583
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
WALK HER DOWN THE AISLE

47
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,625
AND GIVE HER AWAY TO RIN
WITH A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE.

48
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,625
( laughs nervously )

49
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,083
TRUST ME, THIS WEDDING
IS GOING TO BE BIG.

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,375
MORE THAN BIG, HUGE. IT'S GOING
TO BE THE EVENT OF THE SEASON

51
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,666
FOR BOTH THE WORLDS
OF GODS AND HUMANS.

52
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,625
AND SPEAKING OF BIG, JUST WAIT
TIL YOU SEE THE GUEST LIST.

53
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,291
( grunts )

54
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,583
- MMM, THIS IS REALLY GOOD!
- OH-LA-LA!

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,458
- AW! HE LOOKS JUST
LIKE A STUFFED ANIMAL.

56
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,375
( giggles )

57
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,416
HE'S JUST SO CUTE AND
PRECIOUS, ISN'T HE?

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,666
- YEAH.
- SURE IS.

59
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,375
- ( chuckles )

60
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,166
HEY, YOU. THAT TICKLES.

61
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,041
- IT LOOKS LOVELY ON YOU.

62
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,000
- Eustoma: HMM.

63
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,708
THIS WHITE ONE OVER
HERE'S NOT BAD, EITHER.

64
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,625
HMM.

65
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,416
I JUST CAN'T DECIDE.

66
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,958
WOULD MY SIA LOOK PRETTIER IN
A FANCY DRESS OR IN A KIMONO?

67
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,083
PRIMULA, WHAT DO YOU
THINK WOULD LOOK BEST?

68
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,750
HMM.

69
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,791
WELL, MY SIA WILL LOOK
STUNNING IN EITHER ONE.

70
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,375
WHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT?

71
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,916
( laughs )

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,583
- HEY, DID YOU HEAR
THE BIG NEWS?

73
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,791
- YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A
WILD RUMOR AT FIRST, BUT NOW...

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,750
- ( fireworks )

75
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,000
- HUH?

76
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,291
- FIREWORKS?

77
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,500
- I WONDER WHAT'S
BEING CELEBRATED?

78
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,166
- Man 1: TOLD YA
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

79
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,208
- Man 2: I KNOW, YEAH.

80
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,666
GETTING HITCHED, HUH?
WHEN'S THE BIG DAY?

81
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,958
- Man 1: I HEARD IT'S AN
ARRANGED MARRIAGE.

82
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,333
- Man 2: REALLY?

83
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,166
- HEY, COME ON, RIN.
LET'S SEE WHAT'S OVER HERE.

84
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,291
- SURE.

85
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:23,750
RIGHT. STEADY. STEADY.
JUST A LITTLE FURTHER. UGH!

86
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,708
- Sia: OH! YOU WERE SO CLOSE!

87
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,125
- HEY, DON'T WORRY!
WE'LL GET IT THIS TIME!

88
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,583
- YOU CAN DO IT, RIN.

89
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,625
- RIGHT!

90
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,000
- THAT IS SO ROMANTIC.
- BOY, I'LL SAY.

91
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,291
- I WISH I HAD A GIRL LIKE THAT.

92
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,666
( giggles )

93
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,625
- ( sighs )

94
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,291
PERHAPS I COULD TALK TO HIM.

95
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,916
- ( Rin and Sia laugh )

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
- SO WE DIDN'T WIN A PRIZE.

97
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,958
- BUT TODAY WAS STILL
FUN, WASN'T IT?

98
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:26,958
- YEAH, IT WAS.

99
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,208
- I HEARD THEY'RE
GETTING MARRIED.

100
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,333
- WELL, THEY DO LOOK
QUITE HAPPY TOGETHER.

101
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,375
- IT MUST BE NICE
BEING YOUNG AND IN LOVE.

102
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,583
- NO, YOU DON'T THINK...
- COURSE NOT.

103
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,041
BUT IT HAS FELT LIKE PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN STARING AT US ALL DAY.

104
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,541
- I THINK THAT'S THEM.
CHECK IT OUT.

105
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,083
- OH! HEY, THEY'RE THE ONES
GETTING MARRIED, RIGHT?

106
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,375
- I WISH I WAS HIM.

107
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,750
- ( Girl groaning )

108
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,541
- Mayumi: UGH, FINALLY!

109
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,583
YOU TWO CAN RUN,
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME.

110
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,625
( grunts ) UNBELIEVABLE!

111
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

112
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,958
- UM, MAYUMI? WHAT'S WRONG?

113
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,166
- WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?
DON'T PLAY DUMB WITH ME!

114
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,666
- HOW COULD YOU GUYS KEEP
A HUGE SCOOP FROM ME LIKE THAT?

115
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,958
IT'S SO MEAN. BUT YOU'RE
GONNA MAKE IT RIGHT, MISTER.

116
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,375
- ( Rin grunts )

117
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,791
- SINCE YOU TWO ARE THE
TALK OF THE TOWN RIGHT NOW,

118
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,875
IT'S ONLY FITTING THAT YOU
GRANT YOUR PAL, MAYUMI,

119
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,583
AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW.

120
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,208
MR. TSUCHIMI, TELL US,

121
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,333
WHAT WAS ON YOUR MIND WHEN YOU
MADE YOUR MONUMENTAL DECISION?

122
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,583
- WAS IT HARD! ARE YOU HAPPY?
ARE YOU LISTENING?

123
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,625
- HEY, LIKE I SAID BEFORE,
BUDDY, DON'T WORRY.

124
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,666
I'LL TAKE CARE OF KAEDE
AND NERINE FOR YOU.

125
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,416
I'M STRONG ENOUGH TO HANDLE
BOTH OF THOSE LOVELY LADIES.

126
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,625
- HUH?

127
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,333
- WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

128
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,833
- OH, COME ON.
EVERYONE KNOWS BY NOW.

129
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,375
THE MAN WHO COULD BECOME
A GOD OR A DEMON HAS CHOSEN

130
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,291
TO BE A GOD.

131
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,458
- HEY, YOU GUYS ARE
GETTING MARRIED, RIGHT?

132
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,916
- ( grunts )
- WHAT? WE ARE?

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,291
- ( Man yelling )

134
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,041
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS, RIN TSUCHIMI!

135
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,791
THE SIA IMPERIAL GUARD COMMANDO
UNIT WON'T STAND FOR THIS!

136
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,583
- THESE GUYS AGAIN?
- HOW DARE YOU OPPOSE US

137
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,041
AND TAKE OUR BELOVED'S
HAND IN MARRIAGE?

138
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,000
YOUR COURSE OF ACTION HAS
LEFT US NO OTHER CHOICE.

139
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,291
PREPARE TO DIE, RIN TSUCHIMI.

140
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,208
( yelling )

141
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,541
- THEY'RE SERIOUS.

142
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,708
- WHAT THE HELL. IT'S THE
NERINE SECURITY SHOCK TROOP.

143
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,375
- HI-YA!

144
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,333
- THE KAEDE FUYOU
PERSONAL GUARD?

145
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,166
THE KNIGHTS OF KISSY KAEDE?
BUT, WHY?

146
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,333
- A STRANGE ALLIANCE,
YES, BUT FOR OUR SAKES,

147
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,416
BACK OFF OF TSUCHIMI.

148
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,208
- SHUT UP AND
ACCEPT THIS MARRIAGE

149
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,458
AND YOU WON'T GET HURT, PAL.

150
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,958
- ( grunting ) YOU TRAITORS!

151
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,666
- THEY'RE ALL A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.

152
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,666
- ( Rin exhales )

153
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,791
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
PEOPLE GOT THE IDEA.

154
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,958
- SO RIN AND I ARE
GETTING MARRIED, HUH?

155
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:49,041
- HUH! SIA! DON'T YOU
START, TOO. COME ON.

156
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,791
- SO THEN, WHAT?
YOU DON'T WANNA MARRY SIA?

157
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,083
- NO, IT'S... IT'S NOT THAT.
NOT AT ALL, IN FACT.

158
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,416
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE...

159
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,000
WELL, WE'RE STILL IN
HIGH SCHOOL, YOU KNOW?

160
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,500
AND WHAT ABOUT NERINE AND KAEDE?

161
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,125
- Itsuki: YEAH, BUT WITH
THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW,

162
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,125
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY TURNING BACK.

163
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,250
- ( sighs )
- ( Rin grunts )

164
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,000
- ( chopping )

165
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,208
- Rin: I'M BACK.

166
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,750
- Kaede: WELCOME HOME.

167
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,916
DINNER WILL BE READY IN
JUST A FEW MINUTES, OKAY?

168
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,916
- THANKS.

169
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,750
- ( slurping )

170
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,875
- OH. LOOKS LIKE
YOU NEED MORE TEA.

171
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,208
TODAY WHEN I WENT
TO THE STORE,

172
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,291
THEY WERE HAVING THIS LIMITED
TIME SPECIAL ON SOME GREAT TEA.

173
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,666
IF I HAD COME ANY LATER,
I WOULD HAVE MISSED IT,

174
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,541
BUT I JUST HAPPENED TO BE AT THE
RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME.

175
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,958
- ( phone ringing )

176
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,625
- Rin: YES? HELLO?

177
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,541
- Asa: OH. RIN, IT'S YOU.

178
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,958
- ASA?

179
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,500
YOU USUALLY NEVER CALL THIS
LATE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

180
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,708
- YES, EVERYTHING IS FINE.
JUST FINE.

181
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,333
IT'S JUST THAT...
WELL, UM... IS KAEDE THERE?

182
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,041
- SHE IS, BUT SHE'S
KINDA BUSY RIGHT NOW.

183
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,250
I'LL LET HER KNOW YOU CALLED

184
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,791
AND SHE CAN CALL YOU
BACK WHEN SHE'S DONE.

185
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,250
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

186
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,333
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF
BUSY MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

187
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,416
- HUH?

188
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,000
- Ama: OH! IS THAT
RIN ON THE PHONE?

189
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,666
IT IS? HI, RIN.

190
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,666
CONGRATULATIONS.
I HEARD THE GOOD NEWS!

191
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,083
- Asa: MOTHER...
- AMA?

192
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,208
- Asa: WELL, WE'LL TALK TO
YOU LATER, RIN. BYE NOW!

193
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,208
- UH! HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! ASA.

194
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,666
HELLO? HELLO?

195
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:47,333
MAN. DOES EVERYBODY IN TOWN
THINK WE'RE GETTING MARRIED?

196
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,375
THIS IS REALLY
GETTING OUT OF HAND!

197
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,333
STILL, I HAVE BEEN
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME

198
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,500
WITH SIA LATELY, BUT...

199
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,333
( yawns )

200
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO.

201
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,333
- Sia: ALRIGHT, LET'S SEE.

202
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,750
FIRST THERE'S GOING TO
BE ME AND RIN, OF COURSE.

203
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,833
PLUS NERINE AND
KAEDE WILL BE THERE.

204
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,500
UM, WONDER IF RIMU WOULD
WANT TO COME, TOO.

205
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,250
OH, COME ON, RIN. PLEASE?

206
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,916
- ( all laughing )

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,458
- THAT WOULD BE SO GREAT!

208
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,916
( sighs )
OH, I JUST CAN'T WAIT.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
( squealing )

210
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:53,041
- Woman: THAT IS THE WORST SOUP
EVER. THERE ARE BONES IN IT.

211
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,458
- HEY.

212
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,416
- OH, THANKS FOR COMING.

213
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,583
I KNOW MY FATHER ASKED YOU
TO DO THIS. I'M SORRY.

214
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,208
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

215
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,875
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
WANTING TO TALK TO YOU.

216
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,208
- HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

217
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,125
- ISN'T HE GETTING MARRIED SOON?

218
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,250
- I WONDER IF THE FIANCEE KNOWS?

219
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,958
- HOW SCANDALOUS. THAT GUY
MUST REALLY BE A PLAYBOY.

220
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,666
- SHH! WELL,
HE IS KIND OF CUTE.

221
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,125
- ( sighs )

222
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,541
- UM, RIN?

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,916
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
TAKE A WALK WITH ME?

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,083
IT'S A NICE DAY.

225
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,708
- ( Sia groans )

226
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,083
WELL, SO MUCH FOR
THE WEATHERMAN'S

227
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,625
SUNNY AND DRY FORECAST.

228
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,875
HEY, THERE, KAEDE.

229
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,791
- HEY, SIA.

230
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,291
- HAVE YOU LOOKED UP?

231
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,666
DRYING THOSE OUTSIDE TODAY
COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

232
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,083
- OH, I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.
THANKS.

233
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,375
- NO PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY
I'M HEADED TO THE STORE NOW.

234
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,625
I WANT TO GET BACK BEFORE
THE WEATHER GETS TOO BAD.

235
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,833
THAT REMINDS ME. DO YOU NEED
ME TO PICK UP ANYTHING

236
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,833
FOR YOU AT THE STORE?

237
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,708
- NO, NOTHING. THANKS, THOUGH.

238
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,000
- ARE YOU SURE?
WE ARE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW.

239
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,583
IF YOU WANT ANYTHING,
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS ASK ME.

240
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,833
- WELL, I'VE DONE ALL
OF MY SHOPPING ALREADY.

241
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,833
I DON'T REALLY NEED ANYTHING.

242
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,875
- OKAY. WELL, I'M GONNA GO GET
MINE DONE THEN, AND QUICKLY.

243
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,000
- HOLD ON, SIA.
- HMM?

244
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,250
- UM...

245
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,416
WELL, IT'S NOTHING.

246
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,458
YOU HAVE A SAFE TRIP
TO THE STORE, OKAY?

247
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,250
- HMM.

248
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,208
- HEY, THAT'S RIN TSUCHIMI.

249
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,458
- HE'S ALREADY
WITH ANOTHER GIRL?

250
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,000
- UH, I JUST CAN'T DECIDE.

251
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,208
- UH...

252
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,958
GET THIS ONE.
IT'S REASONABLY PRICED.

253
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,666
- WHAT? AT THAT PRICE?

254
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,166
( gasps )

255
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,250
- YOU! I'M JOKING.

256
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,250
- ( giggles )

257
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,666
- I'VE GOTTA RUN. BYE-BYE.

258
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,333
- ( chuckles )

259
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,916
- ( grunts )

260
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,291
- ( Rin sighs )

261
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,875
PEOPLE JUST WON'T STOP TALKING.

262
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,250
( chuckles )

263
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,333
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD
HEARING ALL THOSE PEOPLE

264
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,208
WHISPERING BEHIND YOUR BACK.

265
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,750
I'M SO SORRY.

266
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,125
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

267
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,958
- WELL, ANYWAY,
IT WAS NICE OF YOU

268
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,375
TO HANG OUT WITH
ME TODAY. THANKS.

269
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,375
- ( chuckles ) THANK YOU.

270
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,958
YOU PUT UP WITH ALL
THOSE PEOPLE'S COMMENTS.

271
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,125
I JUST HOPE YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME TODAY.

272
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,708
WELL? DID YOU?

273
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,458
YEAH, I DID.

274
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,583
AND WHAT MADE IT EVEN MORE
SPECIAL WAS THAT IT WAS

275
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,208
THE FIRST TIME WE'VE BEEN OUT
ALONE TOGETHER SINCE WE MET.

276
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,583
I ENJOYED IT.

277
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,666
- ( sighs )

278
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,416
GUESS I HAVEN'T
BEEN TOO CONSIDERATE

279
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,083
OF NERINE'S FEELINGS
RECENTLY, HAVE I?

280
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,250
HOW DID IT MAKE HER FEEL

281
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,000
WHEN SHE SAW ME WITH
SIA ALL THOSE TIMES?

282
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,541
SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

283
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,041
BUT I...

284
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,666
- HEY, RIN.

285
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,416
- Sia: THAT SHOULD
BE EVERYTHING.

286
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,666
LET'S SEE, TOFU, GREEN
ONIONS, GROUND BEEF,

287
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,208
NOODLES, AND SOY SAUCE.

288
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,458
HUH?

289
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,375
- WELL, RIN, DOES THIS PLACE
LOOK FAMILIAR?

290
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,625
- YES, OF COURSE.
HOW COULD I FORGET IT?

291
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,708
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE
YOU AND I FIRST MET.

292
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,541
- YES.

293
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,333
- HERE WE ARE AGAIN,
BACK AT THE SWING SET,

294
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,791
ALL THESE YEARS LATER.

295
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,333
- WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
AND YOU HELPED ME,

296
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,833
I TOLD MYSELF,
THAT'S THE BOY I'LL MARRY.

297
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,458
BUT NOW, I GUESS NOT.

298
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,166
- HUH?

299
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,458
- BUT EVEN SO...

300
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,416
I WANT TO LET YOU
KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIN.

301
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,250
- HUH?

302
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,291
- ( crying )

303
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,375
- OH, RINA.

304
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,791
- NERINE.

305
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,833
- GUESS I NEVER REALIZED THAT

306
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,500
WHEN YOU FALL IN
LOVE WITH SOMEONE,

307
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,166
YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE HURT FEELINGS

308
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,416
OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE
IN LOVE WITH HIM, TOO.

309
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,875
OH, MAN.

310
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,458
THINGS ARE BAD RIGHT NOW.
I'VE GOT TO CHANGE THEM.

311
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,666
BUT HOW? WHAT SHOULD I DO?

312
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,500
YEAH, WHAT SHOULD I DO?

313
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,458
( scoffs )

314
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,583
( gasps )

327

- OH, HEY.

328
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,958

329

THANKS FOR COMING, RIN.

00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,833
SORRY I DRAGGED YOU OVER
HERE ALL OF THE SUDDEN.

331
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,583
- IT'S OKAY. I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ANYWAY.

- WOW.
THE BREEZE FEELS SO NICE.

335
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,083
I'VE BEEN DOING SOME THINKING.

336
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,125
WHEN WE FINALLY GET MARRIED,

337
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,833
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
IN YOUR HEART

338
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,666
THAT I'M THE PERFECT
GIRL FOR YOU.

339
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,375
AND I WANT EVERYONE ELSE
TO FEEL THE SAME WAY, TOO.

340
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,416
- UH.

341

YOU KNOW, AND, UH,

343
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,416
AND JUST ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!

344
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,458
RIGHT NOW, I'VE GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO

345
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,375
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE, THOUGH.

346
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,416
I'VE BEEN REALLY
SELFISH RECENTLY.

347
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,166
AND I'VE MADE YOUR
LIFE DIFFICULT, TOO.

348
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,208
- SIA.

349
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,583
- SO HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO.

350
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,375
FIRST, RIN, I'M GOING
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU

351
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,541
EVEN MORE THAN I ALREADY AM.

352
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,208
AND THEN SECOND,
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE

353
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,916
YOU GET TO KNOW ME EVEN BETTER,

354
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,458
THE REAL ME.

355
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,666
THAT WAY, WHEN IT'S TIME FOR
YOU TO DECIDE WHO TO MARRY,

356
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,125
YOU'LL LOOK AT ALL THE
WONDERFUL GIRLS IN YOUR LIFE,

357
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,458
AND OUT OF THEM,
YOU'LL WANT TO PICK ME.

358
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,416
- UH, OKAY.

359
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,666
- DEAL?

360
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,833
- WELL, WHY NOT?

361
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,750
- SO, RIN,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

362
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,416
CAN WE BE FRIENDS, FOR NOW?

363
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,166
- HMM.

364
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,291

365
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,625

WOMAN WALKED THROUGH MY DOOR,

367
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,333
AND NOW WE'RE LIVING A LIFE OF
DANGER AND ROMANCE ON THE ROAD.

368
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,625
- Mayumi: WOULD YOU STOP
MAKING UP FAKE STORIES.

369
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:08,291
- Itsuki: NEXT TIME, EPISODE
380, A BIKINI, ME, AND...

370
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,833
- Mayumi: WRONG.
NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE,

371
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,583
EPISODE 11, GIRLS OF SUMMER.

372
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,458
- Itsuki: THE MYSTERY WOMAN'S
IDENTITY IS REVEALED.

373
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,208
- SHE'S ACTUALLY...
- Mayumi: ENOUGH.
