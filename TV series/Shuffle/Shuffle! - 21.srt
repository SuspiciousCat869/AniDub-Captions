1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,416
- THE EDGES ARE A
LITTLE CRUNCHY,

4
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,958
BUT I THINK THEY'LL STILL TASTE
DECENT, I HOPE.

5
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,708
HERE ALL THESE YEARS, I THOUGHT
COOKING WAS PRETTY EASY.

6
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:54,125
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY 'CAUSE
I NEVER ACTUALLY HAD TO DO IT.

7
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,875
- WHERE'S KAEDE?

8
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,125
- UM, STILL IN BED. SHE'S
RESTING UNTIL SHE FEELS BETTER.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,666
SHE'LL BE OKAY.
EAT UP BEFORE THEY GET COLD.

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,250
- RIN? IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL EAT LATER WITH KAEDE.

11
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,958
- OKAY, GOOD IDEA.

12
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,500
- THANK YOU. SORRY.

13
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,541
- DON'T BE.

14
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:23,833
KAEDE?

15
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,625
KAEDE. COME ON, GET UP.

16
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,291
WE CAN WALK TO CLASS
TOGETHER, IF YOU WANT.

17
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,833
OKAY, MAYBE NEXT TIME.

18
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,000
- GOOD MORNING, RIN.

19
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,708
- OH, GOOD MORNING, RIN.
YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

20
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,458
- IS KAEDE NOT COMING?

21
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,458
- AFRAID NOT. SHE'S STILL
NOT QUITE FEELING HER BEST.

22
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,916
- IT MUST BE SERIOUS
TO KEEP HER DOWN THIS LONG.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,083
- IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

24
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,458
- WOULD IT BE OKAY IF WE
MAYBE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

25
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,208
RIGHT NOW IS JUST
NOT A GOOD TIME.

26
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,041
SORRY, I DON'T MEAN
TO WORRY YOU.

27
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,125
- NOT AT ALL. YOU'LL TELL US
WHEN YOU FEEL READY.

28
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,083
- TILL THEN, IF THERE'S ANYTHING
WE CAN POSSIBLY DO TO HELP,

29
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,166
PLEASE DON'T THINK TWICE
ABOUT ASKING.

30
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,541
- YOU TWO ARE THE GREATEST,
SERIOUSLY

31
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,791
- OCCASIONALLY, BETWEEN
HUMAN AND DEMON WORLDS,

32
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,416
A PHENOMENON TAKES PLACE THAT
TRANSCENDS BOTH SPACE AND TIME.

33
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,833
- IS IT BECAUSE YOU HATE ME
FOR WHAT I'VE DONE?

34
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,375
- I DON'T HATE YOU.

35
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,250
- GIVE ME A CHANCE TO MAKE THIS
UP TO YOU, I CAN GET BETTER.

36
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,375
PLEASE, RIN. I'LL
EVEN LEARN TO COOK

37
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,416
MORE THINGS
YOU LIKE TO EAT.

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,208
PLEASE, JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER
CHANCE. PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

39
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,708
- JUST TELL ME WHAT I'M
DOING WRONG...

40
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,791
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

41
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,333
- THEN IS IT ABOUT ASA?

42
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,958
- BECAUSE SHE'S
WELCOME, ANYTIME.

43
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,250
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

44
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,875
- DON'T YOU GET IT?

45
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,458
THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS
TAKING CARE OF YOU, RIN.

46
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,208
COOKING MEALS FOR YOU
AND DOING YOUR LAUNDRY.

47
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,875
IT'S WHAT GIVES MY LIFE
A SENSE OF PURPOSE.

48
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,958
- THAT'S NOT TRUE. THIS ISN'T
REALLY THE LIFE YOU WANT.

49
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,125
WE'VE LIVED TOGETHER FOR
A LONG TIME. I KNOW YOU.

50
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,208
KAEDE, BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.

51
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,416
- I HAVE DEVOTED MY ENTIRE LIFE
TO TAKING CARE OF YOU, RIN.

52
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,000
IT'S THE ONLY THING I LIVE FOR.

53
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,125
- I KNOW IT IS.

54
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:27,916
THAT'S THE REASON.

55
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,458
THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED
TO LEAVE, UNDERSTAND?

56
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,791
IT'S WHY I HAVE TO LEAVE, KAEDE.

57
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,500
- ( crying ) NO. BUT IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT.

58
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:42,125
I'M BEGGING YOU.
DON'T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS.

59
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,666
I WON'T SURVIVE IF YOU
DISAPPEAR FROM MY LIFE.

60
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,625
- Nadashiko: HENCE THE ISSUE
OF A TIME PARADOX.

61
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,916
HOWEVER, WE'VE NO
CITABLE CASES TO DATE.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,375
CURRENTLY, FURTHER RESEARCH
IS BEING CONDUCTED.

63
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,750
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DOES IT TASTE THAT BAD?

64
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,916
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,250
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY THIS ONE?

66
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,166
ALL THOSE STARCHES ARE JUST
GONNA SLOW YOU DOWN.

67
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,708
- THANKS, I APPRECIATE IT.

68
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,958
- HOW'S KAEDE DOING?
IS SHE FEELING BETTER?

69
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,666
- SHE'S NOT.

70
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,666
- HMM. I THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE OUTDONE YOURSELF.

71
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,875
THIS TASTES AMAZING!

72
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,000
- WELL, THANK YOU.

73
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,833
- NOW, TELL ME
WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

74
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,666
- "WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING?"
- WITH YOU AND KAEDE.

75
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,291
NERINE AND SIA TOLD ME THAT
SHE WON'T SEE EITHER OF THEM

76
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,083
OR COME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

77
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,666
- IS IT MY FAULT?

78
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,916
- NO, I THINK IT'S MINE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN FAIR TO KAEDE.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,916
STAYING WITH HER ALL THESE
YEARS MADE HER BELIEVE

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,583
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING
BETWEEN US WHEN THERE WASN'T.

81
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,375
IT'S LIKE, SHE'S WASTED
HER ENTIRE LIFE ON ME.

82
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,375
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

83
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,958
- I REALIZED HOW
SELFISH I'VE BEEN

84
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,666
AND I JUST CAN'T KEEP
DOING THAT TO HER.

85
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,750
AND SO, THE BEST THING
THAT I CAN DO IS TO LEAVE.

86
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,166
THE SOONER THE BETTER.

87
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,375
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THROUGH TO HER.

88
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,666
OTHERWISE, KAEDE WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO LET GO.

89
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,083
AND AS MUCH AS I HATE
TO HURT HER,

90
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,000
AS MUCH AS IT SEEMS LIKE
I'M PUSHING HER AWAY,

91
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,708
THIS IS, THIS IS THE ONLY THING
I CAN DO TO HELP HER MOVE ON.

92
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,500
I ONLY WISH...

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
- NO, THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION.
- I'M SO SORRY.

94
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,625
- AT BEST, I COULD EARN ABOUT
SEVENTY A MONTH WORKING

95
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,583
PART TIME, OR
CLOSER TO SIXTY.

96
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,333
IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT REGARDLESS.

97
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,291
- WELL, HELLO, RIN.

98
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,958
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PEEKING IN A REAL ESTATE OFFICE?

99
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,916
- ( chuckles awkwardly )
I'M JUST LOOKING.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,625
- "FOR LEASE?" JUST LOOKING?

101
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,125
FOR WHO?

102
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,708
KAEDE KICKING YOU OUT AND
MAKING YOU FEND FOR YOURSELF?

103
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,833
- AH. WAIT A MINUTE.
- IS SHE RIGHT?

104
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,416
- OKAY, GIRLS, I GUESS, IT'S
TIME TO EXPLAIN.

105
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
- HUH?

106
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,041
- KAEDE?

107
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,750
I'M COMING IN.

108
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,208
- ( gasps ) WHERE ARE YOU?

109
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,958
- YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?

110
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,875
- BUT, WHAT'S YOUR
REASON FOR MOVING?

111
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,500
- BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO FOR BOTH OF US.

112
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,125
- BUT YOU DO LIKE LIVING THERE.

113
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,791
AND YOU'RE NOT TIRED OF LIVING
WITH KAEDE, RIGHT?

114
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,333
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

115
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:52,041
I THINK LIVING WITH KAEDE HAS
BEEN A GOOD THING FOR ME.

116
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,041
- BUT RIN, IF THAT'S
REALLY HOW YOU FEEL,

117
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,333
THEN ISN'T THAT REASON
ENOUGH TO KEEP LIVING THERE?

118
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,875
- LIVING BY YOURSELF
IS A LOT HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS.

119
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,500
COOKING, CLEANING, LAUNDRY.

120
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,833
IT'S PRETTY HARD LABOR WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

121
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,916
- HARD LABOR IS RIGHT, AND
ALL THIS TIME SHE'S BEEN

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,083
DOING EVERY BIT OF IT

123
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,916
BY HERSELF. AND ALL FOR ME.

124
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,041
ALL THAT FOR ME.

125
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,250
- GOOD MORNING, RIN.

126
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,500
HERE YOU GO, DON'T FORGET
ABOUT YOUR LUNCH.

127
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,875
HERE YOU GO. TAKE THIS.
IT'S MEDICINE.

128
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,708
- ( chuckles ) WELL,
ONLY WHEN IT COMES TO RIN.

129
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,416
- I DIDN'T REALIZE,
I WAS TAKING HER FOR GRANTED.

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
BOTH KAEDE AND I,
GENUINELY THOUGHT

131
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,458
WE WERE MAKING
EACH OTHER HAPPY.

132
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:37,291
- WE WERE FOOLING OURSELVES.
MISTAKING COMFORT FOR HAPPINESS.

133
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,958
- I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT. WE
WERE BOTH LIVING IN THE PAST.

134
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,750
STUCK THERE BY SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED TO US

135
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,333
WHEN WE WERE JUST KIDS.

136
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,750
- I REALLY LOVE TAKING
CARE OF YOU, RIN.

137
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,833
IT'S WHAT I ENJOY
DOING THE MOST.

138
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:54,000
- BUT THE TRUTH WAS SHE
WAS ONLY FEELING GUILTY.

139
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,166
SHE FELT HORRIBLE FOR THE
WAY SHE'D TREATED ME

140
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,791
AND WAS STILL TRYING TO
MAKE UP FOR IT.

141
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,791
- AND I WAS AFRAID THAT
IF I TRIED TO STOP HER, WELL,

142
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,458
I FELT LIKE IT WOULD CRUSH
HER SPIRIT.

143
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,791
IF HER DEVOTION TO ME
WAS ALL SHE LIVED FOR

144
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,458
THEN WHO WAS I TO TAKE
THAT AWAY FROM HER?

145
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,458
BUT THEN, YOU TWO
HELPED ME REALIZE

146
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,583
THAT I HAD BEEN FOOLING MYSELF.

147
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,166
SEEING IT ALL WRONG.

148
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,458
ONE THING I'M SURE OF
IS THAT IT'S TIME FOR ME

149
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,416
TO TAKE A NEW STEP FORWARD.

150
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,000
- YOU AND NERINE TAUGHT ME THAT.
- WE DID THAT?

151
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,250
- NOT JUST FOR ME,
BUT KAEDE AS WELL.

152
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,458
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT BOTH OF US
LEARN TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.

153
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,875
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME
SEE THAT.

154
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,458
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

155
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,375
- THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED
TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE.

156
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,583
THAT WAY, JUST LIKE
YOU TWO HAVE DONE,

157
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,416
KAEDE AND I CAN EVENTUALLY
FIND HAPPINESS ON OUR OWN.

158
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,333
- ( chuckles )

159
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,416
- I BET YOU'LL FIND IT.
- WE'LL HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN.

160
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,791
- THANKS.

161
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,916
JUDGING BY THOSE NUMBERS
AT THE LEASING OFFICE,

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,333
LIVING ALONE IS GONNA BE
TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT.

163
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,791
RENTING A TEENY APARTMENT
IS GONNA BE EXPENSIVE.

164
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,666
- I'M CERTAIN
YOU CAN HANDLE IT, RIN.

165
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,333
- I DON'T WANNA SEEM PUSHY,

166
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,583
SHOULDN'T I AT LEAST FIGURE
OUT WHAT I'M GONNA SAY TO HER

167
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,500
BEFORE I SEE HER?

168
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,041
- NO!

169
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,750
- THIS IS PROBABLY A BAD IDEA.

170
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,500
- DO YOU NEED A GIFT
FOR SOMEONE?

171
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,708
- AH, I WAS JUST LOOKING.
THANKS.

172
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,833
WELL, I AM GOING
TO VISIT SOMEONE.

173
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,875
- RIN.

174
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,000
- WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE, PRIMULA?

175
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,750
- ( panting )

176
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,291
- ARE YOU OKAY?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

177
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,541
- I CAN'T FIND KAEDE.
- KAEDE'S GONE?

178
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,958
- ( crying ) I MEAN IT.

179
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,208
JUST DIE!

180
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,625
I'M SORRY.

181
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,208
- ( footsteps approaching )

182
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,291
- KAEDE?
- HELLO, ASA.

183
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,166
- ( thunder rumbling )

184
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,083
- IT'S ABOUT TO POUR.

185
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,791
- I CAME HERE TO GIVE YOU THESE.

186
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,375
YOU SHOULD GET INSIDE
BEFORE THE RAIN STARTS.

187
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,583
YOU'RE GONNA CATCH A COLD
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.

188
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,041
- I GUESS YOU KNOW WHY
I'VE BEEN MISSING SCHOOL.

189
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,291
- I'VE JUST BEEN HIDING
IN MY ROOM.

190
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,000
- RIN TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

191
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,666
- BUT, I KINDA KNEW
BEFORE HE TOLD ME.

192
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,000
- I SEE.

193
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,958
- THEN, YOU ALSO KNOW
THAT RIN DECIDED TO MOVE OUT.

194
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,125
- YEAH.

195
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,666
- I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
TO MAKE HIM LOVE ME.

196
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,083
- KAEDE.

197
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,208
- IT'S NOT THAT SURPRISING.

198
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:01,166
SOME OF THE AWFUL THINGS I DID
SHOULDN'T BE FORGIVEN.

199
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,416
NONETHELESS, I TOOK CARE
OF HIS EVERY NEED.

200
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,083
IT WAS ALL I CARED ABOUT.

201
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,375
EVERYTHING I DID WAS FOR RIN.

202
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,708
IT WAS THE ONE THING I COULD
DO TO TRY AND MAKE UP

203
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,208
FOR WHAT I'D DONE.

204
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,166
BUT THEN, AFTER A WHILE,
I REALIZED THAT

205
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,875
WHAT I REALLY WANTED WAS FOR
HIM TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ME.

206
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,958
I WASN'T HONEST WITH MYSELF.

207
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:24,583
EVERYTHING I DID WAS BECAUSE
I WANTED TO BE WITH RIN.

208
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,416
I HAVEN'T BEEN FAIR TO HIM.

209
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,666
THE TRUTH IS I TOOK CARE OF HIM
OUT OF LOVE, NOT DEBT.

210
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,041
DESPITE WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,
I THINK I WILL ALWAYS LOVE HIM.

211
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,500
I WASN'T BEING HONEST.
I WAS AFRAID OF THE TRUTH,

212
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,583
BECAUSE I KNEW HE WOULDN'T
LOVE ME THE SAME WAY BACK.

213
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,791
- BUT HE KNEW, HE KNEW
THAT YOU CARED.

214
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,166
- I CAN NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF
FOR WHAT I DID, NEVER.

215
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,958
IT MAKES SENSE, THOUGH.

216
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,875
I CAN'T BLAME RIN FOR
CHOOSING SOMEONE LIKE YOU

217
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,500
OVER SOMEONE LIKE ME.

218
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:13,750
- I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY, KAEDE.

219
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,375
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

220
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,291
RIN IS A BIG BOY AND IT WAS
HIS CHOICE TO MAKE.

221
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,583
I DECIDED A LONG TIME AGO,

222
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,708
THAT I WOULD CONTINUE TO LOVE
RIN NO MATTER WHO HE CHOSE.

223
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:27,375
- SO, I GUESS, IT'S YOUR JOB
TO MAKE HIM HAPPY NOW.

224
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,166
- KAEDE.

225
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:35,583
- YOU WILL MAKE HIM HAPPY, WON'T
YOU? BECAUSE RIN DESERVES IT.

226
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,666
- I CERTAINLY PLAN TO,
BUT SO FAR,

227
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,875
HE'S BEEN THE ONE
MAKING ME HAPPY.

228
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,083
- I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.
YOU REALLY HAVE FALLEN FOR HIM,

229
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,083
HAVEN'T YOU, ASA?

230
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,583
- HE CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

231
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,875
- I HATE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE
SUFFERING HE WENT THROUGH

232
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,583
BECAUSE OF ME.

233
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,625
BUT IF YOU MAKE HIM HAPPY,

234
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,000
I THINK IN SOME WAY IT'LL
SORT OF MAKE UP FOR IT.

235
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,458
- KAEDE.

236
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:03,000
- ASA, I NEED YOU TO LET ME
MAKE ONE SELFISH REQUEST.

237
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,250
- I WANT TO SEE HIM.

238
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:09,208
IF I'M ABLE TO JUST SEE HIM.
I CAN KEEP ON LOVING HIM.

239
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,625
I KNOW HE'S NOT MINE,

240
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,833
HE'S NEVER BEEN MINE,
BUT I NEED TO KEEP LOVING HIM.

241
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,041
( crying )

242
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,125
- KAEDE.

243
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:24,041
- I'M SO SORRY, ASA.
I KNOW IT'S SELFISH.

244
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,458
I JUST... I KNOW HOW RIN FEELS.

245
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,083
AND ASA, I KNOW
THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

246
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,625
BUT I STILL... I'M SO SORRY.

247
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,833
- STOP THAT. IF ANYBODY
IS SELFISH, IT'S ME.

248
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,541
I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT
FROM THE BEGINNING.

249
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,708
YOU'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH RIN
FOR AS LONG AS I'VE KNOWN YOU.

250
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,500
I'M SORRY. FORGIVE ME.

251
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,666
- KAEDE?

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,833
- KAEDE? KAEDE!

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,125
- HI, RIN.

254
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,833
- WHAT HAPPENED? I'VE BEEN
WORRIED SICK.

255
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,416
- I'M SORRY YOU WERE WORRIED.

256
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,666
- TELL ME WHERE YOU'VE BEEN.
YOU'RE SOAKING WET.

257
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,541
- ASA AND I GOT CAUGHT
IN THE RAIN.

258
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,333
- I ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.

259
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,458
- HUH?

260
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,208
- I NEEDED TO MAKE SURE.

261
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:43,041
SINCE, I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO IT ANY LONGER.

262
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,708
- KAEDE. JUST LISTEN.

263
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,250
- I THINK I'M FALLING
IN LOVE WITH...

264
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,916
- DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD!

265
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,625
- PLEASE, RIN. I CAN'T HEAR IT
FROM YOU. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

266
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,708
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT.
NOT FROM YOU.

267
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,791
- NOW HOLD ON, THAT ISN'T FAIR.

268
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,958
YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS. RIGHT
NOW, FROM ME, AND NO ONE ELSE.

269
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,416
- ( crying )

270
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,208
- I'M IN LOVE WITH ASA, KAEDE.

271
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,500
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF
THINKING,

272
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,416
ABOUT US, THE OTHER GIRLS,

273
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,833
AND ABOUT DECISIONS I'VE
BEEN NEEDING TO MAKE.

274
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:24,458
I ASKED MYSELF, WHO IS IT THAT I
WANT TO BE CLOSEST TO RIGHT NOW.

275
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,541
AND WHO IS IT THAT
I REALLY LOVE THE MOST?

276
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,125
- AND YOU REALIZED
THAT SOMEONE WASN'T ME.

277
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:35,500
- PLEASE UNDERSTAND.
YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME, KAEDE.

278
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,625
WE'VE SPENT MOST OF
OUR LIVES TOGETHER.

279
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,125
YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN ANYONE.

280
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,833
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME.

281
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,750
- ( camera clicks )

282
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,750
- YOU'RE ONE OF MY
CLOSEST FRIENDS.

283
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,541
I COULD NEVER HATE YOU,
EVEN FOR A MINUTE.

284
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,333
AND I HOPE YOU'LL NEVER HATE ME.

285
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,416
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LOVE
YOU ROMANTICALLY,

286
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,166
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, KAEDE.

287
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,083
- PLEASE, DON'T SAY YOU LOVE ME.

288
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,000
PLEASE DON'T, RIN.
DON'T YOU DARE LOVE ME.

289
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,625
NOT LIKE THAT.
NOT THAT WAY.

290
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,958
- DON'T.
- KAEDE.

291
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:28,625
- PLEASE DON'T LOVE ME.
- I'M SO SORRY.

292
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:34,083
- PLEASE DON'T LOVE ME. I DON'T
KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO...

293
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,291
( sighs )

294
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,708
( crying ) I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

295
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,000
I'M BACK.

296
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,541
- WELCOME HOME, KAEDE.

297
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,541
- HMM? WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU'RE ALL MESSY.

298
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,000
- YEAH, I MADE DINNER.

299
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,916
YOU'RE ALL WET. YOU MUST BE
FREEZING. I'LL GET YOU A TOWEL.

300
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,375
I MADE STEW BECAUSE I FIGURED
YOU'D PROBABLY BE

301
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,875
COLD AND HUNGRY, AND STEW'S
GOOD FOR THAT.

302
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,291
OKAY, YOU MAKE IT BETTER,
BUT I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME.

303
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,666
- THANK YOU.

304
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,166
- Asa: I SEE. I NEVER REALIZED
THERE WAS SO MUCH HISTORY

305
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,916
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

306
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,916
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED
YOU ABOUT IT SO CASUALLY. SORRY.

307
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,916
- IT'S OKAY. AT THE TIME,

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,958
THE ONLY THING I CARED ABOUT
WAS MAKING SURE

309
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,416
KAEDE DIDN'T HURT
HERSELF, YOU KNOW?

310
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,208
- TYPICAL RIN BEHAVIOR.

311
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,125
- WHAT CAN I SAY? I FOLLOW
MY INSTINCTS.

312
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,541
- I KNOW HOW SHE FELT.
I'VE BEEN THERE.

313
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,166
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.

314
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,375
THERE WAS NO WAY KAEDE
COULD "HATE" ANYONE,

315
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,791
ESPECIALLY YOU.

316
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,000
I REMEMBER BACK IN
MIDDLE SCHOOL,

317
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,125
WHEN SHE AND I WERE IN
THE COOKING CLUB TOGETHER,

318
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,666
ONE DAY I ASKED HER
WHY SHE JOINED THE CLUB.

319
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,583
SHE SAID THERE WAS SOMEONE
WHO HAD BEEN VERY GOOD TO HER.

320
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,791
AND SHE WANTED A WAY
TO SAY THANK YOU.

321
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD SAID
AND DONE HORRIBLE THINGS

322
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,625
TO THAT PERSON.

323
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,458
BUT SHE ALSO SAID
THAT SAME PERSON

324
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,500
MADE HER WHO SHE IS TODAY.

325
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,500
SO, I KNEW YOU WERE THE
ONE SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT

326
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,000
ALL THOSE YEARS.

327
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,291
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME
WAS WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

328
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,250
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

329
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,083
SO, I DECIDED TO ASK,
BUT IT WASN'T MY PLACE.

330
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,791
- YES, IT WAS. I'M GLAD
THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT IT.

331
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,625
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW, ASA.

332
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,500
- YOU DID? HOW COME?
- BECAUSE IT WAS IMPORTANT.

333
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,541
AND I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY
FOR SOME OF THE SAME REASON

334
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,375
YOU WANTED ME TO TELL YOU.

335
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:39,541
- WOW, I THINK YOU'RE BLUSHING.
- NO, IT'S JUST HOT TODAY.

336
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,875
- QUIT TRYING TO EMBARRASS ME

337
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,416
AND JUST TELL ME WHY YOU
ASKED ME TO MEET YOU HERE.

338
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
DID YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING?

339
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:50,250
- WELL, YES, I DID. I TOLD KAEDE
ABOUT MY FEELINGS FOR YOU.

340
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,500
I MADE SURE SHE HEARD IT
STRAIGHT FROM ME.

341
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,291
THEN, I REALIZED, I HADN'T
TALKED TO YOU EITHER.

342
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,291
ASA SHIGURE.

343
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,833
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I LOVE YOU.

344
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,208
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU,
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

345
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,625
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

346
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,541
- WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE,
ABOUT BEING HATED BY KAEDE.

347
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,291
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
INCREDIBLY PAINFUL,

348
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,458
TO ENDURE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

349
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,625
- I'D BE LYING IF I TRIED
TO TELL YOU IT WASN'T PAINFUL.

350
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,708
BUT AT THE TIME, I JUST WANTED
TO PROTECT KAEDE.

351
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,833
- EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS BEING
SO MEAN TO YOU?

352
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,166
- YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

353
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,291
WHEN YOU CARE FOR SOMEONE,
YOU PUT UP WITH A LOT.

354
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,875
- YOU'RE STRONG.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIN?

355
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,250
- WELL, I DON'T REALLY
SEE IT THAT WAY.

356
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,125
- OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE VERY STRONG.

357
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,708
ALMOST AS STRONG AS SHE IS.

358
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,750
- AS WHO?

359
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,750
- IS IT REALLY THAT
BIG A MYSTERY?

360
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,125
I OWE HER EVERYTHING.
SHE PUT UP WITH ALL THE PAIN,

361
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,291
ALL OF THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS
I SAID AND SHE NEVER COMPLAINED.

362
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,666
ALL SHE CARED ABOUT WAS
PROTECTING HER LITTLE GIRL.

363
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,750
SO, DO YOU PROMISE THAT
YOU'LL TRY TO PROTECT ME, RIN?

364
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,083
JUST LIKE SHE HAS, THE
PERSON I ADMIRE MORE

365
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,208
THAN ANYONE
ELSE IN THIS WORLD?

366
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,375
- I PROMISE. I'LL PROTECT YOU.

367
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,000
- WELL, THAT WAS QUITE
AN IMPRESSIVE DELIVERY.

368
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,666
NOW, I AM DEFINITELY BLUSHING,

369
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,708
AND I THINK MY HEART MAY HAVE
JUST SKIPPED A BEAT OR TWO.

370
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,125
OKAY. WELL, RIN,
HERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

371
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,291
- ( theme song playing )

372
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

373
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,625
- Sia: WE ALL GOT TO MEET RIN.

374
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,583
- Nerine: AND WE TOLD
HIM HOW WE FELT.

375
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:25,541
- Primula: AND NOW, ALL OF US.
- Kaede: WILL WALK TOGETHER.

376
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,541
- Asa: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE,
EPISODE 22,

377
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,083
"TOWARDS A NEW TOMORROW."
