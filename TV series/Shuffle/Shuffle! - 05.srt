1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,125
- ( thunder rumbling )

4
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,583
- ( sniffling )

5
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,708
- I... I HATE YOU!

6
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,333
( screaming )

7
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,458
- Rin: KAEDE!

8
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,500
- YES? WHAT IS IT, RIN?
WHAT'S WRONG?

9
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,125
WELL, ANYWAY, IT'S TIME
TO WAKE UP NOW, SLEEPY HEAD.

10
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,541
- Woman: THIS MORNING
WILL BE CLEAR,

11
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,416
EXCEPT FOR A FEW LIGHT
SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON.

12
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,083
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD
IDEA TO HAVE YOUR...

13
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,916
- HEY, RIN? UM, WHAT WERE YOU
DREAMING ABOUT? WHEN I WOKE YOU?

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,625
- 'CUSE ME? THAT'S AN
INTERESTING QUESTION. WHY?

15
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,000
- DON'T YOU REMEMBER, SILLY?
YOU CALLED OUT MY NAME.

16
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,166
- ( exclaiming )

17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,875
- COME ON, TELL ME.
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?

18
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,541
- WELL, I... I JUST
DON'T KNOW IF I REMEMBER.

19
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,250
OH, WAIT! I REMEMBER NOW!

20
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,291
YOU WERE ALMOST ABDUCTED
BY ALIENS THAT MUTILATED COWS!

21
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,291
THEY HAD BIG SCARY BROWN EYES

22
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,000
THAT COULD SEE
RIGHT THROUGH YOU!

23
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,750
- YOU JUST MADE THAT WHOLE
ENTIRE THING UP, DIDN'T YOU?

24
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,166
- MAYBE.

25
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,708
ANYWAY, ENOUGH ABOUT THAT.
HOW ARE YOU DOING LATELY?

26
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,541
YOU KNOW, YOU DO
ALL THE HOUSEWORK,

27
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,291
YOU MAKE HUGE
BREAKFASTS EVERY DAY,

28
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,791
PLUS ALL OF OUR LUNCHES,

29
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,000
AND THEN YOU STILL FIND
TIME TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

30
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,458
HOW DO YOU DO IT? DO YOU SLEEP?

31
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,208
- OF COURSE I DO!

32
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,333
AND I WAKE UP FEELING
VERY WELL RESTED!

33
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:26,166
- REALLY? WELL, SINCE YOUR
FATHER'S AWAY ON BUSINESS

34
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,250
YOU CAN MAKE SMALLER MEALS
IF YOU WANT.

35
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,916
JUST TAKE IT EASY AND
DON'T WORK SO HARD.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,958
- DON'T SAY THAT.

37
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,916
I ENJOY TAKING CARE OF YOU, RIN.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,208
IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY AND
IF YOU TOOK THAT AWAY...

39
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,791
( crying ) I DON'T' KNOW
WHAT I'D DO. SORRY.

40
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,458
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

41
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,166
- ALL RIGHT! I'M SORRY!
DO WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY!

42
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,208
- ( cheerfully ) OKAY!
SO, FOR LUNCH TODAY

43
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,000
I MADE BROILED BLACK COD
WITH SAIKYO MISO SAUCE!

44
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,458
AND DINNER TONIGHT
IS GOING TO BE GREAT!

45
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,333
IN HONOR OF THE SPECIAL THING
THAT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY.

46
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,958
- WHAT WAS THAT?

47
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,333
- YOU HAD A DREAM ABOUT
ME THIS MORNING.

48
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,333
THAT'S SPECIAL TO ME!

49
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,791
- IT'S GONNA SHAKE.

50
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,083
- ( both exclaim )

51
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,375
- ( rumbling )

52
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,125
- AN EARTHQUAKE!

53
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,416
- WHERE'S MY PURSE?
RIN! GRAB YOUR WALLET!

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,916
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT
NOW! GET UNDER THE TABLE,

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,291
OR OUT OF THE HOUSE!

56
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,291
- YOU WANT ME TO TAKE
THE TABLE OUT OF THE HOUSE?

57
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,833
- NO, UNDER THE...

58
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,083
NEVER MIND, JUST COVER YOUR
MOUTH WITH A WET HANDKERCHIEF!

59
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,250
- BUT ALL OF THE HANDKERCHIEFS
ARE DIRTY AND NEED TO BE WASHED!

60
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,291
- ( Rin screams )

61
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,708
- Both: UH, IT'S OVER.

62
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,583
- ARE YOU OKAY? PRIMULA?

63
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,375
- MORE PLEASE.

64
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,541
- ( sighs )

65
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,250
- ( frightened cry )

66
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,500
- ( screeching )

67
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,000
- YOU BETTER RUN,

68
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,916
I'M A MEMBER OF THE KNIGHTS
OF KISSY KAEDE, OR THE KKK!

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,208
NOT THE BAD GUYS WITH SHEETS.
AND BROTHER NUMBER ONE!

70
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,375
- I BELONG TO THE
SEXY SIA SOLDIERS! OR SSS!

71
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,541
SCIENCE CLUB VICE PRESIDENT!
AND BROTHER NUMBER TWO!

72
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,833
- I'M A MEMBER OF
RINA'S RANDY RAIDERS, THE RRR!

73
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,750
SCIENCE CLUB TREASURER!
AND BROTHER NUMBER THREE!

74
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,208
- ( together ) TOGETHER
THE THREE OF US...

75
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,333
- HM.
- HA HA.

76
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,750
- HA.

77
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,666
- ARE THE NAKABAYASHI BROTHERS
PERSONAL GUARD UNIT!

78
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,625
- OH, NO!

79
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,708
- PREPARE TO MEET YOUR FATE,
RIN TSUCHIMI!

80
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,416
- WE'VE COLLECTED THE
ATHLETIC TEAM'S SMELLIEST SOCKS!

81
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,625
AND WE'RE GOING TO
SHOWER YOU WITH THEIR STENCH!

82
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,125
- NO WOMAN ON THIS EARTH
WILL EVER COME NEAR YOU AGAIN!

83
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,125
- DIVINE PUNISHMENT!

84
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,333
- WE'LL PUNISH ANYONE WHO
CAUSES TROUBLE FOR RIN!

85
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,666
NOW YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE!

86
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,583
- YOU'RE LUCKY. NEXT TIME
IT'LL BE A BENCH!

87
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,708
- STUPID BROTHERS!

88
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,750
- I'M SO SORRY, RIN!
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF US!

89
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,875
- PLEASE FORGIVE US.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,

90
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,375
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

91
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,458
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. BELIEVE
ME, I'M USED TO IT BY NOW.

92
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,083
- YOU TWO SAVED MY LIFE. THANKS.

93
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,000
- HUH?
- ( giggles ) NO PROBLEM!

94
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,083
- ( metal clanking )

95
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,208
- ( clock chiming )

96
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,333
- THAT'S THE BELL!
- WE'RE GONNA BE LATE!

97
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,583
- LET'S GO! KAEDE!

98
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,833
- 'KAY, I'M COMING.

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,458
( whimpers )

100
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,291
- ( footsteps retreating )

101
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,625
- ALRIGHT. I'M PUTTING ALL THIS
ON YOUR NEXT EXAM.

102
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,041
AND SINCE I'M TELLING YOU
EXACTLY WHAT WILL BE ON IT,

103
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,125
YOU SHOULDN'T GET IT WRONG,

104
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,541
UNLESS YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

105
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,375
- ( whimpers )
GREAT! RIN, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

106
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,666
I'M GONNA GET IT WRONG
ANYWAY, I KNOW IT.

107
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,500
- IT'S OKAY, WE'RE BOTH
IN THE SAME BOAT. DON'T WORRY.

108
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,333
- TSUCHI! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF!

109
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,208
- ( giggling )

110
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,833
- RIN!
- Nerine: RIN...

111
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,416
I WROTE DOWN ALL THE NOTES,
AND I'LL LET YOU COPY THEM LATER

112
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
IF YOU WANT TO USE THEM
TO STUDY WITH TONIGHT.

113
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,041
- RINA! CAN I
USE THEM TOO, PLEASE?

114
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,916
- ( clock chiming )

115
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,666
- I'M SO HUNGRY!

116
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,541
- GIVE IT TO HIM! THIS IS WHAT
YOU MADE IT FOR, ISN'T IT?

117
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,958
- UH-HUH.

118
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,375
- UH. WHAT IS IT?

119
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,458
- HERE'S YOUR LUNCH, RIN.

120
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,875
I MADE THIS FOR YOU, SO ...

121
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,041
- GOOD JOB, I'M IMPRESSED!

122
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,833
ALL OF THAT AFTER ONLY A
FEW LESSONS? WAY TO GO!

123
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:06,916
- ( laughing sheepishly )

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,041
- BUT, WHY DID YOU MAKE SO MUCH?

125
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,541
- WELL, I KIND OF GOT A LITTLE
CARRIED AWAY. BUT, HERE.

126
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,000
- IS THAT AN OMELET?

127
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,208
- THINK SO.

128
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,708
- THAT'S NOT ALL. LOOK.

129
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,833
- OH, IT'S...
IT'S ANOTHER OMELET.

130
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,958
- NOT THAT.

131
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:28,958
THERE'S SOY SAUCE!

132
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,583
- SO IT'S LIKE QUANTITY
OVER VARIETY.

133
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:37,041
- YES! WHEN I SEE THAT BOWL
OF SLIMY MIXED YELLOW EGGS

134
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,916
TURN INTO SUCH A
BEAUTIFUL FLUFFY LIGHT OMELET

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,625
I SOMEHOW FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE SHOWING ME

136
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,708
THE FEELINGS IN MY HEART

137
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,416
CAN TURN INTO SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL, TOO,

138
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,333
AND THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY!

139
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:50,333
- THANKS. UH, I DON'T KNOW IF I
CAN EAT THE WHOLE THING, THOUGH.

140
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,041
- ( moans )

141
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,500
- ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I'M SO HUNGRY,

142
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,000
I COULD EAT ABOUT NINE OF THESE!

143
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,625
- ( laughs ) DO YOU
MEAN THAT, RIN? REALLY?

144
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,166
- OH, YEAH, I DO, EVERY WORD!
IT SMELLS DELICIOUS!

145
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,750
( munching )

146
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,583
IT'S SO GOOD, I LOVE IT!

147
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,333
- ( thunder rumbling )

148
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:20,958
- Itsuki: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

149
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,250
- ATE TOO MUCH.

150
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,208
- RIN, YOU'RE TRAGIC.

151
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,958
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GET A
WOMAN TO KNOW HER PLACE

152
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,583
AND ACTUALLY COOK SOMETHING.

153
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,250
SO WHEN SHE DOES, YOU HAVE
TO REWARD HER BY EATING IT.

154
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,500
EVEN IF IT'S GROSS.

155
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,916
- ( clattering )

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,708
- WHAT'S TRAGIC IS THAT OUTDATED
MISOGYNIST VIEWPOINT, YOU PIG.

157
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,083
- WHATEVER. I'M JUST SAYIN'
YOU SHOULD NEVER REJECT

158
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,166
A GOOD WOMAN'S LOVE LIKE THAT.

159
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,166
I KNOW I WON'T.

160
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,833
POOR RIN, HE'S STILL GOT A LOT
TO LEARN ABOUT THE LADIES,

161
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,000
DON'TCHA BIG GUY?

162
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,000
- Kaede: THAT'S NOT TRUE.

163
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,541
HERE YOU GO.
TAKE THIS. IT'S MEDICINE.

164
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,875
- OH. THANKS, KAEDE.
THAT HELPS.

165
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,875
- RIN ALWAYS TREATS
EVERYONE RIGHT.

166
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,125
THAT'S WHY WE LIKE HIM SO MUCH.

167
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,791
ANYWAY. I'M GONNA GO GET SOME
WATER. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

168
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,041
- HE DOESN'T NEED
ANY WATER, DOES HE?

169
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,750
- ( grunting )

170
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,750
- HE NEEDS A TASTE OF REAL LIFE.

171
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,083
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO BECOME A MAN!

172
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,458
- GET OFF ME!

173
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,166
- OW!

174
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,416
- ( Rin and Mayumi sneeze )

175
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,166
- WOW. IT'S REALLY RAINING HARD.

176
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,875
- AND I FORGOT MY UMBRELLA.
NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

177
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,166
- MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
GIVE UP AND GET WET.

178
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,291
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SHOULD
GIVE UP, RIN TSUCHIMI!

179
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,125
- ( together ) BUT
WE NEVER WILL!

180
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,791
WE ARE THE NAKABAYASHI BROTHERS
PERSONAL GUARD UNIT!

181
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,416
TURBO ONE!

182
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
- ( explosion )

183
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,458
- Asa: WHOA!
THERE THEY GO AGAIN.

184
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,041
- IT LOOKS BAD OUT THERE.
I HOPE RIN IS OKAY.

185
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,000
- WAIT A MINUTE. DON'T YOU
USUALLY WALK HOME TOGETHER?

186
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,750
- I, UH, REALLY NEED TO
LEARN THIS NEW RECIPE.

187
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:18,041
- AWW! I HOPE RIN KNOWS
HOW LUCKY HE IS!

188
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:22,333
- WELL, IT'S, UM... IT'S ALL
I CAN DO TO SHOW HIM I CARE.

189
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,708
- HUH?
- NOTHING.

190
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,833
- ( door opens )

191
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,000
- THANK YOU, ASA!

192
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,166
- ( door closes )

193
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,833
- NO PROBLEM.
GOOD LUCK!

194
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,083
- OH, NO.

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,083
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

196
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,708
- ( gasping )

197
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,250
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

198
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,791
- ( grinding )
- WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

199
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,416
UH, PRIMULA?

200
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,458
- WHAT, RIN?

201
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,583
- NEVER MIND.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

202
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,541
WHERE'S KAEDE?

203
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,416
- I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER YET.

204
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,708
- UH, KAEDE?

205
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,541
- ( clanking )

206
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,583
- KAEDE!

207
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,833
OH, MY GOSH, WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU OKAY?

208
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,833
SHE'S GOT A FEVER! KAEDE!

209
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,625
WAKE UP! KAEDE!

210
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,833
- Doctor: IT'S JUST A COMMON
COLD THAT GOT OUT OF HAND

211
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,083
DUE TO OVEREXERTION.

212
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,250
SEE THAT SHE GETS
AS MUCH REST AS POSSIBLE.

213
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,291
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

214
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,333
KAEDE.

215
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,041
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND
FINISH MAKING BREAKFAST MYSELF.

216
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,291
KAEDE'S GONNA NEED SOMETHING
TO REPLENISH HER STRENGTH

217
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,458
WHEN SHE WAKES UP.

218
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,208
- SO CAN YOU GIVE
ME A HAND HERE?

219
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,250
- UM-HMM.

220
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,500
- UGH!

221
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,291
I DON'T GET IT. WHY DOESN'T
MINE LOOK LIKE THAT?

222
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,625
- BECAUSE YOU SUCK, RIN.

223
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,125
- KAEDE'S GONNA BE PISSED.

224
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,416
I GIVE UP.

225
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,166
NO! THIS IS STUPID! I'M A
MAN, DAMMIT, I CAN DO THIS!

226
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,875
WHAT THE CRAP? FIRE!

227
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,083
PRIMULA, GET ME SOME WATER!
HURRY, I NEED WATER!

228
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,125
- ( sizzling )

229
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,750
- THAT'S REALLY DANGEROUS.

230
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,250
YOU SHOULD NEVER EVER USE
WATER ON A GREASE FIRE.

231
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,541
- I KNEW THAT.

232
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,291
- I'M SORRY. THIS IS
ALL MY FAULT.

233
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,000
I'LL DO THE REST. DON'T
WORRY ABOUT A THING, OKAY?

234
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,541
- PLEASE, GO BACK TO BED,
YOU NEED YOUR...

235
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,000
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT SCHOOL?

236
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,708
- UH, ACTUALLY, NO,
I ALREADY CALLED IN.

237
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,250
- OH, NO! YOU STAYED HOME FROM
SCHOOL TODAY BECAUSE OF ME?

238
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,625
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

239
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,958
I'M SORRY. I'VE CAUSED YOU
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

240
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,833
- HEY, DON'T YOU
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

241
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,166
YOU GET BACK TO YOUR ROOM
AND LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS.

242
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,250
- OH, I'M FINE, REALLY!

243
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,041
I'LL FINISH COOKING THE...

244
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,208
- KAEDE!

245
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,333
THIS IS WHY WE SAID
NOT TO PUSH YOURSELF.

246
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,625
- YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

247
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,666
- ( doorbell ringing )

248
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,208
- HEY, GUYS, WE BROUGHT

251
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,000
- WHAT ARE YOU-

252
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,833
- ASA, WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

253
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,416
- WE KNEW YOU WOULD BE TOO SICK
TO COOK FOR EVERYONE,

254
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,458
SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD
COME AND HELP OUT.

255
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,708
- LOOK AT ALL THIS
FOOD WE BROUGHT.

256
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,916
I'M SURE WE CAN MAKE
SOMETHING YOU LIKE.

257
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,833
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

258
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,916
BUT TAKING CARE OF EVERYONE
HERE IS MY JOB, SO I'D RATHER...

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,875

260
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,625
- THANK YOU.
THAT MEANS A LOT.

261
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,541
I KNOW KAEDE APPRECIATES IT.

262
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:28,791
- ( girls giggling )

263
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,166
- EXCUSE US!
- MOVE IT.

264
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,250
OKAY! WE NEED TO
MAKE HER SOMETHING

265
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,250
THAT'LL HELP HER FEEL BETTER

266
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,916
AND GIVE HER ENERGY AS WELL!

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,958
- ( cracking )

268
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,708
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'VE GOT THIS,

269
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,625
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO ASK
SIA IF SHE NEEDS SOME HELP

270
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:57,666
WITH THE CLEANING,
'KAY? BYE BYE NOW!

271
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,625
WITH THE CLEANING,
'KAY? BYE BYE NOW!

272
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,750
- OHHHHH!

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,541
- ( vacuum cleaner whirring )

274
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,166
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

275
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,250

276
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:18,208

IT HURTS! STOP SUCKING SO HARD!

278
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,333
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH, RIMU?

279
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:39,166
- LATELY, I'M SPENDING
LESS TIME WITH RIN.

280
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,875
I HATE BEING SICK SO MUCH.

281
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,000
BEFORE THEY CAME...

282
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,166
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO TOOK CARE OF HIM.

283
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,291
I WONDER IF...

284
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,291
HE LIKES THE OTHER GIRLS BETTER.

285
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,583
- ( knock on door )

286
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,375
- KAEDE?

287
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,958
- ( giggling )

288
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,708
WOW, ASA! NO WONDER YOU'RE
CALLED "THE SHOCKING SHIGURE!"

289
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,708
- "THE SHOCKING SHIGURE?"
WHAT? WHAT'S THAT?

290
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,041
- IT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T
REALLY COME OFF AS SOMEONE

291
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,625
WHO'D BE SUCH AN AMAZING COOK,

292
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,666
BUT YOU ARE, SO YOU'VE BEEN THE
"SHOCKING SHIGURE" EVER SINCE!

293
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,958
- THAT'S SHOCKING.

294
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,750
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT
ME TO HAVE AN UGLY NAME?

295
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,958
- ( screams ) WHAT IS THAT?

296
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,250
- HMM, LOOKS LIKE OKRA NATTO.

297
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,166
- I'VE NEVER IMAGINED
ANYTHING SO HORRIBLE!

298
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,166
THE OKRA'S RUINED BY THE NATTO!
IT'S TOO CRUEL!

299
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,375
WHO KNEW THAT PEOPLE COULD
DO SUCH TERRIBLE THINGS

300
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:56,500
TO INNOCENT FOOD IN
THIS WORLD! IT'S AWFUL!

301
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,458
- SOMETHING WITH A REALLY WEIRD
TEXTURE IS INSIDE THIS OMELET.

302
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,083
WHAT IS THAT?
IT TASTES FUNNY.

303
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,000
- WELL, IT'S NOT JUST AN OMELET.

304
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,250
THOSE ARE EGG DUMPLINGS
WITH DICED OCTOPUS.

305
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,583
- ( crying )

306
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,833
- I GUESS YOU
DON'T LIKE OCTOPUS.

307
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,083
- "THE SHOCKING SHIGURE?"

308
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,208
- NATTO IS SO HATEFUL! WHY?

309
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,333
- OCTOPUS?

310
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,375
( crying )

311
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,250
- WHERE'S KAEDE?
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

312
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,875
- SHE SAID SHE WASN'T HUNGRY.
SHE'S SLEEPING.

313
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,666
- ( girls giggling )

314
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,291
- HE DOESN'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

315
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,583
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.

316
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,916
- ( giggling ) OH, RIN,
THERE'S NO NEED TO THANK US!

317
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,666
- YEAH, IT WAS NOTHING.

318
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,041
- I TRIED REALLY HARD, BUT I
WASN'T ABLE TO DO ANYTHING.

319
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:48,916
I'M SORRY.

320
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
- COME ON, DON'T SAY THAT.

321
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,541
YOU MADE THINGS A LOT
EASIER, TRUST ME.

322
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,291
- I MADE THINGS EASIER?

323
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,208
- UH, OF COURSE.

324
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,250
- ( giggling ) WE SHOULD
BE GOING, YOU GUYS.

325
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,833
- WE'LL SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL TOMORROW!

326
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,208
- MAKE SURE YOU
TAKE CARE OF KAEDE, 'KAY?

327
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,875
ANYONE CAN TAKE
MEDICINE TO HEAL THEIR BODY.

328
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,750
BUT I THINK YOU MAY
BE THE ONLY ONE

329
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,500
WHO CAN CURE HER BROKEN HEART.

330
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,583
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

331
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,791
SEE YOU LATER, 'KAY!

332
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,000
- THANKS FOR MAKING THIS.

333
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,625
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD
HAVE DINNER TOGETHER.

334
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,083
JUST YOU AND I,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

335
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,375
- REALLY?

336
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,500
SORRY ABOUT THE
TROUBLE TODAY, RIN.

337
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,458
- LISTEN, THE ONLY
TROUBLE YOU'RE CAUSING

338
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,416
IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH REST.

339
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,666
- RIN? DO YOU LIKE
HAVING ME AROUND?

340
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,791
I MEAN, OR DO I JUST
GET IN YOUR WAY?

341
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,666
- KAEDE.

342
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,250
- I THINK...

343
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,125
YOU DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

344
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,750
- ( rumbling )

345
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,666
- ( exclaiming )

346
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,083
- ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE!

347
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,541
- RIN! I, UH...
I NEED TO...

348
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,250
- KAEDE, LISTEN.
THANK YOU.

349
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,083
I REALLY...
I APPRECIATE YOU.

350
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,541
- ARE YOU SURE?
I'M NOT A BURDEN TO YOU?

351
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,083
- NO WAY!

352
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,916
I'M A COMPLETE WRECK WITHOUT
YOU. ARE YOU KIDDING?

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,291
- IF THAT'S TRUE,

354
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,291
IS IT OKAY IF I KEEP TAKING
CARE OF YOU FROM NOW ON?

355
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,291
- ALRIGHT, ON ONE CONDITION.

356
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,375
- SLACK OFF EVERY ONCE
AND AWHILE, YOU KNOW?

357
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,583
GET SOME SLEEP.

358
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,458
OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST
GONNA GET SICK AGAIN

359
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,583
AND I'LL END UP BURNING
THE HOUSE DOWN, OKAY?

360
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,791
- 'KAY!

361
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,416
TIME TO WAKE UP, RIN!

362
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,458
- ( curtains shuffling )

363
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,666
- MORNING.

364
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,125
- THERE'S A NICE HOT BREAKFAST
ALL READY FOR YOU.

365
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,958
- 'KAY, ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

366
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,458
YEAH! I TOOK THE MEDICINE
RIMU MADE FOR ME

367
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,750
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,
I WAS COMPLETELY WELL!

368
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,208
- SHE MADE YOU MEDICINE?

369
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,875
ALRIGHT, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
WHAT SHE WAS GRINDING IN THERE.

370
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,875
- HERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES, OKAY?
HURRY UP AND COME DOWN.

371
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,500
IF YOU WAIT TOO LONG,
YOUR BREAKFAST'LL GET COLD.

372
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,500
- WHAT HAPPENED TO LAST NIGHT?

373
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,500
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO GO EASY ON YOURSELF.

374
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,083
- I DID! I SLEPT IN TODAY!

375
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,541
I USUALLY GET UP
AT AROUND 4:30 OR SO.

376
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,916
BUT INSTEAD I SLEPT IN
UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK!

377
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,625
- OH.

378
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,583
- ( giggles ) FOR SOME REASON,
WHEN I SLEEP MORE,

379
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,708
IT MAKES ME MORE TIRED.

380
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,208
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

381
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,750
SO, DO YOU THINK IT
WOULD BE ALL RIGHT

382
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,166
IF I GOT UP AT 4:30
AGAIN TOMORROW?

383
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,500
- I GUESS.

384
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,750
- I'LL BE WAITING FOR
YOU DOWNSTAIRS, OKAY?

385
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,041
- ( sneezing )

386
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,041
- ( theme song playing )

387
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

388
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,291
- Sia: I CAN'T DECIDE
WHICH CHAIR IS BEST.

389
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,541
- Rin: HOW 'BOUT THIS ONE?

390
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,291
- THAT'S NOT QUITE
STRONG ENOUGH.

391
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,750
- STRONG ENOUGH?
- I'LL HAVE TO TEST IT OUT!

392
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,666
- ( Sia grunts )
- WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING?

393
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,958
- NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE!
EPISODE 6. SMILE!

394
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,458
I THINK I LIKE THIS ONE.

395
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,291
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
GOOD CHOICE.
