1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,958
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,000
- ( laughter )

4
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,833
- Eustoma: GIVE IT UP, MABOU!

5
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,083
- ( laughter continues )

6
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,541
- Eustoma: I'M GAINING
ON YOU, BUDDY!

7
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,583
- AT THAT PACE
YOU'LL NEVER GET ME!

8
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,041
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.

9
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,208
MISSED ME AGAIN!

10
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,958
- OKAY. IF THAT'S WHAT
THEY WANT TO DO HERE.

11
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,375
- NEXT!

12
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:22,125
- Kaede: THERE YOU ARE!
I'M SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT!

13
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,791
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
WE COULD DO ABOUT IT.

14
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,583
THE CHANGING ROOM WAS FULL,

15
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,708
WE WERE HAVING TROUBLE
MOVING AROUND IN THERE.

16
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,208
- WHOA!

17
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,750
- ( exclaims )

18
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,666
- LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS DID
A GOOD JOB OF FINDING A SPOT.

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,083
- YES, IT'S PERFECT!
BUT I'M SORRY I WASN'T

20
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,041
HERE IN TIME TO HELP
YOU BOYS SET THINGS UP.

21
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,333
- IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
CHIVALROUS OF THEM

22
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,583
IF THEY'D MADE YOU HELP.

23
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,333
BESIDES, ISN'T THIS,
"A MAN'S JOB?"

24
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,250
- ( all groaning )

25
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,125
- WHAT? WHY'D YOU CREEPS
SUDDENLY HAVE TO BE SO

26
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,541
LET DOWN WHEN
I WALKED OUT HERE!

27
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,416
- Sia: I'M BACK! RIN, I'M
WEARING MY NEW BATHING SUIT!

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,583
CHECK ME OUT!

29
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,958
( giggles )

30
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,333
- WOW. SIA, IT LOOKS
AMAZING ON YOU!

31
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,750
IT'S GREAT.

32
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,500
- THANK YOU! I WAS REALLY HOPING
THAT YOU'D LIKE THIS ONE ON ME!

33
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,166
I HAD TROUBLE CHOOSING.

34
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,833
- THAT GIRL'S ON FIRE!

35
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,583
- YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING
SOME INTERESTING VIBES

36
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,958
OFF OF THOSE TWO.

37
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,958
- BUT HE'S NICE TO EVERYONE.

38
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,000
- WELL, I MEAN, HOW CAN
HE NOT DROOL AT THE SIGHT

39
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,708
OF THESE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM?

40
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,083
IT'S INSULTING FOR HIM NOT
TO COMPLIMENT ALL OF US.

41
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,541
AM I RIGHT, KAEDE?

42
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,166
- WHAT? WELL,
IT'S JUST THAT...

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,958
- ACTUALLY, IT SEEMS THE
BIGGER PROBLEM'S RIGHT THERE.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,583
- IT'S ME?

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,666
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU
FEEL WEIRD ABOUT OR ANYTHING,

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,208
BUT YOUR BATHING SUIT...

47
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,625
- IT LOOKS PRETTY SWEET,
DOESN'T IT?

48
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,541
MY INSTINCTS WERE
DEAD-ON, AS USUAL.

49
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,041
- PLEASE! SCHOOL SWIMSUITS
ARE A FETISH FOR PERVERTS!

50
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,083
- NERINE'S STILL CHANGING?

51
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,708
- Girls: SHE SHOULD
BE DONE BY NOW.

52
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,791
- Nerine: HEY, I'M RIGHT HERE!
- COOL, NOW EVERYONE'S HERE.

53
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,458
- SORRY! I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
WAITING TOO LONG! HI, RIN!

54
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,375
( giggling )

55
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,000
- UM, NERINE, THAT'S AN
INTERESTING CHOICE.

56
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,958
I'M SURPRISED YOU DECIDED TO
WEAR YOUR SCHOOL SWIMSUIT.

57
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,708
- OH, UM, I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT LIKE SEEING ME

58
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,208
IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

59
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,250
I KNOW IT SEEMS WEIRD, BUT
MY DAD TOLD ME I SHOULD

60
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,708
WEAR IT IF I WAS GOING TO THE
BEACH IN THE HUMAN WORLD.

61
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,916
HE SAID HE WAS SURE YOU'D
REALLY WANT TO SEE ME IN IT.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,333
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DOES IT LOOK FUNNY?

63
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,958
- OF COURSE IT
DOESN'T LOOK FUNNY!

64
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,541
I LIKE IT,
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT...

65
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,916
- Itsuki: SO NERINE'S DAD
THOUGHT THAT US

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,458
GOING TO THE BEACH
WOULD BE THE PERFECT CHANCE

67
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,791
FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO YANK BACK
THE LEAD THAT SIA'S GAINED.

68
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,250
MAN, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE KING OF DEVIL'S

69
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,125
REALLY UNDERSTANDS
THIS FETISH, TOO.

70
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,333
- Rin: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

71
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,833
I BET YOU, HE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT HE'S DOING.

72
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,083
- SERIOUSLY, WHY DO MEN HAVE
TO BE SUCH BONEHEADS, ANYWAY?

73
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,250
THERE ARE LOTS MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO LIKE ABOUT A GIRL

74
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,000
THAN HOW SHE LOOKS
IN HER BATHING SUIT!

75
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,125
- Itsuki: I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING, AND YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

76
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,041
THE PROBLEM IS, IS THAT
YOU'RE REALLY NOT QUALIFIED

77
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,458
TO TALK ABOUT IT YET.

78
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,708
SO WE'LL PICK THIS UP ONE DAY

79
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,208
AFTER YOU GET A LITTLE
BIT BIGGER THAN PRIMULA.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,708
THIS KID'S BOOBS ARE BIGGER
THAN YOURS. SAD, HUH?

81
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,208
- ( groans )

82
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,375
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
JUST YOU AND ME, KID.

83
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,375
SO MAYBE WE CAN FORM

84
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,458
A "FLAT-CHESTED"
ALLIANCE TOGETHER?

85
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,291
WE'LL FIND THE SMALL NUMBER
OF BOYS ON THE BEACH

86
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,708
WHO'RE INTO OUR TYPE
AND MAKE THEM DROOL!

87
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,083
- FLAT-CHESTED ALLIANCE.

88
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,416
- ( chuckles )

89
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,208
- Asa: AT ANY RATE,
NERINE'S SWIMSUIT

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,833
IS KIND OF PERVERT BAIT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

91
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,416
- RINA? DID YOU
BRING A BACKUP CHOICE?

92
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,833
- ACTUALLY, I DID.

93
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,958
JUST IN CASE THIS ONE
DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT.

94
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,833
IT'S THE ONE I PLANNED ON
WEARING FOR YOU ORIGINALLY.

95
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,333
- OKAY, THEN.

96
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,416
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO AND PUT
ON THE OTHER ONE INSTEAD.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,541
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE
YOU PICKED IT OUT

98
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,125
JUST SO YOU COULD SHOW IT TO ME.

99
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,833
- I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE IT.
- SURE! NO PROBLEM!

100
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,708
I'LL GO AND PUT IT
ON RIGHT NOW! OKAY?

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,083
- MY DAY'S ALREADY STARTING OUT
TO BE EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING.

102
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,666
- Itsuki: WELL, I THINK YOU
HANDLED THAT SITUATION

103
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,166
PRETTY TACTFULLY, BUT...

104
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,833
YOU ALSO MANAGED
TO MAKE SOME NEW ENEMIES

105
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,750
AT THE SAME TIME. WAY TO GO.

106
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,250
- ( grunting in anger )

107
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,541
- HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM!
WE'RE HERE AT THE BEACH, RIN!

108
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,333
LET'S GO FOR A SWIM!

109
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,375
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT!
LET'S HAVE FUN.

110
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,958
- COME ON! LET'S PLAY!

111
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,916
- Rin: YOU GOT IT!

112
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,875
- Mayumi: HERE IT COMES!

113
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,375
- Nerine: RIN! I'M BACK!

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,541
SORRY YOU HAD TO WAIT AGAIN.

115
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,791
WHAT DO YOU THINK? DOES THIS
ONE LOOK ANY BETTER?

116
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,041
- Rin: IT'S REALLY NICE.
YOU LOOK GREAT IN IT.

117
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,541
- THANKS, I'M SO
GLAD YOU LIKE...

118
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,208
- HEY. WHAT'S UP?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

119
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,416
- ( screams )

120
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,291
- OH, WOW, THAT WAS...

121
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,333
( yells )

122
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,625
- ARE YOU OKAY?

123
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,875
UH...

124
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,833
WHOA! I THINK IT'S SAFE
TO LET GO NOW.

125
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,916
- OH, I'M SO SORRY, RIN.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,625
THAT WAVE CAME
CRASHING DOWN ON US,

127
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,708
AND I GUESS I WAS TOO
SCARED TO THINK CLEARLY.

128
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,500
- WHAT? I SEE.

129
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,958
YOU'RE AFRAID A WAVE
MIGHT PUSH YOU UNDER?

130
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,208
- THE OCEANS IN MY
WORLD DON'T HAVE ANY WAVES.

131
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,708
AND BESIDES THAT,
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM.

132
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,916
SO, BEING UNDERWATER
MAKES ME PANIC.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,083
- REALLY? WELL, I'D BE WILLING
TO TEACH YOU, IF YOU'D LIKE.

134
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,958
- YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

135
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,541
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,208
- ( laughs nervously )

137
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,500
- OKAY, WHO'S GOING TO
CATCH THIS BALL?

138
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,500
- Rin: ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S GOOD! KEEP IT UP!

139
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,208
NOW TRY PUTTING YOUR
FACE IN THE WATER!

140
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,083
- Nerine: OKAY.

141
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,291
- WHEN CAN WE PLAY?

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,708
MAN.

143
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,416
- YOU'RE DOING GOOD. KEEP IT UP.
NOW, KICK A LITTLE HARDER.

144
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,416
- Nerine: I'M TRYING.
LIKE THIS?

145
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,333
- WELL, WHAT CAN YOU DO?

146
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,416
- Waitress: GOOD
AFTERNOON, GIRLS!

147
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
YOU SHOULD COME IN! WE HAVE
SOME AMAZING SPECIALS TODAY!

148
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,458
- CUTE!

149
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,583
- ( both sigh )

150
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,916
- ( panting )

151
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,166
NEXT TARGET ACQUIRED.

152
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:01,958
HI YA!

153
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,125
( screams )

154
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,208
MY MISTAKE!
SORRY ABOUT THAT!

155
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,833
- FOR SOME REASON,
HE SEEMS KIND OF FAMILIAR.

156
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,541
- ( exclaims )

157
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,583
OH, MAN. THAT WASN'T COOL.

158
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,416
( gasps )

159
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,125
- IF HE SPENDS
ALL DAY WITH HER,

160
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,000
WHEN'S HE GOING TO
HAVE TIME FOR ME?

161
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,458
- THAT'S GOOD!
YOU'VE GOTTEN A LOT BETTER!

162
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,958
ALRIGHT. I THINK YOU'RE
READY TO USE THIS NOW.

163
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,375
- Sia: NO! SHE'LL NEVER
GET ANY BETTER

164
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,458
IF YOU KEEP DOING
THINGS THAT WAY!

165
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,208
THIS STUFF ISN'T
DOING YOU ANY GOOD!

166
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,291
- WHAT? IT'S NOT? YOU SURE?

167
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,875
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, RIN!

168
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,041
WHEN YOU'RE A GIRL YOU CAN DO
IT ALL! JUST STAY FOCUSED!

169
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,583
ALL THESE TOYS ARE HOLDING YOU
BACK FROM ACTUALLY DOING IT!

170
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,375
YOU NEED TO TRUST YOUR
INSTINCTS! I'LL HELP YOU OUT,

171
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,833
SO LISTEN TO ME
AND FOLLOW MY LEAD.

172
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,916
- Nerine: ARE YOU SURE?
- Sia: YES, OF COURSE I AM!

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,916
- Nerine: OKAY. I TRUST YOU!

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,750
- ALL RIGHT!
NOW, KEEP YOUR LEGS STRAIGHT!

175
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,541
- Nerine: OKAY!
- YOU GOT IT! JUST LIKE THAT!

176
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,416
- WELL, GUESS
SHE WAS RIGHT.

177
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,166
THIS FEELS SO GOOD.

178
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,083
COMING TO THE BEACH TODAY
WAS A REALLY GREAT IDEA.

179
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,458
THIS IS WHAT
SUMMER IS ALL ABOUT.

180
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,208
- Asa: OH, YAY! JUST THE
PERSON I WANTED TO SEE!

181
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,250
- HUH?

182
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,000
- I NEED YOU TO HELP ME.
- WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

183
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,791
WHY ARE YOU STAYING
ALL CROUCHED DOWN,

184
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,583
WHEN IT'S SHALLOW
ENOUGH TO STAND?

185
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,291
- ACTUALLY, THERE IS A REASON.

186
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,958
- WHOA! WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR TOP?

187
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,583
- WELL, THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT

188
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,041
AND MY TOP GOT
WASHED OUT TO SEA.

189
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,708
- IF THAT'S THE CASE
COULDN'T YOU JUST HIDE THEM

190
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,625
WITH YOUR HANDS OR SOMETHING?

191
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,000
- I THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT,

192
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,291
BUT I CAN HIDE A LARGER
SURFACE AREA THIS WAY.

193
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,041
- YEAH, I GET IT,
BUT THIS CAN'T BE THE BEST...

194
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,166
( grunts )

195
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,791
- WHAT'S WRONG?
I GET THE FEELING

196
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,000
I MIGHT BE EMBARRASSING
YOU A LITTLE.

197
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,458
- LOOK, THE PROBLEM ISN'T
WHETHER OR NOT

198
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,666
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING.

199
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,458
- YOU KNOW YOU LIKE IT.

200
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,625
- WILL YOU STOP TEASING ME!
KNOWING YOU,

201
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,041
YOU'RE PROBABLY HAVING
SOME FUN AT MY EXPENSE.

202
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,666
- I WANTED TO MAKE
THE BEST OF IT.

203
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,083
AND YOU? YOU HAVING FUN?

204
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,375
- DAMMIT, ASA! COME ON, LET'S
GET YOU ONTO THE SHORE.

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,833
- Rin: JUMP UP,
I'LL CARRY YOU!

206
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,375
MAKE SURE YOU HOLD ON TIGHT!

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,125
- ( Asa laughs )

208
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,958
- Rin: YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY,

209
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,708
YOU ALMOST GAVE
ME A HEART ATTACK.

210
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,208
- ( laughs )
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

211
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,708
- ( sighs ) IT'S BEEN SO CRAZY.

212
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,875
LIKE, I DON'T THINK
I COULD HANDLE

213
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,833
ANOTHER PAIR OF BREASTS TODAY.

214
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,041
- Sia: OH? "HANDLING BREASTS?"

215
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,000
IS THAT WHY YOU SNUCK
OFF HERE WITHOUT US?

216
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,208
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

217
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,625
I TOOK MY EYES OFF YOU FOR A
SECOND AND NOW!

218
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,208
I'D LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING

219
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,208
SINCE YOU RAN AWAY.

220
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,083
- NO! NO WAIT!
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!

221
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,791
JUST LISTEN... HELPING!

222
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,791
I WAS JUST HELPING
HER OUT OF THE WATER!

223
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,291
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!
SHE WAS HAVING AN EMERGENCY!

224
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,083
- YOU WERE JUST
HELPING HER OUT?

225
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,083
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S NOT
ALL THAT WAS GOING ON HERE.

226
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,416
- NO, I SWEAR,
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH!

227
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,916
- OH, YEAH?

228
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,250
- DON'T BE HARD ON HIM.
YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING.

229
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,250
HE REALLY DID SAVE ME.
NOTHING ELSE WAS GOING ON.

230
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,375
WHY DON'T I GO BUY EVERYONE
SOME COLD DRINKS AS AN APOLOGY?

231
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,750
JUST LET ME GET DRESSED,
AND WE'LL GO OUTSIDE...

232
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,583
- ( both gasp )

233
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,833
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

234
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:04,000
- YEAH, I THINK I'M ALL RIGHT.
- YOU SURE?

235
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,333
- I'M A LITTLE WEAK FROM BEING
IN THE SUN SO MUCH TODAY.

236
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,458
I KNOW I'LL BE FINE
AFTER I DRINK SOMETHING.

237
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,125
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET GOING THEN.

238
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,958
- THANKS. I'LL FINISH
GETTING CHANGED.

239
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,416
- THAT WAS KINDA SCARY!

240
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,833
- DON'T PUSH YOURSELF.
IT'S NOT WORTH GETTING SICK.

241
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,500
- I PROMISE TO TAKE IT EASY.

242
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,166
- Kaede: GOOD, YOU'RE ALL IN
HERE! EVERYBODY'S HUNGRY,

243
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,666
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D
GO HAVE SOME LUNCH

244
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:32,708
WHEN YOU'RE ALL READY?

245
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:39,708
WHEN YOU'RE ALL READY?

246
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,833
- Mayumi: THAT'S TOO FUNNY.

247
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,916
- Kaede: DOES ANYONE
WANT MORE OF THIS?

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,583
- HERE YOU GO! IT'S THE
EXTRA DISH YOU ORDERED!

249
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,875
JUST LET ME KNOW IF I CAN
GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE, OKAY!

250
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,166
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

251
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,458
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE DOING
BETTER NOW. ARE YOU?

252
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,875
- I'M SURE IT WAS JUST
SENSORY OVERLOAD

253
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,291
SO EARLY IN THE MORNING.

254
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,375
AND, NOW THAT I'VE EATEN,
I HAVE TONS OF ENERGY.

255
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,000
SO YOU CAN GO HAVE FUN WITH SIA
WITHOUT ME GETTING IN THE WAY.

256
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,125
- Sia: BOY, THAT WAS GOOD.
BUT I ATE WAY TOO MUCH!

257
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,916
I'M FEELING TOTALLY
STUFFED AND SLEEPY.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,208
WHENEVER I FIND
I HAVE A FULL STOMACH,

259
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,500
I ALWAYS
GET SUPER TIRED.

260
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,458
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

261
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,291
- Sia: I GUESS WE
COULD BOTH USE A NAP.

262
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,916
LET'S GO BACK IN LATER, AND EVEN
FARTHER OUT THIS TIME, OKAY?

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,958
AND I'D LIKE IT IF IT COULD
JUST BE US FOR A WHILE.

264
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,291
- THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GOOD PLAN.

265
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,875
WE CAN GO FARTHER OUT THEN.

266
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,375
IT'LL JUST BE THE TWO OF US.

267
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,291
- WE FELL ASLEEP.

268
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,625
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT'VE BEEN
OUT IN THE SUN FOR TOO LONG.

269
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,250
HEY, YOU SHOULD
GET UP NOW, SIA.

270
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,583
YOU'LL GET SUNBURNED IF WE STAY
LIKE THIS FOR MUCH LONGER.

271
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,166
( gasps ) WHAT? HOW THE HELL
DID WE END UP HERE?

272
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,083
- WHY'D YOU SHOUT?

273
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,541
IT'S SO QUIET.

274
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,458
EVERYONE ELSE TAKE
OFF AND GO SOMEPLACE?

275
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,916
- NO, WE'RE THE ONES
WHO TOOK OFF.

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,375
I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AROUND US.
YOU'LL GET THE PICTURE.

277
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,708
- ( gasps ) NO WAY!

278
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,166
- WE MUST'VE BEEN TOO
CLOSE TO THE WATER

279
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,666
WHEN THE TIDE GOT HIGH.

280
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,083
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
WE'VE BEEN FLOATING,

281
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,166
BUT WE MIGHT BE PRETTY
FAR AWAY BY NOW.

282
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,291
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
- THAT'S NOT AN EASY QUESTION.

283
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,833
- MY SKIN'S STARTING TO GET
ITCHY. I'M GETTING A SUNBURN.

284
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,833
- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE SUN

285
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,500
BEFORE WE BOTH FRY.

286
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,125
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PADDLE TO
SHORE. THERE'LL BE SHADE THERE.

287
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,208
- Sia: OKAY!

288
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,958
- Rin: IS ANYBODY HERE? KAEDE?

289
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,666
NERINE! MAYUMI!

290
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,333
- PRIMULA! DAD!

291
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,166
KAREHA! ASA!
WHERE ARE YOU?

292
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,541
NO ONE'S HERE. WHAT DO YOU
THINK WE SHOULD DO NOW?

293
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,583
- DAMN! I DON'T SEE HOW WE
COULD'VE GOTTEN SO FAR AWAY.

294
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,583
- CAN WE GO?
IT'S TOO HOT TO STAY HERE.

295
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,625
- RIGHT. LET'S TRY TO
FIND A NICE SHADY SPOT

296
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,916
WHERE WE CAN RELAX AND THINK.

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,500
- THAT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE IT'LL BE EASY.

298
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,416
- WE'VE GOTTA TRY.
THIS IS IT. SO COME ON.

299
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,000
- BUT WHERE? ARE WE JUST
GOING TO WANDER AROUND?

300
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,833
- THERE'S NO GOOD REASON
FOR US TO STAY HERE.

301
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,166
MAYBE WE CAN EVEN FIND SOMEPLACE
WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE.

302
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,833
- OH, RIGHT!

303
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,875
- ( sighs )

304
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,875
OH MAN, IT'S JUST LIKE
THIS GRASS GOES ON FOREVER.

305
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,250
THE GROUND HERE'S SO HARD,
MY FEET ARE KILLING ME.

306
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,708
YOU DOING OKAY BACK THERE?

307
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,916
- UH-HUH. YEAH, I'M DOING FINE.

308
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,541
( screams )

309
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,250
- Rin: ( gasps ) SIA!
- Sia: OW! THAT REALLY HURTS!

310
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,166
- THINGS ARE GOING
FROM BAD TO WORSE.

311
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,625
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU CAN STILL WALK?

312
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,208
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE BEEN THINKING?

313
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,916
THAT MAYBE SOMEHOW WE'VE
CROSSED OVER INTO ANOTHER WORLD.

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
A PLACE WHERE THERE
ARE NO PEOPLE.

315
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,916
WHAT IF, AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH, WE DON'T FIND ANYBODY?

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,458
- I CAN'T HELP FEELING
WE'RE ALL ALONE!

317
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,833
- THAT'S NOT TRUE!

318
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,333
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE THE
ONLY ONES IN THIS WORLD!

319
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,666
- ( wind blowing )

320
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,208
- ( bird cawing )

321
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,583
- ( exclaims in fright )

322
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,000
- OH, NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S JUST A BIRD.

323
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,666
DON'T BE SCARED. THERE'S
NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

324
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,708
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

325
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,583
- I HATE THAT YOU'RE HAVING
TO LUG ME AROUND.

326
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,750
- DON'T WORRY, YOU'RE LIGHT.
THIS IS A PIECE OF CAKE.

327
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,125
- BUT, YOU MUST BE FEELING
EXHAUSTED BY NOW.

328
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,333
DO YOU THINK THIS IS MY FAULT?

329
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

330
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,041
- I REMEMBER WISHING I
COULD GO FAR AWAY WITH YOU,

331
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,583
JUST THE TWO OF US.

332
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,000
BEFORE WE FELL ASLEEP ON THE
BEACH. AND THEN THIS HAPPENED.

333
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,625
- Rin: LISTEN,
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

334
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,416
INSTEAD OF WORRYING
ABOUT WHO'S TO BLAME,

335
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,291
WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON WHAT WE
NEED TO DO TO GET THROUGH THIS.

336
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,333
- WHAT IF WE NEVER GET
TO SEE RINA AND RIMU

337
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,708
OR MY FATHER AGAIN?

338
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,583
- IF WE CAN'T, I... DON'T KNOW.

339
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,750
- YOU CAN'T THINK LIKE THAT!
IF WE'RE NOT RESCUED,

340
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,666
I'LL MAKE SURE WE
MAKE IT HOME SAFELY.

341
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,500
BESIDES, IF THAT WISH DID
COME TRUE, WE'RE BOTH TO BLAME.

342
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,541
I'VE GOTTA ADMIT,
I WANTED THE SAME THING YOU DID.

343
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,666
- HUH?

344
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,375
- I WANTED TO BE ALONE
WITH YOU, SIA,

345
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,458
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

346
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,000
MY WISHES WERE THE SAME AS
YOURS. AND IF THEY CAME TRUE,

347
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,500
IT'S BECAUSE WE BOTH HOPED
THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN. YOU KNOW?

348
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,625
- YEAH, OKAY.

349
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,041
- OKAY, NOW LET'S SAY
THE WORSE CASE SCENARIO

350
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,750
IS TRUE AND WE'RE THE ONLY
ONES LIVING ON THIS WORLD.

351
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,041
OF COURSE YOU'D
MISS YOUR FRIENDS,

352
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,958
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'D BE ALL ALONE.

353
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,958
YOU'VE GOT ME HERE
TO PROTECT YOU.

354
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,208
AND I'LL BE BY YOUR SIDE,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

355
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,958
RIGHT?

356
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,291
- THANK YOU, RIN.

357
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,708
- ( leaves rustling )

358
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,833
- ( animal growls )

359
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,000
- WHAT IS THAT THING?

360
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,666
- TRY TO STAY CALM.
HOLD STILL FOR NOW.

361
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,041
LOOK, EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

362
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,666
- BUT WE NEED A PLAN. ALRIGHT?
- ALRIGHT.

363
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,666
- IF THAT ATTACKS US,
LET ME HANDLE IT.

364
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,625
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE ME BEHIND
AND RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

365
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,416
DON'T EVEN LOOK BACK UNTIL
YOU'RE SOMEPLACE YOU FEEL SAFE.

366
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,416
- NO WAY! I WOULD
NEVER RUN OFF AND

367
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,958
LEAVE YOU IF YOU WERE IN DANGER!

368
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,708
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, GO.

369
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,833
- NO! YOU'D HAVE TO ESCAPE WITH
ME OR I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

370
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,208
- DON'T SAY THAT!

371
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,750
I'D WANT TO KNOW THAT
AT LEAST YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT!

372
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,958
- RIN, I DON'T CARE!

373
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,916
- Rin: HURRY! THIS WAY!

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,583
- Sia: WATCH WHERE
WE'RE RUNNING!

375
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,458
- ( both scream )

376
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,208
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

377
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,583
- THINK SO.

378
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,583
IT'S LIGHT!

379
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,375
- SOMEONE'S OVER THERE!

380
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,875
- ANYBODY? WE NEED SOME HELP!
- WE'RE OVER HERE!

381
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,333
- ( both laugh )

382
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,875
- Rin: OH, MAN.

383
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,708
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES HERE,
AFTER ALL.

384
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,916
IT'S LIKE WE ACTUALLY
HAVE WANDERED

385
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,500
INTO SOME TERRIBLE,
LONELY PLACE.

386
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,291
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

387
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,375
IT'S LIKE, I WANTED TO SAVE YOU,

388
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,708
BUT WE'RE STILL IN THE
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

389
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,291
I FEEL LIKE I LET YOU DOWN.

390
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,125
- MMM-MMM.

391
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,500
OH, NO!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

392
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,083
YOU'VE DONE MORE THAN ENOUGH.

393
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,916
BESIDES THAT, YOU'VE MADE ME
REALIZE SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

394
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,583
YOU KNOW THE STUFF
YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE?

395
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,250
YOU MADE ME FEEL BETTER
KNOWING NO MATTER

396
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,000
WHAT KIND OF CRAZY PLACE
WE'RE IN, I HAVE YOU.

397
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,166
SO, AS LONG AS WE'RE
TOGETHER, I'LL BE FINE.

398
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,583
THERE'S NO ONE BUT US.

399
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,958
IT'S KIND OF LIKE WE'RE THE ADAM
AND EVE OF THIS WORLD, ISN'T IT?

400
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,291
- YEAH.

401
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,416
LET'S TRY TO MAKE OUR LIFE
TOGETHER A HAPPY ONE. EVEN HERE.

402
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,958
- YES, IT'LL BE OUR NEW HOME.

403
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,083
AND I'LL HAVE LOTS OF BABIES FOR
YOU TO LOVE, TOO.

404
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,208
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

405
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,791
- MY LOVE.

406
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,083
- Itsuki: HEY, CHECK IT OUT!

407
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,875
IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE TWO ARE
ABOUT TO START MAKING OUT!

408
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,750
- Mayumi: I DIDN'T THINK SIA
WAS SO FAR IN THE LEAD

409
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,416
AGAINST THE OTHER GIRLS.

410
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,583
- WOW! THIS IS A BIG SCOOP!
- Kareha: OOH LA LA!

411
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,875
- ( both gasp )

412
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:15,000
- KAEDE? NERINE?
ITSUKI, HOW... MAYUMI?

413
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,250
WHERE HAS EVERYONE BEEN
HIDING ALL OF THIS TIME?

414
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,458
- Mayumi: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

415
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,291
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN
WANTING TO ASK YOU!

416
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,083
- YOU TWO JUST VANISHED
ALL OF A SUDDEN

417
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,041
AND WE COULDN'T FIGURE
OUT WHERE YOU'D GONE.

418
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,416
WE KEPT WAITING FOR YOU TO
COME BACK, BUT YOU NEVER DID.

419
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,291
- HOLD ON, DOES THIS MEAN?
WHAT I THINK IT MEANS?

420
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,666
- Both: SO THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED TO US!

421
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,208
- BUT NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
INTERRUPTED SOMETHING.

422
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,958
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GO.

423
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,125
- NO. YOU WEREN'T
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING!

424
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,916
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE WEATHER.

425
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,458
- OH!

426
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,833
- ( laughs loudly )

427
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,708
- COME ON, NO LAME EXCUSES.
JUST LEVEL WITH US.

428
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,375
SO, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
TO KEEP YOURSELVES BUSY

429
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,458
ALL THOSE HOURS YOU WERE GONE?

430
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,916
- YOU WEREN'T DOING THAT,
WERE YOU?

431
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,458
- JUST TELL US.

432
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,083
- DAMN, YOU SURE ARE
ONE HEARTLESS GUY, RIN.

433
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,916
- ( laughs )

434
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,750
- YOU DON'T...
NOTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED.

435
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,333
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S OKAY.

436
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,041
THIS'LL BE A SECRET BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US. OKAY!

437
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,708
- Boys: LOOK AT THOSE WAVES!
THREE CHEERS FOR THE NIGHT SEA!

438
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,666
- ( theme song playing )

439
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

440
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,041
- MABOU, YOU BETTER WATCH OUT!
I'M GOING TO CATCH YOU!

441
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,458
- NOT IN A MILLION YEARS!
- I'LL NEVER GIVE UP!

442
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,291
- Nerine: WE'RE SO SORRY
YOU HAD TO HEAR THAT.

443
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,583
- Sia: SEE YOU NEXT TIME
ON SHUFFLE! EPISODE 10,

444
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,625
"MOONLIT CONFESSION."

445
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,458
- Forbesii: I'M BEGINNING TO
SUSPECT THAT OUR DAUGHTERS

446
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,166
AREN'T VERY IMPRESSED WITH US.

447
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,416
- Eustoma: SIA!
THAT'S NOT TRUE, IS IT?
