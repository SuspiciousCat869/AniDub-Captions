1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,958
- ( alarm ringing )

4
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,250
- ( sighs )

5
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,958
IT'S GONNA BE A BEAUTIFUL DAY!

6
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,291
- ( humming )

7
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,916
- GOOD MORNING, MOM!

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,791
- HEY, ASA! GOOD MORNING!

9
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,416
WOULD YOU MIND TASTING THIS
SOUP FOR ME, PRETTY PLEASE?

10
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,041
- YOU'RE A GOOD COOK MOTHER,
I TRUST YOU.

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,583
- AW! COME ON.

12
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,416
YOU KNOW I'M NOT AS GOOD OF A
COOK AS YOU ARE, SWEETHEART.

13
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,375
- PLEASE, TASTE IF FOR ME!
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

14
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,750
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S MISSING SOMETHING.

15
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,083
- I KNEW IT!
WILL YOU PLEASE FIX IT?

16
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,708
- SURE. I GUESS I COULD.

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,125
- AND THAT SHOULD DO IT.
- OH, LET ME TRY, PLEASE!

18
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,708
DELICIOUS!
OH, YOU'RE A GENIUS!

19
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,875
- WHY ARE YOU FLATTERING ME?
IT WON'T MAKE IT TASTE BETTER.

20
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,458
- I'M NOT FLATTERING YOU,
IT'S THE TRUTH!

21
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,333
YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR COOKING
SKILLS, YOU'LL BE A BRIDE SOON.

22
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,125
- ( laughs )

23
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,708
- I'M NOT EVEN DATING.
- YOU'RE NOT?

24
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,375
BUT DIDN'T YOU BRING HOME A
PRESENT FROM SOMEONE YESTERDAY?

25
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,625
- ( exclaims )

26
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,625
- SO, WHO WAS IT?
OH, LET ME GUESS.

27
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,041
I BET IT WAS FROM RIN,
WASN'T IT?

28
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,041
- NO MOM, JEEZ!
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

29
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,166
RIN DOESN'T EVEN
LIKE ME THAT WAY!

30
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,458
- ( laughs ) I REFUSE
TO BELIEVE THAT!

31
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,625
- Kareha: WELL, SUMMER
VACATION'S ALMOST HERE.

32
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,833
- Asa: THANK GOODNESS.

33
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,416
- SO, HAVE YOU HAD A
CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT

34
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,625
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WITH ALL
THE FREE TIME YOU'LL BE HAVING?

35
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,333
- UH-UH. NOT REALLY.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

36
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,458
- OH, I DON'T KNOW, I WAS
SORT OF THINKING ABOUT

37
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,375
GETTING A PART TIME
JOB THIS SUMMER.

38
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,375
- WHAT KIND OF JOB?
- NOT SURE.

39
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,416
I THOUGHT I MIGHT TRY
WAITRESSING OR SOMETHING.

40
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,791
YOU KNOW THAT CAFE THAT'S
JUST DOWN THE STREET?

41
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,291
IT'S IN FRONT OF
THE TRAIN STATION?

42
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,458
I THINK IT'S CALLED FLORA?

43
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,500
- YOU MEAN THE PLACE WHERE
THEY WEAR THE UNIFORMS

44
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,083
WITH THE REALLY SHORT SKIRTS?

45
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,541
- YEP! THE UNIFORMS ARE
SO CUTE, AREN'T THEY?

46
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,291
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT!
- WELL, IF YOU SAY SO.

47
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,416
- YOU SHOULD GET A
JOB THERE TOO, ASA!

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
- HUH?

49
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,083
- I THINK IT WOULD LOOK
BETTER ON YOU.

50
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,166
SO, I'M GONNA PASS. BUT THANKS!

51
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,416
- COME ON, I BET YOU'D
LOOK ADORABLE IN IT!

52
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,291
- THANK YOU, BUT IF RIN
WALKED IN, HE'D SAY,

53
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,583
"ASA, WHAT THE HECK'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU? WHAT'RE YOU WEARING?"

54
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,375
- THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW HE'D SAY IT!

55
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,875
- OKAY.

56
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,875
AND WHAT DOES RIN HAVE TO DO
WITH YOU WORKING AT A CAFE?

57
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,750
- HUH? NO REASON
AT ALL, REALLY.

58
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,291
- NO REASON? ARE YOU SURE?

59
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,458
OOH, LA LA!

60
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,250
- KAREHA, STOP IT!
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE TIMES!

61
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,541
RIN DOESN'T LIKE ME THAT WAY.
YOU KNOW THAT!

62
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,333
- Kareha: LOVE IS SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL THING!

63
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,541
I MEAN, OOH LA LA!

64
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,125
( giggling )

65
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,375
- Takizawa: MORNING, ASA!

66
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,458
- ( gasps )

67
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,250
OH, HI. GOOD MORNING.

68
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,000
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY,
ISN'T IT.

69
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,416
- YEAH, IT IS.

70
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,875
( chuckles )

71
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,833
- SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.
I GUESS I SURPRISED YOU.

72
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,375
- OH, NO! NOT AT ALL!

73
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,166
- GOOD. I'M GLAD. WELL, SEE YA!

74
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,208
- IS THAT THE GUY WHO GAVE
YOU THE PRESENT THE OTHER DAY?

75
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,625
- YEAH, I'M AFRAID SO.

76
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,625
- SO YOU HAVEN'T,
ANSWERED HIM YET?

77
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,458
- GOOD MORNING!

78
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,958
- OH, GOOD MORNING,
ASA, NICE TO SEE YOU!

79
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,333
- Both: GOOD MORNING.

80
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,625
- ( all giggle )

81
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,500
- ( sighs )

82
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,500
- ( chattering )

83
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,208
- Kareha: KIND OF LOOKS LIKE YOU
ARE THE TALK OF THE TOWN TODAY.

84
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,916
( giggles )

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,166
- WHY'S EVERYONE MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL?

86
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,708
- BECAUSE THE GUY
WHO LIKES YOU

87
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,250
JUST HAPPENS TO BE TAKIZAWA,
OF ALL PEOPLE.

88
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,666
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM THAT
WELL. WHAT MAKES HIM SO SPECIAL?

89
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,541
- Kareha: HE'S CAPTAIN
OF THE SOCCER TEAM,

90
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,083
AND HE'S AN AMAZING ATHLETE.

91
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,708
MOST OF THE GIRLS
HAVE CRUSHES ON HIM!

92
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,250
- Asa: HMM, I ALWAYS
THOUGHT THAT GUY, ITSUKI,

93
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,750
WAS MORE POPULAR
WITH THE GIRLS.

94
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,333
- ( kareha chuckles )

95
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,250
HE'S NOT MORE POPULAR,
HE'S MORE AVAILABLE.

96
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,833
TAKIZAWA'S MORE OF
A CHALLENGE, YOU KNOW?

97
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,750
LOTS OF GIRLS HAVE
TRIED TO PURSUE HIM,

98
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,833
AND HE'S TURNED DOWN
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

99
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,208
- Asa: REALLY?
- Kareha: UH-HUH!

100
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,333
SEE, A WONDERFUL GUY IS IN LOVE
WITH YOU! YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY!

101
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,375
- Asa: I WOULDN'T CALL IT LUCKY.

102
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,083
I'M NOT THAT INTERESTED IN HIM.

103
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,791
- BUT YOU DID
ACCEPT HIS PRESENT.

104
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,291
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT,
IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED?

105
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,041
- WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

106
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,916
I COULDN'T THINK OF A REASON
TO TURN HIM DOWN, YOU KNOW?

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,416
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

108
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,916
ISN'T WHETHER YOU LIKE HIM
OR NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON?

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,875
JUST TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL.

110
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,083
- I'M NOT SURE HOW
I FEEL ABOUT HIM, THOUGH.

111
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,208
- OH DEAR, THIS IS NO GOOD.

112
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,541
- DO YOU THINK I MESSED UP?
- Takizawa: THERE YOU ARE!

113
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,500
GUESS WHAT? I JUST
FOUND OUT OUR CLASSES

114
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,083
ARE DOING PE TOGETHER
THIS AFTERNOON.

115
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,916
- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,708
- EVERY GOAL I MAKE
WILL BE FOR YOU.

117
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,500
AFTER THAT, I DARE YOU
TO TURN ME DOWN.

118
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,875
- OH! OKAY.
- WELL, SEE YA THERE!

119
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,541
- Kareha: WELL, MY GOODNESS!
IT'S HARD TO TELL HIM ANYTHING

120
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,041
WHEN HE'S THAT
AGGRESSIVE, ISN'T IT.

121
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,875
I THINK MEN ARE KIND
OF HANDSOME WHEN

122
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,500
THEY'RE JUST A
LITTLE BIT PUSHY, DON'T YOU?

123
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,208
OOH LA LA!

124
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,250
( giggling )

125
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,375
- OH, GROW UP.

126
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,666
- RIN!

127
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,708
- WOW! PERFECT TIMING!
ASA SHIGURE!

128
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,625
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING US
ABOUT THAT VERY SPECIAL MOMENT

129
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,833
WHEN THE FAMOUS TAKIZAWA
SAID HE LOVED YOU?

130
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,125
- WE ALL WANNA KNOW.

131
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:29,125
- WELL, YOU SEE,
I DIDN'T REALLY...

132
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,500
OH, MY GOSH, HAVE YOU
HEARD ABOUT THIS, TOO?

133
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,541
- WELL, YEAH.

134
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,750
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
IS TALKING ABOUT IT.

135
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,333
- WOW. THAT IS
REALLY EMBARRASSING.

136
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,083
- SO, TELL US HOW YOU FEEL.

137
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,916
- MAYUMI!
- WELL, WOW...

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,291
I'M NOT SURE I'M READY
FOR A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP.

139
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,500
YOU KNOW! TELL 'EM, RIN!

140
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,583
- I THINK YOU MIGHT
WANNA REPHRASE THAT!

141
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,875
THERE'S A WHOLE SLEW OF
GUYS COMING OUT NOW SAYING

142
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,458
THEY'VE SECRETLY LIKED
YOU THIS WHOLE TIME.

143
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,833
SO, TELL US. WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT, ASA?

144
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,375
- OH WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

145
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,708
- HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS RUMOR?

146
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,125
- NO, THIS IS THE FIRST.

147
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,666
I MEAN, I NEVER THOUGHT OF
ASA EVEN HAVING A BOYFRIEND.

148
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,625
BUT, YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

149
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,666
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
IT'S THAT IMPOSSIBLE.

150
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,625
I THINK YOU'D MAKE
A GREAT GIRLFRIEND, ASA!

151
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,583
- Kareha: OOH-LA-LA!

152
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,166
- ( Rin grunts )

153
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,000
- OH COME ON! I BET YOU SAY THAT
TO ALL THE GIRLS, DON'T YOU RIN!

154
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,166
- ( bell ringing )

155
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,666
- OH! THE BELL!
COME ON, YOU, TIME TO GO!

156
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,625
BYE, YOU GUYS! LATER!

157
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,000
- Kareha: WELL,
THAT WAS INTERESTING!

158
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,791
- WHAT WAS?
- OH, YOU KNOW.

159
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,958
THE WAY RIN SAID HE THOUGHT

160
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,750
YOU'D MAKE A GREAT
GIRLFRIEND BACK THERE.

161
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,166
I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM TALK
ABOUT YOU LIKE THAT BEFORE.

162
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,625
- THAT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

163
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,541
- OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
THIS COULD BE GOOD IF YOU'D

164
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,791
STOP BEING SO STUBBORN
AND GIVE IT A CHANCE.

165
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,166
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?
- WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

166
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,000
THE FACT THAT RIN'S
FINALLY STARTING TO

167
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,583
SEE YOU AS A GIRL
WHO'S WORTH DATING,

168
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,750
COULD ACTUALLY MEAN HE'S
INTERESTED IN YOU HIMSELF!

169
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,833
- THERE'S NO WAY! RIN AND I
ARE JUST REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.

170
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,291
THAT'S ALL WE'VE EVER BEEN.

171
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,083
- Kareha: OH, YEAH?
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

172
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,916
- YEP.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,333
- I'VE ALWAYS KINDA SECRETLY
HOPED THAT YOU AND RIN

174
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,916
WOULD FALL IN LOVE AND
BECOME A COUPLE SOME DAY.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,916
I MEAN, THERE'S LOTS OF
STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
WHO'RE JUST GOOD FRIENDS,
UNTIL ONE DAY THEY REALIZE...

177
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,250
THEY WERE MEANT TO BE!

178
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,083
- YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

179
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,625
STOP IMAGINING THINGS
AND GET DRESSED ALREADY.

180
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,750
PLEASE.

181
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,625
- ( breathes heavily )

182
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,916
- Girls: HE'S AWESOME!

183
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,458
- ( gasps )

184
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,583
- Teacher: SHIGURE!
YOU'RE UP NEXT, COME ON!

185
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,208
- OKAY, I'M COMING!

186
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,250
( gasps )

187
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,333
( gasping )

188
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,416
( groans )

189
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,875
- ARE YOU OKAY?

190
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,041
- OH, YOU POOR THING! ASA!

191
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,750
- ( groans )

192
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,291
- OH, DID I HURT YOU, ASA?
- IT'S OKAY, I'LL BE FINE.

193
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,541
I'M SORRY I MADE
YOU GUYS WORRY.

194
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,083
- I WASN'T THAT WORRIED.

195
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,833
BUT KAEDE WAS SO FRIGHTENED,
SHE WAS ALMOST IN TEARS.

196
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,541
- STOP IT!

197
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,250
WELL, THEY TOLD US YOU
WERE REALLY SERIOUSLY INJURED.

198
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,958
- THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION!
IT'S JUST A SMALL SPRAIN.

199
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,458
NO BIG DEAL, REALLY.

200
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,791
- BUT, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR?

201
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,291
- WHAT? NO!

202
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,875
ICING IT SHOULD BE... ENOUGH!

203
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,208
- CAREFUL, YOU CAN'T WALK
ON IT YET. LET IT REST!

204
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,541
- KAREHA, I THOUGHT
I HEARD SOMEWHERE

205
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,333
THAT YOU WERE GOOD
AT HEALING MAGIC.

206
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,416
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE
POSSIBLE TO FIX ASA'S ANKLE?

207
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,125
- WELL, I...

208
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,791
- IT'S OKAY,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

209
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,166
MY ANKLE WILL HEAL
ITSELF WITHOUT MAGIC.

210
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,041
- BUT YOU CAN'T WALK
HOME LIKE THAT, ASA!

211
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,750
- SURE I CAN.

212
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,291
BECAUSE RIN ACTUALLY VOLUNTEERED
TO HELP ME WALK HOME TODAY.

213
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,708
- SHUT UP!
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN!

214
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,833
- ASA! HEY, YOU!

215
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,250
I'M SO SORRY!

216
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,625
I GOT OUT OF THE CLASS AS
SOON AS I POSSIBLY COULD.

217
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,000
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

218
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,375
- YEAH, I'M FINE!
THANKS FOR ASKING.

219
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,333
- GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER.
I'LL WALK YOU HOME.

220
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,500
- Asa: OH, NO THAT'S OKAY!
RIN'S WALKING ME HOME.

221
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,416
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN OVER BEFORE,
SO HE KNOWS WHERE I LIVE.

222
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,958
AND I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO
FEEL AWKWARD, MEETING MY MOM.

223
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,583
- OH, I SEE.

224
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,958
- ( laughs nervously )

225
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,166
- Rin: WAS THAT REALLY OKAY?
- Asa: WAS WHAT OKAY?

226
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,083
- WELL, I FEEL LIKE
MY WALKING YOU HOME

227
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,916
IS INTERFERING WITH YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH TAKIZAWA.

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,958
- OH, PLEASE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT!

229
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,500
- BUT I AM WORRIED.

230
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,625
YOU'VE KINDA BEEN ACTING A
LITTLE STRANGE ALL DAY TODAY.

231
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,875
- IT'S BECAUSE OF THE
STUPID RUMORS GOING AROUND,

232
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,875
I FELT SELF CONSCIOUS.
I'M SORRY IF I WAS AWKWARD.

233
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,458
- IT'S OKAY IF IT'S TRUE.

234
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,875
I MEAN, HE SEEMED LIKE HE WAS
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

235
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,291
- Asa: YEAH.
WELL, HE'S A NICE GUY.

236
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,000
I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT NOT
GIVING HIM AN ANSWER YET.

237
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,500
- Rin: OH, REALLY?
YOU HAVEN'T? WHY NOT?

238
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,916
- Asa: I COULDN'T.
I GUESS THAT'S WHY,

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,791
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO
WALK ME HOME TODAY.

240
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,791
BUT, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
REASON NOT TO ASK YOU!

241
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,875
- YOU'RE SO HANDY!
- OH, IS THAT WHAT I AM?

242
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,458
- WELL, WHAT DO WANNA BE?
MY OBNOXIOUS KID BROTHER?

243
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,750
A FRIEND OF UNSAVORY TIES?

244
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,750
AN OLD CHILDHOOD PLAYMATE?
IT'S UP TO YOU. TAKE YOUR PICK.

245
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,500
- NONE OF THOSE ARE SEXY.

246
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,291
- SO YOU WANNA
FEEL SEXY, DO YOU?

247
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,250
THERE. IS THAT BETTER?

248
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,875
- OH COME ON. NOW YOU'RE
JUST PATRONIZING ME.

249
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,083
- MAYBE I AM!

250
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,958
- ( laughter )

251
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,375
- REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?

252
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,541
WHAT TIME IS SHE COMING BACK?
IS THIS OKAY?

253
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,791
- IT'S FINE.
JUST SIT DOWN AND RELAX.

254
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,375
- DON'T YOU WANNA GO SOMEWHERE?

255
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,750
- ARE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE
BEING ALONE WITH ME?

256
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,666
- NO. NO, NOT AT ALL.

257
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,875
- OKAY, WELL,
GIVE ME A SECOND TO CHANGE.

258
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,583
- YOU'LL BE OKAY WITH
YOUR SPRAINED ANKLE?

259
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,250
- YOU CAN GIVE ME A HAND
IF IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

260
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,500
- JUST HURRY AND CHANGE
YOUR CLOTHES, ASA, JEEZ.

261
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,416
- LAME! WHATEVER, YOU'RE NO FUN.

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,791
YOU CAN COME TAKE
A LITTLE PEAK IF YOU WANT,

263
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,041
BUT TELL ME FIRST,
SO I CAN BE READY FOR YA.

264
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,958
- YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T TEMPT ME LIKE THAT.

265
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,500
I AM A NORMAL, HEALTHY
YOUNG MAN, AFTER ALL.

266
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,041
- OKAY, JUST BE AWARE
THAT WHENEVER I GET EXCITED

267
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,666
I MAKE THE CUTEST SQUEAL EVER.

268
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,958
- IT NEVER ENDS, DOES IT?

269
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,541
YOU KNOW, SHE ACTS TOUGH,

270
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,583
BUT SHE HAS A SOFT FEMININE
SIDE THAT SHE RARELY SHOWS.

271
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,958
I BET IF SHE WOULD LET
OTHERS SEE THAT MORE OFTEN,

272
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,083
SHE'D HAVE GUYS ASKING
HER OUT, LEFT AND RIGHT.

273
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:32,250
A GIFT? TAKIZAWA
REALLY IS A NICE PERSON.

274
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,666
I WONDER WHY ASA HASN'T
AGREED TO GO OUT WITH HIM YET.

275
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,083
- WHERE'S RIN?

276
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,666
- ASA HURT HER ANKLE TODAY,
SO HE HELPED HER WALK HOME.

277
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,041
- HE'S WITH ASA?
- YEAH.

278
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,083
- IT'S BAD FOR A YOUNG MAN
AND LADY TO BE ALONE TOGETHER.

279
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,125
- RIMU, WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

280
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,208
- TV. THE DAYTIME
DRAMA PROGRAMS.

281
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,083
- YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH
THOSE KINDS OF SHOWS.

282
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,333
BESIDES, NOTHING LIKE THAT IS
GOING ON BETWEEN RIN AND ASA.

283
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,791
- IT'S NOT?

284
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,375
- THOSE TWO HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
SINCE THEY WERE KIDS,

285
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,208
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT
KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

286
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,250
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

287
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,416
- SHE SURE IS TAKING HER TIME.

288
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,666
OH WELL, I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM ANYWAY.

289
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,208
IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T KNOW
MY OWN WAY AROUND THIS HOUSE,

290
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,125
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN COMING HERE
SINCE I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH.

291
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,541
- ( both gasp )

292
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,208
- UH, HI...
- HI, RIN.

293
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,666
- DID YOU... DID YOU
FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR?

294
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,750
- NO, IT JUST WASN'T
WORKING FOR SOME REASON.

295
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,583
I GUESS...
I GUESS IT'S BROKEN.

296
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,583
I WAS THINKING I SHOULD
PROBABLY BUY SOME PARTS

297
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,791
TO FIX IT THIS WEEKEND.

298
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,250
- YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

299
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,208
- YEAH, THANKS
FOR REMINDING ME.

300
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,000
- HEY, WHAT'RE FRIENDS FOR.
SORRY FOR BARGING IN LIKE THIS.

301
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,833
- IT'S COOL,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

302
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,916
- ( Asa screams )

303
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,541
- ( both laugh )

304
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,791
- THAT WAS SO AWKWARD.

305
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,625
CAN WE JUST PRETEND
IT NEVER HAPPENED?

306
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,166
- GLADLY.

307
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,500
- OH, MY GOSH, YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE IN FOREVER, HAVE YOU?

308
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,291
- LIKE, SINCE, JUNIOR HIGH!
- NOPE. YOU'RE RIGHT,

309
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,333
WE USED TO HANG OUT
HERE A LOT BACK THEN.

310
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,166
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE
STOPPED DURING HIGH SCHOOL.

311
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,250
- Asa: MY MOM SAYS
SHE MISSES YOU.

312
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,750
- Rin: KAEDE ALWAYS
LOOKED FORWARD TO

313
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,708
TAKING COOKING
LESSONS FROM YOU.

314
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,583
SHE WAS COMING TO YOU
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY.

315
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,791
SHE REALLY IMPROVED A LOT.

316
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,791
- Asa: OH YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

317
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,416
ACTUALLY, THOSE LESSONS
ARE THE VERY REASON YOU AND I

318
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,708
FIRST MET EACH OTHER.
DO YOU REMEMBER?

319
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,000
- WELL, SORT OF.

320
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,083
- GOSH, IT FEELS
LIKE FOREVER AGO,

321
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,666
AND THE COOKING CLUB
HAD JUST STARTED

322
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,791
WHEN YOU AND KAEDE CAME IN.

323
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,041
I THOUGHT BOTH OF YOU WERE
JOINING AT FIRST, BUT THEN...

324
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,250
- I'M NOT JOINING, I'M JUST
HERE TO WATCH OVER HER.

325
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,833
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU
WOULD TAKE CARE OF HER FOR ME.

326
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,791
- Asa: THAT KINDA SURPRISED ME.

327
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,500
- Rin: KAEDE PUSHES
HERSELF TOO HARD,

328
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,250
SO I WAS JUST TRYING
TO LOOK OUT FOR HER.

329
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,416
Asa: I ENVIED HER.

330
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,083
- NO WAY, REALLY?

331
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,333
- REALLY! I MEAN,
YOU WEREN'T EVEN IN THE CLUB,

332
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,958
BUT YOU ALWAYS WAITED FOR HER.

333
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,958
YOU WERE JUST SO SUPPORTIVE,
I THOUGHT IT WAS SWEET.

334
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,083
- DIDN'T KNOW I
HAD SUCH AN IMPACT.

335
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,458
- YOU CERTAINLY DID. DEFINITELY.

336
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,666
EVEN THOUGH YOU SAID YOU
WERE JUST WAITING FOR HER,

337
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,291
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT YOU WERE
THERE BECAUSE YOU CARED, A LOT.

338
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,375
I DIDN'T KNOW GUYS
LIKE THAT EXISTED.

339
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,041
KAEDE WAS WORKING SO
HARD ON HER COOKING,

340
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,333
AND IT WAS ALL FOR YOU.

341
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,625
YOU TWO SEEMED TO HAVE
SOMETHING SO SPECIAL.

342
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,291
I REMEMBER WISHING I HAD A GUY
WHO CARED ABOUT ME THAT WAY.

343
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,958
AND, THAT'S WHY I ENVIED HER.

344
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,791
- I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF
GUYS LIKE ME STILL OUT THERE.

345
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,041
- DO YOU THINK SO?

346
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,000
- OF COURSE I DO.
TAKE TAKIZAWA,

347
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,208
HE SEEMS LIKE A REALLY GREAT GUY
AND HE CARES ABOUT YOU A LOT.

348
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,125
- TAKIZAWA? GREAT.

349
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,250
- OH, SORRY, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

350
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,833
- NO, IT'S COOL!

351
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,708
I MEAN, YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU
WANT! WE'RE FRIENDS, AREN'T WE?

352
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,166
- YEAH, OKAY, THEN TELL ME
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM.

353
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,250
- RIGHT. LET ME THINK. I'M...

354
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,458
I KIND OF... I GUESS I DON'T
KNOW HOW I FEEL.

355
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,625
- IS IT POSSIBLE HE'S
JUST NOT YOUR TYPE?

356
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,250
- NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT.

357
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,708
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
WHAT KAREHA SAID EARLIER.

358
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,083
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

359
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,875
ISN'T WHETHER YOU LIKE HIM
OR NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON?

360
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,208
- NO, IT'S NOT.

361
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,208
I MEAN, HOW I FEEL ABOUT
HIM ISN'T THE ISSUE HERE.

362
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,041
- HUH?

363
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,583
- I'M NOT READY.

364
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,875
AND BESIDES, DO I LOOK LIKE
SOMEONE'S WHO'S INTO ROMANCE?

365
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,875
- WELL, NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT, I GUESS NOT.

366
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,750
- DON'T BE SUCH A JERK!
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY "YES."

367
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,541
EVEN IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IT'S TRUE.

368
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,958
- OOPS! I'M SORRY.

369
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,416
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

370
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,666
I'M NOT READY FOR THAT
KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

371
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,000
I'M STILL YOUNG AND I
WANNA ENJOY A NORMAL

372
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,375
HIGH SCHOOL LIFE WITH
MY FRIENDS, WHILE I CAN.

373
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:07,000
I LOVE HAVING THE FREEDOM TO
BE AS SILLY AND CRAZY AS I WANT.

374
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,333
I WOULDN'T WANT
THAT TO CHANGE

375
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,291
BECAUSE OF SOME BOY
LOOKING AFTER ME.

376
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,583
- I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

377
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,083
- REALLY? I KNEW THAT YOU WOULD.

378
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,375
- SURE, WE'RE FRIENDS,
AREN'T WE?

379
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,250
- WHAT'S WEIRD,
IS THAT I COULD ACTUALLY

380
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,458
STILL SEE MYSELF
FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.

381
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,875
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

382
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,333
- ( laughs )

383
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,666
THAT'S OKAY, BECAUSE I HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION

384
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,833
OF COMPETING WITH KAEDE AND
YOUR LITTLE HOUSEHOLD HAREM.

385
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,291
- WHO'S THE JERK NOW!

386
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,083
- I KNOW, I'M SORRY.
I'M GONNA GET US SOME TEA.

387
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,833
- WHA...

388
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,916
- ( heartbeat )

389
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,958
- RIN.
- Ama: ASA! I'M HOME!

390
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,750
- I FOUND THE BEST...

391
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,458
OH RIN, I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE!

392
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,250
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YES, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME!

393
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,416
GOODNESS, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR LEG!

394
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,916
- OH, NOTHING.
I JUST SPRAINED IT A LITTLE.

395
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,833
- THAT'S SO AWFUL! LET ME
GET SOME MEDICINE FOR IT!

396
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,791
- ( both sigh )

397
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,958
- YOU'RE KIDDING!

398
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,833
YOU WERE TEASING THAT
WHOLE TIME, WEREN'T YOU!

399
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,875
- I GUESS YOU'LL NEVER
KNOW FOR SURE, WILL YOU?

400
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,250
- ( laughs )

401
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,541
- Kareha: YOU TURNED
HIM DOWN, HUH?

402
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,458
- YEAH. I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE READY

403
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,916
FOR A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

404
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,625
- IS THAT IT, OR IS IT POSSIBLE

405
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,500
YOU'RE ALREADY IN LOVE
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

406
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,416
- NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

407
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,208
I JUST LIKE MY LIFE
THE WAY IT IS NOW,

408
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,208
AND I'M NOT READY TO CHANGE IT.

409
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,541
- BUT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE
ISN'T SOMEONE SPECIAL OUT THERE

410
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,875
WHO COULD CHANGE MY MIND.

411
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,708
- ( screams )

412
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,083
- ( theme song playing )

413
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

414
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,625
- Primula: I CAN'T SLEEP.
- Rin: TRY COUNTING SHEEP.

415
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,958
- Primula: OKAY.
ONE SHEEP, TWO SHEEP,

416
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,958
RIN, WHAT ARE THE SHEEP DOING?

417
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,583
- Rin: STROLLING AROUND
AND JUMPING FENCES.

418
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,041
- Primula: ARE THEY FOR SALE?

419
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,333
- Asa: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE,
EPISODE 8, "PANTY DATE!"

420
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,541
- Rin: WHY DID YOU ASK THAT?
- Primula: I WANT TO EAT THEM.
