1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,250
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,583
- Rin: ASA.

4
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,750
( panting )

5
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,375
ASA. WHERE ARE YOU?

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,333
ASA. WHERE DID YOU GO?

7
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,833
- ( coughing )

8
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,083
- Girl: GRANDPA. HANG ON.

9
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,291
- ASA.

10
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:56,250
- ( breathing heavily )
NOT, NOT YET.

11
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,083
YOU CAN DO IT.

12
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,791
BETTER HURRY, THOUGH.

13
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,833
- Ama: ASA.

14
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,041
- ASA. WHERE ARE YOU? ASA.

15
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,041
- ( horn honking )

16
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,250
- SORRY.

17
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,666
DAMMIT.

18
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,125
- RIMU? ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
- SOMETHING BOTHERS ME.

19
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,833
- TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

20
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,416
- I DON'T KNOW.

21
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,375
- RIMU.

22
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,083
- ASA, WHERE DID YOU GO?

23
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,166
- I'VE LIVED IN THIS CITY
MY WHOLE LIFE.

24
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,208
BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY TAKEN THE
TIME TO JUST LOOK AT IT BEFORE.

25
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,583
- IT'S NO USE.

26
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,083
- RIN.

27
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,291
- GET A GRIP. ASA
WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON YOU.

28
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,958
SHE'S GOT TO BE
SOMEWHERE. BUT WHERE?

29
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,458
THINK ABOUT IT.

30
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,416
WHAT PLACES WOULD ASA POSSIBLY
GO AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

31
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,875
COME ON, THINK, RIN.

32
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,916
- WHEN I START TO GET SCARED,
THERE'S THIS DREAM I REMEMBER.

33
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,583
A DREAM I HAD ABOUT THE TWO OF
US WHEN WE'RE BOTH VERY OLD.

34
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,375
IN THE DREAM YOU HAD TAKEN ME
BACK TO THAT OVERLOOK...

35
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,583
- JUST MAYBE.

36
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,791
YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH
A COLD OUT HERE.

37
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,041
- RIN. HOW'D YOU
KNOW I'D BE HERE?

38
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,458
- OH, JUST CALL IT A HUNCH.

39
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,208
- I SEE. I REALLY LIKE THAT YOU
KNOW ME AS WELL AS YOU DO, RIN.

40
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,500
- WELL, WE SHOULD GET GOING.
IT'S PRETTY COLD OUT HERE.

41
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,333
UH, ASA? UM...

42
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,500
- I KNOW THIS SOUNDS STRANGE.
BUT WHEN I GOT HERE,

43
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,583
I SUDDENLY FELT A
WHOLE LOT BETTER.

44
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,125
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU
FIRST TOLD ME YOU LOVED ME.

45
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,000
- I WAS SO HAPPY TO HEAR IT.
- I WAS REALLY NERVOUS, THOUGH.

46
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,541
- YOUR ONCE IN A LIFETIME
CONFESSION?

47
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,916
- WELL, SURE. I GUESS.

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,041
- HEY, COME ON. DON'T
SHORT CHANGE IT.

49
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,541
IF ALL YOU CAN SAY IS "I GUESS,"

50
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,333
THEN IT MAKES THE CONFESSION
SEEM LIKE NOTHING.

51
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,500
IT TOUCHED ME, SO PLEASE
DON'T RUIN IT.

52
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,958
- I, I'M SORRY.

53
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,250
- I AM GLAD THAT YOU SAID IT,
THOUGH.

54
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,583
IN FACT, I'M REALLY GLAD THAT
YOU SAID IT JUST LIKE

55
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,041
A PROPER GENTLEMAN WOULD.

56
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,333
- ASA, CAN WE JUST...

57
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:32,000
- IT'S SUCH A NICE NIGHT.
OH, LOOK. SEE IT?

58
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,791
THERE'S VERBENA ACADEMY.

59
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,416
I WONDER HOW
EVERYONE'S BEEN DOING?

60
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,166
OH, AND THERE'S OUR JUNIOR HIGH.

61
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,333
I WAS WHAT? A THIRD YEAR STUDENT
WHEN YOU AND I FIRST MET?

62
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,666
THAT'S RIGHT.

63
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,458
KAEDE BROUGHT YOU ALONG
TO A COOKING CLUB MEETING.

64
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:50,333
THAT SURE BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.
LOOK, THE TRAIN STATION.

65
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,125
AND SPEAKING OF MEMORIES, THAT
WAS THE FIRST PLACE

66
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,250
I EVER MET A BOY
TO GO ON A DATE.

67
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,625
( laughing ) MY HEART
WAS BEATING A MILE A MINUTE.

68
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,166
- WE NEED TO TALK...

69
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,791
- THERE'S MY HOUSE. IT LOOKS
SO SMALL FROM UP HERE.

70
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:09,291
HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME YOU CAME OVER TO MY PLACE?

71
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,416
- I SURE DO. YOU WERE SO...
- PLEASE.

72
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,166
- WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO UPSET?

73
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,291
- ASA, LISTEN.
YOU'VE GOT TO USE YOUR MAGIC.

74
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,416
I'M BEGGING YOU.

75
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:28,500
- THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T DO.
- AT ALL? NO MATTER WHAT?

76
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,500
- I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,
RIN, BUT, LIKE I SAID,

77
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,625
I WON'T USE MY MAGIC.

78
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,750
- I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY THAT.

79
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,583
- I'M SORRY. THAT'S THE
WAY IT HAS TO BE.

80
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,208
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M
GOING THROUGH.

81
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,750
YOU CAN'T.

82
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:46,500
- DO YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL RIGHT
NOW? ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS.

83
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,333
YOU'RE SUFFERING, AND THE ONLY
THING I WANT RIGHT NOW

84
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,625
IS FOR YOU TO GET BETTER.

85
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,583
BUT IF YOU WON'T
USE YOUR MAGIC,

86
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,708
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU.

87
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,791
HONESTLY, I'M AT THE END
OF MY ROPE.

88
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,333
WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE YOU BETTER?

89
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:06,083
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT ALL THIS TIME.

90
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,875
BUT IN THE END, I COULDN'T
FIND AN ANSWER.

91
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,500
BUT STILL, I CAN'T SIT BACK
AND LET YOU DIE,

92
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,500
SO I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

93
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,916
- RIN, WAIT.

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,666
- I JUST COULDN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE, ASA.

95
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,458
SO THIS IS ALL I CAN DO.

96
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,375
- NO. DON'T!

97
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,791
- I'LL DO ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING
TO MAKE YOU LIVE,

98
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,375
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS.

99
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,750
IF THIS IS WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE
YOU USE YOUR MAGIC, SO BE IT.

100
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,375
- ( gasps )

101
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:40,916
- I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART,
ASA. I ALWAYS WILL.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,125
EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE.

103
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,583
- ( screams )

104
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:58,083
RIN!

105
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:02,541
YOU IDIOT. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

106
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,750
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M... I'M AN IDIOT.

107
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,916
BUT THIS WAS ALL
I COULD THINK OF, SORRY.

108
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,875
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

109
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,916
WATCHING SOMEONE YOU LOVE
DIE IN FRONT OF YOU HURTS.

110
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,958
DOESN'T IT?
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

111
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,708
WHAT EXACTLY WAS IT THAT AMA
WISHED FOR YOU, HUH?

112
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,375
SHE WISHED YOU WEREN'T HUMAN
SO YOU WOULDN'T SUFFER,

113
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,750
BUT DON'T YOU THINK SHE WANTED
MORE THAN JUST THAT FOR YOU?

114
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,125
DON'T YOU THINK YOUR MOTHER
WANTS TO SEE HER DAUGHTER LIVE?

115
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,416
DON'T YOU THINK SHE WANTS TO SEE
HER DAUGHTER SMILE AND BE HAPPY?

116
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,208
DO YOU KNOW HOW IT MAKES AMA AND
ME FEEL TO SEE YOU SUFFERING?

117
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,166
WE CAN'T STAND IT.
IT'S TERRIBLE.

118
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,208
SO I...

119
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,166
- NO, DON'T. YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME.

120
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,625
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

121
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,458
MY LIFE ISN'T WORTH LIVING IF
I DON'T HAVE ANYONE IN IT.

122
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,625
- ( crying ) RIN!

123
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,500
- IF EVERYONE IN MY LIFE
JUST UP AND LEFT,

124
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,291
I'M SURE I'D WITHER
AWAY IN TWO WEEKS.

125
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,541
- YOU'VE GOT TO HANG IN THERE.
STAY WITH ME.

126
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:17,791
- SO THAT'S WHY. THAT'S WHY I
NEED SOMEONE IN MY LIFE,

127
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,583
LIKE YOU...

128
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,416
- NO. DON'T. PLEASE, RIN.

129
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,083
PLEASE OPEN YOUR EYES.
YOU CAN'T DIE. YOU CAN'T.

130
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,708
( screams ) I WON'T LET YOU.

131
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,291
RIN?

132
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,583
- ASA. HEY.

133
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,375
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

134
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,208
- YOU DUMMY.

135
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,500
- Primula: IT'S BEEN
THREE WEEKS SINCE THEN.

136
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,250
KAEDE. HURRY UP.

137
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,750
I'M ATTENDING SCHOOL NOW AS A
FIRST YEAR STUDENT

138
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,291
AT VERBENA ACADEMY.

139
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,416
- COMING. SORRY TO MAKE YOU WAIT
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

140
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,666
HERE YOU GO, RIMU. DON'T FORGET
TO TAKE YOUR LUNCH WITH YOU.

141
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,958
- THANK YOU.
BUT KAEDE, WHERE'S YOURS?

142
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,666
- OH, NO. I FORGOT.

143
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,958
- Eustoma: HEY, PRIMULA.

144
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,416
- HOW ARE YOU?
GOTTEN USED TO SCHOOL YET?

145
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,041
- WHY DON'T WE COME AND OBSERVE
YOUR CLASS TODAY THEN, OKAY?

146
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,416
BESIDES, WE HAVEN'T SEEN
RIN IN QUITE A WHILE.

147
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,416
WHY, JUST THIS MORNING,
MABOU AND I WERE...

148
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,000
- Sia: FORGET IT, DAD.
YOU'RE NOT COMING.

149
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,208
- Nerine: FATHER.

150
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,250
- ( gasps )

151
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,458
- STUPID PARENTS.

152
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,375
RIN AND ASA TOLD US LATER WHAT
HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

153
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,750
WE WERE ALL PRETTY SHOCKED.

154
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,375
OH. HI, RIN.

155
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,666
- PRIMULA, WHAT'S UP?
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

156
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,291
- HEY, THERE. GOOD MORNING,
YOU LITTLE LOVE BIRDS.

157
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,833
KAEDE AND THE OTHERS SCOLDED
RIN FOR RISKING HIS LIFE.

158
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,791
BUT HONESTLY, I THINK HE DID
WHAT HE FELT WAS RIGHT.

159
00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:00,791
ASA IS COMPLETELY WELL NOW, TOO.
SHE AND I HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

160
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,791
WHEN WE BOTH GOT SICK, IT TOOK
RIN TO GET US BETTER.

161
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,333
WE DON'T MENTION THE DAY THEY
ALMOST DIED ANYMORE.

162
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,666
THERE'S NO REASON TO.

163
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,625
JUST BEING ABLE TO HAVE RIN
AND ASA IN OUR LIVES

164
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,958
IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR US.

165
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,875
- Nerine: DO YOU
MEAN YOUR FATHER'S UNDERWEAR?

166
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,333
- YEAH, THOSE RED ONES HE WEARS.

167
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,416
- I REALLY WISH I
HADN'T HEARD THAT.

168
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,583
- ( Rin yawning )

169
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,458
- RIN, ARE YOU SLEEPY?

170
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,958
- UH-HUH. DELIVERING
NEWSPAPERS HELPS PAY THE RENT,

171
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,958
BUT I HAVE TO GET
UP BEFORE DAWN.

172
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,583
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU COULD
USE SOME COFFEE.

173
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,291
- ( laughs )

174
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,500
OH, HEY, BEFORE I FORGET, THANK
YOU FOR THIS MORNING, KAEDE.

175
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,875
- OH. YOU'RE WELCOME, BUT IT
WAS REALLY NOTHING AT ALL.

176
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,208
- HEY. WHAT ARE THE TWO
OF YOU TALKING ABOUT, RIN?

177
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,291
- COME ON. IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

178
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,875
THIS MORNING WHEN I WENT
BY KAEDE'S HOUSE

179
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,875
TO DELIVER THE PAPER, SHE HAD A
CUP OF COFFEE WAITING FOR ME.

180
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,000
RIGHT?

181
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,458
- UH, NO WAY. KAEDE,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

182
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,000
- YEAH, THANKS FOR SHOWING
ALL OF US UP.

183
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,416
FINE, I'LL MAKE COFFEE FOR YOU

184
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
TOMORROW, TOO, RIN,
BUT MINE WILL BE GOURMET ROAST.

185
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,083
- OH, YEAH? THEN, I'LL MAKE
BREAKFAST FOR YOU, TOO.

186
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,958
A BIG ONE WITH BACON, EGGS,
WAFFLES... WHATEVER YOU WANT.

187
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,708
- WELL, I'M ON A PRETTY
TIGHT DELIVERY SCHEDULE.

188
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,458
- PRETTY SNEAKY MOVE
YOU MADE THERE, KAEDE.

189
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,625
- NO, YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

190
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,041
I JUST HAPPENED TO
WAKE UP EARLY.

191
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,041
- NO YOU DIDN'T, KAEDE.
YOU SET YOUR ALARM.

192
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,583
- RIMU.

193
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,041
- I CALL THAT A CHALLENGE.
IT'S ON.

194
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,625
- THEN I'M GOING TO GET UP
SUPER EARLY TOMORROW.

195
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,000
- ME, TOO.

196
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,625
- UH, LOOK, I APPRECIATE THIS.

197
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,458
I REALLY DO, BUT DON'T
OVERDO IT, OKAY?

198
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,416
- ( overlapping chatter )

199
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,583
- I MADE YOU LUNCH TODAY.
- OH. THANK YOU, ASA.

200
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,458
- IT TURNED OUT REALLY AMAZING.
YOU'LL SEE.

201
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,541
HOPE YOU'RE LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

202
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,166
- UH, SURE. OF COURSE.

203
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,666
- SEE YA.

204
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,833
- ( man laughing )

205
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,833
- WHO ARE YOU?

206
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,750
- Primula: RIN WANTS TO GET INTO
THE SAME UNIVERSITY AS ASA,

207
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,708
SO HE'S HAVING TO STUDY
REALLY HARD.

208
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,416
- OH, YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE TO
SLEEP IN MY CLASS, TSUCCHIMI.

209
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,541
'CAUSE YOU OWE ME A ONE HUNDRED
PAGE REPORT TOMORROW.

210
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:27,000
- NO. NOT THAT.

211
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,125
- BUT IT'S NOT WORKING
OUT TOO WELL.

212
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,708
HMM...

213
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,208
- A ONE HUNDRED PAGE REPORT?

214
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,333
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WRITE
THAT BY TOMORROW?

215
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,583
- EXCUSE ME? RIN?

216
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,750
HERE ARE THE NOTES I TOOK
ABOUT TODAY'S LECTURE.

217
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,333
YOU'RE MORE THAN
WELCOME TO THEM,

218
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,500
IF YOU THINK THEY'LL HELP.

219
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,541
- THAT GOES FOR MY
NOTES AS WELL, RIN.

220
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,458
YOU CAN USE THEM IF YOU'D LIKE.

221
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,708
- I WISH I'D TAKEN NOTES I COULD
LEND YOU, BUT I DIDN'T,

222
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,416
SO ALL I CAN DO IS CHEER YOU ON.

223
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,875
- THANKS FOR THE THOUGHT.
REALLY.

224
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,625
- Itsuki: UH-UH. NO WAY.
YOU GIRLS CAN'T DO THIS.

225
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,625
- WHY CAN'T THEY, ITSUKI?

226
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,541
- 'CAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR. COME ON.

227
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,333
DO I REALLY HAVE TO SPELL
IT OUT FOR YOU?

228
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,041
YOU CAN'T HAVE THREE LOVELY
LADIES FAWNING ALL OVER YOU

229
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,708
WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE
A PERFECTLY GOOD GIRLFRIEND.

230
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,791
- THIS HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT AND YOU KNOW IT.

231
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,750
- NO. IT DOES.

232
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,458
SINCE YOU'RE NOW TAKEN, YOU'VE
GOT NO RIGHT TO THESE LADIES.

233
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,583
TIME TO STEP ASIDE AND GIVE
SOMEONE ELSE THE OPPORTUNITY

234
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,750
TO FIND LOVE.

235
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,583
THAT BEING SAID, WHAT
DO YOU SAY, KAEDE?

236
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,375
DO YOU WANT TO GO ON
A DATE WITH ME?

237
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,375
- HERE WE GO.

238
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,125
- OH. UM, THANK YOU, ITSUKI,

239
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,166
BUT I STILL HAVE FEELINGS
FOR RIN. I'M SORRY.

240
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,541
- BUT HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND.

241
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,750
- YEAH, THAT'S
TRUE, BUT YOU SEE,

242
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,625
ASA TOLD ME IT'S OKAY IF I
STILL LOVE HIM, AND I DO.

243
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,833
- GOOD FOR YOU AND RIN.

244
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,708
- THEN WHAT ABOUT YOU, NERINE?
WANT TO GO OUT?

245
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,250
- I'M SORRY.

246
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,375
I'M SURE YOU'RE A NICE GUY AND
WOULD SHOW ME A FINE TIME,

247
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,125
BUT I'VE GOT A THING
FOR RIN, TOO.

248
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,458
- HOW ABOUT YOU, SIA?

249
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,083
- THANKS. BUT THE WORLD OF THE
GODS IS A POLYGAMOUS SOCIETY,

250
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,125
SO I CAN STILL LOVE RIN.

251
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,166
- CRAP.

252
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,833
- COME ON. YOU SHOULD KNOW
BETTER THAN TO HIT ON GIRLS

253
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,041
WHO ALREADY HAVE THEIR LITTLE
HEARTS SET ON SOMEONE.

254
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,750
JUST GIVE IT UP ALREADY, ITSUKI.

255
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,625
AND, BESIDES, THERE'RE PLENTY
MORE FISH IN THE SEA, RIGHT?

256
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,250
- YOU'RE CORRECT, AND I DO
WANT TO SPREAD MY LOVE AROUND.

257
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,875
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SOUND SO
SCUMMY ALL THE TIME?

258
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,500
- IT'S JUST THAT WHEN I SEE
THE GIRLS AT SCHOOL,

259
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,208
I WANT TO LOVE
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

260
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,666
- EVEN YOU, MAYUMI.
YOUR FACE AIN'T BAD AT ALL.

261
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,250
- HUH?

262
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,000
- HONESTLY, I THINK YOUR FACE
IS DECENT, BUT THE REST OF YOU?

263
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,958
UGH, NOT SO MUCH.
- OH, NO.

264
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,083
- LIKE YOUR BOOBS,
FOR EXAMPLE. TINY...

265
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,208
- SHUT UP.

266
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,291
- UH. WOW, MAYUMI.

267
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:49,833
- YOU SUCK.
- HE BROUGHT THIS ON HIMSELF.

268
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,541
- Nerine: HELLO, EVERYONE.
IT'S TIME FOR NEBU LUNCH BOX,

269
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,041
VERBENA ACADEMY'S OFFICIAL
SCHOOL RADIO PROGRAM.

270
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,125
- NERINE MAKES
A REALLY GOOD DEEJAY.

271
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,500
- I HEARD THEY'RE EVEN GOING
TO LET HER SING DURING

272
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,208
THE LUNCHTIME BROADCAST
IN A FEW WEEKS.

273
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,458
- WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

274
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,375
- YOU READY FOR LUNCH NOW?

275
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,791
- OH. THANKS AGAIN, ASA.

276
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,166
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO EATING

277
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,583
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR DELICIOUS
LUNCHES ALL MORNING.

278
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:16,583
- UM, HEY, RIN. I'LL MAKE YOU A
DELICIOUS LUNCH SOMETIME, TOO.

279
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,458
I GUARANTEE YOU'LL LOVE IT.

280
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,291
- HOLD ON, SIA.

281
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,666
- AS LONG AS THAT'S OKAY,
OF COURSE.

282
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,291
- SURE THING. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

283
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,041
IN FACT, I BET RIN WOULD REALLY
APPRECIATE IT. RIGHT?

284
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,041
- ( chuckles nervously )

285
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,708
- BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
EAT MY LUNCH, TOO. OKAY?

286
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,375
- OH. YEAH. SURE.

287
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,333
- THANKS SO MUCH, RIN.
I'LL WORK HARD ON IT, I SWEAR.

288
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,500
- BUT YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T BODE
WELL FOR YOUR FUTURE

289
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,291
IF ASA ALREADY HAS
THIS MUCH CONTROL.

290
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,291
( chuckles )

291
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,125
- OH, RIN, THAT REMINDS ME.

292
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,291
PRIMULA MADE A LITTLE
SOMETHING SPECIAL

293
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,166
FOR YOUR LUNCH TODAY, ALSO.

294
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,750
- I DID.

295
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,625
- WOW. THAT'S GREAT. I'M
IMPRESSED. I'D LOVE TO TRY IT.

296
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,208
- SURE.

297
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,791
- OOH, LOOKS PRETTY TASTY. AND
SO DOES THAT GIANT RICE BALL

298
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,000
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

299
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,666
WELL, THANKS AGAIN, RIMU.

300
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,416
- Both: RIN!

301
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,708
- PRIMULA, WHAT IN THE WORLD
WAS IN THAT THING YOU MADE?

302
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,583
- WHAT'S WRONG?

303
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,583
- HERB ENCRUSTED LAMB,

304
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,083
WRAPPED IN SEAWEED AND DIPPED
IN EXTRA BITTER SAUCE.

305
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:24,541
- HE MUST BE ALLERGIC TO IT.
- OH, RIN. IT'LL BE OKAY.

306
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,458
- HEY, DO YOU MIND IF WE DROP BY
THE BOOKSTORE ON THE WAY HOME?

307
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,791
I'D LIKE TO GET THE
NOVEMBER ISSUE

308
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,083
OF "HOME COOKING FOR
LOVE" IF IT'S OUT.

309
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,000
- SURE. NO PROBLEM.

310
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,208
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO LOOK FOR A
NEW COOK BOOK THAT'S GOT

311
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,125
RECIPES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES
OF EGG DISHES, ANYWAY.

312
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,375
- OH. HEY, RIMU. SEE YOU LATER.
- HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, PRIMULA.

313
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,375
- HI, KAEDE.

314
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,291
- HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU, RIMU.

315
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,833
IT SEEMS RIN ALREADY
LEFT FOR THE DAY.

316
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,791
- THINK HE'S AT THE USUAL PLACE?

317
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,416
- HUH? UM, SURE. I GUESS.

318
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,791
- WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
- WELL, WAIT. PRIMULA.

319
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,250
- I FOUND THE NICEST
LITTLE CAFE

320
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,791
NEAR THE TRAIN STATION
THE OTHER DAY.

321
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,416
THE UNIFORMS THE WAITRESSES
WEAR ARE PRETTY CUTE.

322
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,666
I BET NERINE WOULD
LOOK GOOD IN ONE.

323
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,375
- OH. YOU MUST BE
TALKING ABOUT FLORA.

324
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,500
- SO YOU'VE BEEN THERE?
YOU, SHIN?

325
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,958
- YEAH SEVERAL TIMES.
THEY MAKE A PARFAIT TO DIE FOR.

326
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,791
HMM...

327
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,541
- WAS THAT SOMEONE
YOU KNOW, SHIN?

328
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,250
- NO, BUT SHE LOOKED
LIKE SOMEONE I KNEW

329
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,375
WHO PASSED AWAY
SOME TIME AGO.

330
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,250
- I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.
SHE DID LOOK A LOT LIKE HER.

331
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,875
- I WISH SHE WAS ALIVE SO WE
COULD APOLOGIZE TO HER, MABOU.

332
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,625
- ME, TOO. I FEEL JUST TERRIBLE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

333
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,916
- Kareha: BACK AGAIN, HUH?

334
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,791
YOU KNOW, RIN, YOU ARE
ONE ATTENTIVE GUY.

335
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,291
- NO. IT'S NOT THAT,
IT'S JUST...

336
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,791
- IT'S NOTHING TO BE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

337
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:33,375
- BUT, I'M NOT EMBARRASSED.
UH, COULD I ORDER NOW?

338
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,208
- SURE. OH, WAITRESS.

339
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,833
- WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE HERE.
YOU CAN DO IT.

340
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:40,916
YOU CAN TAKE MY ORDER.

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,083
- RIN. WOULD YOU STOP
BEING SO SHY?

342
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,666
OH, LOOK, THERE'S YOUR
WAITRESS RIGHT NOW.

343
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,166
- YOU CAME TO VISIT AGAIN.
THANKS, RIN.

344
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,416
- WELL, I'M GLAD
I COULD BE HERE.

345
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,333
- UH, COME ON. YOU KNOW WHEN
YOU GET ALL EMBARRASSED,

346
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,708
IT MAKES ME ALL EMBARRASSED TOO.

347
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,833
- BUT...

348
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,541
- OOH LA LA, WHAT'S THE MATTER.

349
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,833
YOU MEAN YOU TWO STILL AREN'T
USED TO THE UNIFORM YET?

350
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,625
IT'S ALREADY BEEN A WEEK
SINCE YOU STARTED WORKING HERE.

351
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:07,666
- NO, NOT YET. I'M JUST STARTING
TO THINK I PICKED THE WRONG JOB.

352
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,708
I MEAN, A FRILLY SKIRT
LIKE THIS ONE

353
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,166
JUST DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON ME.

354
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,166
- ASA, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

355
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,166
IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.
VERY GOOD.

356
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,833
- OOH LA LA.

357
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,000
- OH, YOU THINK SO?
- OF COURSE.

358
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,916
- WELL, HERE'S A SPECIAL TREAT.

359
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,416

361
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,250
- UM, THANKS?

362
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:38,916
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

363
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,458
- I LOVE A HAPPY ENDING.

364
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,166
- HURRY UP, KAEDE.

365
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,041

366
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,583
