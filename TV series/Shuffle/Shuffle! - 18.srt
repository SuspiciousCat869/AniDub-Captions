1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,083
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,166
- THERE HE IS, YOU
GUYS! COME ON!

4
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,208
- Girl: WAIT UP!

5
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,458
- I SEE.
A NEW KIND OF COOKIE, HUH?

6
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,833
- YEP. IT'S CALLED
A TRICOLOR COOKIE.

7
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,750
WHEN IT'S FINISHED, I'LL
LET YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE

8
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,458
OF BEING THE FIRST
ONE TO TASTE IT!

9
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:02,291
- HOLD ON, DOESN'T THAT MAKE
ME SOME KINDA GUINEA PIG?

10
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,666
- WELL, IF THAT'S HOW
YOU'RE GONNA BE, RIN,

11
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,208
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU ANY,
EVEN IF YOU TRY TO BEG ME.

12
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,166
- NO, I WAS JUST KIDDING.

13
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,583
NOTHING IN THE WORLD
WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER

14
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,458
THAN EATING
YOUR COOKIES, ASA!

15
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,333
- ( grunting )

16
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,875
- I LOVE YOUR COOKIES,
IT WAS JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH!

17
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,125
REALLY! I PROMISE!

18
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,333
- DO YOU THINK SHE MIGHT BE THE
GIRL THAT RIN IS IN LOVE WITH?

19
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,125
- I GUESS. MAYBE.

20
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,375
- MAYBE, HUH?

21
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,875
THOSE TWO MIGHT
BE A GOOD MATCH.

22
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,083
AND ASA IS A REALLY
GOOD PERSON, SO...

23
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,750
- WELL, YEAH, BUT. IT'S NOT LIKE
RIN HAS EXACTLY COME OUT

24
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,375
AND SAID IT TO
EITHER ONE OF US!

25
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,458
- DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S
SAID ANYTHING TO ASA?

26
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,541
- I'D BE WILLING TO
BET THAT HE HASN'T!

27
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,375
- SO, WHAT DO YOU
THINK WILL HAPPEN?

28
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,750
- I DON'T THINK WE CAN LET
THINGS STAY THIS WAY ANYMORE!

29
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,875
- MMM-HMM.

30
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,083
- WAIT, A DATE?

31
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,791
- YEP! WE THINK YOU SHOULD
GO ON A DATE WITH ASA!

32
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,250
- HOW COME YOU TWO ARE ASKING
ME TO DO THIS ALL OF A SUDDEN?

33
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,541
- ARE YOU SAYING IT'S
NOT SOMETHING

34
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,708
YOU ARE WILLING TO CONSIDER?

35
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,166
- NO, I'M WILLING
TO CONSIDER IT,

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,708
IT JUST SEEMS OUT OF THE BLUE.

37
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,416
- SO, YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT THEN?

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,041
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU TWO WOULD BRING

39
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,416
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
UP SO RANDOMLY?

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,750
- HONESTLY, ARE YOU
THAT CLUELESS?

41
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,541
- RIN, JUST LISTEN TO ME.

42
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,833
I THINK YOU NEED TO
TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

43
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,208
TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR!

44
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,333
- WHAT DO I NEED
TO MAKE CLEAR?

45
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,791
- YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION
ABOUT WHO IT IS THAT YOU LOVE.

46
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,458
- THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW,

47
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,000
IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

48
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,333
SO, I GUESS THERE MUST
BE SOMEONE ELSE SPECIAL

49
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,791
IN YOUR LIFE, ISN'T THERE?

50
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,625
- Nerine: HEY, DON'T WORRY.

51
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,583
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE
ME AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW.

52
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,916
FOR ALL I KNOW,

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,791
YOU MIGHT ALREADY HAVE A
SPECIAL GIRL IN YOUR LIFE.

54
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,916
- I'M SORRY.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,458
- AND BESIDES,
IT'LL BE MUCH EASIER

56
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,250
FOR THE TWO OF US TO FIGHT OUR
COMPETITION IF OUR RIVAL KNOWS.

57
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,875
- ROMANTIC RIVALRY SHOULD
BE FAIR AND SQUARE.

58
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,083
PLUS, IN MY OPINION, COMPETITION
BRINGS OUT THE BEST IN EVERYONE!

59
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,750
- AND, IF ASA REALLY
IS OUR COMPETITION,

60
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,666
THEN WE'VE GOT A
WORTHY ADVERSARY.

61
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,333
- RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

62
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,666
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THE BOTH OF YOU!

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,958
- LET'S GET RIGHT TO WORK!

64
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,916
- WAIT, HOLD ON
JUST ONE MINUTE.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,916
YOU SAY I SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR
BUT WHAT EXACTLY SHOULD I DO?

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,166
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU...

67
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,000
- Itsuki: TELL HER HOW
YOU FEEL RIN, WHAT ELSE?

68
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,833
- HUH?

69
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,291
- SO, ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE
HER SOMEWHERE REALLY FUN RIN?

70
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,833
- WELL, YOU KNOW.
WE'LL GO WHEREVER!

71
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,750
- Nerine: DON'T BE LIKE THAT.
YOU'LL EARN A LOT OF POINTS

72
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,541
IF YOU TAKE HER SOME
PLACE SHE REALLY LIKES.

73
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,250
- WELL, WHAT KIND OF
PLACES DOES SHE LIKE?

74
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,125
- WELL, HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?

75
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,125
- ( grunting in anger )

76
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,125
- Kaede: I WONDER WHAT
RIN IS DOING RIGHT NOW?

77
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,291
OH. HEY, TRY AND DO IT
SO IT WHIPS IN MORE AIR!

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,125
HE CAME HOME AND WENT
STRAIGHT OUT AGAIN.

79
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,166
I GUESS SIA AND THE OTHERS
WERE WITH HIM AS WELL.

80
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,583
- THEY SAID THEY WERE
TAKING RIN TO PLAN A DATE.

81
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,458
- WE ALL KNOW RIN'S
NOT QUALIFIED

82
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,916
TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
CONSIDERING THE GRAVITY
OF THE SITUATION,

84
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,708
IT IS UP TO ME TO CHOOSE
THE ULTIMATE DATE LOCATION!

85
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,500
BEHOLD! CUPID LAND!

86
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,166
- ( all exclaim )

87
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,208
- THE SEATS ON EVERY RIDE
ARE MADE FOR COUPLES!

88
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,750
IT'S MADE OF LOVERS,
BY LOVERS.

89
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,458
AND FOR LOVERS WHO ARE
LOOKING TO SHARE THEIR LOVE!

90
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,333
NO BETTER PLACE ON EARTH
TO CONFESS YOUR FEELINGS!

91
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,125
- ( girls exclaim )

92
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,333
- WOULDN'T SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE

93
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,708
ON THE NORMAL SIDE BE BETTER?

94
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,125
- AND WHAT EXACTLY IS
"THE NORMAL SIDE" RIN?

95
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,041
- WELL, FOR EXAMPLE,
GO SEE A MOVIE OR SOMETHING.

96
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,958
- FOOL!

97
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,708
GO ON AN UTTERLY NORMAL DATE,

98
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,708
YOU'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO MAKE
AN UTTERLY NORMAL CONFESSION.

99
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:09,458
A CONFESSION OF LOVE SHOULD BE
A BEAUTIFUL AND DRAMATIC THING!

100
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,000
- I JUST THINK A NORMAL
DATE WOULD BE BEST!

101
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,041
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

102
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,791
THIS IS TRUE LOVE, BABY!

103
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,875
THERE'S NOTHING
NORMAL ABOUT IT!

104
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,500
- YES! I THINK THIS
IS A GREAT PLAN!

105
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,708
- NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO
WORKING OUT THE DETAILS.

106
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,708
- ROGER THAT, CAPTAIN ITSUKI!

107
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,958
- I WILL DO EVERYTHING
THAT I CAN FOR YOU, SIR!

108
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,250
- HEY, HEY. HAVE YOU ALREADY
PICKED OUT THE SPOT WHERE

109
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,250
RIN SHOULD TELL
HER HE LOVES HER?

110
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,833
- ( girls chattering )

111
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,416
- Rin: WHAT ABOUT,
WHAT I WANNA DO?

112
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,375
- SO, YOU'RE FINALLY GOING
ON A DATE WITH RIN, HUH?

113
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,625
NOW YOU'LL BE...

114
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,750
- KAREHA! NOW DON'T START
IMAGINING WEIRD THINGS.

115
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,000
WE'RE JUST GOING OUT ON
A DATE TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN!

116
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:02,500
- GIVE IT UP, LET'S GO BACK
TO CLASS. COME ON!

117
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,875
- WELL, OKAY.

118
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,250
I'LL SEE YOU AT TEN IN FRONT
OF THE TRAIN STATION.

119
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,000
- ( sighs )

120
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,833
- SO, THE DATE IS
TOMORROW, RIGHT?

121
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.

122
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,916
YOU THINK IT'LL BE ALRIGHT
IF I WEAR NORMAL CLOTHES?

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,708
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU WEAR,

124
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,458
FANCY OR NOT,
I'M SURE THAT ASA WILL BE

125
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,583
THRILLED JUST TO BE GOING
ON A DATE WITH YOU.

126
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,708
THIS IS THE FIRST DATE, RIGHT?

127
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,375
I GUESS NORMALLY, IT WOULD BE
ALL THREE OF US OUT AND ABOUT.

128
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,166
YOU, AND ASA, AND ME.

129
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,583
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
THIS WASN'T MY IDEA.

130
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,583
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
I PROMISED RIMU THAT

131
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,083
I WOULD TAKE HER
SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES

132
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,041
ALL DAY ON SUNDAY.
SO, IT'S NOT LIKE

133
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,083
I WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO COME
ALONG ANYWAY. RIGHT, RIMU?

134
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,333
- MMM-HMM.

135
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,583
- I'LL BE BACK. I'M GONNA GO
MAKE A FRESH POT OF TEA.

136
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,416
- GOING "ALL OUT" AND FANCY
LIKE THAT WOULD BE WEIRDNESS.

137
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,041
BUT DRESSING TOO CASUAL
WOULD BE KINDA WEIRD TOO.

138
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,250
WHAT'S UP WITH ME?
I'M REALLY NOT THE KIND OF GIRL

139
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,708
WHO STRESSES OUT OVER
WHAT TO WEAR ON A DATE.

140
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,208
MAN, THIS IS HOPELESS.

141
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,291
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT
MAKING ME DINNER TONIGHT.

142
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,458
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM, RIN.

143
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,083
- WELL, WISH ME LUCK THEN!

144
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,833
- OH, KAEDE!

145
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,500
- HEY, DOESN'T A LITTLE
YARD WORK SOUND FUN?

146
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,500
- Nerine: THERE HE IS!

147
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,833
- Itsuki: AND EXACTLY
AS I PREDICTED,

148
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,958
RIN IS LATE JUST
LIKE HE ALWAYS IS!

149
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,750
- Mayumi: HEY,
SHE REALLY WENT ALL OUT!

150
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,375
WELL, HE IS LATE,
BUT HE'S HERE.

151
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,625
- Itsuki: THAT'S IT,
RIN, LAY ON THE CHARM!

152
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,041
- WOW, ASA LOOKS
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!

153
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,000
- IT MUST BE SO NICE TO ACTUALLY
GET TO GO OUT ON A DATE!

154
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,083
- YEAH.

155
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,166
- SO, I GUESS WE SHOULD GO.

156
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,333
- UH...

157
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,916
- HE JUST MISSED THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY TO GRAB HER HAND!

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,500
- I HAVE A HORRIBLE FEELING THIS
DATE IS GOING TO BE A NIGHTMARE.

159
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,333
- HERE WE GO EVERYONE!

160
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,583
WE HAVE TO BE THERE TO GIVE
OUR COMPLETE SUPPORT TO RIN!

161
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,458
- THAT'S RIGHT,
SO THAT HE CAN CLEARLY

162
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,166
CONVEY HIS FEELINGS TO
THE GIRL HE LOVES THE MOST.

163
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,083
- AND FOR OUR OWN SAKES TOO!

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,375
- THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

165
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,375
YOU WANNA GO ON
THIS RIDE FIRST?

166
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,291
- WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
GO ON THIS ONE AFTER ALL.

167
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,166
- MOVE IT! COME ON, NOW!

168
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,833
- EXCUSE ME! WHAT THE...

169
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,500
- MOVE IT OR LOSE IT,
MISTER MAN!

170
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,666
- WAIT FOR ME, RIN!

171
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,750
- WELCOME TO THE
MERRY-GO-ROUND OF LOVE!

172
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,583
- ( carousel music playing )

173
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,625
- LISTEN, YOU SURE
I'M NOT HEAVY?

174
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,458
- NO, I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

175
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,916
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,541
- DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.
JUST HOLD ON TIGHT TO ME, OKAY?

177
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,291
- YES MA'AM!

178
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,375
- SIR, MA'AM, PLEASE DO NOT
BEHAVE RECKLESSLY ON THE RIDE!

179
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,125
- THESE COFFEE CUPS SURE ARE
SOMETHING ELSE, DON'T YOU THINK?

180
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,208
YOU KNOW, THE WAY THEY
SPIN AROUND REAL GENTLY

181
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,500
AND ARE NICE AND
RELAXING AND STUFF.

182
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,750
( laughs nervously )

183
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,750
- Nerine: WHY ARE THEY
SITTING SO FAR APART?

184
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,833
- OH, RIN.
YOU'VE LEFT US NO CHOICE.

185
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,333
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS,
BUT I GUESS IT'S UP TO US NOW!

186
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,958
- YOU'RE RIGHT. LET'S DO IT!

187
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,708
- ( both scream )

188
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,333
- YOU DID IT, NERINE!

189
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,583
- I'LL BET YOU THAT RIN IS
HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE NOW!

190
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,041
- SIR, MA'AM, PLEASE DO NOT
BEHAVE RECKLESSLY ON THE RIDE!

191
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,666
- Asa: HERE!

192
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,333
SO, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, RIN?

193
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,833
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT
YOU, YOU FEELING OKAY?

194
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,625
- RIDING ROLLER COASTERS DOESN'T
BOTHER ME, SO I'LL BE FINE.

195
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,375
- I CAN'T EVEN HANDLE THAT
COFFEE CUP RIDE. IT'S TOUGH.

196
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,083
- DO YOU WANNA TAKE A
BREAK FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

197
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,291
- I THINK I'D BETTER.

198
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,583
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'LL BE OKAY!

199
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,666
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK WE'RE READY TO GO.

200
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,000
- SO, LET'S SEE.
- LET'S GO ON THAT ONE NEXT!

201
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,000
THIS IS A LITTLE MORE
RELAXING, DON'T YOU THINK?

202
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,500
- YOU KNOW, IT'S GETTING PRETTY
LATE, WE'D BETTER HURRY UP.

203
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,541
WE STILL NEED TO
HIT THE PIRATE SHIP.

204
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,291
AND WE CAN'T MISS
THE HAUNTED VILLAGE.

205
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,916
- YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO NEED TO RUSH,

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,916
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
GOING ANYWHERE.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,458
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

208
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,125
- SINCE YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA THROW UP ANYMORE,

209
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,791
YOU THINK YOU WANNA
GIVE IT ANOTHER GO?

210
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,583
- YOU BET I DO.
I SUPPOSE WE OUGHT TO TRY THE...

211
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,875
- LET'S GET ON THE GO CARTS!

212
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,750
BETTER GET DRIVING RIN
OR I'M GONNA HIT YOU!

213
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,541
- YOU'VE HIT ME ENOUGH ALREADY!

214
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,000
- ( laughs )

215
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,041
- ( both scream )

216
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,666
- RIN. SMILE! NOW, SAY CHEESE!

217
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,458
- ( camera clicks )

218
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,750
- SORRY FOR DRAGGING YOU
AROUND EVERYWHERE.

219
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,125
GUESS OUR LUNCH SORT OF TURNED
INTO A LATE AFTERNOON SNACK.

220
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,000
- OH, DON'T WORRY. IT'S
REALLY NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL.

221
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,625
- Itsuki: HAVE LUNCH
AT PASTA HOUSE!

222
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,750
- THIS IS SO NOT GOOD.

223
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,458
EVERYBODY WORKED SO HARD
TO COME UP WITH THIS PLAN.

224
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,041
AND NOW, EVERYTHING WE'RE
DOING IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,791
- RIN, ARE YOU NOT HAVING
FUN HANGING OUT WITH ME?

226
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,458
- WHAT? NO, REALLY.
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.

227
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,708
- OKAY.

228
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,458
- IS IT JUST ME OR ARE
THEY ACTING STRANGE?

229
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,291
- WHAT DID I SAY, I TOLD
HIM TO TAKE HER

230
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,083
TO THE PASTA
HOUSE, DIDN'T I?

231
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,375
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THAT FOOL DESERVES WHATEVER

232
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,916
HE GETS FOR IGNORING
MY FLAWLESS DATING PLAN!

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,500
- EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING DIDN'T
GO EXACTLY AS WE PLANNED,

234
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,125
IT STILL LOOKED TO ME LIKE ASA
WAS HAVING FUN, DON'T YOU THINK?

235
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,916
- YEAH. I THOUGHT THAT THINGS
WERE LOOKING PRETTY DARN GOOD.

236
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,625
- I AM HAVING FUN. HONESTLY.

237
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,333
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

238
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,083
SEE? DID YOU THINK I WAS
REALLY GONNA HIT YOU?

239
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,416
- NO, I...

240
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,500
- THAT WAS TASTY.
SLIGHTLY RIN-FLAVORED.

241
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,875
- Mayumi: I LIKE
WHAT I'M SEEING!

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,500
- THEY REALLY DO LOOK GOOD.
- YEAH. I'M GLAD FOR THEM.

243
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,875
- SO, TELL ME,
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO NOW?

244
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:16,916
- UH...

245
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,250
- WHAT'S WRONG?

246
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,708
- HOW ABOUT GOING FOR A
RIDE ON THE FERRIS WHEEL?

247
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,166
- THIS IS FINALLY IT, BUDDY!

248
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,333
- I'M LOCKED AND LOADED
AND READY TO GO.

249
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,166
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

250
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,625
- I THINK WE SHOULD
ALL JUST WAIT HERE.

251
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,333
- WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?
WE'VE FINALLY GOTTEN...

252
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,208
- WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN.
- I GUESS YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT.

253
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,500
- I'M VERY SORRY.
BELIEVE ME, I AM.

254
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,666
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

255
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,583
- OH, NO. I'M OKAY. NOTHING'S
WRONG AT ALL, REALLY.

256
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,125
HEY, YOU KNOW.
I WAS KIND OF THINKING,

257
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,750
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

258
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,708
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING
STUPID, FORGET IT.

259
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,916
- Asa: YOU KNOW, I HAD A WHOLE
LOT OF FUN WITH YOU TODAY.

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,083
I CAN'T BELIEVE,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

261
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,458
YOU'VE EVER ASKED ME OUT ON
A REAL DATE. IT MADE ME HAPPY.

262
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,916
IT MADE ME REALLY HAPPY.

263
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,833
OH, AND I HAVE SOMETHING HERE
THAT I WANNA GIVE YOU,

264
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,125
IF IT'S OKAY.

265
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,416
THESE AREN'T THE TRI-COLOR
COOKIES I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

266
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,541
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T
MIND REGULAR COOKIES.

267
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,541
- THEY LOOK JUST
ABOUT PERFECT TO ME!

268
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,083
- I BAKED THEM FOR YOU
TO SAY "THANKS" FOR TODAY.

269
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,958
- HUH? YOU REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT!

270
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,750
- NOW OPEN UP AND SAY "AH"!

271
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,916
- Asa: HOW ABOUT WE
TRY IT LIKE THIS?

272
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,916
- ( gasps )

273
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,000
- WAIT, ASA, I...

274
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,041
- ( creaking )

275
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,000
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR RIDING WITH US TODAY!

276
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,416
- YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE!

277
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,333
DID YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING?

278
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,500
THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU WANTED
TO SAY TO ME WHILE WE'RE HERE,

279
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,708
WASN'T THERE RIN?

280
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,500
- WELL, IT'S JUST THAT I...

281
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,875
- BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW,

282
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,333
IT'S KINDA WEIRD WITH
EVERYONE WATCHING.

283
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,083
I'M SO ON TO YOU PEOPLE.

284
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,833
YOU CAN ALL COME ON
OUT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

285
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,041
YEP, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

286
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,666
- BUT, HOW DID YOU
KNOW THEY WERE HERE?

287
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,125
- I NOTICED WHAT
YOU WERE DOING.

288
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,500
YOU WERE TRYING TO
PLAN OUR DATE

289
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,708
ACCORDING TO WHAT THIS
THING SAYS, RIGHT?

290
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,958
- NO. IT'S NOTHING
BAD, IT'S JUST...

291
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,000
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CLUE
WHAT TO DO ON A DATE,

292
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,583
SO I WAS...
WELL, I THOUGHT...

293
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,541
THIS WASN'T MY IDEA.

294
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,791
HONESTLY, I JUST WANTED
TO GO ON A NORMAL DATE,

295
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,958
BUT ITSUKI SAID THAT
WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

296
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,416
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THAT LEAD...

297
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,125
- NO, I THINK I GET IT.

298
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,208
IT MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY
STRESSFUL FOR YOU WITH

299
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,750
ME TRYING TO DO
MY OWN THING, HUH?

300
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,208
- LISTEN, IT'S JUST...

301
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,333
I ONLY FELT BAD BECAUSE SIA
AND NERINE WENT TO A LOT

302
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,083
OF TROUBLE TO MAKE THE
DATE PLANS FOR ME.

303
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,208
I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON
I EVEN WENT ON THE DATE,

304
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,666
WAS BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME TO,
YOU KNOW?

305
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,541
AND I WANTED TO DO WHAT
I COULD FOR BOTH OF THEM!

306
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,958
- ( all gasp )

307
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU, RIN.

308
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,583
YOUR FRIENDS TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
AND YOU JUST DO WHAT THEY SAY?

309
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,833
SO, WHERE WAS YOUR HEART
IN ALL OF THIS, HUH?

310
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,208
WAS THERE EVEN ONE TINY
THING IN THIS ENTIRE DAY

311
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,750
THAT WAS YOUR IDEA?

312
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,833
ONE MOMENT THAT YOU
WANTED TO SHARE WITH ME?

313
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,041
DID YOU EVEN WANT
TO GO OUT WITH ME?

314
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,666
- NO, WAIT. ASA, LISTEN!

315
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,458
- THIS IS OUR FAULT,
ALL THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE

316
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,125
WE FORCED RIN TO DO IT
AND HOPED THAT IT WOULD...

317
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,666
- I'M NOT TALKING
TO THE TWO OF YOU!

318
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,000
EVERYONE HERE HAS THEIR
OWN SELFISH REASONS

319
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,125
TO TRY AND GET YOU
TO DO THINGS, RIN.

320
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,875
BUT, IN THE END,
ALL THAT MATTERS IS

321
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,208
THAT YOU DO WHAT
YOU TRULY WANNA DO.

322
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,041
BE HONEST WITH ME, WERE YOU
FORCED TO GO ON THIS DATE?

323
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,083
- OF COURSE NOT, ASA.
I WANTED TO TAKE YOU OUT!

324
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,541
- NEXT TIME, RIN,

325
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,916
DO IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
AND NOT CAUSE THEY SAID TO.

326
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,333
- HEY, LISTEN.
I REALLY FEEL JUST HORRIBLE.

327
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,666
- I'M SO SORRY, RIN.

328
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,250
- NO, IT'S OKAY. I WAS WRONG.

329
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,166
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

330
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,958
- I'VE GOT TO TAKE MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS

331
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,291
OR NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE.

332
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,500
GUESS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY.

333
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,458
NEXT TIME, I'LL HAVE THE
COURAGE. TO TELL HER HOW I FEEL.

334
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,750
I'M BACK.

335
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,500
- HEY THERE,
WELCOME BACK HOME, RIN!

336
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,291
- OH. WHEN I LEFT,

337
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,708
DIDN'T I TELL YOU I WOULD NOT
BE NEEDING ANY DINNER?

338
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,583
- OH MY GOSH,
I COMPLETELY FORGOT,

339
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,916
I'M SORRY.
I'LL CLEAN IT UP RIGHT AWAY!

340
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,583
- ( theme song playing )

341
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

342
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:03,708
- Kaede: RIN. RIN. RIN...

343
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,458
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
I CALL YOUR NAME,

344
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,083
I CAN'T PUT MY FEARS TO REST.

345
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,625
WHAT'S COME OVER ME?

346
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,958
- Primula: NEXT
TIME ON SHUFFLE,

347
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,875
EPISODE 19,
"UNFORGETTABLE SENTIMENTS."

348
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,333
- Rin: KAEDE, I...
