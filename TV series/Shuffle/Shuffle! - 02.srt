1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,916
- WELL, WE ENJOYED SOME VERY
NICE WEATHER YESTERDAY,

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,291
BUT BE PREPARED,

5
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,041
AS THE FORECAST SHOWS
A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN TODAY.

6
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,791
- I NEVER RELAX IN THE MORNING.
I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT.

7
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,208
- I'M REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE

8
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,166
THAT YOU ACTUALLY
GOT UP THIS EARLY.

9
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,666
- I KINDA LIKED IT.
I THINK I MIGHT EVEN TRY

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,291
AND WAKE UP EARLY
AGAIN TOMORROW.

11
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,875
- THEN I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SET MY ALARM

12
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,375
EVEN EARLIER SO I CAN
STILL MAKE BREAKFAST.

13
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,250
- GIVE ME A BREAK, YOU WAKE
UP EARLY ENOUGH ALREADY.

14
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,708
- SO, ARE YOU THIRSTY?
SHOULD I MAKE YOU SOME MORE TEA?

15
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,958
- SURE, I'D LOVE SOME MORE.

16
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,083
IT'S BEEN A FEW DAYS
SINCE THEY GOT HERE

17
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,291
AND IT FEELS LIKE THINGS ARE

18
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,458
FINALLY BEGINNING
TO SETTLE DOWN.

19
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,500
KING OF THE GODS
OR THE DEMONS?

20
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,000
I DON'T FOLLOW YOU,
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

21
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,250
- IT'S EASY. JUST CHOOSE
ONE OF THE TWO GIRLS TO MARRY.

22
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,833
- NOW CHOOSE. DO IT.

23
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,958
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

24
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,041
- COULD IT BE THAT YOU DON'T
LIKE EITHER OF THE GIRLS?

25
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,208
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW THEM.

26
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,958
- OH MY GOSH, KAEDE. WHAT
KIND OF NERD PASSES OUT

27
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,000
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?
COME ON, WAKE UP.

28
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,333
- WELL, I IMAGINE THINGS
WILL WORK OUT SOMEHOW.

29
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,875
- Eustoma: HOP TO IT, RIN.
LET'S GO TO SCHOOL.

30
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,958
- YOU DO THIS EVERY MORNING.

31
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,375
PLEASE, WOULD YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICES DOWN?

32
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,958
- HAVE YOUR NEIGHBORS
COMPLAINED? I HOPE NOT.

33
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,458
- BECAUSE OF YOU TWO,
I HAVE NO NEIGHBORS ANYMORE.

34
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,916
- SINCE WE ALL LIVE RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER,

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,916
IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT
WE WALK TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,625
THERE'S SAFETY IN NUMBERS,
MY DEAR BOY.

37
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,208
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

38
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,208
DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T WANT
TO WALK TO SCHOOL WITH MY SIA.

39
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,500
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

40
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,958
- WHAT IS IT THEN? PERHAPS,

41
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,000
YOU HAVE ANOTHER GIRLFRIEND
WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT? HMM?

42
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,125
- UH, I'M JUST, WELL,
YOU SEE, SIR...

43
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,500
- KAEDE AND I HAVE
KNOWN EACH OTHER

44
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,833
SINCE WE WERE LITTLE KIDS.

45
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,166
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,083
- WELL, THANK THE UNDERWORLD.
NERINE WOULD BE SO HEARTBROKEN,

47
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,750
HER FEELINGS FOR YOU HAVE BEEN
BLOSSOMING IN HER LITTLE BOSOM

48
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,208
SINCE THE DAY SHE MET YOU.

49
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,250
- HUH?
- OH, DON'T WORRY, RIN.

50
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,750
I MEANT THAT AS
A FIGURE OF SPEECH, OF COURSE.

51
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,041
NERINE'S BOSOM'S
AREN'T LITTLE AT ALL.

52
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,041
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE
QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

53
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,458
- HUH? NO, I MEAN,
WHEN DID SHE...

54
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,708
- HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

55
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,750
- MY SIA'S BOSOMS
AREN'T LITTLE AT ALL,

56
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,291
AND SHE'S A GROWING GIRL.

57
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,791
WHY BY NEXT YEAR,
SHE'LL BE A DOUBLE D.

58
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,958
- SHIN!
- DAD, BE QUIET.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,458
- THAT WAS A BIT HARSH.

60
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,833
- ( laughs )

61
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,500
- I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THAT, YOU GUYS.

62
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,166
- OH, THEY'RE SO ANNOYING.

63
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,625
I REALLY WISH OUR DADS WOULD
STOP EMBARRASSING US LIKE THAT.

64
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,625
- OH, IT'S OKAY,
DON'T WORRY SO MUCH.

65
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,458
- COME ON, DON'T LET THEM
GET TO YOU.

66
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,916
SO, ARE YOU TWO GETTING
MORE COMFORTABLE

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,833
IN THE HUMAN WORLD?

68
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,750
- YES, DEFINITELY.

69
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,416
- IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED HELP WITH,

70
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,208
DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK US, OKAY?

71
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,833
- THANKS, BUT YOU KNOW,

72
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,000
THIS ISN'T OUR FIRST
TIME IN THIS WORLD.

73
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,250
- HEY, KAEDE.

74
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:51,375
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M FROM THE KKK.

75
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,958
- NOT AGAIN.

76
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,791
- OKAY, WHO'S THAT GUY, RIN?

77
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,375
- HE'S FROM KAEDE'S
FAN CLUB, THE KKK,

78
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,083
THE KNIGHTS OF KISSY KAEDE,

79
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,791
NOT THE GUYS WITH THE SHEETS.

80
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,416
- HOW NEAT. I REALLY WISH I
COULD HAVE A FAN CLUB LIKE THAT.

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,458
- UM, TRUST ME, YOU DON'T.

82
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,541
- WAIT. I HAVEN'T FINISHED
INTRODUCING MYSELF.

83
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,375
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

84
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,833
- I, TOO - WHEELER YAMAGUCHI,

85
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,416
WILL BE THE FIRST TO
CONFESS MY LOVE TO SIA.

86
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,708
- WAIT, I SOLDIER
OSHITA HAVE TO CONFESS

87
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,958
MY DEEP, UNDYING
FEELINGS FOR NERINE FIRST.

88
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,791
- ( screams )

89
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,958
- RIN, WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THESE PEOPLE?

90
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,291
- THEY'RE COMPLETELY INSANE.

91
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,958
- MY, UH, NAME IS, UH...

92
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,250
- I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD IF YOU TRY
TO GET IN MY WAY, RIN TSUCHIMI.

93
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,333
- MY NAME IS, UH...

94
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,125
- YOU'D BETTER STEP ASIDE
RIGHT NOW, TSUCHIMI.

95
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,000
- WHAT THE HECK
IS GOING ON HERE.

96
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,666
- KAEDE!
- SIA!

97
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,791
- NERINE!

98
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,833
- LEAVE US ALONE.

99
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,583
- HUH, AND YOU CALL ME HARSH.

100
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,500
- I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DO THAT, SORRY.

101
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,625
- YOU DID GO A LITTLE TOO FAR.

102
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,875
- ( sobs ) YOU,
YOU USELESS SCUMBAGS.

103
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,333
- MORNING, TSUCHIMI.

104
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:18,041
- TSUCHIMI, GREAT DAY, ISN'T IT?
- TSUCHIMI, WHAT'S UP?

105
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,750
- HOW YOU DOING, TSUCHIMI?
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

106
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,958
- WOW, YOU HAD A BAD MORNING,
DIDN'T YOU?

107
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,291
- YEAH, THANKS FOR NOTICING,
YOU JERK.

108
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,791
- DAMN, YOU HAVE SO GOT IT
MADE. I ENVY YOU, MAN.

109
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,250
- RIN, HERE YOU GO.
I HOPE THIS HELPS SOME.

110
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,083
- AH, THAT FEELS SO AMAZING.

111
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,791
- HUH?
- OH, RIN, ARE OKAY?

112
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,583
- ARE YOU HURTING A LOT, RIN?

113
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,291
- GO AWAY, I WANT TO
DO THIS BY MYSELF.

114
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,625
- NO, MOVE.

115
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,041
- OW, OW, OW. DON'T RUB IT.

116
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,750
- All: UH, OH, I'M SORRY.

117
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,166
- UH, IT'S OKAY, I'M FINE NOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

118
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,666
- HEY, RIN, BIG TROUBLE.

119
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,458
- WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN
THAT WOULD MEAN MORE TROUBLE.

120
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,416
- OH, SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT THEN?

121
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,291
- FINE THEN, TELL ME.

122
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,541
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR RIN TSUCHIMI.

123
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,083
- UH, YES?

124
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,041
- WE, MEN, ARE FROM THE SSS.

125
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,500
THE SIAIMPERIAL GUARD COMMANDO
UNIT, THE "SEXY SIA SOLDIERS".

126
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,833
- AND WE ARE FROM THE RRR.

127
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:29,500
THE NERINE SECURITY SHOCK
TROOP OR "RINA'S RANDY RAIDERS".

128
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,666
- UH, WE ARE FROM THE...
- TSUCHIMI, PREPARE.

129
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,583
- UH, YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME,
MORE GROUPIES?

130
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,541
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS RUSHING
IN HERE FOR.

131
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,916
I WAS TRYING TO WARN YOU ABOUT
ALL THE PISSED OFF GROUPIES

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,833
COMING TO GET YOU, BUT YOU WERE
TOO STUBBORN TO LISTEN TO ME.

133
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,791
- TOO LATE.
- ( grunts )

134
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,583
- DON'T WORRY, RIN. I'LL BE
BACK WITH A BODY BAG LATER.

135
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,791
- OH, CRAP.

136
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,291
- ( screams ) AFTER HIM, MEN!
GO, GO, GO.

137
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,083
- OH, NO.

138
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,166
- WELL, THEY MIGHT HURT HIM,

139
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,875
BUT I DON'T THINK
THEY'LL KILL HIM.

140
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,958
OH, COME ON.
HE CAN HANDLE HIMSELF.

141
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,416
YOU GUYS WORRY TOO MUCH.

142
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,041
- ANYWAY, RIN'S A LUCKY GUY

143
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,166
TO HAVE SO MANY MEN
JEALOUS OF HIM.

144
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,750
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOU TRANSFERRED
ALL THE WAY TO THE HUMAN WORLD

145
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,875
JUST TO BE WITH HIM.

146
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,083
- WHEN YOU GUYS GOT HERE,

147
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,583
YOU SHOULD HAVE HUGGED
HIM TIGHT AND SAID,

148
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,750
OH, RIN. WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I WOULD HAVE DONE.

149
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:25,000
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,
I WANTED TO DO THAT, BUT I , UH,

150
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,625
- WE WERE WORRIED THAT IT WOULD
CAUSE A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR RIN,

151
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,250
IF WE DID THAT IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE,

152
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,500
SO, WE THOUGHT WE'D BETTER NOT.

153
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,208
- YEAH, GOOD CALL THERE.

154
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,208
IF YOU TWO HAD BEEN ALL
OVER HIM LIKE THAT,

155
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,125
WE PROBABLY WOULD BEEN
AT HIS FUNERAL BY NOW.

156
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,000
- HOW SWEET.

157
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,166
SUPPRESSING YOUR OWN DESIRES

158
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,916
AFTER YOU'VE HELD ON
TO THEM FOR SO LONG,

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,291
OUT OF CONCERN FOR
HIS VERY WELL BEING.

160
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,375
- KAEDE, YOU'VE GOT SOME
TOUGH COMPETITION.

161
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,375
- HUH, MAYUMI.

162
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:53,916
- MM. RIN, YOU ARE SUCH
A LUCKY BASTARD.

163
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,208
- ( angry muttering )

164
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,125
- MY LUCK SUCKS.

165
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,875
- THAT'S SO STRANGE.
I'M SURE I SAW HIM.

166
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,125
- DID YOU FIND HIM?

167
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,791
- NO, I DIDN'T.

168
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:18,916
- UH, EXCUSE ME, MISS,
HAVE YOU SEEN RIN TSUCHIMI?

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,375
- UH, HUH. NO ONE HERE BUT ME.

170
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,875
- ( grunts )

171
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,000
- DAMN IT. I GUESS, I'LL HAVE
TO KEEP LOOKING THEN.

172
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,791
- HEY, YOU CAN COME OUT NOW.

173
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,666
- THANKS. YOU REALLY
SAVED ME THERE.

174
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,875
- POOR THING.
YOU REALLY HAVE IT ROUGH.

175
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,958
- JUST A LITTLE, SINCE
SIA AND NERINE GOT HERE.

176
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,166
- SUCKS, HUH?

177
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,666
- OH, I'M SURE IT'LL
ALL WORK OUT, SOMEHOW.

178
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,875
- OH, DON'T ACT LIKE
IT'S SUCH A BAD THING.

179
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,416
THEY CAME ALL THE WAY TO
THIS WORLD JUST TO SEE YOU,

180
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,000
YOU'RE A LUCKY GUY.

181
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:57,208
HEY, UH, YOU DIDN'T PEEK
UP MY SKIRT OR DID YOU?

182
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,375
- HUH? NO, NOT EVEN
A LITTLE BIT.

183
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:05,708
- NO? AW, TOO BAD.

184
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,375
- HEY, NOW.
- HI, RIN.

185
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,625
- THERE YOU ARE,

186
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,250
ALL YOUR FRIENDS HAVE
BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

187
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,791
SO, I BROUGHT THEM HERE.

188
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,791
- ( all grunting )

189
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,458
- YOU'VE GOT COMPANY.
BETTER RUN.

190
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,875
- ( screams ) HE WENT THIS WAY.
GO, GO, GO, GO.

191
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,250
- ( sighs )
YOU'RE A LIFE SAVER, ITSUKI.

192
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,875
- YEAH, YOU'D BE IN
A LOT OF TROUBLE WITHOUT ME.

193
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,916
- I WISH THEY'D GIVE ME A BREAK.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,250
IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE DONE ANYTHING
TO DESERVE ALL THIS HARASSMENT.

195
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,250
- IT'S INEVITABLE.
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

196
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,541
- KAEDE IS THE HOTTEST GIRL
IN OUR SCHOOL,

197
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,125
AND IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT
SHE'S COMPLETELY DEVOTED TO YOU,

198
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,000
BUT NOW, ON TOP OF THAT,
YOU'VE GOT NERINE AND SIA.

199
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,458
- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
LIKE I ASKED THEM

200
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,875
TO COME HERE AND SEE ME.

201
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,416
- NOW, IF THAT ISN'T A
SPOILED ATTITUDE FOR YOU,

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,083
THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

203
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,125
YOU HAVE THREE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
WHO ABSOLUTELY ADORE YOU,

204
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,958
AND YOU'RE STILL NOT HAPPY.

205
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:04,708
- WHATEVER. SO, WHICH ONE
DO YOU LIKE THE BEST?

206
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,458
- WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT?

207
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,708
- WELL, IF YOU COULD JUST
PICK ONE OF THE GIRLS,

208
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,708
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO LOVE
ON THE TWO WHO GOT LEFT OUT.

209
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,750
- NO WAY.
- COME ON.

210
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,875
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE?

211
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,875
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LEAD
ALL THREE OF THEM ALONG,

212
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,791
UNTIL YOU BREAK
THEIR POOR LITTLE HEARTS?

213
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,375
YOU OUGHT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT, ROMEO.

214
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,541
- RIN, I'M ALL DONE IN HERE.

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,041
RIN?

216
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,458
- HEY, IS THERE SOMETHING
THE MATTER?

217
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,541
- SORRY, YOU SAY SOMETHING?
- UH, BATHROOM'S FREE.

218
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,583
- OH, OKAY.

219
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,125
- WHAT'S UP?
- OH, NOTHING, REALLY.

220
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,166
- ANYWAY, I'M DONE
WITH THE BATHROOM, OKAY?

221
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,250
- Itsuki: YOU'RE JUST GONNA
LEAD ALL THREE OF THEM ALONG,

222
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,958
UNTIL YOU BREAK
THEIR POOR LITTLE HEARTS?

223
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:18,625
- HEY RIN, I'M SORRY
FOR HOLDING YOU UP. RIN?

224
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,666
- WELL, GOOD MORNING,
KAEDE. WHERE'S RIN?

225
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,375
- NOT HERE.

226
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,541
- HMM?

227
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,500
- SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU THIS MORNING?

228
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,375
- UH, NOTHING.

229
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,583
- I COULDN'T FIND YOU.
SIA AND RINA WERE WORRIED, TOO.

230
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,708
- ( students chattering )

231
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,791
- WHAT'S WRONG, RIN?

232
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,083
- BUTTS IN SEATS,
CLASS IS STARTING.

233
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,958
- ( screams )

234
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,625
- COME ON, JUST GIVE UP ALREADY.

235
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,333
- REALLY? SO, BOTH
OF YOU MET RIN

236
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,833
WHEN YOU WERE JUST LITTLE GIRLS?

237
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,708
- YEAH, I CAME TO THIS
WORLD EIGHT YEARS AGO

238
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,958
WITH MY FATHER ON ONE
OF HIS BUSINESS TRIPS.

239
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,416
- BUT THEN I GOT LOST.
- HOW?

240
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,416
- I GOT SO BORED, I RAN AWAY.

241
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,750
I'D READ ABOUT TRAINS IN BOOKS,

242
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,458
SO, I THOUGHT IT'D BE
FUN TO TAKE A TRAIN RIDE.

243
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,541
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN TO GET OFF.

244
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,958
- ( laughs )

245
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,208
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
QUITE AN ADVENTURE.

246
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,541
- IT WAS, BUT OF COURSE,
I ENDED UP HOPELESSLY LOST,

247
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,250
AND THAT'S WHEN RIN FOUND ME.

248
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,208
HE KEPT ME COMPANY AND PLAYED
WITH ME UNTIL MY DAD CAME.

249
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,875
- ( laughs )

250
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,791
- I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
ANYTHING LIKE THAT

251
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,000
BUT, I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE.

252
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,625
- I ACTUALLY MET RIN
THE SAME WAY SIA DID.

253
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,083
I WAS HERE VISITING WITH
MY FATHER ON A BUSINESS TRIP,

254
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,875
AND I GOT LOST, TOO.

255
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,333
- SO, YOU MET RIN THE SAME WAY?
- I DID.

256
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,208
- I WAS SITTING IN A
PLAYGROUND ALL ALONE

257
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,916
AND SCARED AND HE
HELPED ME FEEL BETTER.

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,416
EVER SINCE THAT DAY,

259
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,166
IT'S BEEN MY DREAM
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

260
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,625
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE ME
FOR EIGHT WHOLE YEARS.

261
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,875
JUST BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED WAY BACK THEN?

262
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,416
- Sia: I HAVEN'T STOPPED
THINKING ABOUT HIM

263
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,958
A SINGLE DAY SINCE THEN,

264
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,291
SO, SEEING HIM AGAIN
MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY.

265
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,208
- I FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME.

266
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,583
IT SEEMS THAT SEEING RIN AGAIN

267
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,625
IS A BIG DREAM COME
TRUE FOR BOTH OF US.

268
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,875
- WHERE DID RIN GO?

269
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,708
- HEY, YOU GUYS
LOOKING FOR RIN?

270
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,291
HE LEFT ALREADY TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL THE GROUPIES.

271
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,875
- OH, THANKS.

272
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,458
- OKAY THEN, IT'S MY TURN.

273
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,916
I'M GONNA TAKE ALL YOU
LUCKY LADIES OUT ON A DATE.

274
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,250
HOW'S ABOUT WE
CUDDLE UP SOMEWHERE...

275
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,625
- I HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.

276
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,916
- GOOD IDEA. WE'LL GO HOME
WITH YOU, KAEDE.

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,666
- LET'S ALL WAIT
FOR RIN TOGETHER.

278
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,916
- OKAY.

279
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,541
- I'M SUCH A LOSER.

280
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,666
- THEY CAME ALL THE WAY TO
THIS WORLD JUST TO SEE YOU,

281
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,250
YOU'RE A LUCKY GUY.

282
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,500
- IT SEEMS THAT SEEING RIN AGAIN

283
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,416
IS A BIG DREAM COME TRUE
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

284
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,791
- I HAVEN'T STOPPED
THINKING ABOUT HIM

285
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,166
A SINGLE DAY SINCE THEN,

286
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,458
SO, SEEING HIM AGAIN
MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY.

287
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,250
- WOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN HERE FOR A WHILE.

288
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,291
- COME WITH US.
YOU KNOW IT'LL BE FUN.

289
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,291
- THAT'S IT.
YOU CAN DO IT.

290
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,250
- ( giggles )
YEAH, WE ALMOST GOT IT.

291
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,375
- ALL RIGHT.

292
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,875
- UH, THIS SUCKS. LET'S
GO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.

293
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:22,916
- YEAH.

294
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,541
- HMM?

295
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,708
THAT MACHINE WON'T WORK
UNLESS YOU PUT MONEY IN IT.

296
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,458
DID YOU WANT THAT LITTLE
STUFFED KITTY CAT?

297
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,750
- OKAY. GIVE ME JUST A SECOND.

298
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,625
- OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW.

299
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,625
I WAS SURE I HAD MORE
MONEY THAN THIS.

300
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,416
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT, SORRY.

301
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,916
I'M REALLY SORRY.
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

302
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,375
- UH, I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

303
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,833
- ( gasps )
- RIN.

304
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:13,416
- UH, YEAH, MY NAME IS RIN.
BUT, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

305
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,125
- LYCO.

306
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,958
- YOU KNOW NERINE?
- ARE YOU A FRIEND OF NERINE'S?

307
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,500
- ARE YOU?
- RIN.

308
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:33,083
- WAIT, JUST A SEC, UH.
- I FINALLY FOUND YOU.

309
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,666
- I FOUND YOU.
- YOU WHAT?

310
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,583
- THIS IS NO GOOD.

311
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,083
I HOPE NOBODY SEES ME LIKE THIS.

312
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,291
- Itsuki: OH, SO THAT'S
YOUR TYPE.

313
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,166
- ( gasps )

314
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,625
- NICE. WHAT A LITTLE
CUTIE SHE IS.

315
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,333
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

316
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:58,250
- UH, ITSUKI, THIS ISN'T
REALLY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

317
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,291
- HEY, HOW ABOUT A DATE
WITH YOURS TRULY

318
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,250
IN ABOUT ANOTHER FIVE YEARS?

319
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,250
- MM.
- WOW, SHE'S REALLY INTO YOU.

320
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,666
- THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK.
- YEAH, IT IS, CRADLE ROBBER.

321
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,458
- YOU HAD BETTER SHUT UP.

322
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,500
YOU'VE GOT ABOUT ONE
MINUTE BEFORE I SOCK YOU.

323
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,583
- ( laughs ) I CAN'T WAIT TO
SEE YOU AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.

324
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,041
BYE, RIN.

325
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:26,083
- NO, DON'T. WAIT A MINUTE.
I , I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

326
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,916
- HI, THERE, RIN. IS THAT YOU?
( laughs )

327
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,708
- MS. AMA...

328
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,208
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE. YOU HAVEN'T
COME TO VISIT US IN A LONG TIME.

329
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,375
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
WE'VE REALLY MISSED YOU.

330
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,666
- ( laughs awkwardly )
WELL, YOU KNOW,

331
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,625
I DO GET TO SEE ASA AT
SCHOOL EVERY DAY NOW.

332
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,375
- SO, WHO IS THIS YOUNG LADY?
IS SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

333
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,791
- NO, SHE'S, UH, WELL, I...

334
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,250
- ( gasps )
IS SHE YOUR SECRET LOVE CHILD?

335
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,041
- NO, NO WAY.
- OF COURSE NOT.

336
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,166
- I WONDER...

337
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,708
- UM, DOES SHE LOOK
LIKE SOMEONE YOU KNOW?

338
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,750
- HUH?

339
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,708
- I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT HOW CUTE SHE IS.

340
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,208
YOU'RE A PRETTY SMOOTH OPERATOR,
AREN'T YOU, RIN?

341
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,916
- I'M NOT, REALLY.

342
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,875
- OH, NO. I BETTER HURRY
OR I'LL MISS THE SALE.

343
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,000
SEE YOU LATER, RIN.

344
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,250
- OH, BYE.

345
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,500
- HOPE SHE DOESN'T TALK
TOO MUCH. THIS COULD BE BAD.

346
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,375
EVERYONE OUT THERE WILL BELIEVE
I AM A CRADLE ROBBER.

347
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,125
I'M HOME.

348
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,416
- All: WELCOME BACK, RIN.

349
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,833
- THANKS. WHAT ARE YOU ALL
DOING HERE?

350
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,875
I MEAN, WHY ARE YOU ALL
AT OUR HOUSE?

351
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,041
- WE ALL DECIDED
TO HAVE A BIG TEA PARTY.

352
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,291
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN

353
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,000
AND WOULD HELP US GET TO
KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

354
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,541
- WE'VE REALLY BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

355
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,916
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

356
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,666
- AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE TEA,
I'VE GOT BOOZE. HERE.

357
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,833
I'LL OPEN A BOTTLE RIGHT NOW.

358
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,291
- ( yells ) DAD, STOP TRYING
TO CORRUPT RIN.

359
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,500
- AW, WHO IS THAT CUTE LITTLE
THING HIDING BEHIND YOU?

360
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,833
DON'T BE SHY.

361
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,916
- ( gasps ) PRIMULA?

362
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,291
- ( gasps )

363
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,708
- ( grunts )

364
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,791
- Rin: PRIMULA?

365
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,791
- Forbeshii: HOW
DID SHE GET HERE?

366
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,291
- UM. SHE ASKED ME
IF I KNEW NERINE,

367
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,333
SO, I THOUGHT
I SHOULD BRING HER HOME.

368
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,791
- RIMU, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

369
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,833
- I WANTED TO MEET HIM.

370
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,791
I WANTED TO MEET RIN.

371
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,500
- BUT, WHY?

372
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,166
- I'VE HEARD ABOUT
HIM FOR A LONG TIME,

373
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,125
SO, I WANTED TO MEET HIM.

374
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,416
- OH, UH, PRIMULA IS FROM
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

375
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
YOU SEE, SHE WAS EXTREMELY SHY,

376
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,125
BUT FOR SOME REASON SHE BECAME
QUITE ATTACHED TO NERINE.

377
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,041
- SHE'S FROM YOUR WORLD?

378
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,791
- SHE MUST HAVE COME HERE
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

379
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,000
- IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE FOR HER
TO DO THAT?

380
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,916
- WELL, SHE'S SPECIAL.

381
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,541
ANYWAY, WE NEED TO MAKE
ARRANGEMENTS TO SEND HER HOME.

382
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,333
- I'M NOT GOING HOME.

383
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,000
- RIMU.
- I'M STAYING HERE.

384
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:03,500
- PRIMULA, YOU HAVE TO GO HOME.
- I WANT TO STAY HERE.

385
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,916
- UM, DADDY?

386
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,750
- MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LET HER
STAY, SHE'S PRETTY DETERMINED.

387
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,375
- YOU'RE RIGHT. THEN SO BE IT.

388
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,875
- UM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE'S RIGHT?

389
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,875
- WELL, RIN, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

390
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,958
- UH, LOOK, I'M A GUEST HERE,
TOO. THIS IS KAEDE'S HOUSE.

391
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,375
IT'S UP TO HER WHETHER OR NOT
SHE CAN STAY, WELL?

392
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,958
- I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

393
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,708
I'D LOVE TO HAVE HER STAY HERE
IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU, RIN.

394
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,000
- UH, IF IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

395
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,583
I'M SURE THAT WE COULD
TAKE CARE OF RIMU.

396
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,250
- SHE'S JUST LIKE THEM.

397
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,125
SHE CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
JUST TO SEE ME.

398
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,250
OKAY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO LIVE WITH US?

399
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:03,166
- ( laughs ) OH, YAY.
- YES, I LIKE IT HERE, WITH YOU.

400
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,208
- WELL, WELCOME HOME THEN,
PRIMULA.

401
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,833
- ALL RIGHT, THAT A BOY.
NOW WE CAN PARTY. ( laughs )

402
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,166
- NOW, IT'S A WELCOME
PARTY FOR PRIMULA.

403
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,291
- WAIT A MINUTE, YOU GUYS.

404
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,125
- ( laughs )

405
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,458
- COME ON NOW, SHIN,
DON'T HOLD BACK.

406
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,291
- ( laughs )

407
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:28,416
- EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT. HERE'S
TO YOU, SHIN, A TOAST TO YOU.

408
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,916
- HEY, GIRLS, LET'S WALK TO
SCHOOL TOGETHER TOMORROW, OKAY?

409
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,041
- All: YEAH.

410
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,833
- ( theme song playing )

411
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

412
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,666
- Kaede: WE HAVE
A NEW FAMILY MEMBER.

413
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,208
- Rin: YEAH, HAVING
PRIMULA HERE

414
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,708
SORT OF BRIGHTENS THE PLACE UP.

415
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

416
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,541
- UH, PRIMULA, HAVE
YOU LEARNED ANYTHING

417
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,833
ABOUT THE HUMAN WORLD, YET?

418
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,166
- I DID.
- WHAT?

419
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,833
- CRADLE ROBBER.
- WHAT?

420
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,833
- NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE,
EPISODE 3: "DO YOU REMEMBER?"

421
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,166
- RIN IS A CRADLE ROBBER.
- NO!
