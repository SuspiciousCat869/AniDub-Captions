1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,833
- HELLO THERE, RIN!
- ( groaning )

4
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,958
- HEY! NOTHING LIKE A GOOD
PAT ON THE BACK!

5
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,500
- NOW THAT WE'RE DATING,

6
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,708
ARE YOU STILL GONNA GREET ME
LIKE THAT EVERY TIME YOU SEE ME?

7
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,750
- OH! SORRY. OLD HABIT.

8
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,416
- YEAH, I'LL SAY.

9
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,208
- OKAY, THEN. DOES THIS
FEEL BETTER FOR YOU?

10
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,333
( chuckling )

11
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,375
- LET'S GET TO SCHOOL.

12
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,083
- Girl: HEY, WAIT UP!

13
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,000
- MORNIN', TSUCHIMI!

14
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,375
- YO, YOU LUCKY BASTARD!

15
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,458
- YOU TWO LOOK CUTE
WALKING TOGETHER.

16
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,458
- GUYS, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GREET HIM

17
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,083
WITH A HARD SLAP ON THE BACK!

18
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,250
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

19
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,458
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO THEY
GOT THE IDEA FROM.

20
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,208
- MM. YOU'VE GOT A POINT THERE.

21
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,458
- Sia: GOOD MORNING, RIN.

22
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,791
- WELL, GOOD MORNING, RIN.
GOOD MORNING, ASA.

23
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,916
- AND A GOOD MORNING
TO YOU, TOO, LADIES.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,750
- ( laughs )

25
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,791
- DURING THE MIDDLE AGES,

26
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,708
SCIENCE HADN'T BEEN
ESTABLISHED YET.

27
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,083
THE CLOSEST THING TO IT
WAS SOMETHING CALLED ALCHEMY.

28
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,750
ETERNAL YOUTH AND CREATING GOLD
FROM LESSER METALS

29
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,541
WERE TWO OF ALCHEMY'S PURSUITS.

30
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,833
- TSUCCHIMI.
- UH...

31
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,791
- YOU OWE ME A TWENTY-PAGE
PAPER ON ALCHEMY TOMORROW!

32
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,416
- YES, MA'AM!

33
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,666
- ( students laughing )

34
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,833
- ( sighs )

35
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,208
MAN, OH, MAN.
THANKS TO MISS NA'S LECTURE,

36
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,875
I MISSED MORE THAN HALF OF
THE LUNCH PERIOD.

37
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,375
- LOVE MAKES YOU DO
DUMB THINGS.

38
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,458
STILL, I'D BE ACTING LIKE
A DOOFUS, TOO,

39
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,541
IF I JUST GOT A GIRLFRIEND.

40
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,666
- THANKS, ITSUKI.

41
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:38,125
- IT'S BEEN A WEEK SINCE YOUR
"BIG, DRAMATIC CONFESSION," HUH?

42
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,916
- HEY, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT WAS SO BIG AND DRAMATIC?

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,291
YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE!

44
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,791
- I KNOW! THAT'S
WHAT'S SO FRUSTRATING!

45
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,333
OH, MAN!

46
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,500
HOW COULD YOU LET A FABULOUS
PHOTOGRAPHER SUCH AS MYSELF

47
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,166
MISS AN IMPORTANT
MOMENT LIKE THIS?

48
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,625
- ( exclaims in discontent )

49
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,583
- HEY, RIN, SINCE I MISSED IT,

50
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,125
HOW 'BOUT YOU CONFESS YOUR
LOVE TO ASA AGAIN,

51
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,291
THIS TIME ON CAMERA?

52
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,833
- I DON'T THINK SO!

53
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,708
- I WAS SHOCKED.

54
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,791
AND OUT OF A BEVY OF BABES,

55
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,541
YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE KAEDE,
SIA, OR NERINE.

56
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,083
BUT INSTEAD, YOU CHOSE ASA!

57
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,875
- NO WAY!

58
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,541
- MY DAD TOTALLY DID THAT!

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,083
- Rin: I CONSIDERED ALL OF THEM.

60
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,333
KAEDE AND THE OTHER GIRLS,
BUT IN THE END...

61
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,208
- I GET IT. DON'T WORRY. YOU
DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

62
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,541
- HUH?

63
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,291
- YOU HAD FOUR GIRLS
VYING FOR YOUR ATTENTION,

64
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,750
BUT YOU COULD ONLY FALL
IN LOVE WITH ONE OF 'EM.

65
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,791
NO ONE CAN FAULT YOU
FOR THAT, MAN.

66
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,916
I THINK YOU MADE A SMART MOVE.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,250
YOUR HEART SPOKE TO YOU
AND YOU LISTENED.

68
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,125
IT SAID, "CHOOSE ASA.
SHE'S YOUR TRUE LOVE."

69
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,208
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, RIN.

70
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,833
- WELL, THANKS, MAN.

71
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,875
- YOU KNOW, ITSUKI, SOMETIMES
YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE A NICE GUY.

72
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,166
- 'COURSE I CAN! HA!

73
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,416
AND THAT'S WHY,
FREE OF CHARGE,

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,416
I'LL CARE FOR THE OTHER GIRLS
FOR YA.

75
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,125
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THEM, RIN.

76
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,083
THEY'LL RECEIVE MY SPECIAL
HANDS-ON TREATMENT,

77
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,541
I CAN PROMISE.

78
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,083
- Rin: HERE WE GO.

79
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,333
- YOU COULDN'T LOVE
ALL OF THOSE GIRLS.

80
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,875
BUT MYSELF ON THE OTHER HAND?

81
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,250
WELL, NO PROBLEM!

82
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,041
THERE'S PLENTY OF ITSUKI
TO GO AROUND, LADIES!

83
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,791
I ALWAYS WANTED A HAREM!

84
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,708
HEY, I THINK I'LL LET
KAREHA JOIN, TOO!

85
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,666
- WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S NOT THERE?

86
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,166
- OH, I'M SORRY.

87
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,625
- WOMEN SMALLER THAN A B-CUP
AREN'T WELCOME IN MY HAREM.

88
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,583
WE CAN'T MAKE
ANY EXCEPTIONS, SO...

89
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,458
( groaning )

90
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,458
- ( chuckles )

91
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,541
- HEY, RIN?

92
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,333
WALK HOME WITH ME?

93
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,333
- SORRY, BUT I'VE GOT
AN APPOINTMENT WITH A REALTOR

94
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,541
ABOUT APARTMENTS
THIS AFTERNOON.

95
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,291
- OH, OKAY.

96
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,041
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE GOING
TO BE DOING THAT AFTER SCHOOL.

97
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,333
WELL, HOW 'BOUT YOU, NERINE,
WANNA JOIN ME?

98
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,208
- I CAN'T, SIA.

99
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,500
I'M SORRY.
I'VE GOT THIS THING.

100
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,625
- YOU'RE BUSY, TOO?

101
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,833
- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
JOINING THE BROADCAST CLUB,

102
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,625
SO I'M GOING TO BE MEETING
WITH THEM IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

103
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,208
- SERIOUSLY?
THAT SOUNDS COOL.

104
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,458
- UH-HUH.

105
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,208
- THAT'S GREAT. WILL YOU
BE ON THE SCHOOL RADIO?

106
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,958
WILL WE GET TO HEAR YOU
DURING THE LUNCHTIME BROADCAST?

107
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,166
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

108
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,375
I'M HOPING THAT THE CLUB
WILL GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY

109
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,583
TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING NEW,
YOU KNOW?

110
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,875
- HOW COOL!
GOOD LUCK, NERINE.

111
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,791
- I APPRECIATE THAT.
THANKS, RIN.

112
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,333
- ( chuckles ) SURE THING.

113
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,125
IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE
IF WE COULD HEAR YOU SING

114
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,041
ON THE RADIO SOMETIME.

115
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,708
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

116
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,458
YEAH. ONE DAY! I PROMISE!

117
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,166
- Girl: WE'RE READY
FOR YOU, NERINE.

118
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,750
- 'KAY. I'M COMING.

119
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,750
THAT'S THEM.
I'VE GOTTA GO.

120
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,208
- SURE. BREAK A LEG.

121
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,625
- I WILL! THANKS, RIN!

122
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,125
- SHE'S REALLY APPLYING HERSELF.

123
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,916
- UH-HUH.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,625
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I'VE GOTTA DO THAT, TOO!

125
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,333
JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE!

126
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,666
I'M GONNA WORK A WHOLE LOT
HARDER, OKAY?

127
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,958
SO I CAN BECOME JUST AS
ATTRACTIVE AS NERINE AND ASA.

128
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,083
- OKAY.

129
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,833
- ( laughs )

130
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,708
SO YOU BETTER GET READY.

131
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,041
I'M GOING TO BECOME
THE MOST FANTASTIC WOMAN

132
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,666
YOU'VE EVER MET
AND STEAL YOUR HEART.

133
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,625
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE NOT SIA. YOU'RE...

134
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,666
- ( chuckles )

135
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,208
- UM...

136
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,666
- ALRIGHT, GUYS.
GOTTA GET HOME.

137
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,375
I'VE GOT LOTS
OF THINGS TO DO.

138
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,916
CATCH YOU LATER, RIN.

139
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,833
- SPEAKING OF THINGS TO DO...

140
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,250
- KAEDE, DOES THIS MISO SOUP
TASTE ALRIGHT?

141
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,666
- YES, I THINK IT'S DELICIOUS.

142
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,583
- REALLY?

143
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,666
- UH-HUH. I THINK ADDING
A LITTLE MORE MISO

144
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,416
MIGHT MAKE IT EVEN BETTER.

145
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,875
- MORE MISO?

146
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,708
- SHOW ME HOW MUCH TO ADD.
- SURE! OF COURSE, I WILL.

147
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,291
THERE. THAT'S BETTER.

148
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,000
NOW FOR THAT SOUP...

149
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,250
- THE RECIPE THAT I FOLLOWED

150
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,166
SAID TO USE ONLY ONE THIRD
OF A CUP OF MISO.

151
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,791
- YES, BUT IT WORKS BETTER IF
YOU ADD MISO GRADUALLY...

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,041
- ( grunts )

153
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,208
AREN'T THEY DONE YET?

154
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,333
- SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

155
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,541
- THEY'RE DONE! AT LAST!

156
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,625
( laughs ) THOSE LOOK GREAT!

157
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,583
OH! I CAN TOTALLY MAKE DINNER!

158
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,166
THAT'S REALLY EASY!

159
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,125
BUT MAKING DESSERT, ON THE
OTHER HAND, IS REALLY HARD!

160
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,625
- SWEETHEART, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

161
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:19,833
THESE THINGS ARE
A LITTLE BITTER,

162
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,291
BUT THEY'RE
NOT THAT BAD.

163
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,833
- NOT BAD?

164
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,250
MY DESSERTS ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO BE PERFECT

165
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,333
IF I'M GOING TO WIN RIN OVER!

166
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,458
- BUT, SWEETIE, DIDN'T RIN HOOK
UP WITH LITTLE MISS SHIGURE?

167
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,916
- MM-HMM. I KNOW HE DID THAT,

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,583
BUT IN THE WORLD OF THE GODS, A
MAN CAN HAVE MANY WIVES.

169
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,666
RIGHT? RIN'S MINE.

170
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,000
- OH, SIA!

171
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,583
MY PRECIOUS LITTLE GIRL
IS ALL GROWN UP!

172
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,958
COME TO DADDY, SWEET...

173
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,041
- CUT IT OUT, DAD!
I'M BUSY!

174
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,291
- ( sobbing )

175
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,625
- Asa: YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT BAD.

176
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,250
- Rin: IT IS PRETTY
SMALL, THOUGH.

177
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,125
- WHAT A GREAT VIEW.

178
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,791
HOW MUCH IS THIS PLACE AGAIN?

179
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,541
- A COOL FIFTEEN THOUSAND YEN
A MONTH.

180
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,041
- THAT'S REALLY CHEAP.

181
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,041
- WELL, IT'S A LITTLE OLD
AND RUN-DOWN, TO BE HONEST.

182
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,875
PLUS, THE BATHROOMS HERE
ARE SHARED.

183
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,041
BUT I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

184
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,041
- WAIT! THEY'RE
SHARED BATHROOMS?

185
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,958
I HAD ENOUGH SAVED
TO PUT DOWN A SECURITY DEPOSIT.

186
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,416
PLUS THE FIRST MONTH'S RENT,
BUT FOR A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

187
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,708
WITH A PART-TIME JOB,

188
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,250
THIS IS REALLY ALL I COULD
AFFORD RIGHT NOW.

189
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,750
- SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT.

190
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,833
- IT'LL BE GOOD FOR ME.

191
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,375
I'VE HAD IT EASY ALL MY LIFE.

192
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,166
AND I NEED TO SUPPORT MYSELF.

193
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,708
- YOU'VE REALLY BECOME
A MATURE PERSON, RIN.

194
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,208
- THAT'S NICE OF YOU TO SAY.

195
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,750
I'M GLAD YOU CAME ALONG.

196
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,875
WELL, SURE. I AM, TOO.

197
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,833
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT ABOUT DOES IT.

198
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,416
- TIME TO SET SAIL.
- Kaede: RIN?

199
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,166
YOUR DISHES ARE ALL
PACKED UP AND READY TO GO.

200
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,583
- OH, THANKS.

201
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,750
- GETTING A FINAL LOOK
AT YOUR ROOM, HUH?

202
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,000
- CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S MY LAST NIGHT HERE.

203
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,833
- I'M THINKING ABOUT
ASKING MY FATHER

204
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,958
IF WE CAN JUST LEAVE THIS ROOM
THE WAY IT IS NOW SO YOU...

205
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,083
SO YOU CAN...

206
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,541
SO YOU CAN COME BACK HERE
WHENEVER YOU WANT, 'KAY?

207
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,125
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME.

208
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,250
- THANK YOU.

209
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,000
- THERE ARE SO MANY
MEMORIES HERE.

210
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,125
- BOY, I'LL SAY.

211
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,208
- JUST ABOUT EIGHT YEARS WORTH.

212
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,291
- YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE IT'S BEEN THAT LONG.

213
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,083
- WELL, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

214
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,750
I STILL HAVE SOME
THINGS TO CLEAN UP.

215
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,875
- KAEDE, WAIT.

216
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,916
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR
ME ALL THESE YEARS

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,458
HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT.

218
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,666
- I...
- IT'S OKAY.

219
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,125
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO THANK ME.

220
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,541
- YOU AND YOUR DAD TOOK ME IN

221
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,958
AND MADE SUCH A HAPPY
HOME FOR ME HERE.

222
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,708
MATTER HOW MANY WORDS
I COULD USE,

223
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,833
I CAN NEVER THANK YOU ENOUGH.

224
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,125
BUT I JUST CAN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING THIS.

225
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,958
KAEDE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

226
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,083
- OH, LISTEN.

227
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,458
THANK YOU. IT WAS GREAT
GROWING UP

228
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,916
AND HAVING YOU AS A ROOMMATE
ALL THESE YEARS.

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,250
ANYWAY, PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO SAY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

230
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,583
- HOW AM I GONNA GET BY
WITHOUT YOUR HELP?

231
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,833
WHO'S GONNA MAKE SURE
I WAKE UP ON TIME EVERY DAY?

232
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,041
- OH, I'M SURE YOU'LL MANAGE.

233
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,166
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE,
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA

234
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,541
TO SET TWO ALARM CLOCKS.

235
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,791
- 'KAY.

236
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,333
- AND WASH YOUR LAUNDRY.
DON'T LET IT PILE UP.

237
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,625
- RIGHT.

238
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,416
- DON'T SKIMP ON
YOUR HOUSECLEANING, EITHER.

239
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,000
OPEN THE WINDOWS
AND LET SOME FRESH AIR IN.

240
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,291
( sobbing ) AND DON'T FORGET
TO EAT YOUR...

241
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,666
( crying )

242
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,625
- KAEDE, THANK YOU.

243
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,000
- Eustoma: RAISE YOUR GLASSES!

244
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,291
WELL, THEN,

245
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,541
SINCE YOU'RE LEAVING US,
WE'D LIKE TO SAY...

246
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,916
- All: GOOD LUCK, RIN!

247
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,916
AH, THAT'S GOOD! I THINK
I'LL HELP MYSELF TO SOME MORE!

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,291
- GO EASY TONIGHT, DAD.

249
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,666
HEY, THAT'S IT! YOU ARE CUT OFF!

250
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,666
- LET GO OF MY SAKE!

251
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,833
- DRINK UP.
YOU'RE THE GUEST OF HONOR.

252
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,958
- THE GUEST OF HONOR, HUH?

253
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,291
- NOW LOOK, RIN,

254
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,333
WE'RE NOT THINKING OF THIS AS
A FAREWELL PARTY.

255
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,833
INSTEAD, IT'S ONE WELCOMING YOU
TO YOUR NEW LIFE LIVING ALONE.

256
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,583
WE STILL WANT TO SEE YOU AROUND.

257
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,708
- I'LL BE HERE.

258
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,708
- GOOD. HOWEVER,
I'VE GOT TO ADMIT,

259
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,666
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
THAT YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE NERINE.

260
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,208
- FATHER! STOP IT!

261
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,250
- NO, NO, I'M NOT GIVING UP
HOPE JUST YET, NERINE.

262
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,708
RIN MAY HAVE PICKED
A GIRLFRIEND,

263
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,666
BUT HE HAS YET TO PICK A BRIDE.

264
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,208
SO THE COMPETITION
ISN'T OVER YET.

265
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,333
- I GUESS...

266
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,458
- I MADE THIS JUST FOR YOU.
IT'S NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT...

267
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,291
- THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

268
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,791
- LOOK, I MADE SOMETHING
FOR YOU, TOO!

269
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,625
TRY IT!

270
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,041
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE TRIED MAKING DESSERT.

271
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,625
SO I'M SORRY IF THEY
DIDN'T TURN OUT SO GREAT.

272
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,416
- OH, NO, I'M SURE THEY'RE FINE.

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,375
HEY! THESE ARE PRETTY TASTY!

274
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,916
- YOU THINK SO? YAY!

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,583
WELL, I'M GOING TO
KEEP PRACTICING IN THE KITCHEN

276
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,791
SO I CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE

277
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,916
BIGGER AND BETTER DESSERTS
FOR YOU, RIN!

278
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
- I'M GOING TO KEEP
PRACTICING,TOO.

279
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,916
THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE
ALL SORTS OF DISHES FOR YOU.

280
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,166
- WELL, GOOD LUCK, THEN.

281
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,833
I CAN'T WAIT TO TASTE IT!

282
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,291
- THIS GUY'S THE BEST!

283
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,458
ALREADY GOT HIS OWN APARTMENT!

284
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,833
AND HE'S MAKING
HIS OWN LIVING, TO BOOT!

285
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,500
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

286
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,083
IF I WORK PART-TIME...

287
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,916
- WOW!

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,416
LIVING ALONE WITHOUT HELP
FROM THE KING OF THE GODS

289
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,875
AND THE KING OF THE DEMONS!

290
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,250
ATTABOY, RIN!

291
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,500
- UH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

292
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,833
- HEY, I LIKE YOU SO MUCH,
YOU CAN HAVE SIA.

293
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,791
NOW LET'S TOAST TO OUR NEW
FAMILY BONDS. DRINK UP!

294
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,916
- DAD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,708
- SIA, WHY'D YOU DO THAT TO HIM?

296
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,291
- WHY NOT?

297
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,333
IS IT BECAUSE YOU WANNA
TOAST OUR NEW FAMILY BONDS?

298
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,125
DO YOU WANNA MARRY ME?

299
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,916
( moans softly )

300
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,250
( screaming )

301
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,500
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

302
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,125
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

303
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,750
- PARTY TIME! LET'S DRINK!

304
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,875
- SHUT UP!

305
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,708
- ENOUGH.

306
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,333
- Forbesii: SHIN. SHIN!
ARE YOU ALRIGHT!

307
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,166
- Rin: KAEDE! HOT WATER! QUICK!

308
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,333
- Kaede: RIGHT AWAY!

309
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,458
- HEY, JUST LEAVE
ALL THE HEAVY STUFF TO ME.

310
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,208
- DON'T WORRY. IT'S OKAY.

311
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,000
I MIGHT NOT LOOK IT, BUT I'M
ACTUALLY IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.

312
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,875
- I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.

313
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,333
- HEY, THAT'S NOT NICE, RIN.

314
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,083
YOU KNOW A CONSIDERATE
BOYFRIEND WOULD HAVE SAID,

315
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,708
"THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU'RE VERY LADYLIKE."

316
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,458
- SORRY. HERE, LET ME GET THAT.

317
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,708
- I'VE GOT IT. I'M ALMOST DONE.

318
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,291
THIS IS EASY.

319
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,916
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

320
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,666
WAIT. LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.

321
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,333
- SEE? TOLD YOU!

322
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,291
I KNEW THOSE TWO WOULD BE
ALL OVER EACH OTHER!

323
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,375
- WE CAME ALL THE WAY OVER HERE
TO HELP YOU MOVE IN,

324
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,125
BUT SHOULD WE JUST
COME BACK LATER?

325
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,875
- MAKING OUT, HUH?

326
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,041
- NO, WE WEREN'T!

327
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,583
I THOUGHT THAT ASA
HURT HER HANDS.

328
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,708
I NEEDED A CLOSER LOOK,
SO THERE.

329
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,500
- THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE ASHAMED.

330
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,791
- NO, I'M TELLING YOU GUYS
THE TRUTH!

331
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,541
HEY, WHERE'S NERINE?

332
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,875
- OH?

333
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,416
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT.

334
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,541
COME ON, NERINE, SHOW RIN.

335
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,333
TA-DA!

336
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,500
- ( stutters ) NERINE!

337
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,208
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE THAT?

338
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,708
- WELL, BECAUSE MY FATHER
TOLD ME TO.

339
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,500
- WHO BETTER TO HELP YOU
CLEAN AN APARTMENT THAN A MAID?

340
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,625
REALLY NICE THINKING
THERE, MABOU.

341
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,875
- LOOK, I REALLY DON'T...

342
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,041
- WAIT, RIN.

343
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,041
THERE'S ONE MORE
SURPRISE FOR YA.

344
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,083
PRIMULA, YOU CAN COME ON IN.

345
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,958
- UH, PRIMULA, WHAT THE...

346
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,833
- RIN, HOW DOES IT LOOK?

347
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,916
- IT LOOKS GOOD.

348
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,875
REALLY, PRIMULA.
YOUR TAIL IS INTERESTING.

349
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,500
- NERINE MADE IT FOR ME.
- BUT, WHY?

350
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,791
- YOU LIKE THAT STUFF.

351
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,041
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
ITSUKI TOLD ME.

352
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,666
- OH, HE LIKES 'EM ALL RIGHT.

353
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,125
RIN'S GOT A THING FOR LITTLE
GIRLS IN COSTUMES.

354
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,333
- ITSUKI, PLEASE SHUT
YOUR MOUTH.

355
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,958
- SO RIN IS TOTALLY UNPACKED
AND ALL MOVED IN NOW, HUH?

356
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,541
- YEP, HE SURE IS.
SINCE EVERYONE PITCHED IN,

357
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,583
WE GOT DONE MUCH FASTER THAN
WE HAD EXPECTED TO.

358
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,416
- I'M SO HAPPY FOR RIN.

359
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,375
HEY, WHERE IS HE, ANYWAY?

360
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,291
I'M SURPRISED HE'S NOT WITH YOU.

361
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,916
- HE'S SIGNING PAPERS
AT THE REALTOR'S OFFICE.

362
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,041
HE'S MEETING ME HERE
WHEN HE'S DONE.

363
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,125
- OH. GOT A BIG DATE
PLANNED FOR THIS EVENING?

364
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,083
- NO, UNLESS YOU CONSIDER
BUYING HOUSEHOLD ITEMS A DATE.

365
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,583
I'VE GOTTA HELP RIN SHOP
FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

366
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,750
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
THAT'S SO CUTE AND CUDDLY.

367
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,541
- IT'S OKAY.

368
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,166
I'LL STILL BE WITH RIN, SO...

369
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,000
( chomps )

370
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,875
- HEY, SIS, I WANT ANOTHER.
- SURE.

371
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,458
- ASA, I JUST WANNA
LET YOU KNOW HOW HAPPY I AM

372
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,750
THAT YOU FOUND SOMEONE.

373
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,791
WELL, THANKS, BUT
ENOUGH ABOUT MY LOVE LIFE.

374
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,166
WHAT ABOUT YOURS?

375
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,666
IS THERE ANY SPECIAL SOMEONE
IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW?

376
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,166
WELL, COME TO THINK OF IT,
THERE IS SOMEONE.

377
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,500
WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
GONE ON A DATE

378
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,333
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW I FEEL.

379
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,333
BUT I DAYDREAM ABOUT HIM
ALL THE TIME.

380
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,708
- WHAT? KAREHA!

381
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,916
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
COME ON AND SPILL IT!

382
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
- ( giggles ) RIN. WHO ELSE?

383
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,250
- WHAT?

384
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,750
- HE'S JUST SO KIND
AND WELL-MANNERED.

385
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,083
HE'S THE KIND OF GUY I'D LOVE TO
SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

386
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,875
- NO, YOU CAN'T, HE'S TAKEN.

387
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,375
HE'S ALL MINE! YOU HEAR?
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF HIM!

388
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,125
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM,
GOT IT?

389
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,916
I WON'T LET ANYONE ELSE
HAVE RIN, NOT EVEN YOU!

390
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,583
- ASA, RELAX.
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD?

391
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,375
THE WORLD OF THE GODS
IS A POLYGAMOUS SOCIETY.

392
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,625
( humming )

393
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,083
- ( Rin laughing )

394
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,958
KAREHA'S GOT A WICKED
SENSE OF HUMOR!

395
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,916
- I FELT LIKE I WAS GONNA PASS
OUT WHEN SHE SAID THAT.

396
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
- WOW. KAREHA MUST HAVE
REALLY FREAKED YOU OUT.

397
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,458
IT'S TOO BAD I WASN'T THERE.

398
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,750
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE!

399
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,666
- HOLD ON! YOU JUST DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU, RIN?

400
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,666
- DON'T... GET WHAT?

401
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,916
- HOW I FEEL WITH ALL THESE
GIRLS AROUND YOU?

402
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,333
- HUH?

403
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,291
- FIRST THERE WAS NERINE
AND PRIUMLA IN THOSE OUTFITS.

404
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,791
THEN THERE WAS KAREHA.

405
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,208
ASA, LOOK.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

406
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,541
I CHOSE YOU AFTER ALL, REMEMBER?

407
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,083
- THERE'S KAEDE AND SIA, TOO!
- ASA!

408
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,000
- THEY ALL WANT YOU
AS THEIR BOYFRIEND, RIN!

409
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,333
- YEAH, BUT, ASA,
I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND, 'KAY?

410
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,083
- YEAH? FOR HOW LONG?

411
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,666
ARE YOU GOING TO BE
COMMITTED TO ONLY ME, RIN?

412
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,458
OR'RE YOU GOING TO HAVE LOTS
OF WIVES, LIKE THE GODS DO?

413
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,458
- LISTEN, FIRST OF ALL...

414
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,416
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL
WITH THAT...

415
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,125
- WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT, RIN?

416
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,375
I... UM... UH...

417
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,083
YOU, ASA. JUST YOU.

418
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,625
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT!

419
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,958
( giggles ) GOOD CHOICE!

420
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,708
SO I GUESS THIS IS WHERE YOUR
NEW LIFE BEGINS, ISN'T IT, RIN?

421
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

422
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,750
I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT WHAT LIES AHEAD,

423
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,000
BUT I'M ALSO
A LITTLE SCARED, TOO.

424
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,500
- WELL, KNOWING YOU,
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE FINE.

425
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,708
- I HOPE SO.

426
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,208
THERE IS ONE GOOD THING, THOUGH.

427
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,291
I KNOW I'VE GOT YOU
IN MY LIFE AT LEAST.

428
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,375
ASA, WHAT THE...

429
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,041
ARE YOU OKAY?

430
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,833
ASA, OPEN YOUR EYES!

431
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,791
HEY, SAY SOMETHING!

432
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:25,166
ASA! ASA! ASA!

433
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,250
- ( theme song playing )

434
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

435
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,500
- I NEVER KNEW IT.

436
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,166
I NEVER REALIZED THAT A PATH
COULD END SO ABRUPTLY

437
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,708
BEFORE ALL THE STEPS
HAD BEEN TAKEN.

438
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,833
- I'M SORRY, RIN.

439
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,166
- Kaede: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE!

440
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,291
EPISODE 23,
"THE TRUTH REVEALED."

441
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,708
- Asa: I... I'LL NEVER...
