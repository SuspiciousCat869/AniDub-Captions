00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,875
- ( siren wailing )

4
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,750
- ( door opens )

5
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,583
- THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP.

6
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,375
- HI, AMA.
- HELLO, RIN.

7
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:00,750
- IS SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
- SHE'LL BE FINE.

8
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,708
- SHE JUST NEEDS TO REST FOR A
COUPLE OF DAYS, THAT'S ALL.

9
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,625
- SHE'LL BE AS GOOD AS NEW.
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

10
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,083
- SO. DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT HER.
- OKAY.

11
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,000
- UM, RIN, ARE YOU BUSY
RIGHT NOW?

12
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,958
COME WITH ME, LET'S HAVE A CHAT.

13
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,000
- ( crying )

14
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,166
- YOU OKAY?

15
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:49,125
- I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.
- WHAT IS IT?

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,666
- RIMU, I HURT THEM.

17
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,625
LET GO. JUST DIE.

18
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:02,458
WHY? I DID IT AGAIN.
I HURT THEM.

19
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,833
I PROMISED MYSELF.

20
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:08,791
I PROMISED IT WOULD NEVER
HAPPEN AGAIN, AND IT DID.

21
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,583
I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.

22
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,708
- WHAT DID YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?

23
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,583
- TELL ME, YOUNG MAN,
DO YOU LOVE MY DAUGHTER? WELL?

24
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:26,375
- UH, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

25
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,291
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
AN ANSWER YET.

26
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,708
- COME ON, YOU'RE A BOY, SHE'S
A GIRL. HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

27
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,458
- OW, OW, OW.

28
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:37,333
- SO, GOT AN ANSWER?
- NOT YET.

29
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,333
- ( sighs )

30
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,708
I GUESS IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL
FIGURE IT OUT SOONER OR LATER.

31
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,625
I JUST WANT ASA TO BE HAPPY.

32
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,375
EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES I'M
NOT HER FAVORITE PERSON.

33
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,166
- HUH?
- I LOVE MY DAUGHTER,

34
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,833
AND SHE ALWAYS HAS A SMILE
FOR ME BUT I DO WONDER.

35
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:00,500
IS SHE STILL ANGRY WITH ME
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS? WELL.

36
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,833
- ( crying ) STOP IT. WHY DID
YOU GIVE ME A BODY LIKE THIS?

37
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,791
- ASA.

38
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,291
- WHY DOES IT
ALWAYS HURT SO MUCH?

39
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,791
I JUST WANT TO BE LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE.

40
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,833
- IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT
I'M SUFFERING.

41
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,583
YOU MADE ME THIS WAY.

42
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:17,000
I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN, I WISH
I'D NEVER EVEN BEEN BORN.

43
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,500
- I CAN'T BLAME HER FOR IT.
IT'S REALLY MY FAULT,

44
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,916
IT'S BECAUSE OF ME SHE HAS
TO FIGHT SO HARD RIGHT NOW.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,708
- YOU MUST KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

46
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,041
YOU'RE HER MOTHER
AND SHE WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

47
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,708
- IT'S ALL RIGHT. NO MATTER
WHAT SHE THINKS OF ME,

48
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,791
I'LL NEVER STOP DOING EVERYTHING
I CAN TO KEEP HER HAPPY AND SAFE

49
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,166
AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE.

50
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,291
- IT, IT'S OKAY.

51
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:43,166
- I KNOW AND SHE'LL ALWAYS
HAVE YOU, WON'T SHE, RIN?

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,416
- ( phone ringing )

53
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,833
- Kaede: FUYOU RESIDENCE?

54
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,833
- OH, RIN.

55
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,958
- KAEDE?
I'M STILL AT THE HOSPITAL.

56
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,916
I'M GOING TO BE HOME LATE.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
SO, GO AHEAD AND EAT
WITHOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

58
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:04,291
- OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND.
HOW'S ASA DOING?

59
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,750
I SEE. WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

60
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,333
TRY TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
TOO. GOODBYE.

61
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,416
- RIN?

62
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,375
- WELCOME BACK, ASA.
- GOOD MORNING.

63
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,250
- ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

64
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,041
- WELL, MY HAND IS CERTAINLY
FEELING BETTER.

65
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,833
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

66
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,125
- I COULD STAY
LIKE THIS FOREVER.

67
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,125
- YEAH, BUT THEN YOU'D
HAVE TO LIVE IN THE HOSPITAL.

68
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,583
- HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED
THAT SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER

69
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,000
JUST TO SHUT UP AND NOD?

70
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,583
RIN, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT A WOMAN'S FEELINGS?

71
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,000
- FORGIVE ME, I'VE NEVER
BEEN A FAST LEARNER.

72
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,583
BESIDES, YOU'RE NOT
A TYPICAL GIRL.

73
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,625
- OH, HI.
- GO TO BED, KAEDE.

74
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,583
- WHY? I CAN'T SLEEP.

75
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,625
RIN WILL COME HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL SOON.

76
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,833
I'M SURE HE'LL NEED ME.

77
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,291
- ( door opens )

78
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:28,208
- UH. YOU'RE BACK.
WELCOME HOME, RIN.

79
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

80
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,916
- YOU TOO. IS ASA
FEELING BETTER?

81
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,625
- SHE'LL BE FINE.
THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

82
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,708
SHE'S GOTTEN USED TO IT.

83
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,208
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD. UH, RIN.
- HMM?

84
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,000
- I'VE GOT YOUR BACKPACK
AND YOUR LUNCH READY FOR SCHOOL.

85
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,166
- OH, UH, SORRY,
I'M NOT GOING TODAY.

86
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,750
- HUH?

87
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,166
- I WAS UP REALLY LATE. I
THINK I'M JUST GONNA SLEEP.

88
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,083
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO SCHOOL AT ALL?

89
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,750
- YEAH.

90
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,208
JUST GIVE MISS NA A REALLY GOOD
EXCUSE FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

91
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,375
- ALL RIGHT.

92
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,166
- UH, RIN.
- HEY, KAEDE.

93
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,083
- I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE GOING TO SCHOOL.

94
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:30,458
- OH, WELL, I DID GO. BUT, BUT
I FORGOT SOMETHING AT HOME.

95
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,083
- OH, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, SEE YOU LATER.

96
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,458
- ARE YOU GOING TO
THE HOSPITAL AGAIN?

97
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,000
- HUH? YEAH.

98
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,875
- DO YOU HAVE TO?
- HUH?

99
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,375
- I MEAN, IS IT REALLY
NECESSARY FOR YOU

100
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,166
TO BE THERE EVERY SECOND?

101
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,083
- HEY, WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

102
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,416
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO? WHY?
TO TAKE CARE OF HER?

103
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,583
YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR.

104
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,125
I THINK SHE'LL BE
ALL RIGHT WITHOUT YOU.

105
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,166
- WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU, KAEDE?
WHAT IS IT?

106
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,750
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU HAVE TO GO.

107
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,083
- YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
REALLY STRANGE LATELY.

108
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,708
IT'S LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

109
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,166
- ( gasps ) I'M SORRY.

110
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,666
- ( crying )

111
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:28,083
- Ama: LUNCH IS SERVED. I HOPE
YOU BROUGHT YOUR APPETITES.

112
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:32,666
- WOW, AMAZING.
- THANKS A LOT, MOM.

113
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,250
- BUT ARE YOU SURE IT'S OKAY
TO EAT IT?

114
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,000
- HMM? SURE, WHY NOT?

115
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,708
- BECAUSE AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO EAT HOSPITAL FOOD

116
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,958
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL?

117
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,041
- HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO
GET HER STRENGTH BACK

118
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,750
EATING THAT STUFF?

119
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,208
- ( both laugh )

120
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,791
- ( sighs )

121
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,416
- BESIDES, I'M GETTING
OUT OF HERE TOMORROW.

122
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,583
- YOU SURE IT'S OKAY TO LEAVE?

123
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,875
- YEAH, THE DOCTOR SAID SHE
WAS DOING BETTER.

124
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,500
- JUST ONE MORE DAY
OF TAKING IT EASY

125
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,958
AND I'LL BE BACK TO MY OLD SELF.

126
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,333
BESIDES, IF I STAY
IN THE HOSPITAL ANY LONGER,

127
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,333
I HAVE A FEELING
SOMEONE WILL USE IT

128
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,500
AS AN EXCUSE TO SKIP SCHOOL.

129
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,666
YOUR GRADES ARE BAD
ENOUGH WITHOUT MISSING

130
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,541
EVEN MORE CLASSES.
IF YOU GET HELD BACK,

131
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,708
IT'S GOING TO PUT
ANOTHER YEAR BETWEEN US.

132
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,333
- YOU SAY THAT, BUT WHETHER
I PASS OR NOT,

133
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,083
YOU'RE STILL GOING
OFF TO COLLEGE SOON.

134
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:22,041
- ( sighs ) I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW.

135
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,000
- ISN'T THERE A COLLEGE
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?

136
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,875
- OH, THANK YOU.

137
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,791
- I'M REALLY JUST GOING TO GO
ANYWHERE THAT'LL TAKE ME.

138
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,375
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU GO,

139
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,875
THEN WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO GO TO THE SAME SCHOOL AS ME?

140
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,125
- HUH?
- WELL, IT WOULD BE FUN.

141
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,958
- LIKE HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT WITHOUT ALL THE RULES.

142
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,375
- I THINK WE'D HAVE A GREAT TIME
TOGETHER. BUT WITH YOUR GRADES,

143
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,666
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'LL
GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY

144
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,583
THAT I'VE GOT MY EYE ON.

145
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,250
- ( chuckles )

146
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,083
- YEAH, YEAH.
I THINK I CAN TAKE A HINT.

147
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,416
- WELL, I GUESS
I'D BETTER START STUDYING.

148
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,083
- OH, SILLY.

149
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,000
I DON'T THINK SHE MEANT YOU
HAD TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

150
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,416
- I THINK HE CAN STAY FOR A BIT.

151
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,833
ONE DAY IS NOT GONNA MAKE
HIM ANY SMARTER,

152
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,000
AND I'M ENJOYING HIS COMPANY.

153
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,750
TOMORROW THEN.

154
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,083
WE CAN STUDY TOGETHER, AND
I WON'T GO EASY ON YOU.

155
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,083
BUT AS FOR RIGHT NOW,
SAY "AH".

156
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,250
- AH.
- NOW CHEW. THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

157
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:48,125
- IT WAS NICE. BACK WHEN
THERE WAS ONLY RIN AND I.

158
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,958
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS KINDA NICE.
MAYBE I COULD GET USED TO IT.

159
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,208
- WHAT?

160
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,625
- JUST SITTING HERE, DOING
NOTHING, RELAXING.

161
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,458
- IT'S NOT REALLY A BAD WAY
TO PASS THE TIME, IS IT?

162
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,625
- DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'D GET BORED?

163
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,291
- NO, WAY. DON'T GET ME WRONG,

164
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,166
MOST OF THE TIME I LIKE TO KEEP
BUSY, I LIKE BEING ACTIVE.

165
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,083
I LIKE TO HAVE FUN.

166
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,791
BUT SOMETIMES IT FEELS GOOD
TO SLOW DOWN, YOU KNOW?

167
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,666
JUST STAND STILL AND BREATHE
WHILE THE WORLD KEEPS MOVING.

168
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,083
SOMETIMES DOING THAT CAN MAKE
YOU FEEL EVEN MORE ALIVE, RIGHT?

169
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,541
- WELL, YEAH, IT CAN. I GUESS.

170
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,541
- IT'S JUST WHEN I WAS A KID,

171
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,208
I WAS SO SICK THAT I WAS IN THE
HOSPITAL AS OFTEN AS AT HOME.

172
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,125
I GOT USED TO DOING NOTHING.
AND I HATED IT.

173
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,083
IT ALWAYS FELT LIKE I WAS JUST
WASTING AWAY MY LIFE.

174
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,166
- I'M SORRY, ASA.

175
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,833
- SO, WHENEVER I WAS FEELING
WELL, I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING.

176
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,916
- ANYTHING, JUST TO FEEL ALIVE.

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,458
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED LEARNING
HOW TO COOK SO MANY THINGS.

178
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,083
BUT NOW, I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT LIVING FRANTICALLY

179
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,500
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT.

180
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,666
SITTING HERE LIKE THIS AND JUST
TAKING IT EASY WITH YOU

181
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,625
FOR A WHILE, IT'S REALLY
KIND OF NICE.

182
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,250
- YEAH, IT IS.

183
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,375
- I'LL HAVE TO THINK
OF SOME WAY TO THANK YOU.

184
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,958
LET'S SEE.

185
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,125
( chuckles )

186
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,416
- I'LL COME BACK SOON.
- OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD.

187
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,375
- THANKS FOR STOPPING BY, RIN.
- OF COURSE.

188
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,583
- TAKE CARE, RIN.

189
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,291
- ( crying )

190
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,166
- I'M HOME.

191
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,083
- I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE
BACK. COME ON IN.

192
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,541
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
HUNGRY YET,

193
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,041
BUT DINNER'S READY
WHENEVER YOU ARE.

194
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,916
- I'M FINE. I HAD A REALLY
BIG LUNCH,

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,625
BUT PLEASE GO AHEAD AND
EAT WITHOUT ME.

196
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,708
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

197
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,875
THEN I'LL GO AND GET
A NICE BATH READY.

198
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,500
- ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA GO
LAY DOWN.

199
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,791
I REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN MUCH
SLEEP LATELY.

200
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,541
- HEY, SIA AND RINA BOTH
BROUGHT COPIES OF THEIR NOTES

201
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,083
FROM SCHOOL
FOR YOU EARLIER.

202
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,083
THEY'RE ALL ON YOUR DESK IF YOU
WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEM.

203
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,541
- COOL. THANK YOU.

204
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,333
- ( knocks on door )

205
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,083
- YES?

206
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,416
- GOT A SEC?
- WHAT IS IT?

207
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:40,166
- UM, I JUST, I WAS WONDERING.
IS ASA FEELING BETTER NOW?

208
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,541
- YEAH, SHE'S DOING FINE. SHE'LL
BE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL TOMORROW.

209
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:50,125
- GOOD FOR HER.
- YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

210
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,250
ASA SAYS THAT SHE AND HER MOTHER

211
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,708
DIDN'T USED TO GET
ALONG VERY WELL.

212
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,958
BUT NOW THEY SEEM SO HAPPY
AROUND EACH OTHER.

213
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
- ISN'T THAT NICE.

214
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,791
- YEAH, IT IS. BUT I THINK
THEY'RE BOTH STILL HURTING.

215
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,375
ASA FEELS BAD FOR BEING
MEAN TO THE PERSON

216
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,791
SHE LOVES MOST IN THE WORLD,

217
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,125
AND AMA STILL WORRIES
THAT HER DAUGHTER IS ANGRY.

218
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,666
- I'M SURE THEY'RE FINE.

219
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,958
- MAYBE THEY ARE.

220
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,708
I THINK THEY'D BE HAPPIER
IF THEY SAT DOWN, TALKED,

221
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,041
AND JUST CLEARED IT ALL UP.

222
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,208
- SOMETIMES THERE ARE THINGS
YOU JUST CAN'T TALK ABOUT.

223
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,291
SO, YOU KEEP THE PAIN QUIET.

224
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,208
- HMM?
- BUT THEN THERE'S YOU,

225
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,375
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO CONCERNED
FOR EVERYONE ELSE'S SUFFERING.

226
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,375
- WHAT'S WRONG?

227
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,708
- SO, MAYBE IT IS BETTER
TO TALK ABOUT THE PAIN.

228
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,708
MAYBE THEN YOU'D LISTEN.

229
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,500
- KAEDE, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

230
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,250
- NOTHING, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

231
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,041
- ( gasps )

232
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,375
- ( moans )

233
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,500
- ( door opens )

234
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,791
- RIN.
- HEY, KAEDE.

235
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,041
- WHAT THE HECK DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

236
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,708
- PLEASE, RIN.

237
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,916
PLEASE DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.

238
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,791
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

239
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,000
- I JUST WANNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

240
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,416
- PLEASE DON'T LEAVE, RIN.

241
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,791
PLEASE JUST STAY HERE WITH
ME IN THIS HOUSE FOREVER.

242
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,375
- YOU SEE, I WILL
GIVE YOU EVERYTHING.

243
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,500
- JUST STOP IT.

244
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:14,375
- DON'T GO. NO, STAY. I TAKE
IT BACK. I TAKE IT ALL BACK.

245
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,000
- THAT WAS CRAZY. I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.

246
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,666
JUST COME BACK. PLEASE, RIN.

247
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,750
- ( crying ) NO,
WHAT DID I DO? RIN.

248
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,083
- ( panting )

249
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,333
- Kaede: OH, NO. NOT AT ALL.

250
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,125
I REALLY LOVE TAKING
CARE OF YOU, RIN.

251
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,791
IT'S WHAT I ENJOY
DOING THE MOST.

252
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,500
- YOU'RE KIDDING,
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE?

253
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,416
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LEAD ALL
THREE OF THEM ALONG,

254
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,791
UNTIL YOU BREAK THEIR POOR,
LITTLE HEARTS?

255
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:53,125
- BUT, IN THE END, ALL THAT
MATTERS IS WHAT YOU WANNA DO.

256
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,333
BE HONEST WITH ME, RIN. WERE
YOU FORCED TO GO ON THIS DATE?

257
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,125
- ( grunts )

258
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,291
I'M AN IDIOT. WHAT THE HELL
HAVE I BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME?

259
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:16,375
I FAILED THEM. KAEDE?
I WAS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HER.

260
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,625
AND WHAT ABOUT ASA?

261
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,583
I WANTED TO HELP HER, AND
SHE ENDED UP HURT AGAIN.

262
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,375
- ( whimpers )

263
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:32,083
- LIKE SIA AND NERINE
AND PRIMULA.

264
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,666
I THOUGHT THAT SOMEHOW
I COULD MAKE ALL OF THEM HAPPY.

265
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:41,500
OF COURSE I COULDN'T. WHAT
WAS I THINKING? WHAT AN IDIOT.

266
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,416
HOW DID I NOT NOTICE ANY OF IT?

267
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,916
I WAS COMPLETELY BLIND TO
EVERYTHING. DAMMIT, DAMMIT.

268
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,041
DAMN! DAMN, DAMN, DAMN.

269
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,416
- ( crying )

270
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,208
- WHERE DID I MESS UP? WHEN DID
ALL THIS START FALLING APART?

271
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:14,500
WHAT DID I DO?
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

272
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,375
MAYBE RIN NEVER
FORGAVE ME AFTER ALL.

273
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,041
MAYBE HE'S REALLY HATED ME
THIS WHOLE TIME.

274
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,250
BUT AFTER ALL THOSE
HORRIBLE THINGS I SAID,

275
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,416
I REALLY CAN'T BLAME HIM, CAN I?

276
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,125
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
IF HE GOES AWAY?

277
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,500
HOW CAN I KEEP LIVING
IN THIS HOUSE WITHOUT HIM?

278
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,666
I WANTED TO SHOW HIM
HOW SORRY I AM.

279
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,250
THAT'S IT, THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

280
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:42,500
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE CARE
OF HIM TO MAKE UP FOR THE PAST.

281
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:47,458
- ARE YOU SURE? WAS IT
ALL FOR RIN? JUST FOR HIM?

282
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:52,000
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WAS FOR ME.

283
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,791
I JUST WANTED TO BE WITH HIM.
THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANTED.

284
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,958
- TELL HIM, WHY DON'T
YOU TELL RIN THAT?

285
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,083
TELL HIM THAT YOU WANT
TO BE WITH HIM.

286
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,958
- I HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL HIM
THAT. NOT AFTER WHAT I'VE DONE.

287
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,583
- BUT WHY NOT?

288
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,208
- BECAUSE HE WILL
NEVER LOVE ME BACK.

289
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,250
I HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL
RIN HOW I FEEL,

290
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,375
BECAUSE I DON'T DESERVE
TO BE LOVED BY HIM.

291
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,208
- SO, THAT'S IT?
YOU'LL LET HIM GO?

292
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,416
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
I WANT HIM TO STAY, TOO.

293
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:29,916
- HE'LL BE BACK.

294
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,666
- OF COURSE.

295
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,333
COME TO THINK OF IT.
THIS RAIN IS VERY FAMILIAR.

296
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,666
WOW, THAT WAS SO LONG AGO.

297
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,000
- ( breathing heavily )

298
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,708
- THERE.

299
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,375
- ( door opens )

300
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,166
- I'LL JUST DO WHAT I'VE ALWAYS
DONE, LIKE NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

301
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,000
AND I'LL KEEP DOING IT FOREVER.

302
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,541
I'M FINE WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE
NOW. REALLY, I CAN HANDLE IT.

303
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,833
BECAUSE WHAT I WANT
IS FOR RIN TO BE HAPPY.

304
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,958
SO I CAN ACCEPT
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO.

305
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,583
AS LONG AS HE JUST STAYS
HERE WITH RIMU AND ME,

306
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,416
IT WILL BE FINE. I DON'T MIND
IF HE LOVES ASA.

307
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,958
HE CAN DATE WHOEVER
HE WANTS TO. I'LL BE FINE.

308
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,458
IF HE'LL ONLY STAY HERE.

309
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,166
- HI.

310
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,333
- I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK.
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

311
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,625
- YOU'LL CATCH COLD
JUST STANDING THERE.

312
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,583
I'LL START RUNNING YOU
A NICE BATH.

313
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,375
- KAEDE, WAIT.
- OH, YEAH?

314
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:30,458
- I'VE, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

315
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,125
- WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
THINKING ABOUT, RIN?

316
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:37,750
- WELL, I... I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE.

317
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,875
- ( gasps )

318
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,541
- ( theme song playing )

319
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,250
- ( singing in Japanese )
