1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,041
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,916
- Rin: HEY, KAEDE. WE GOTTA GO.

4
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:51,500
- Kaede: JUST A MINUTE.
I'M ALMOST DONE.

5
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,208
- HERE, DON'T FORGET YOUR LUNCH.
- OH, THANK YOU!

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,750
OKAY. WE'D BETTER RUN.

7
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,458
- PRIMULA, CAN YOU PLEASE TAKE
CARE OF THINGS WHILE WE'RE GONE?

8
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,208
- SURE. I'LL BE WAITING
RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

9
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,958
- WELL, GOOD MORNING, YOU TWO.

10
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,916
GLAD I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE BEHIND.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,291
- HI. HOW'S IT GOING
THIS MORNING?

12
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,750
- HEY. WHERE'S SIA?
SHE RUNNING LATE TOO?

13
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,625
- ( yelling ) HOLD UP!

14
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:21,208
HI, EVERYONE! RIN, WAIT
FOR ME! I'M COMING TOO!

15
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,750
- GOOD MORNING, SIA. I...
- ( giggling ) GOTCHA!

16
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,333
- WHA? SIA...

17
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,166
HEY!

18
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,000
- ( both giggle )

19
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,708
- Sia: YEP, THESE DAYS, THERE
ARE TONS OF DIFFERENT

20
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,250
COLORS AND PATTERNS
TO CHOOSE FROM.

21
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,458
MY DAD GOT SO CARRIED AWAY, HE
VOLUNTEERED TO TRY THEM ON.

22
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,208
WE GO THROUGH A DOZEN PAIRS
BEFORE HE BLURTS OUT,

23
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,125
"RED, NOTHING BETTER THAN RED

24
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,208
WHEN IT COMES TO
CLASSIC UNDIES."

25
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,958
HILARIOUS!

26
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,208
- ( laughs )

27
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,583
THAT SOUNDS JUST LIKE
YOUR FATHER, ALL RIGHT.

28
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,375
BUT THE OLD MAN HAS
A GOOD POINT.

29
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,166
RED IS THE MOST SENSIBLE COLOR.

30
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,291
- WELL, UM...

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,541
I'M LOST.

32
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,125
WHAT PRECISELY DID YOUR DAD MEAN
BY THE TERM "CLASSIC" UNDERWEAR?

33
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,958
- YOU SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW?

34
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,833
UH... RIGHT.

35
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,083
HOW DO I PUT THIS DELICATELY,

36
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,916
BUT IN A WAY THAT
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND?

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,125
- WELL, IT'S NO MYSTERY,
ANY GUY WILL TELL YOU

38
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,291
THAT NOTHING LOOKS QUITE AS HOT
ON A GIRL AS RED.

39
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:29,666
ESPECIALLY UNDERGARMENTS. HA!
SILKY, SMOOTH AND SO SEXY.

40
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,083
- ( gasps )

41
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,375
- WHOOPS. GUESS I SAID TOO MUCH.

42
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,208
- ACTUALLY, ITSUKI,
THAT'S AN INTERESTING INSIGHT.

43
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,833
- Mayumi: OH, SHOOT!

44
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,875
I FORGOT I'M SUPPOSED TO GET THE
MATERIALS FOR NEXT PERIOD.

45
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:49,833
- WOW, YOU'RE ON DUTY AGAIN
TODAY? YOU SEEM STRESSED OUT.

46
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,500
- I SURE AM.

47
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,125
BEING AN ASSISTANT TO A PHYSICS
TEACHER IS REALLY HARD WORK.

48
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,333
KANEDA USES MORE
PRINTOUTS THAN ANYONE.

49
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,833
- I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU
IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE.

50
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,166
- YOU WOULD?
- OF COURSE.

51
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,958
- YOU'RE AWESOME!

52
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,291
- GEE, YOU COULD
SHOW SOME ENTHUSIASM.

53
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,791
- COME ON!

54
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,125
YOU MIGHT WANT TO WEAR GLOVES.
THAT INK GETS EVERYWHERE.

55
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,500
- JUST AN OBSERVATION.

56
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,333
AND FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

57
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,125
BUT, IT SEEMS THAT
NERINE'S ATTITUDE

58
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,041
HAS CHANGED EVER SO SLIGHTLY.

59
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,708
- WELL, SURE.
BUT NERINE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE.

60
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,416
AND, LATELY, OUR
PRIMULA HAS BECOME

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,250
QUITE THE
CHATTERBOX, TOO.

62
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,333
A NICE CHANGE.
DON'T YOU THINK, RIN?

63
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,708
- OH, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

64
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,833
- THAT MAY BE TRUE,
BUT ONE FACT IS GLARINGLY CLEAR.

65
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,375
SOMETHING WILDLY LIFE-CHANGING
HAPPENED TO THOSE GIRLS

66
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,833
DURING THEIR TRIP
TO THE DEMON WORLD.

67
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,416
- YEAH, THEY'RE MORE CHIPPER
AND FULL OF LIFE.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,750
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.

69
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,125
WE COULD ALL USE MORE CHEER.

70
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,541
- YOU'RE RIGHT, OF COURSE.

71
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,208
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE
BEST PART THOUGH?

72
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,541
AS A RESULT, THE REST OF US
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETURN

73
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,791
TO OUR NORMAL LIVES.

74
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:57,375
- YUP. MOST DEFINITELY.
- AND, EVERYONE'S HAPPY.

75
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,666
- OH, YEAH. THAT REMINDS ME.

76
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:10,958
KAREHA!

77
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,000
- OH, RIN. HELLO.

78
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,875
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

79
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,166
- NO, UM, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

80
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,250
BUT, IT'S...
IT'S ABOUT ASA THOUGH.

81
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,250
- WHAT'S WRONG? WHY DON'T
YOU TALK TO HER DIRECTLY?

82
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,791
- HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

83
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,541
OH, RIN.

84
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,000
- Itsuki: AND NOW, GIVE A
CHEER IN CELEBRATION

85
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,333
OF ASA SHIGURE'S FULL RECOVERY!

86
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,666
- All: CHEERS!

87
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,000
- I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

88
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,541
THIS EXTERIOR,
IS REALLY JUST A BIG OLD SHAM.

89
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,375
I WAS ACTUALLY GOING CRAZY
WORRYING ABOUT ASA'S HEALTH.

90
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,750
- YOU'RE LYING.
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

91
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,875
- EVERYONE HERE KNOWS
YOU'RE AN OPPORTUNIST.

92
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,666
- THE GOOD THING IS
WE'RE TOGETHER.

93
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,375
KAEDE, SIA, NERINE, PRIMULA
AND EVEN ASA, ARE ALL BACK NOW.

94
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,541
IT FINALLY FEELS LIKE THINGS
HAVE RETURNED TO NORMAL

95
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,666
AROUND HERE.

96
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,333
- I COULDN'T HAVE
SAID IT BETTER!

97
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,500
- ( groans )

98
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,208
- THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A MARK.
BUT, THANK YOU, THOUGH.

99
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,875
- NOW THINGS HAVE REALLY
GONE BACK TO NORMAL.

100
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,375
I MEAN, WHAT'S A DAY WITHOUT A
GOOD SLAP ON THE BACK FROM ASA?

101
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,125
- AM I RIGHT?
- ABSOLUTELY!

102
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,041
AND I COULD NEVER
IMAGINE ABANDONING

103
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,541
ONE OF OUR MOST
BELOVED TRADITIONS.

104
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,666
- THANKS, ASA.

105
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,666
- SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

106
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,250
THAT YOUR VISIT WAS AN
AWESOME SURPRISE

107
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,750
AND IT MEANT A LOT.

108
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,583
I NEVER IMAGINED YOU'D BE
THE ONE TO COME SEE ME.

109
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,416
- I'M GLAD THAT
YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

110
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,833
ORIGINALLY, YOU TOLD ME
YOU'D BE BACK IN SCHOOL

111
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,541
BY THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK,

112
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,958
AND WHEN YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP,
I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK.

113
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,125
- YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT ME, RIN?

114
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,958
- WELL, OF COURSE, I WAS.

115
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,000
- I DID TOY WITH THE IDEA OF
COMING BACK RIGHT AWAY THOUGH.

116
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,125
BUT MY MOTHER INSISTED
THAT I TAKE IT EASY

117
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,708
AND REST FOR JUST
A FEW MORE DAYS.

118
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,708
SORRY.

119
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,666
- IS THAT REALLY THE TRUTH?
- OH, SURE, YES!

120
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,333
- ( both laughing )

121
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,875
- ASA, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

122
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,666
YOU DON'T SEEM
TO BE EATING MUCH.

123
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,583
- THAT'S BECAUSE I'M DIETING!

124
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,708
WELL, IT'S NOT SO MUCH A DIET.

125
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,041
I'M BEING RESPONSIBLE
WITH MY CALORIE INTAKE,

126
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,833
ESPECIALLY SINCE I'VE BEEN SICK.

127
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,208
I TEND TO GAIN WEIGHT
RIGHT AROUND HERE.

128
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,791
- ( gasps )

129
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,208
STOP. OKAY, WE GET THE IDEA.

130
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,833
- ( girls giggling )

131
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,041
- THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST
TIME TO PRESENT THIS, BUT...

132
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,333
IT'S ONE OF
YOUR FAVORITE DISHES, SO...

133
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,875
- NO, IT'S PERFECT!

134
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,500
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO
GET BACK TO OUR NORMAL ROUTINE.

135
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,500
THIS EGG OMELET IS
AN EXCELLENT TOUCH.

136
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,208
- I'M SO GLAD.

137
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,625
HEY, I HAVE ENOUGH
FOR EVERYONE, SO DIG IN.

138
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,916
- I'LL GIVE IT A TASTE TEST.

139
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,375
NOW, BE HONEST, NERINE.

140
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,500
YOU MADE THIS LOVELY DISH
JUST TO IMPRESS ME, DIDN'T YOU?

141
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,750
- THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID,
YOU IDIOT.

142
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,041
SHE'S BEING REALLY POLITE
AND OFFERING SOME TO ALL OF US.

143
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,250
- IN THAT CASE, I'D LOVE A BITE.

144
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,833
- I LIKE THE CORNERS.
- ME, TOO!

145
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,500
- ( gulping )

146
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,500
DELICIOUS!

147
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,708
YOU'VE MANAGED TO CREATE

148
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,000
THE PERFECT BLEND OF SPICES
AND RAW FLAVOR.

149
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:28,083
IT'S EXQUISITE!

150
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,291
- WOW, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
SAY THIS, BUT ITSUKI'S RIGHT.

151
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,458
YOU'RE CULINARY SKILLS
ARE OFF THE CHART.

152
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,125
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH IT
MEANS TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

153
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,291
THANK YOU, ASA.

154
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,375
- ( clock chiming )

155
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,500
- ALL RIGHT, CLASS DISMISSED!

156
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,250
SO, WHAT'RE YOU WAITING FOR?
BEAT IT.

157
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,416
- HEY, RIN!

158
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,583
WHY DON'T WE WALK HOME TOGETHER?

159
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,666
- SURE, SOUNDS GREAT.
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU, KAEDE?

160
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,250
- ME? I GUESS I DON'T HAVE
ANY SHOPPING TO DO

161
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,166
THIS AFTERNOON, SO YEAH.

162
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,291
- OKAY THEN, LET'S GET GOING.

163
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,875
- IT'S THE GREATEST.

164
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,291
AND EVERYTHING THEY SELL THERE
IS REALLY SUPER COOL.

165
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,416
- WOW, CAN I THINK ABOUT IT?

166
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,208
- WHAT'S TO THINK ABOUT, NERINE?
COME WITH US.

167
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,333
- WELL, I GUESS I WILL. I COULD
USE A COUPLE OF NEW OUTFITS.

168
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,291
- THERE'S BEEN
A CHANGE IN PLANS.

169
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,500
SIA, YOU TWO GO ON
WITHOUT ME, OKAY?

170
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,000
- WHAT?
- OKAY.

171
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,625
YOU GIRLS GO HAVE FUN.

172
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,416
- I KNOW ONE OF THE GUYS WHO
WORKS THERE AND HE'S WAY SWEET.

173
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,541
- NERINE?

174
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,250
- SIA, ARE YOU COMING?

175
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,250
- UH-HUH.
- WE'D BETTER GET A MOVE ON

176
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,833
IF WE WANT TO GET IN ON
THE AWESOME SALES.

177
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,958
- SEE YA.

178
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,083
- REALLY? ARE YOU CERTAIN?

179
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,458
- POSITIVE.

180
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,333
WHEN WE VISITED THE LABORATORY
IN THE DEMON WORLD,

181
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,625
I DISCOVERED THAT
LYCORIS ONE TRUE WISH

182
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,541
HAD FINALLY BEEN FULFILLED.

183
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,458
- WOW, NERINE, I HAD NO IDEA.

184
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,875
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

185
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,500
IT WASN'T MY INTENTION TO
KEEP IT A SECRET FROM YOU.

186
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,833
- FORGET IT.

187
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,791
THERE WASN'T A THING YOU
COULD DO ABOUT IT ANYWAY.

188
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,083
BUT, TELL ME STRAIGHT.
DOES THIS MEAN...

189
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,166
IT'S TRUE. MY FEELINGS
FOR RIN ARE MY OWN.

190
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,958
I LOVE HIM AS NERINE,
AND NERINE ALONE.

191
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,750
FROM HERE ON I'M LOOKING
AT RIN THROUGH MY OWN EYES.

192
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,916
AND I KNOW I'LL GROW
TO LOVE HIM EVEN MORE.

193
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,541
- I'M GLAD.

194
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,583
IF THAT'S WHERE YOUR HEAD'S AT,
THEN I FEEL A LITTLE RELIEVED.

195
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,541
- ( Nerine giggling )

196
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,458
THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE.

197
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,416
NOW THAT I CAN FOCUS ON JUST ME,
I'M SEEING CLEARLY.

198
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,625
AS IF MY EYES HAVE BEEN OPENED
TO THE HUMAN WORLD

199
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,083
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

200
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,958
EVERY ASPECT OF RIN'S WORLD
IS WASHING OVER ME.

201
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,708
THE SIGHTS, SOUNDS,
EVEN EMOTIONS

202
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,166
SEEM EASIER TO INTERPRET.

203
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,916
SO, I'VE DECIDED
TO START FROM ZERO

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,750
AND REBUILD MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIM FROM THE GROUND UP.

205
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,625
AND NOT JUST ONLY WITH RIN.

206
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,416
BUT WITH THE ENTIRE WORLD
IN WHICH HE LIVES.

207
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,833
IT'S MY OPPORTUNITY
TO REALLY START OVER.

208
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,416
- I SEE.

209
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,083
YOU SEEM QUITE HAPPY.

210
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,125
WELL, ARE YOU?

211
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,875
- OH, YES!

212
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,750
AND NOW, SIA,
IT'S YOUR TURN TO BE HAPPY.

213
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,625
- WAIT, NERINE? WHAT?

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,541
MY TURN?

215
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,708
WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?

216
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,791
NERINE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

217
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,375
HMM...

218
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,625
WHO AM I TO THINK MY HAPPINESS
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HERS?

219
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,333
- ( sighs )

220
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,916
- IT'S SO GORGEOUS.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,208
I'VE NEVER SEEN A SHOP
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

222
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,625
ANY ITEM YOU COULD IMAGINE.

223
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,500
- Kaede: I HAD NO IDEA.

224
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,375
- Rin: YOU SHOULD GO WITH HER
NEXT TIME, KAEDE.

225
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,583
- Nerine: YES, I'D LIKE THAT.

226
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,916
- AND NOW, SIA,
IT'S YOUR TURN TO BE HAPPY.

227
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,916
- WAKE UP!

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,375
- ( Rin screaming )

229
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,583
- GOTCHA! MORNING.

230
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,458
- YEAH, YOU DID.
COULDN'T WE JUST SHAKE HANDS?

231
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,250
- ( laughing )

232
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,166
COME ON! YOU DON'T WANT TO
BE LATE FOR CLASS, DO YOU?

233
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,625
- ASA, WAIT!

234
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,500
- ( Mayumi laughing )

235
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,041
SMELLS GREAT. KAEDE SURE
MAKES A DELICIOUS LUNCH.

236
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,583
- DON'T MIND IF I DO.
- HEY! CUT IT OUT!

237
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,041
- PARDON THE OBSERVATION, BUT...

238
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,375
IT SEEMS TO ME THE COMFORTS
OF DAY-TO-DAY LIFE

239
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,291
OFTEN MANIFEST IN OUR ROUTINE
HABITS, MEALTIME FOR EXAMPLE.

240
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,208
AH! THE SPLENDOR
OF FAMILIAR CUISINE.

241
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,416
- I JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO MAKE IT TODAY.

242
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,791
- WHAT?
THERE'S NO EGG OMELET?

243
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,333
- I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

244
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,500
- THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

245
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,333
EXCUSE ME,
I THINK MY STOMACH'S IN SHOCK.

246
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,000
- ( inaudible )

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,083
- THAT SMACK OF YOURS, IT'S
NEVER THE SAME TWICE, IS IT?

248
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,083
A WHOLE NEW PAIN EVERY TIME.

249
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,125
- IT HURTS ME
AS MUCH AS IT DOES YOU.

250
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,541
- I'M SURE.

251
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,083
- ( Asa giggling )

252
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,208
- WHAT THE?

253
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,541
- ( phone ringing )

254
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,708
- Kaede: YES? FUYOU RESIDENCE.

255
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,958
OH, HI, ASA!

256
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,083
YEP. OH.

257
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,000

258
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,416

YES.

260
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,083
WHEN? TOMORROW?

261
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,958
A SHOPPING SPREE, WOW.
SURE, THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

262
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,791
LISTEN, CAN YOU HOLD ON
FOR A MINUTE?

263
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,416
I'M GOING TO SWITCH TO THE
PHONE UPSTAIRS, OKAY? COOL.

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,708
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT RIN?

265
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,708
THIS IS KILLING ME.

266
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,208
I CAN'T HIDE
MY FEELINGS FOR HIM.

267
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,375
NO MATTER HOW THIS PLAYS OUT,
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE RIN.

268
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,291
SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE.

269
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,500
BECAUSE WITH THE WAY
THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW.

270
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,250
EVERYONE IS MISERABLE.

I NEED SOME STRONG MUSCLES

00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,375
IT'S BEEN SO LONG. I'LL WASTE
AWAY BEFORE SHE GETS BACK.

313
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,208
( stomach growling )

314
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,833
SHE'S HOME!

315
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,500
OH, WELCOME HOME, SIA!
NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK, UM...

316
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,291
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

317
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,583
( stomach growling )

318
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,541
- UNBELIEVABLE!

319
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,583
- ( gasps )

320
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,583
HUH? WHAT'S WRONG?

321
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,375
- AS IF YOU DON'T KNOW.

322
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,875
YOU WALKED RIGHT BY HIM AT THE
STORE WITHOUT EVEN SAYING HELLO.

323
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,375
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW WEAK
YOU'VE BECOME. MAKES ME SICK.

324
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:27,041
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT. WHY ARE
YOU SAYING SUCH HURTFUL THINGS?

325
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,250
- IT'S THE TRUTH.

326
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,958
I'M ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR
YOUR BEST INTERESTS.

327
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,458
YOU NEED TO TRUST HIM
AND BE MORE ASSERTIVE.

328
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,791
- IF I'M HOLDING BACK,
IT'S FOR MY FRIENDS.

329
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,958
- FRIENDS? HOW NAIVE.

330
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,416
- NO, WHAT'S NAIVE IS THE BELIEF
THAT MY LOVE FOR RIN

331
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,916
WAS EVER TRULY ENOUGH.

332
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,916
WE ALL CARE ABOUT HIM,
JUST TAKE NERINE, FOR EXAMPLE.

333
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,041
HER HEART ACHES AS MUCH AS
MINE DOES. MAYBE EVEN MORE.

334
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,583
- YOU'VE LOST HIM!

335
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,833
DON'T WASTE MY TIME
IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO FIGHT

336
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:55,916
FOR WHAT YOU WANT.

337
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,083
YOU THINK NERINE OR ANY
OF THOSE TRAMPS

338
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,916
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS?

339
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,458
LOVE IS UGLY!

340
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,625
- UGLY? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

341
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,375
- IT ISN'T A RIGHT, SIA.

342
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,166
TO CLAIM LOVE, YOU HAVE TO
GET YOUR HANDS BLOODY.

343
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,833
YOU MUST CLAW YOUR
WAY TO HIS HEART

344
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,958
AND BEAT DOWN ANY COMPETITION.

345
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,750
AND, IF NOT, MISERY'S ALL YOU'LL
EVER HAVE TO CURL UP NEXT TO.

346
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,583
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG!

347
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,875
LOVE REQUIRES HONESTY.

348
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,666
LOVE IS PATIENT AND... EITHER
HE'S MEANT FOR ME, OR HE ISN'T.

349
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,666
- LIAR!
- YOU'RE LYING!

350
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,125
- WHAT AN IDIOT.

351
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,541
IN CASE YOU'D FORGOTTEN,
I AM YOU.

352
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,125
I KNOW HOW YOU REALLY FEEL!

353
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,500
- IF THAT'S TRUE...

354
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,375
YOU'LL RESPECT MY CHOICE.

355
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,833
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT,

356
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,625
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
WHAT'S RIGHT.

357
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,750
IT'D BE SELFISH OF ME TO
TRY TO GAIN HAPPINESS

358
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,708
AT THE EXPENSE OF
SOMEONE ELSE'S.

359
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:52,500
- CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T TRY. I'M
DONE REASONING WITH YOU, SIA.

360
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,666
YOU HAD PLENTY OF
CHANCES TO MAKE RIN OURS

361
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,041
AND YOU BLEW THEM ALL.

362
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,083
I THINK IT'S TIME
I TOOK CONTROL.

363
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,333
IF YOU WON'T CLAIM HIM, I WILL!

364
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,458
- NO, YOU CAN'T!

365
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,833
LET ME OUT!

366
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,125
- AW, MAN.

367
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,958
I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT THIS
THROUGH JUST A LITTLE BETTER.

368
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,833
AGREEING TO HELP ASA SOUNDED SO
MUCH EASIER WHEN I WAS AWAKE!

369
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,458
STILL, I PROMISED.

370
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,416
- Kikyou: HI, RIN! GREAT TIMING!

371
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,666
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- YOU'RE NO FUN! UP HERE!

372
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,625
- ( gasps )

373
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,666
- ( giggling )

374
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,500
HEY THERE, SWEETIE!

375
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:50,666
- ( gasps ) SIA.
WHY ARE YOU UP THERE?

376
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,416
- BECAUSE... I LIKE TO SIT
ON A COLD FENCE IN THE MORNING.

377
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,750
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I SURPRISED YOU, HUH?

378
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,500
WHICH MEANS YOUR
REASON FOR BEING HERE

379
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,666
IS FAR MORE INTERESTING
THAN MY OWN.

380
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,291
- UH, WELL, I WAS JUST...

381
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,833
- ( giggling )

382
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,708
SINCE WE'RE BOTH JUST STANDING
HERE, WE SHOULD GO ON A DATE.

383
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,708
- HUH? WAIT. A DATE?

384
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,583
- WHY NOT?

385
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,208
- UH, HUH, UH...

386
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,458
- ( theme song playing )

387
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

388
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,416
- Rin: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO SIA,

389
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
BUT, SHE'S DEFINITELY
NOT HERSELF LATELY.

390
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,958
I GUESS HER ASKING ME OUT ISN'T
CRAZY OR ANYTHING, IT'S JUST...

391
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,083
WAIT! HEY, WHAT DOES SHE
THINK WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW?

392
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,708
WE HAVE SCHOOL!

393
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:12,208
- Nerine: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE.
EPISODE 17, "HONEST FEELINGS."

394
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,333
- Kikyou: YOUR WISH
AND MINE ARE THE SAME.
