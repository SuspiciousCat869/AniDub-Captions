1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,625
- LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.
TAKE YOUR SEATS. QUICKLY!

4
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,708
WHERE ARE RIN AND SIA?

5
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,833
- ( Asa whining )

6
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:09,708
OH, JEEZ! RIN, WHERE ARE YOU?

7
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:13,041
- ( giggling ) COME ON! SILLY.

8
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,333
- HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND!
- COME ON. HURRY!

9
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,416
- SIA, STOP IT!

10
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,333
THAT'S ENOUGH, OKAY?

11
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,458
MAN, I BET CLASS HAS ALREADY
STARTED BY NOW.

12
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,166
- OH, WHO CARES?
FORGET ABOUT SCHOOL.

13
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,500
WHY DON'T WE JUST SKIP IT TODAY?

14
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,916
- HUH?

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
SKIP SCHOOL? THAT'S REALLY
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

16
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:35,416
BUT JUST THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO US IF MISS NA FINDS OUT.

17
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,000
IT WON'T BE PRETTY,
YOU CAN BE SURE OF THAT.

18
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,416
- RIN, ARE YOU JUST
SAYING ALL THAT

19
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,083
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
GO ON A DATE WITH ME?

20
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:47,041
- NO, NOT AT ALL! UH, WELL,
YOU SEE, IT'S JUST THAT...

21
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,708
IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT,
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TODAY.

22
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,833
- LIAR!

23
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,416
YOU'RE MAKING EXCUSES!

24
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,750
AND I HAVE NOTICED THAT
YOU HAVEN'T SPENT

25
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,625
ANY TIME WITH ME LATELY.

26
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,791
- WHAT ARE YOU...

27
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,750
MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE RIGHT.

28
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,625
- I AM RIGHT!
AND THAT'S WHY I DECIDED...

29
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,916
THAT YOU AND I ARE GOING
ON A DATE TODAY, ALL DAY.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,291
AND YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO
PAY ATTENTION TO ME!

31
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,500
YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM ME.

32
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,708
- SIA, I REALLY THINK WE
SHOULD BE HEADING TO SCHOOL.

33
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,375
- WELL, IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO BE,

34
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,291
YOU LEAVE ME WITH NO CHOICE.

35
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,833
- ( screaming )

36
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,000
- ( Kikyou shrieking )

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,416
THAT MONSTER! YOU PERVERT!
HE PULLED UP MY SKIRT!

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,458
- NO! WAIT A SECOND! SIA?
- HE TRIED TO MOLEST ME!

39
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,916
- Woman: HOW DISGUSTING!

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,583
- NO, REALLY, IT'S NOT WHAT...
- Man: SCUMBAG!

41
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,583
- HEY! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

42
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,291
- I PROMISE, I DIDN'T.

43
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,208
I THINK WE FINALLY LOST THEM.

44
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,166
NO THANKS TO YOU, SIA.

45
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,208
- ( giggles )

46
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,958
- WELL, READY TO GO?
- YEAH.

47
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,208
WE'RE REALLY LATE
FOR SCHOOL NOW.

48
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,916
SIA?

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,125
- SO, I GUESS, SCHOOL'S MORE
IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN ME, HUH?

50
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,083
- SIA, STOP IT! THAT'S
NOT IT AT ALL.

51
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,583
- BUT THAT IS IT!

52
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,000
THERE REALLY IS A REASON I
ASKED YOU OUT TODAY BUT...

53
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,250
I DON'T KNOW.

54
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,166
I DO HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU,

55
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,750
BUT I CAN'T DO IT AT SCHOOL.

56
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,916
- IT'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT?

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,583
- OH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I'M TRYING.

58
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,583
YOU'LL JUST
END UP SAYING "NO".

59
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,166
- SIA...

60
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,291
( sighs ) WELL, OKAY THEN.

61
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,916
- DOCTOR? MY WIFE? HOW IS SHE?

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,666
- THERE REALLY IS
NO EASY WAY TO SAY THIS...

63
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,875
BUT YOUR WIFE ONLY HAS
ONE MORE WEEK TO LIVE.

64
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,291
- WHAT? NO! OH, GOD!

65
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,583
- Rin: OKAY...
SO WHY ARE WE WATCHING A MOVIE?

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,333
- HEY, SIA?

67
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,875
WHAT WAS THAT IMPORTANT THING
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME?

68
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,625
- HMM?

69
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,041
- COME ON, WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU TODAY?

70
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,166
YOU'RE ACTING KINDA WEIRD
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

71
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,375
- ( shrieking ) HOLD ME, RIN,
I'M SO SCARED!

72
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,333
- SIA! HEY!
- ( crying ) NO!

73
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,458
- ARE YOU GOING
TO GET WELL, MOM?

74
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:23,041
- ( Asa groaning )
MY ARMS ARE SO SORE.

75
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,125
- YOU CARRIED IT
ALL BY YOURSELF?

76
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,083
- UM, EXCUSE ME. ASA?
- HMM?

77
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,083
- Kareha: OH.
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE, KAEDE?

78
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,541
- KAEDE? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

79
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,125
- I'M SURE I'M WORRYING ABOUT
NOTHING, BUT HAVE YOU SEEN RIN?

80
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,833
HE LEFT THE HOUSE
EARLY THIS MORNING

81
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,083
AND HE SAID HE WAS STOPPING BY
YOUR PLACE, BUT...

82
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,375
- WAIT. HE'S NOT HERE?
- NO.

83
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,500
- WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.
HE TOLD ME HE'D MEET ME

84
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,958
AT MY PLACE BEFORE SCHOOL,

85
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,791
BUT, HE STOOD ME UP
THIS MORNING.

86
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,083
- OOH LA LA.
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND MORBID,

87
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,833
BUT, YOU DON'T THINK HE
WAS IN AN ACCIDENT, DO YOU?

88
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,166
- OR MAYBE ON HIS WAY TO
MY HOUSE THIS MORNING,

89
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,958
HE GOT KIDNAPPED.

90
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,083
- KIDNAPPED?

91
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,166
( exclaims )

92
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,291
- KAEDE!

93
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,583
- KAEDE'S GONE, TOO?

94
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,833
- ( Kikyou humming )

95
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,791
- I HOPE ASA WILL
STILL TALK TO ME AFTER THIS.

96
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,750
- HEY, RIN.

97
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,666
TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

98
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,916
- ABOUT THE DRESS? IT'S REALLY
NICE. BUT, I DON'T KNOW...

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,125
I DON'T THINK IT'S YOUR STYLE.

100
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:47,125
- OH. WELL. AND THIS ONE?

101
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,541
- THAT'S, UM...
THAT ONE'S MUCH BETTER.

102
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,458
( groans )

103
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,875
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD BE DOING THIS, SIA.

104
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,083
- THEN HOW ABOUT THIS?

105
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,458
- ( screams )

106
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,666
- EXCUSE, ME? MA'AM? IS
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT IN THERE?

107
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,375
HUH. I COULD'VE SWORN...

108
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,166
- OH, IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU

109
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,791
TO BE EMBARRASSED WITH ME.

110
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,125
- THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
YOU DIDN'T GET FLASHED.

111
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:27,458
- DON'T WORRY. I'M JUST FINE
WITH YOU SEEING MY BODY.

112
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,791
IN FACT, IF YOU'D LIKE,

113
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,416
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO
SHOW YOU THE REST OF IT.

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,041
- SIA...

115
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,083
- ( giggling )

116
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,041
- WELL, THAT WAS FUN.
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NEXT?

117
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,333
- HAVEN'T WE DONE
ENOUGH ALREADY?

118
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,041
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE BUY SOMETHING
FOR DINNER AND HEAD HOME?

119
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,625
- DINNER?

120
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,083
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT DINNER.

121
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,041
THE ONLY THING YOU NEED
TO CONCERN YOURSELF WITH

122
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,291
RIGHT NOW IS, ME. OKAY?

123
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,250
- UH... YOU'RE...
YOU ARE REALLY SIA, RIGHT?

124
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,125
- WELL, OF COURSE I AM, RIN.

125
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,750
I MEAN, COME ON, IF I'M NOT SIA,
WHO THE HECK ELSE WOULD I BE?

126
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,041
HEY, RIN.
LET'S GO SIT OVER THERE!

127
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,708
HEY. COME ON, RIN!

128
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,250
SITTING HERE ALONE LIKE THIS...

129
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,583
IT FEELS ALMOST LIKE YOU AND I
ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE

130
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,541
IN THE WHOLE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

131
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,875
EARLIER...
I MEANT IT.

132
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,125
I AM SERIOUS, RIN.
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF ME.

133
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,166
- SIA!

134
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,458
- IF YOU WANT.

135
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,333
- ( heart beating )

136
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,541
- WHY, RIN?

137
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,083
WHY NOT?

138
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,208
DON'T YOU...

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,458
THIS WAS WRONG.

140
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,000
( crying )

141
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,125
- SIA!

142
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,083
NO! SIA, DON'T!

143
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,875
I'M BACK, KAE...

144
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,625
- OH. WELCOME HOME, RIN.

145
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,333
- ( all gasping )

146
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,000
- OH, RIN!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

147
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,166
- ( stomach grumbling )

148
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,750
( sighs )

149
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:24,166
SIA. WHERE ARE YOU? WE SHOULD
HAVE HAD DINNER HOURS AGO.

150
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,166
- ( door opening )

151
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,791
- SHE'S BACK!

152
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,458
OH, SWEETHEART! I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU'D GET HOME.

153
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,041
GUESS YOU'RE GOING
TO COOK DINNER NOW, RIGHT?

154
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,208
- ( stomach grumbling )

155
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,041
- ( crying ) RIN.

156
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

157
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,833
YOU'RE TERRIBLE!
WHY? WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

158
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,166
- BECAUSE SOMETHING
HAD TO BE DONE

159
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,375
SINCE YOU WERE TAKING FOREVER
TO MAKE A MOVE.

160
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,833
I DID YOU A FAVOR
AND JUST MADE IT FOR YOU.

161
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,750
- BUT I NEVER ASKED YOU TO.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT!

162
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,166
- SORRY, I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WERE OKAY

163
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,666
WITH THE WAY THINGS WERE GOING.

164
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,333
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU
PREFERRED IT THAT WAY?

165
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,458
NOT BEING ABLE TO TELL RIN
HOW YOU FEEL?

166
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,500
- AT LEAST I WAS HAPPIER THEN!

167
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,458
I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE
KEEPING THINGS THE SAME

168
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,750
IF I KNEW HOW TODAY
WAS GOING TO TURN OUT.

169
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,000
BUT NOW, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FACE RIN AFTER ALL THIS?

170
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,708
- THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH RIN.

171
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,041
YOU THREW YOURSELF AT HIM
AND HE WOULDN'T EVEN KISS YOU.

172
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,916
YOU KNOW, I TOTALLY THOUGHT
THINGS WOULD GO WELL

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,416
FOR YOU TODAY, SIA.

174
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,458
I KEPT TELLING MYSELF,
"SIA DESERVES THIS.

175
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,833
SHE DESERVES TO FALL IN LOVE!"

176
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,166
"SHE DESERVES HAPPINESS!"
GUESS I WAS WRONG.

177
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,750
- HAPPINESS?

178
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,208
- OF COURSE!

179
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,500
I MEAN, YOU REALLY ARE IN
LOVE WITH RIN, AREN'T YOU?

180
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,791
SO THEN IF YOU TOLD HIM THAT,

181
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,416
MAYBE IT WOULD LEAD
TO HIM LOVING YOU!

182
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
- YEAH, BUT...

183
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,208
- SIA, DON'T YOU WANT TO
FIND HAPPINESS?

184
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:20,458
- YES, BUT...
IT'S OKAY. REALLY.

185
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,000
BECAUSE...

186
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,541
I DON'T WANT ANY HAPPINESS IF IT
MEANS I HAVE TO BE SELFISH.

187
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,666
- SIA!

188
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,166
JUST SAY IT.
IS IT BECAUSE OF ME?

189
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,833
- NO! IT'S NOT. NOT AT ALL.
PLEASE DON'T THINK THAT!

190
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,000
- DON'T LIE!

191
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,541
YOU CAN'T HIDE ANYTHING
FROM ME. YOU NEVER COULD.

192
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,708
DON'T FORGET THAT I AM INSIDE
YOU, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

193
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,041
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT
MAKES ME FEEL?

194
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,916
KNOWING THAT YOU CAN'T
EVER BE HAPPY PERSONALLY

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,458
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO CONCERNED
ABOUT MY HAPPINESS?

196
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,083
MAYBE IT'S TIME
I FOUND HAPPINESS ON MY OWN.

197
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,041
LOOK, IF YOU REALLY CARE
ABOUT ME, SIA,

198
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,458
THEN YOU'LL GO FIND
HAPPINESS FOR YOURSELF.

199
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,916
- DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE...

200
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,750
- I'M AFRAID SO. YEAH.

201
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,666
I'VE GOT TO. EVERY
TIME I COME OUT,

202
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,958
I'VE CAUSED SO MUCH
TROUBLE FOR YOU, SIA,

203
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,083
SO...

204
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,250
SO, I'LL JUST...

205
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,083
I'LL GO AWAY.
AND NEVER BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

206
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,666
- KIKYOU! PLEASE, DON'T!

207
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,583
- GO FIND YOUR HAPPINESS.

208
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,708
- WAIT! DON'T GO. STAY HERE.

209
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,458
DON'T LEAVE.

210
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,500
DON'T GO AWAY.

211
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,708
PLEASE, JUST STAY WITH ME.

212
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,833
- I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, SIA.

213
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,500
- ( crying )

214
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,541
- Mayumi: WELL, GOOD MORNING,
RIN. KAEDE. NERINE.

215
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,750
- Rin: MORNING.

216
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,708
- Kaede: AND A GOOD MORNING
TO YOU, MAYUMI.

217
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,291
- Nerine: HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

218
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,541
- Sia: RIN...

219
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,666
- Mayumi: KAEDE CALLED
AND TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

220
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,375
SO, YOU FINALLY HAD A RUN-IN
WITH SOME COPPERS, HUH?

221
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,000
- "FINALLY?" HEY, WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT EXACTLY?

222
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,750
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

223
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,208
I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU'D
EVENTUALLY BE WANTED

224
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,000
BY THE POLICE FOR
SOMETHING OR THE OTHER.

225
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,541
- Kaede: MAYUMI, STOP!

226
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,041
- WAIT, YOU DIDN'T TELL ANYONE
ELSE ABOUT THIS, DID YOU?

227
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,375
PLEASE, TELL ME YOU DIDN'T.

228
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,875
- UH, TELL EVERYONE ELSE
ABOUT WHAT, RIN?

229
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,250
- Mayumi: OH, YOU'VE GOT TO
HEAR THIS. IT'S A RIOT!

230
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,333
- Rin: COME ON, MAYUMI!

231
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,500
- Mayumi: OW! HEY,
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

232
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,041
- Rin: YOU SURE DO
HAVE A BIG MOUTH.

233
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,291
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

234
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,583
- Rin: SOMEBODY BACK ME UP HERE.

235
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,916
- Mayumi: WELL, DON'T
LOOK AT ME, MISTER.

236
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,875
- HEY! GOOD MORNING, RIN!

237
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,666
- OH. HELLO, ASA. GOOD MORNING.
- OH, YES. GOOD MORNING.

238
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,375
- NICE ONE, ASA.

239
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,333
- WHAT GIVES, ASA? THAT WAS
A LITTLE HARDER THAN USUAL.

240
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,375
- HUH? I WONDER WHY?

241
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,583
IT COULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

242
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,833
WITH YOU STANDING ME UP
YESTERDAY, COULD IT?

243
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,416
- UH... YEAH. YOU SEE...

244
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,750
ABOUT THAT, I CAN EXPLAIN...

245
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:33,500
- REALLY?
WHY DON'T YOU START THEN?

246
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,333
- WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS, I...

247
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,791
- WHATEVER.

248
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,500
I WAS SURPRISED THAT KAEDE
THOUGHT I WAS BEING SERIOUS

249
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,166
ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING THING.

250
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,208
I NEVER THOUGHT
SHE'D ACTUALLY CALL THE POLICE.

251
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,291
- Kaede: BUT I THOUGHT...

252
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,208
- SO YOU'RE THE GUILTY ONE
WHO PUT THAT CRAZY IDEA

253
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,708
IN HER HEAD, WEREN'T YOU?

254
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,166
IT TOOK ME HOURS TO STRAIGHTEN
THINGS OUT WITH THE COPS.

255
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,416
- SERVES YOU RIGHT,

256
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,541
BUT DON'T YOU DARE TRY
AND BLAME ME FOR THAT.

257
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,708
BLAME THE GUY WHO BROKE HIS
PROMISE AND STOOD ME UP INSTEAD.

258
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,458
- BUT, ASA, THAT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS! HEY!

259
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,166
- WOULD YOU JUST WAIT A MINUTE?
- Sia: OF COURSE.

260
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,666
- THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN
SOME THINGS.

261
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,250
ASA, PLEASE. I CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING! IT'S LIKE THIS...

262
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,416
- ( clock chiming )

263
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,708
- Nadeshiko: OKAY!
THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY.

264
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,500
- WELL, ALL RIGHT.

265
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,125
THANKS TO KAEDE
SMOOTHING THINGS OVER,

266
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,708
MISS NA DOESN'T WANT
TO KILL US NOW.

267
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,833
- HELLO.

268
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,208
HEY, RIN. DO YOU THINK WE
COULD TALK AFTER CLASS?

269
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,833
SEE YOU THEN.

270
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,166
I LOVE THIS!

271
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,833
IT REALLY IS A PERFECT
AUTUMN DAY, ISN'T IT?

272
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,125
- OH. UH, YEAH.

273
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,916
- WOW!

274
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,041
LOOK AT ALL THIS!
THERE ARE SO MANY FLOWERS!

275
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,041
I WONDER WHAT
THIS KIND IS CALLED?

276
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:05,375
- WELL, SIA, YOU'RE BACK
TO YOUR OLD SELF TODAY.

277
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,208
- HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
SIA FROM YESTERDAY, RIN?

278
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,500
I'M SORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE
THAT I CAUSED YOU.

279
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,541
THAT WAS A SIDE OF ME
YOU HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

280
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,000
WELL, THE TRUTH IS, THERE'S
ANOTHER SIA INSIDE OF ME.

281
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,208
- HUH?

282
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,583
- I KNOW THIS MIGHT BE
HARD TO BELIEVE.

283
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,708
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HONEST
AND TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE.

284
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,458
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW. I WAS
SCARED OF WHAT YOU'D THINK.

285
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,625
I WAS SUPPOSED TO
HAVE A TWIN SISTER.

286
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,041
- "SUPPOSED TO HAVE"?

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,916
DOES THAT MEAN? YOU LOST?

288
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,625
- YEAH.

289
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,958
THERE WERE SOME
COMPLICATIONS WITH MY SISTER

290
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,666
WHEN WE WERE STILL IN THE WOMB.

291
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,416
AND SO...

292
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,416
I WAS BORN AN ONLY CHILD.

293
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,291
- SIA, I'M SORRY.
- IT'S REALLY SAD, ISN'T IT?

294
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,416
IT BREAKS MY HEART.

295
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,958
SO, IN THE WOMB, RIGHT BEFORE
MY SISTER FADED AWAY,

296
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,583
I ABSORBED ALL OF
HER THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS.

297
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,125
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY.

298
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,291
YOU'RE A SPECIAL PART OF ME.

299
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:14,000
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.
SO, LET'S STAY TOGETHER.

300
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,583
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE WITH ME.

301
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,041
WE'LL BE SISTERS FOREVER, OKAY?

302
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,708
AND SINCE THAT DAY, THERE HAVE
BEEN TWO VERSIONS OF ME.

303
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,875
ONE IS THE NORMAL ME

304
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,333
WHO'S STANDING IN FRONT
OF YOU RIGHT NOW.

305
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,958
AND THE OTHER,
YOU MET YESTERDAY.

306
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,166
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THERE ARE
TWO VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE

307
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,333
LIVING INSIDE OF ME.

308
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,166
I EXPERIENCE SO MANY DIFFERENT
EMOTIONS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

309
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,458
WHETHER I'M LAUGHING, CRYING,
OR FALLING IN LOVE,

310
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,500
YOU'RE STILL SEEING
THE NORMAL SIA.

311
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,458
BUT, SOMETIMES,
THE OTHER ME COMES OUT

312
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,833
CAUSING THOSE SAME EMOTIONS
TO BE MUCH MORE INTENSE.

313
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,541
SO THEN, SHE HAS TO GO BACK
INSIDE MY SUBCONSCIOUS,

314
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,041
ALL ALONE.

315
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,416
THAT'S WHY I DECIDED THAT
I CAN'T BE HAPPY ON THE OUTSIDE

316
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,750
IF SHE'S UNHAPPY ON THE INSIDE.

317
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,333
BECAUSE THAT JUST WOULDN'T
BE FAIR TO HER, WOULD IT?

318
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,791
- I SEE.

319
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,916
- HOWEVER, THANKS TO YOU, RIN,
I REALIZED SOMETHING.

320
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,166
ALL THIS TIME, SHE COULDN'T
STAND THAT WAY OF THINKING.

321
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,333
- HUH?

322
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,208
- I REALLY BELIEVED THAT
HAPPINESS FOR MYSELF

323
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,875
WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

324
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,416
MY SISTER NEVER WANTED ME
TO GO THROUGH LIFE LIKE THAT,

325
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,916
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE ALONE.

326
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,333
SO EVEN THOUGH SHE CAUSED
A LOT OF TROUBLE,

327
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,750
SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.

328
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,000
SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO
INTERFERE AT ALL.

329
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,791
SHE ONLY WANTED WHAT SHE
THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR MY LIFE.

330
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,916
SHE COULDN'T EXPERIENCE
IT FOR HERSELF,

331
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,625
BUT SHE WANTED ME TO BE HAPPY.

332
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,750
- REALLY?

333
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,416
- MY SISTER FINALLY GAVE ME
THE COURAGE I NEEDED.

334
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,166
THE COURAGE TO LOVE,

335
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,375
AND TO BE OKAY WITH WANTING
THAT FOR MYSELF.

336
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,375
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING
AGAIN TO YOU.

337
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:19,041
I LOVE YOU. REALLY.
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

338
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,166
- SIA.

339
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,083
I'M SORRY.

340
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,833
- YOU KNOW, I HAD A FEELING
YOU'D SAY THAT, RIN.

341
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,666
SO, I GUESS THERE MUST BE
SOMEONE ELSE SPECIAL

342
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,666
IN YOUR LIFE, ISN'T THERE?

343
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,791
- SIA.

344
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,041
- HEY, I AM REALLY SORRY
I'VE BEEN KEEPING

345
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,958
SOMETHING THIS
IMPORTANT FROM YOU.

346
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,375
I EVEN SAID I WANTED YOU
TO GET TO KNOW ME BETTER.

347
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,958
IT FEELS SO GOOD TO FINALLY
GET THIS OFF MY CHEST!

348
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,041
WELL, COME ON, RIN.
LET'S GET GOING.

349
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,666
- OH, THERE'S ONE THING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW.

350
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,500
- HMM?

351
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,583
- IN THE REALM OF THE GODS,

352
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,958
IT'S COMMON FOR A MAN TO
HAVE MANY WIVES.

353
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,500
- HUH?

354
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,208
- ( theme song playing )

355
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

356
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,791
- Nerine: WE'VE REALIZED
SOMETHING IN SPITE OF OURSELVES.

357
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,583
- Sia: BECAUSE ALL
OF US LOVE RIN.

358
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,041
- Nerine: THEN, FOR RIN'S SAKE,
AS WELL AS OUR OWN.

359
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,791
- Primula: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE.
EPISODE 18, "THE ONE RIN LOVES"

360
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,250
- Rin: I SHOULDN'T LET THINGS
DRAG ON LIKE THIS, SHOULD I?
