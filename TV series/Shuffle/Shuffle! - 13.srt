1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,916
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,750
- Kaede: I'M SORRY, I KNOW
I'M RUNNING A LITTLE BEHIND.

4
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,958
- IT'S OKAY. WE'RE REALLY
NOT IN A HURRY.

5
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,791
- I'M JUST EXCITED ABOUT
STARTING THE SECOND TERM.

6
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,000
HEY, RIMU, WE'RE HEADED OFF
TO SCHOOL, OKAY?

7
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,208
- KAEDE, LET'S GO.

8
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,916
- ARE YOU OKAY?

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,041
- I'LL BE FINE.
WE BETTER GET TO SCHOOL.

10
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,541
- Primula: RIN, KAEDE?

11
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,750
- RIN. KAEDE.

12
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,916
- Nadeshiko: HUSTLE, MAYUMI,
YOU'VE GOT TWENTY MORE LAPS.

13
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,833
SIA, STOP YOUR WHINNING.
FIFTEEN TO GO.

14
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:48,000
- Mayumi: SOMEBODY KILL ME,
PLEASE. ANY TIME NOW.

15
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,791
- IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR
FORGETTING YOUR HOMEWORK.

16
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,250
YOU GET TO RUN ONE LAP
FOR EACH THING YOU FORGOT.

17
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,958
WAIT. STOP. TSUCCHI!

18
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,583
- HANG IN THERE, SIA,
I'LL RUN, TOO.

19
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,875
- WHAT? BUT...
BUT YOU'LL GET IN TROUBLE.

20
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,583
- I KIND OF FEEL BAD ABOUT
MAKING YOU WORRY SO MUCH.

21
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,500
BESIDES, I CAN'T LET YOU
RUN ALL THIS BY YOURSELF.

22
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,333
- OH, RIN.

23
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,791
- KAEDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,041
SPACE CADET,
YOUR POT IS BOILING.

25
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,375
- WHAT?

26
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,875
I'M SORRY.

27
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,250
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU'RE COMPLETELY OUT OF IT.

28
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,041
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
TOTALLY OUT OF THE BLUE,

29
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,958
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
LEARNING TO MAKE SWEETS?

30
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,500
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

31
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,291
- NO. IT'S NOTHING.

32
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,208
IT'S JUST THAT, I THOUGHT THAT
IF I MADE RIN SOMETHING NICE,

33
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,375
IT MIGHT CHEER HIM UP.

34
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,083
- JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

35
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:26,500
- OH, RIN, I MADE YOU A YUMMY
BAVARIAN CREAM PIE FOR DESSERT.

36
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,958
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO AND CUT YOU A SLICE?

37
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,083
- SURE.

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,875
- OH, I'M SORRY, KAEDE.

39
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,750
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT PRIMULA, YOU KNOW?

40
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,750
THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

41
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,541
SHE GETS TO EAT
AS WELL AS WE DO.

42
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,416
- I DON'T KNOW. I HOPE SO.

43
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,958
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

44
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,666
OF COURSE,
SHE'S EATING WELL, RIGHT?

45
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,791
SHE WENT BACK TO THAT PLACE
SO SHE'D GET BETTER.

46
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,125
I BET SHE'S PROBABLY BACK
TO 100 PERCENT BY NOW

47
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,125
AND STUFFING HER FACE WITH

48
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,666
DELICIOUS DEMON
WORLD STYLE FOOD.

49
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,958
- SHE'S ONLY BEEN THERE A DAY.

50
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,791
- YEAH, I KNOW. IT ISN'T
GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

51
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,416
- WHAT ABOUT MAGIC?

52
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,041
WHAT IF SHE WAS
MIRACULOUSLY CURED

53
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,333
BY SOME POWERFUL MAGICAL SPELL?

54
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,458
- HEY, IT COULD HAPPEN.
( laughing )

55
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,541
- Forbesii: THE EXAMINATIONS

56
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,875
AREN'T HAPPENING AS
QUICKLY AS WE'D HOPED.

57
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,375
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE'LL BE
ABLE TO COME BACK FOR A WHILE.

58
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,791
- FOR A WHILE?
AND HOW LONG IS A WHILE?

59
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,333
- AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T KNOW.

60
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:50,041
WE'LL CONTACT YOU AS SOON
AS WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION.

61
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,041
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

62
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,500
PROMISE ME THAT YOU'LL
TAKE GOOD CARE OF PRIMULA

63
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,083
WHILE SHE'S AWAY.

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,125
- ( sighs )
- Nerine: FATHER.

65
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,541
- WHAT IS IT, NERINE?

66
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,666
- IS RIMU...

67
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,458
IS HER CONDITION AS BAD
AS I'VE BEEN TOLD?

68
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,458
- NO. IT'S JUST LIKE I TOLD RIN.

69
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,708
- DON'T YOU LIE!

70
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,916
I KNOW THAT SOMETHING'S
WRONG. RIMU'S IN TROUBLE.

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,750
I FEEL THIS PAINFUL ACHE IN MY
HEART AND IT HURTS FOR PRIMULA.

72
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,333
- I GUESS THERE'S NO WAY
TO KEEP IT FROM YOU. ALL RIGHT.

73
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,750
- Researcher: THE MAGIC
ACCUMULATED IN HER

74
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,583
IS FAR GREATER THAN WHAT
WE HAD ORIGINALLY PREDICTED.

75
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,000
- NOW STOP RIGHT THERE.

76
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,500
IF PRIMULA REGAINED
HER HUMANISTIC EMOTIONS,

77
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,791
WASN'T SHE SUPPOSED TO BE
ABLE TO CONTROL HER POWERS?

78
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,041
- WELL, IN THEORY.

79
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,833
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
THE HYPOTHESIS WAS WRONG?

80
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,166
- WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT EITHER.

81
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,500
OUR PREDICTIONS INDICATED

82
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,666
THAT SHE WOULD GAIN A
DEGREE OF CONTROL, BUT...

83
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,500
- BUT SHE'S NOT DOING IT.

84
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:03,250
WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE?
IF THINGS GET WORSE?

85
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,416
- THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY
THAT SHE WILL SUFFER

86
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,000
THE SAME FATE AS
THE PREVIOUS SUBJECTS.

87
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,000
- SHE'S THE THIRD ONE ALREADY.

88
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,291
ARE YOU SAYING
THERE'S NO WAY TO SAVE HER?

89
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,916
- THERE IS A WAY, BUT...

90
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,333
- NO THAT'S AWFUL.

91
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,583
- THAT'S OUR ONLY OPTION
RIGHT NOW.

92
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,083
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING
FOR OTHER WAYS, BUT...

93
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,333
- NO, BUT... BUT THEN...

94
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,708
- NERINE, I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU
FEEL. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

95
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:34,541
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
ABOUT LYCORIS EITHER.

96
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:39,458
REMEMBER, RIN CAN'T KNOW ABOUT
THIS. KEEP OUR SECRET SAFE.

97
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,916
- NERINE, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

98
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,958
POOR RIN. HE SEEMS
SO DEPRESSED, ALONE.

99
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,416
I HOPE THAT PRIMULA
CAN COME BACK SOON.

100
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,791
- UM, YOU KNOW, SIA, I...

101
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:19,958
NOTHING. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

102
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,500
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING ON
YOUR MIND, DON'T BOTTLE IT UP.

103
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,000
WE'LL WORK TOGETHER, OKAY?
SINCE THERE'S TWO OF US,

104
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,083
WHO KNOWS WHAT IDEAS
WE'LL BE ABLE TO DISCOVER.

105
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,875
- SIA...

106
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,750
- I DON'T WANT TO SEE
RIN FEELING LIKE THAT

107
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,625
ANYMORE THAN YOU DO.

108
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,916
- LET'S GO SOMEWHERE
MORE PRIVATE.

109
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,833
- I HAD NO IDEA.

110
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,541
- I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN BRING
MYSELF TO TELL RIN THE TRUTH.

111
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,625
- YEAH, BUT, I DON'T THINK
THAT WE CAN STAY QUIET

112
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,791
AND KEEP THIS THING
TO OURSELVES EITHER.

113
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,500
- WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT, SIA.

114
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,000
I JUST DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW TO TELL HIM.

115
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,333
- BUT, WHAT IF THERE WAS
A SPECIAL OCCASION?

116
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,125
HOW ABOUT THIS?

117
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,000
LISTEN, LET'S GET IN TOUCH
WITH BOTH RIN AND KAEDE

118
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,541
AND INVITE THEM OVER FOR DINNER?

119
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,708
WE'LL INVITE BOTH OF
OUR FATHERS AS WELL,

120
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,458
AND THEN WE'LL WAIT FOR
THE PERFECT TIME TO BRING IT UP.

121
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,250
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

122
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,041
THAT OUR FATHERS BE THE ONES
TO TALK TO RIN ABOUT RIMU?

123
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,708
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

124
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,250
LET'S FIND RIN AND KAEDE,
SO WE CAN INVITE THEM OVER.

125
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,041
- HEY, I THOUGHT YOU AND
I WERE HAVING DINNER

126
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,166
OVER AT NERINE'S PLACE TONIGHT.

127
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,125
- YEAH. I KNOW, I'M JUST WORRIED

128
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,250
IF WE DON'T BRING AT LEAST
ONE DISH TO THE PARTY,

129
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,791
THEY'LL THINK WE'RE RUDE.

130
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,625
- YOU'RE RIGHT. WE PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T SHOW UP TO THIS THING

131
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,250
COMPLETELY EMPTY HANDED, HUH?

132
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,833
- APPARENTLY, SIA AND HER FATHER

133
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,375
ARE COOKING UP A PRETTY
EXTRAVAGANT FEAST.

134
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,208
I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT
I DON'T BRING SOMETHING

135
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,791
THAT'S ALREADY ON
THE MENU, YOU KNOW?

136
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,625
- YOU OUGHT TO CALL THEM AND SEE
WHAT KINDA STUFF THEY'RE MAKING.

137
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,041
- NO! THERE'S NO WAY I COULD
EVER ASK THEM THAT, RIN.

138
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,625
THEN THEY'LL DEFINITELY THINK
WE'RE RUDE.

139
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,541
- I DON'T MIND.
I'LL GO ASK THEM.

140
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,916
- Eustoma: HOW ARE WE
GOING TO HANDLE THIS?

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,875
ARE WE REALLY GOING TO TELL RIN
AND KAEDE THE TRUTH ABOUT RIMU?

142
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,416
- WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

143
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,291
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
WE CAN HIDE FOREVER.

144
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,875
AND I THINK IT'S CRUEL TO FORCE
OUR DAUGHTERS TO BE QUIET

145
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,666
AND TO LIE TO THEIR FRIENDS.

146
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,166
- I COMPLETELY AGREE.

147
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,833
BUT IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE THING
TO TELL THEM.

148
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,291
WE JUST SIMPLY CANNOT LET
PRIMULA COME BACK HERE AGAIN.

149
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,541
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND.

150
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,625
THE WAY THINGS ARE,
PRIMULA WON'T LAST LONG.

151
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,625
- ( door creaking )
- WHO'S THERE?

152
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,708
OH, RIN.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

153
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,916
- I KNOCKED ON THE DOOR
AND NOBODY CAME,

154
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,333
SO I LET MYSELF IN. SORRY.

155
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,250
IS THAT THE TRUTH?
WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING?

156
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,958
- WELL... NOW, RIN, LISTEN HERE.

157
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,416
- I WANT THE TRUTH NOW.

158
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,166
- YES, IT'S TRUE.
- BUT WHY?

159
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,000
DIDN'T SHE GO BACK TO
THE REALM OF THE DEMONS

160
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,958
SO THAT SHE COULD GET BETTER?

161
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,750
- YES, THAT WAS THE INTENT.

162
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,000
NO, NO, THAT IS THE INTENT
EVEN NOW AS WE SPEAK.

163
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,833
BUT, PRIMULA'S CONDITION HAS
WORSENED FAR BEYOND ANYTHING

164
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,416
THAT WE HAD EVER ANTICIPATED.

165
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,208
- NO, BUT...
BUT THAT MEANS PRIMULA IS...

166
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,916
- IT'S EXACTLY AS HE SAID.

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,625
AT THIS RATE
THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING

168
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,000
IF SHE'LL LIVE THROUGH THE DAY.

169
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,500
- IS THERE SOME KIND OF CURE?

170
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,541
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY
TO HELP HER.

171
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,958
TALK TO ME.

172
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,041
- THERE IS ONLY ONE CURE.

173
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:44,041
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.
SO SHE CAN BE SAVED, RIGHT?

174
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,041
- BY ALLOWING HER EMOTIONS
TO SHOW,

175
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,500
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ABLE TO CONTROL HER MAGIC.

176
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,625
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, IT APPEARS
THAT IT HAS SERVED TO HAVE

177
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,500
THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON HER.

178
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,541
THUS RESETTING
PRIMULA'S EMOTIONS

179
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,416
BEFORE THEY GROW ANY STRONGER.

180
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,791
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY.

181
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,708
PRIMULA WILL FORGET
WHAT IT IS TO FEEL.

182
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,000
AND SHE WILL LIKELY
NEVER RECALL IT AGAIN.

183
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,708
- OH. HEY, RIN,
I'M SORRY WE TOOK SO LONG.

184
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,333
WE'LL GET STARTED COOKING
RIGHT AWAY.

185
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,541
RIN?

186
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,041
- OH, NO. LISTEN, RIN.
- YOU KNEW.

187
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,875
YOU BOTH KNEW ABOUT PRIMULA?

188
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,250
WHY?

189
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,375
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
AS SOON AS YOU FOUND OUT?

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,125
TELL ME WHY?

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,666
- I'M SO SORRY, RIN.
- I APOLOGIZE.

192
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,000
WE REALLY NEVER MEANT
FOR IT TO BE THIS WAY.

193
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,750
- I'M SORRY. YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT.

194
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,083
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY TELL ME
ABOUT HER?

195
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,208
- OH, RIN.

196
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,291
- I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU MUST'VE FELT.

197
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:21,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. HOW AM I
EVER GOING TO TELL KAEDE?

198
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,416
- HEY.

199
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,625
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU, RIN?

200
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,833
HIDING AWAY IN PRIMULA'S ROOM
LIKE THIS?

201
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,375
- OH, UH...

202
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,208
YOU KNOW OUR DINNER PARTY THING?

203
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,458
IT GOT CANCELLED,
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA GO.

204
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,625
- OH, I HOPE EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

205
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,083
- YEAH. APPARENTLY, SOMETHING
JUST HAPPENED TO COME UP.

206
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,416
- WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

207
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,083
- ME, TOO.

208
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,791
- WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER GET
DINNER STARTED, OKAY?

209
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,833
- SURE THING, KAEDE.

210
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,583
- I SURE HOPE RIMU'S ABLE TO
COME HOME SOON, DON'T YOU?

211
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,916
- WHAT?

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,541
- 'CAUSE WHEN SHE
DOES COME BACK,

213
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,000
I'M GONNA MAKE HER THE
BEST MEAL SHE'S EVER HAD.

214
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,208
- YEAH, WELL, I'M SURE
SHE'LL BE HOME REAL SOON.

215
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,791
- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE LYING
TO ME, RIN.

216
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,291
( sobbing ) YOU'RE A WONDERFUL,
KIND PERSON.

217
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,583
BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A HORRIBLE LIAR.

218
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,958
- ARE YOU GOING TO SIT THERE
AND DO NOTHING?

219
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,333
- ( Kaede sobbing )

220
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,958
- ( sobbing )

221
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,833
- I SURE AM SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU TWO HERE.

222
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,500
WHERE'S RIN AND KAEDE?
THEY'RE NOT WITH YOU?

223
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,958
HELLO, RIN.
- HEY THERE, ASA.

224
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,458
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? YOU TWO
ARE SITTING WAY TOO FAR APART.

225
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,333
NOW, YOU LISTEN UP, MISTER,

226
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,500
YOU BETTER NOT HAVE GONE

227
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,416
AND DONE SOMETHING
TO UPSET KAEDE AGAIN.

228
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,625
- NO, RIN HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.

229
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,250
- DON'T YOU LIE FOR HIM.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROTECT HIM.

230
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,291
COME ON, JERK FACE,
IT'S TIME TO FESS UP.

231
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,041
- EXCUSE ME,
BUT I'M JUST NOT IN THE MOOD.

232
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,166
- RIN, WAIT.

233
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,291
IT'S ABOUT RIMU, ISN'T IT?

234
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,791
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.

235
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,416
- ( students talking )

236
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,708
- Sia: RIN, DO YOU WANNA
WALK HOME TOGETHER?

237
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,541
- OH, I WOULD

238
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,583
BUT I'M JUST GONNA WALK AROUND
AND GET SOME AIR.

239
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,833
- HUH?
- SORRY.

240
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,708
- WHAT'S UP? SO, YOU'RE NOT
GOING HOME WITH RIN, HUH? KAEDE?

241
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,791
HELLO. UH... LADIES?

242
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,750
- ( upbeat music playing )

243
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,583
- OH, PRIMULA.

244
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,791
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A BREAK
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

245
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
I HEARD ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
FROM KAEDE.

246
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,583
BUT STILL, RIN, WHAT WAS
ALL THAT ABOUT EARLIER?

247
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,208
IT'S REALLY NOT LIKE YOU.

248
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,875
- I JUST...
I DIDN'T WANNA GO HOME.

249
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,791
- HUH?

250
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,875
- IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT
WITHOUT PRIMULA THERE.

251
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,958
AND THEN, TO SEE
THAT LOOK ON KAEDE'S FACE.

252
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,833
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP HER.

253
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,958
PLUS, IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

254
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,458
WHAT I DID WAS HORRIBLE.

255
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,291
SHE DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT
TO GO BACK.

256
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,250
I FORCED HER.
I MADE HER GO BACK.

257
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,791
WHEN SHE WAS SO AGAINST IT.

258
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,500
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

259
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,625
I DIDN'T KNOW I WASN'T
EVER GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN.

260
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,750
- YEAH, BUT IF THINGS
HAD BEEN LEFT ALONE,

261
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,958
RIMU WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
ANY BETTER, RIGHT?

262
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,666
- MAYBE SO. BUT THAT
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

263
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,125
THAT I FORCED PRIMULA TO
GO BACK AGAINST HER WILL.

264
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,125
KAEDE WOULDN'T STOP CRYING.

265
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,333
BUT YOU KNOW, SHE HASN'T SAID
A BAD WORD ABOUT ME.

266
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,041
I THINK THAT I WOULD FEEL BETTER
IF SHE'D JUST BLAME ME.

267
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,291
LIKE SHE DID BEFORE.

268
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,750
IF SHE'D JUST SAY THAT
IT'S MY FAULT THAT RIMU'S GONE.

269
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,666
- THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY.
CUT OUT THIS MOPING NONSENSE.

270
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,291
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO FEEL
SORRY FOR YOURSELF, RIN.

271
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,083
- ASA. I...

272
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,500
- YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON AND
YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE

273
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,208
FOR A FRIEND WHEN
THEY NEED YOU.

274
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:17,375
YOU BUST YOUR BUTT TO HELP THEM
BECAUSE YOU GENUINELY CARE.

275
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,916
RIMU WAS ABLE TO SMILE AGAIN
BECAUSE OF YOU.

276
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,166
DID YOU FORGET THAT?

277
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,833
- YEAH BUT BECAUSE OF THAT
PRIMULA, SHE...

278
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,750
- OH, WOW, I CERTAINLY HOPE

279
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,000
YOU'RE NOT SAYING PRIMULA'S
SMILING AGAIN WAS A MISTAKE?

280
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,333
- THAT'S NOT.

281
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,083
- OF COURSE NOT.

282
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,750
SHE HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SMILE
I'D EVER SEEN.

283
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,250
YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I KNOW
WHY SHE SMILED SO PRETTY.

284
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,333
SHE SMILED SO PRETTY BECAUSE OF
YOU, BECAUSE SHE'D MET YOU, RIN.

285
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,333
- YOU THINK SO, HUH?

286
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,875
- ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

287
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,166
- WHAT THE HECK
HAVE I BEEN DOING?

288
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,541
I NEED TO BE THERE RIGHT NOW
FOR PRIMULA.

289
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,958
- YEAH.

290
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,708
- SITTING HERE ALL DEPRESSED
ISN'T DOING ANY GOOD.

291
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,666
WHAT THE HELL HAVE I BEEN DOING?

292
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,375
IF I WANNA SEE HER,
I CAN JUST DO THAT.

293
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,500
- THAT'S TRUE.

294
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,291
- I CAN'T SIT HERE.
I GOTTA GO AND SEE HER.

295
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,583
PRIMULA IS PART OF MY FAMILY.

296
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,458
- I BET SHE'S THERE WAITING.

297
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,666
- RIGHT. LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY

298
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,041
TO COME AND FIND ME.

299
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,875
THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

300
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,791
- WHAT'S A FRIEND FOR?

301
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,916
RIGHT?

302
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,916
- RIGHT.

303
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,625
- Sia: YOU'RE GONNA GO SEE RIMU?
- YES. THAT'S WHAT I'VE DECIDED.

304
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,458
- HOLD ON JUST A SECOND, RIN.

305
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,333
RIMU IS REALLY SICK
AND I THINK THAT...

306
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,750
- I KNOW THAT.

307
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,583
I ALSO KNOW WHAT CAUSED
THE SICKNESS TO HAPPEN

308
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,291
AND THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE CURE.

309
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,458
AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO BE
THERE FOR HER.

310
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,750
- BUT, IF SHE CONTINUES
HER TREATMENT

311
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,333
FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER,

312
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,708
THEY SAY THAT
SHE MIGHT GET BETTER.

313
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,750
- THAT'S RIGHT. I
THINK THE BEST THING TO DO

314
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,916
IS TO WAIT A LITTLE
LONGER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

315
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,250
- I'M NOT GOING TO ABANDON
A FAMILY MEMBER.

316
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,458
KAEDE?

317
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,208
- I DON'T KNOW.

318
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,875
- I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW.

319
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,250
BUT SEEING PRIMULA
JUST WOULDN'T BE...

320
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,916
- KAEDE, TELL ME.

321
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,750
- JUST LISTEN, RIN.

322
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,375
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT
RUSHING INTO THIS IS VERY SMART.

323
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,500
- SHE'S EXACTLY RIGHT,
LET'S NOT PUSH IT.

324
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,208
- AND YOU CALL YOURSELVES
POTENTIAL GIRLFRIENDS FOR RIN?

325
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,833
YOU'D HAVE TO BE
BLIND NOT TO NOTICE

326
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,291
HOW MUCH RIN'S BEEN SUFFERING.

327
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,000
THE WAY HE'S BEEN AGONIZING
AND HURTING OVER THIS.

328
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,333
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO PROTECT
SOMEONE PRECIOUS TO HIM

329
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,583
AND HE COULDN'T.

330
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,750
THINKING THERE WAS NOTHING
HE COULD DO.

331
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,416
HE WAS COMPLETELY
AND TOTALLY DESTROYED.

332
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,416
YOU DON'T GET IT. DON'T YOU SEE
THAT HE'S NOT HIMSELF.

333
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,583
HE'S NOT HIMSELF AT ALL.

334
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,708
- YOU SEE, ASA FINALLY
SLAPPED SOME SENSE INTO ME

335
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,125
AND MADE ME THINK.

336
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,125
WAITING ISN'T
GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING.

337
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,708
IF I DON'T TAKE THE INITIATIVE,

338
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,500
I WON'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT
THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT.

339
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,208
I'M GOING.
I JUST DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

340
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,291
- THEN GO.

341
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:05,125
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
- WOW, SIA, THANKS.

342
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,333
- I'M COMING, TOO. I WANNA
GO WITH YOU TO SEE RIMU.

343
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,041
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, KAEDE.

344
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,166
- I...

345
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,416
I... NO.

346
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,791
I DON'T EVER WANNA LOSE A PERSON
I CARE ABOUT AGAIN. NOT EVER.

347
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,625
- NERINE.
- NO. WAIT.

348
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,833
- DO SOMETHING.
- RIGHT.

349
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,541
- Nerine: ♪ BUT I KNOW IT
IN MY HEART SOMEHOW ♪

350
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,458
♪ THAT YOU'LL

351
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,958

353
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:46,750
- NERINE.

354
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,458
- I SING THESE WORDS ALTHOUGH
THE SONG ITSELF IS NOT MY OWN.

355
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,916
- ( theme song playing )

356
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

357
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,500
- Rin: THAT BEAUTIFUL SMILE IS

358
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:39,458
ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR
FROM PRIMULA'S FACE.

359
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:40,958
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
THAT I CAN DO TO HELP HER.

360
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,166
- Nerine: I SING THESE WORDS

361
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,750
ALTHOUGH THE SONG
ITSELF IS NOT MY OWN.

362
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,250
IT BELONGS TO MY...

363
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,416
- Kaede: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE.
EPISODE 14 - "LYCORIS."

364
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,791
- Nerine: I ROBBED HER OF
EVERYTHING THAT SHE EVER WAS.
