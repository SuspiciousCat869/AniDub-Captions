I HOPE YOU SLEPT WELL.

SO, WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE SO EARLY?

I MAKE DAD FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

STEAK? PORK CHOPS? CHICKEN?

ARE THE LUCKIEST ONES TO WEAR?

LIKE GOD HIMSELF IS TELLING ME
I SHOULD GO ON A DATE WITH HIM.

79

PLACE AT THE TABLE FOR YOU?

- IS THAT OKAY?
- HUH?

88
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,458
- RIN, DATING?

89
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,875
- OF COURSE.

90
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,791

DIDN'T HE?

91

IT'S JUST GOING TO BE

YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT.

95

YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE!

96
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,750
- WELL, NERINE BELIEVED
THE BEST STRATEGY WAS

97
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,458
TO TAKE HER TIME
BEFORE MOVING.

98
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,250
CHECK.

99
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,833
- HMM.

100
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,958
IF YOU ASK ME, KIDS TODAY
NEED TO TAKE MORE CHANCES.

101
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,416
MAKE A RASH DECISION
ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU KNOW?

102
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,291
WHAT'S THE WORST
THING THAT CAN HAPPEN?

103
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,458
( exclaims ) DAMN! A JOKER!

104
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,916
- MY DAUGHTER CAN BE
A LITTLE SHY AT TIMES.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,166
SHE'S NOT THE TYPE TO
LAUNCH A PRE EMPTIVE STRIKE.

106
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,166
HEY! DIRECT HIT ON YOUR
TIGER'S FRONTAL ARMOR!

107
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,458
WAIT, THAT SHOT
GOT DEFLECTED.

108
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,000
- ( laughs )

109
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,541
YOU'RE ABOUT AS UNLUCKY AS
YOUR DAUGHTER RIGHT NOW!

110
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,708
SHE'LL NEVER WIN RIN'S
HEART BY HOLDING BACK!

111
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,333
ONE AWAY!

112
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,375
- NOW, WAIT!
- I DON'T THINK SO!

113
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,958
WAITING IS FOR WIMPS!

114
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,708
COMPETITION CAN BE PRETTY
HARSH, CAN'T IT, MABOU?

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,083
- IS THAT SO?

116
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,375
WELL, THEN.
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

117
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,333
READ 'EM AND WEEP, OLD FRIEND.

118
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,750
- ( grunts )

119
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,375
- DONE! FROM ONE AWAY,
ALL SIMPLES, WITH TWO DORAS,

120
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,875
A CRITICAL ROYAL
STRAIGHT FLUSH, TURBO R!

121
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,833
NOW THAT'S A CRITICAL HAND!

122
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,458
- NO, WAIT! PLEASE!

123
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,250
- COMPETITION CAN BE
PRETTY HARSH, CAN'T IT?

124
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,583
- DAMMIT! I KNEW I NEVER
SHOULD HAVE SOLD YOU THOSE

125
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,958
TWO HIGH DOLLAR HOTEL
PROPERTIES DURING THE GAME!

126
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,500
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

127
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,916
- OKAY. SO, WHERE IS IT
THAT WE'RE GOING?

128
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,625
- I DON'T KNOW, EXACTLY.
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO?

129
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,875
- HMM. I WISH I'D KNOWN
WE WERE GOING OUT,

130
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,500
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF SOMETHING. I'M SORRY.

131
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,916
- THAT'S OKAY. I KNOW OF A
FEW PLACES AROUND HERE,

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,541
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

133
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:09,291
- SURE. I'M INTERESTED.
- OKAY.

134
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,666
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
PLANNING OUT THE PERFECT DATE.

135
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,416
TODAY, I'M GOING TO USE
THOSE PLANS TO MOVE

136
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,208
OUR RELATIONSHIP
TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

137
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,750
NO WAY AM I GOING
TO LET THIS END

138
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,541
WITH US JUST BEING GOOD FRIENDS!

139
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,916
I KNOW!
LET'S GO TO KOMOREBI STREET!

140
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,541
FIRST, WE'LL START OFF
AT A FAMILIAR PLACE,

141
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,541
AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ONTO NEW,
EXCITING SPOTS, AND FINALLY,

142
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:33,416
WE'LL TOP IT OFF WITH A ROMANTIC
EVENING OF DINNER AND MUSIC!

143
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,291
I COULDN'T ASK FOR A
BETTER DREAM DATE!

144
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,500
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

145
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,750
DO YOU WANT TO STOP
IN HERE FOR A BIT?

146
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,125
- ARE YOU SURE?

147
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DO YOU NOT LIKE KARAOKE?

148
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,500
- NO, IT'S...

149
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,916
IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T
KNOW MANY SONGS. THAT'S ALL.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,750
- HEY, DON'T WORRY! IT'S EASY!

151
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:50,875
I'LL HELP YOU LEARN SOME

152
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,083
AND THEN WE CAN RECORD
A DUET TOGETHER!

153
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,458
AND I GET TO BE ALONE WITH
YOU IN A TINY, LITTLE BOOTH!

154
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,208
I'M SO EXCITED!

155
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,208
- WE NEED TWO STUDENT

00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,875
- ( girl singing )

157
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,083
- THAT'S ONE LOUD
SINGER YOU GOT THERE.

158
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,916
- THAT VOICE. IT ACTUALLY
SOUNDS KIND OF FAMILIAR.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,541
- ( loud singing continues )

160
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,583
- EXCUSE ME, MISS?

161
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,333
COULD YOU TURN DOWN THE
VOLUME A LITTLE, PLEASE?

162
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,541
YOUR SINGING IS A BIT LOUD.

163
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,000
- WHAT? IS THAT YOUR POLITE
LITTLE WAY OF TELLING ME

164
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,375
YOU THINK MY VOICE SUCKS?

165
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,500
- Rin: MAYUMI?

166
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,958
- HEY, LOOK! IT'S RIN AND SIA!
DID YOU GUYS HEAR HER?

167
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,666
THAT ATTENDANT WOULDN'T KNOW
TALENT IF IT BIT HER ON THE...

168
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,291
WAIT, YOU TWO CAME HERE
TOGETHER, DIDN'T YOU?

169
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,541
AND I KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, RIN!

170
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,541
YOU'RE ON A DATE
WITH SIA, AREN'T YOU?

171
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,875
- WHAT A SCOOP!

172
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,958
ALL RIN'S GIRLFRIENDS HAVE
BEEN IN A TIGHT RACE,

173
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,083
BUT SIA'S MANAGED TO PULL AHEAD

174
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,166
AND LEAVE THE REST
OF 'EM IN HER DUST!

175
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,125
I'VE GOTTA CAPTURE
THIS HISTORIC MOMENT!

176
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,416
- STOP, YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING ME, MAYUMI!

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,166
( exclaims )

178
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,750
- COME ON!

179
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,791
- I WAS JUST KIDDING!
I WASN'T REALLY EMBARRASSED!

180
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,000
- GREAT.

181
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,458
- ( both panting )

182
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,583
- OH, MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE RAN INTO MAYUMI THERE.

183
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,583
- I'M GOING TO DIE. I WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR DUET.

184
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,000
- ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

185
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,083
- NOTHING! I'M GREAT, THANKS.

186
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,958
HEY, WHY DON'T WE
JUST GO SOMEPLACE ELSE?

187
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,625
- Rin: A THRIFT STORE?
- YEP.

188
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,583
THERE WERE SOME CLOTHES
HERE I WANTED TO CHECK OUT.

189
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,125
WELL, RIN?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

190
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,000
- HEY, THAT WOULD
LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

191
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,875
- REALLY? GREAT, BECAUSE
THERE'S ONE FOR YOU, TOO!

192
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,916
- UH, MATCHING OUTFITS?

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,541
- WOW! I JUST KNEW IT WOULD
BE A PERFECT LOOK FOR YOU!

194
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,916
- UH, YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

195
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,875
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

196
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,708
I MEAN, WOULDN'T IT
KINDA LOOK LIKE WE...

197
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,166
- SHOULD WE BUY THESE?
- Itsuki: YOU DOG!

198
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,416
- YOU'RE ALREADY DATING?

199
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,125
YOU DON'T WASTE ANY
TIME, DO YOU RIN?

200
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,750
- ITSUKI!

201
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,000
- YOU'RE MOVING WAY
FASTER THAN I THOUGHT.

202
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,000
AND IF YOU TWO ARE
BUYING MATCHING OUTFITS,

203
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,958
THEN I GUESS YOU'VE
SETTLED ON SIA, HUH?

204
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,666
- PLEASE. I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

205
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,291
- SURE YOU DO, BUDDY. AND DON'T
WORRY ABOUT NERINE AND KAEDE.

206
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,625
THERE'S PLENTY OF ME TO GO
AROUND FOR THE BOTH OF 'EM.

207
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,291
- Nerine: I DON'T THINK SO.
- Sia: NERINE!

208
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,125
- MY HEART DOES BELONG
TO RIN, YOU KNOW THAT.

209
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,875
SIA, DID YOU AND RIN
COME HERE TOGETHER?

210
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,583
- UH...
- HMM...

211
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,041
- ( laughs nervously )

212
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,958
WELL, I...
WE GOTTA GO, RIN!

213
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,625
- UH, OKAY!

214
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,333
- I'M SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK
OUT FOR THE TWO OF YOU GUYS.

215
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,291
- YEAH. I WAS HOPING
THE THREE OF US

216
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,541
COULD ALL LOOK
LIKE TRIPLETS.

217
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,583
- HUH?

218
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,375
- Sia: WHY DOES THIS
KEEP HAPPENING TO US?

219
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,583
KEEP TRYING, SIA! DON'T GIVE UP!

220
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,208
- HI, THERE. I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU ALL THIS TIME

221
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,416
BECAUSE I...
WELL, BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!

222
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,625
AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME,

223
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,833
THEN, YOU SHOULD COME
PLAY A GAME WITH ME!

224
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,583
- WOW, SIA. I NEVER FIGURED
YOU WOULD BE A GAME FAN.

225
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,708
- WELL, I'M NOT, ACTUALLY.

226
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,000
- THEN WHY DID WE COME HERE?

227
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,416
- BECAUSE, I WANTED
TO DO THAT WITH YOU.

228
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,333
- OH. THE PHOTO BOOTH?

229
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,583
- WHAT'S THAT?
- PRIMULA?

230
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,458
- BROWN BALL.

231
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,416
- OH, DO YOU WANT ONE OF THOSE?
- RIMA.

232
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,666
- KAEDE.
- HEY, RIN.

233
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,208
- SHOPPING?
- YEAH.

234
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,083
- GREAT.

235
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,791
- WELL, I GUESS WE
SHOULD BE GOING NOW.

236
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,166
- WHAT FOR?

237
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,041
- WE'VE GOTTA GO,
TOO. RIGHT, SIA? BYE.

238
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,291
WE KEEP RUNNING
INTO PEOPLE WE KNOW.

239
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,000
THIS TOWN IS SMALLER
THAN I THOUGHT.

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
- SO MUCH FOR MY PLANS
FOR THE PERFECT DREAM DATE!

241
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,958
WAIT! I CAN'T GET
DISCOURAGED NOW!

242
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,708
MY PLAN ISN'T EVEN
HALFWAY OVER! I CAN SAVE IT!

243
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,333
HEY, RIN? WE WERE RUNNING A
LOT. ARE YOU THIRSTY AT ALL?

244
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,208
( mumbling )

245
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,291
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING! I'M GREAT!

246
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,333
- OKAY. SO, DID YOU
DECIDE ON SOMETHING?

247
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,583
- WHAT? UH, UM, WELL...

248
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,083
NO, NOT YET. BUT,
DO YOU LIKE FRUITY DRINKS?

249
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,166
I BET YOU DON'T.
BECAUSE YOU'RE A GUY AND ALL.

250
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,750
- FRUITY? NOT REALLY.

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,750
- WELL, DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION

252
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,000
JUST FOR TODAY.

253
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,083
BECAUSE I'D REALLY LIKE
TO ORDER THIS WITH YOU.

254
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:23,666
- OH, I GUESS NOT.
- WHAT? NO, I MEANT...

255
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,416
SURE. WHY NOT?
LET'S GET ONE OF THOSE.

256
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
- OKAY!

257
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,500
- EXCUSE ME, MISS. WE'D

258
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,583
- SO, TELL ME,
WHAT'LL IT BE TODAY, FOLKS?

259
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,125
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

260
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,833
- I WAS ABOUT TO
SAY THE SAME THING.

261
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,375
OH, MY GOSH!
ARE YOU TWO ON A DATE?

262
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,541
( gasps )

263
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,666
OOH LA LA!

264
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,416
YOU TWO ARE ORDERING THE
LOVEY DOVEY TROPICAL JUICE

265
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,125
FOR TWO AND YOU'RE
GOING TO SHARE IT?

266
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,416
I GUESS YOU REALLY
ARE ON A DATE!

267
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,291
YOU KNOW, IT'S ONLY RIGHT
THAT I WARN YOU GUYS.

268
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,958
MOST COUPLES WHO
ORDER THAT DRINK END UP

269
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,583
SMOOCHING LIKE
CRAZY AFTERWARDS!

270
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,291
OOH LA LA!

271
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,708
- THERE SHE GOES.
OH, PLEASE, NOT TODAY!

272
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,208
- Rin: YEAH.

273
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,500
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST ORDER
SOME NORMAL DRINKS, YOU KNOW?

274
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,458
- OKAY, IF YOU SAY SO.

275
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,250
I THOUGHT MY LUCK
WAS GOING TO IMPROVE

276
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,208
SO THAT MY LOVE WOULD COME TRUE.

277
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,916
MAYBE MY HOROSCOPE WAS WRONG.

278
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,166
- ( screams )

279
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,750
- LADY, YOU GOT STRIPES!

280
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,291
- OH, MY!
THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE!

281
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,583
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET
YOUR WAITRESS'S ATTENTION!

282
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,791
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP THAT RIGHT NOW! LET GO!

283
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,958
- SO, DO YOU LIKE PANTIES LIKE
THAT? THE KIND WITH STRIPES?

284
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,625
- WHO? ME? WELL, I... NO!

285
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,125
- ( grunting )

286
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,125
- YEAH.
- GREAT!

287
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,666
UH, I MEANT IT'S GREAT
YOU'RE SO HONEST!

288
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,125
SO HE DOES LIKE STRIPES!

289
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,333
ALRIGHT! JUST KEEP UP THE
GOOD WORK, LUCKY PANTIES!

290
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,416
- Sia: SO FAR THE PLAN'S
BEEN DERAILED A LITTLE,

291
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,166
BUT HOPEFULLY IT'LL
GET BACK ON TRACK

292
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,958
ONCE WE GET INTO
THE NEXT TOWN.

293
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,250
WE WON'T RUN INTO
ANYONE WE KNOW THERE.

294
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,250
THINK POSITIVE! THE DAY IS
YOUNG AND THERE ARE PLENTY

295
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,083
OF OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE OUR
RELATIONSHIP TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

296
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,916
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT
THING YOU KEEP LOOKING AT?

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
- HUH? OH, THIS? IT'S NOTHING.
- OKAY.

298
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,333
- ANYWAY, THAT REMINDS ME.

299
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,250
IT WAS ON A TRAIN,
LIKE THIS, WASN'T IT?

300
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,958
- HUH?

301
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,958
- YOU KNOW,
WHERE YOU AND I FIRST MET.

302
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,833
- YEAH. EIGHT YEARS AGO, RIGHT?

303
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,750
THAT WAS WHEN MY FATHER
CAME TO THIS WORLD ON

304
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,333
A BUSINESS TRIP AND
HE HAD TO TAKE ME WITH HIM.

305
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,833
I GOT ON A TRAIN BY
MYSELF AND GOT LOST.

306
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,708
I WAS ABOUT TO START CRYING,
BUT THEN YOU CAME ALONG

307
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,083
AND PLAYED WITH ME AND
MADE ME FEEL BETTER, REMEMBER?

308
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,875
- YEAH, I DO.

309
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,208
- MY DAD GOT SO WORRIED
THAT HE TURNED PALE.

310
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,625
HE SAID IF I HADN'T TURNED UP,

311
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,791
HE WOULD HAVE STARTED
A WAR, THE GOOF!

312
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,666
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
GOOFY ABOUT THAT.

313
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,958
- ( both laugh )

314
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,666
- BY ANY CHANCE ARE
YOU HUNGRY AT ALL?

315
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,958
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

316
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,125
THERE'S A RESTAURANT HERE

317
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,416
THAT'S GOTTEN SOME
REALLY GREAT REVIEWS!

318
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,875
- Man: THE LINE
STARTS OVER HERE!

319
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,625
- WOW, IT'S LONG.
- HEY, DON'T WORRY!

320
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,291
I KNOW ANOTHER DELICIOUS
PLACE THAT'S A FEW BLOCKS AWAY!

321
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,583
- IT'S CLOSED.
- MAYBE THIS WASN'T IT.

322
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,125
BUT I KNOW ANOTHER ONE
THAT'S EVEN BETTER. TRUST ME!

323
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,500
( exclaims )

324
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,500
- Rin: OUT OF BUSINESS

325
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,708
- ( groans ) WELL, SO MUCH FOR
MY PLAN, MY BACK UP PLAN,

326
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:09,041
AND EVEN MY "BACK UP"
BACK UP PLAN. OH, DEAR!

327
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,541
- HEY. WE DID PASS A FAMILY
RESTAURANT ON THE WAY OVER HERE.

328
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,916
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE CHECK IT OUT?

329
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,125
- Sia: DAMN IT!

330
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,125
I GUESS THESE LUCKY PANTIES
AREN'T SO LUCKY.

331
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,125
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

332
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,791
WAIT! I STILL HAVE ONE MORE
CHANCE TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT!

333
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,333
- SO WHERE ARE
WE OFF TO NEXT?

334
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,875
- IT'S TOP SECRET!

335
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,000
- ( laughs )

336
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,458
- ( crying )

337
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,750
- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

338
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,708
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

339
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,291
GOT LOST, HUH?

340
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,333
UP! HOW'S THIS?
CAN YOU SEE HER NOW?

341
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,291
- UH, I CAN'T.

342
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,708
- Rin: WHAT ABOUT
FROM OVER HERE?

343
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,041
- Masato: NO.

344
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,750
- YOU READY?
- YEAH!

345
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,958
- ( Masato laughs )

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,958
- NICE ONE.

347
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,041
- COME ON! HURRY UP!
- I'M COMING!

348
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,583
- THAT'S IT.
NO MORE COMPLAINING.

349
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,666
THIS IS THE RIN THAT I LOVE.

350
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,500
PLUS, WE'LL NEVER
MAKE IT IN TIME.

351
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,083
- READY, SET. GO!

352
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,875
- HEY, WAIT!
I WANT TO TRY IT, TOO!

353
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,583
CAN I SLIDE WITH
YOU THIS TIME?

354
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,625
- Masato: SURE!

355
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,916
- MASATO!

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,041
- MOMMY!

357
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,125
- HONEY, I'M SO SORRY!

358
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,541
- MOMMY!
- ARE YOU OKAY?

359
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,625
- Masato: YEAH!

360
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,958
- ( both chuckle )

361
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,750
- TOP-SECRET DATE PLAN.

362
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,916
- THE FIRST STEP TOWARD
BECOMING HIS WIFE.

363
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,750
THE LUCKY PANTIES
WILL BE STRIPED,

364
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,625
THE FINALE WILL BE A ROMANTIC
DINNER AT THE HOTEL!

365
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,791
I LOVE RIN!

366
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,291
- SIA.

367
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,125
- Sia: AW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE HOME ALREADY.

368
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,083
WELL, ANYWAY.
I HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME.

369
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,500
THANKS FOR GOING
OUT WITH ME, RIN.

370
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,791
- SURE.

371
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,458
- ASKING YOU OUT ON
THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT

372
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,833
DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL, DID IT?

373
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,000
IT'LL BE BETTER NEXT TIME,
I SWEAR!

374
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,291
- LET'S NOT WAIT
FOR NEXT TIME.

375
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,833
LET'S HANG OUT A LITTLE BIT
LONGER. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

376
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,250
- OKAY!

377
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,625
- Sia: YOU WEREN'T KIDDING.

378
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,041
THE CLASSROOM IS A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PLACE AT NIGHT.

379
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,166
THE MOON IS SO PRETTY.

380
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,458
- Rin: THIS IS THE
QUIETEST PLACE.

381
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,875
- THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
IT'S USUALLY THE NOISIEST.

382
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,916
- BY THE WAY, I ALMOST
FORGOT. YOU DROPPED THIS.

383
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:56,833
- ( gasps )

384
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,750
OH, MY GOSH, YOU DIDN'T
READ ANY OF THIS, DID YOU?

385
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,291
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T.

386
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,458
- WELL...

387
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,250
HEY, TODAY WAS FUN, WASN'T IT?
EVEN WITH ALL THAT CRAZY STUFF.

388
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,250
- MMM-HMM.

389
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,708
- ( theme song playing )

390
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

391
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:06,833
- Rin: THE AC BROKE DOWN!

392
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,291
- Kaede: AND THE REPAIR
SHOP'S CLOSED TODAY.

393
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,291
- Sia: DON'T WORRY, RIN!
LEAVE IT TO ME!

394
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,500
HIT IT LIKE THIS,
FROM A 45 DEGREE ANGLE!

395
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,375
- Primula: NEXT TIME,
ON SHUFFLE! EPISODE 9,

396
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,083
"SURVIVAL SWIMMING
AT THE BEACH."

397
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,583
- Sia: THE AC IS SMOKING.

398
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,541
- Primula: HIT IT FROM
A 60 DEGREE ANGLE.

399
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,583
- Rin: NO!
