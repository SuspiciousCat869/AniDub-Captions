1
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,625
- ( alarm ringing )

2
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,791
- HMM.

3
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:28,958
- GOOD MORNING, RIN.

4
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,166
- ( giggles ) COME ON,
IT'S TIME TO GET UP NOW.

5
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,875
- AW, GIVE ME A BREAK.

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,250
- IT'S EARLY STILL.

7
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,625
- JUST LET ME SLEEP A LITTLE
BIT LONGER, PLEASE?

8
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,708
- BUT RIN, YOU WANT TO
BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN

9
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,583
AND ENJOY YOUR FOOD, RIGHT?

10
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,750
THERE'S HOT MISO SOUP
WAITING FOR YOU,

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,583
WITH MUSHROOMS,
JUST LIKE YOU LIKE IT.

12
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,833
- SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS? BECAUSE
THOSE ARE THE ONES I LIKE.

13
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,833
- SILLY, WHICH OTHER ONES
ARE THERE?

14
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,458
- AND THOSE LITTLE GREEN ONIONS?
YOU KNOW I LIKE GREEN ONIONS.

15
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,291
- ( chuckles )
HOW COULD I FORGET?

16
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,250
- HMM.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,833
- HOW DO YOU DO IT, KAEDE?

18
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,791
I MEAN, YOU NEVER FORGET
A THING, DO YOU?

19
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,416
- ( giggles )
NOT WHEN IT COMES TO YOU.

20
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,500
ANYWAY, BREAKFAST IS READY
AND WAITING FOR YOU, OKAY?

21
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,000
SO, COME DOWN
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

22
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,291
- HARD TO BELIEVE
WE'RE THE SAME AGE.

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,250
SO, THIS IS ME.
I'M RIN TSUCHIMI.

24
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:43,250
I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH KAEDE
FUYOU FOR EIGHT YEARS NOW.

25
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,375
BOTH MY PARENTS PASSED
AWAY IN AN ACCIDENT,

26
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,291
ALONG WITH KAEDE'S MOTHER.

27
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,875
SINCE THEN, KAEDE HAS PRETTY
MUCH TAKEN CARE OF ME.

28
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,916
ALTHOUGH, SINCE I
STAY HERE RENT FREE,

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,083
I SHOULD REALLY BE
DOING ALL THE WORK.

30
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,250
- HERE YOU GO, RIN.
JUST LIKE I PROMISED.

31
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,750
- OH, THANKS.

32
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,250
- UH, HEY, KAEDE, I KNOW
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE

33
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,250
BUT WE COULD JUST HAVE TOAST.

34
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,208
- OKAY. I'LL MAKE
TOAST TOMORROW.

35
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,000
LET'S SEE, WHAT'S
GOOD WITH TOAST.

36
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,916
- AH, WE CAN HAVE EGGS,
AND BACON, AND MAYBE...

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,833
- NO, NO. I MEAN...
- HMM?

38
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,875
- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LOT
OF WORK TO COOK ALL THIS

39
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,916
EVERY MORNING, THAT'S ALL.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,958
- OH, NO, NOT AT ALL. I REALLY
LOVE TAKING CARE OF YOU, RIN.

41
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,041
IT'S WHAT I ENJOY
DOING THE MOST.

42
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:32,958
DOES THAT BOTHER YOU?

43
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,041
- OH, NO. I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

44
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,500
- ( chuckles )
GOOD, WANT SOME TEA?

45
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,416
- HERE YOU GO. DON'T
FORGET ABOUT YOUR LUNCH.

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,916
- OH, THANKS.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,875
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE'S YOUR LUNCH?

48
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,791
- ( gasps ) OH, NO,
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT.

49
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,958
- HUH, ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT ME INSTEAD OF HERSELF.

50
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,291
- I FEEL SO STUPID.
THANKS FOR WAITING.

51
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,208
- NO PROB. HEY LOOK, I GUESS
THE SATOHS ARE MOVING OUT.

52
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,666
- YEAH, THE TANAKAS,
THE YAMAMOTOS,

53
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,708
AND THE UESUGIS MOVED OUT, TOO.

54
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,625
SO DID THE GOSHOGAWARAS.

55
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,333
- THAT'LL MAKE EIGHT NEIGHBORS
ON BOTH SIDES OF US, WON'T IT?

56
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,791
- YOU THINK MAYBE WE'VE DONE
SOMETHING TO PISS THEM ALL OFF?

57
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,250
- HUH?

58
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,625
- IS YOUR DAD GONNA BE GONE
FOR A VERY LONG THIS TIME?

59
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,083
- HIS BUSINESS TRIPS ARE
GETTING OUT OF HAND.

60
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,541
- YEAH, I KNOW, RIGHT.

61
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,625
- HE SAID HE COULD BE GONE

62
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,333
FOR AS LONG AS
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS.

63
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,083
- DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD?

64
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,708
I MEAN LEAVING A YOUNG
MAN AND A YOUNG GIRL

65
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,833
IN A BIG HOUSE
ALONE ALL THAT TIME?

66
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,916
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE, IT JUST
SHOWS THAT HE TRUSTS YOU.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,541
- ( chuckles ) YOU THINK?

68
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,083
- 'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
WHEN HE WAS LEAVING,

69
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,625
HE DID TELL ME I
OUGHT TO 'GO FOR IT',

70
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,208
SINCE I HAVE HIS APPROVAL.

71
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,416
- ( gasps )

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,041
- I THINK HE SHOULD BE
PUTTING MORE THOUGHT

73
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,250
INTO HIS DAUGHTER'S FUTURE.

74
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,166
ISN'T HE AFRAID GUYS
ARE GONNA BE INTIMIDATED

75
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,625
BY OUR RELATIONSHIP?

76
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,750
I MEAN, DOESN'T HE
WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY?

77
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,791
- I THINK MAYBE DADDY MIGHT
BE THINKING THE SAME THING

78
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,333
ABOUT MY FUTURE THAT I AM.

79
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:07,666
- HUH?
- OH, UH, NOTHING.

80
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,791
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU, RIN.

81
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,458
I'M MAGNUM SAKAI, OF
KAEDE'S PERSONAL GUARD,

82
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,541
THE KNIGHTS OF KISSY KAEDE
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE KKK.

83
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,333
UH, NOT THE MEAN GUYS
WITH THE SHEETS.

84
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,541
- ( whimpers )

85
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,625
- WAIT, YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL?
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

86
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:28,250
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH, RIN TSUCHIMI.

87
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,291
I HEREBY CHALLENGE YOU
TO A DUEL FOR MISS FUYOU'S LOVE.

88
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,208
- WOW, WHAT A CHARMER.

89
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,333
SO, "MISS FUYOU," HOW DOES IT
FEEL BEING TURNED INTO A PRIZE?

90
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,666
- ( laughs awkwardly )
UH, I...

91
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,125
- NOW, YOU DIE!

92
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,833
- ( screams )

93
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,208
- YOU CAN'T, I'VE ALREADY GIVEN
MY WHOLE BODY AND SOUL TO RIN.

94
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,541
- ( cries )

95
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,125
- I'M SO SORRY, RIN.

96
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,083
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN
THAT LIKE IT SOUNDED.

97
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,416
- UH, KAEDE, LET'S JUST GO.

98
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,291
- ( cries )

99
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,666
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

100
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,916
- ( panting )

101
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,625
- I GUESS WE FINALLY LOST THEM.

102
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,125
- THANK GOODNESS.

103
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,458
I'M SO GLAD THERE WERE ONLY
A FEW GROUPIES OUT TODAY.

104
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,708
- THEY DO THIS EVERY
SINGLE MORNING.

105
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,125
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO GET
THE HINT AND LEAVE US ALONE.

106
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,541
- HUH. OH MY GOSH, UH, RIN?

107
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:38,791
- HUH? OH, I'M SORRY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

108
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,041
- ( grunts )

109
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,791
- HELLO.

110
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,333
GOOD MORNING, RIN.

111
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,125
- SO, HOW ARE YOU DOING
THIS MORNING, ASA?

112
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,458
- YOU WALKED TO SCHOOL
TOGETHER AGAIN, HUH?

113
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,333
DOES THIS MEAN YOU TWO
ARE LOVEBIRDS, TELL ME.

114
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:02,333
- HUH? DID YOU JUST ATTACK ME
OUT OF A SUDDEN FIT OF JEALOUSY?

115
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,708
- YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL RIN.
US GIRLS HAVE FRAGILE HEARTS,

116
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,375
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO STRING HER ALONG.

117
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,833
UNLESS YOU REALLY
DO LIKE HER, WELL?

118
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,958
- DON'T BE SILLY ASA. BY THE
WAY, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BE

119
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,083
A LITTLE MORE GENTLE WITH
ME FROM NOW ON, PLEASE.

120
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,750
- OKAY. IS THIS GENTLE
ENOUGH FOR YOU?

121
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,958
- AH. STOP IT, ASA.

122
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,416
- I BET YOU'LL BE DREAMING
ABOUT THIS TONIGHT, WON'T YOU?

123
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
- WOULD YOU KNOCK
IT OFF, PLEASE?

124
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,416
- ( laughs ) JUST KIDDING.

125
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,708
- MAN, I REALLY WISH
SHE'D STOP TEASING.

126
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,750
I MEAN, SHE'S EMBARRASSING ME.

127
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,708
- DO YOU REALLY
THINK I'M TEASING?

128
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:36,541
- HUH?

129
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,791
- DON'T MISS ME TOO MUCH.

130
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,791
- CRAZY GIRL. SHE REALLY KNOWS
HOW TO MESS WITH A GUY'S BRAIN.

131
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,000
- IT'S ALL THAT ENERGY SHE JUST
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

132
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,458
- SHE SURE WEARS ME OUT.

133
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,375
- ( students chattering )

134
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,125
- KAEDE.

135
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,500
- ( grunts )

136
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,500
- KAEDE! COME INTO MY BOSOM.

137
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:12,666
- ITSUKI, UM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO RIN?

138
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,583
- WELCOME TO MY FISTS, ITSUKI.

139
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,625
- UH, I DON'T LIKE YOU
LIKE THAT, MAN.

140
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,416
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEARN
TO LEAVE KAEDE ALONE.

141
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,250
- COME ON. I CAN'T HELP IT

142
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,500
I CAN'T DEPRIVE MYSELF
OF KAEDE'S LOVE, RIGHT?

143
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,458
- WHY ARE YOU SO STUCK ON KAEDE?
THERE ARE OTHER GIRLS, YOU KNOW.

144
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,125
TAKE MAYUMI FOR INSTANCE.

145
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,750
- AW, I GOTTA HAVE
SOMETHING TO GRAB ON TO,

146
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,958
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

147
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,458
- ( chuckles )
MAYUMI IS TOO FLAT CHESTED.

148
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,458
- UGH. WHATEVER.

149
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,333
- ( giggles ) IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU, MAYUMI.

150
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,750
- HI, KAEDE.

151
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,458
- THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING FLAT CHESTED, OKAY?

152
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,708
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

153
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,583
THERE ARE LOTS OF GUYS
WHO ACTUALLY PREFER IT.

154
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,916
- YEAH, THAT'S ONLY A
TINY PERCENTAGE OF GUYS,

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,458
AND YOU KNOW IT.

156
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,208
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
NO ONE WANTS D CUPS ANYMORE.

157
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:04,708
NOT D, NOT C, NOT B. IT'S
ABOUT WHAT FITS IN YOUR HAND.

158
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,916
- UM, THAT'S REALLY
EMBARRASSING.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,416
- DOES IT FEEL LIKE
KIND OF LIKE A BOARD?

160
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,791
- UGH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

161
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,666
GUYS WHO CAN'T WAIT
TO HUG EACH OTHER,

162
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,208
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
REALLY SHOULDN'T TALK.

163
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,625
- DON'T GET IDEAS. THAT WASN'T
WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE?

164
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,541
- NOW WAIT JUST A MINUTE
THERE, SUGAR LUMPS.

165
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,333
SEE, MY PRIORITY
IN LIFE IS GIRLS,

166
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,625
FOLLOWED BY FEMALES,
LADIES, WOMEN AND BABES.

167
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,416
THE GIRLS ARE WHAT
I ABSOLUTELY LIVE AND DIE FOR.

168
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,458
- LISTEN TO HIM, WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO LOCK HIM UP

169
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,166
IF THIS TRANSFER
STUDENT IS A GIRL.

170
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,500
- OH. THAT'S RIGHT,

171
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,750
I THINK I'VE HEARD SOME
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THAT.

172
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,458
- IS THE STUDENT HERE ALREADY?

173
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,625
- NO. I'M NOT SURE OF
ALL THE DETAILS YET,

174
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,416
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
GONNA BE HERE TOMORROW.

175
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,458
- I WONDER WHAT KIND
OF PERSON THEY'LL BE.

176
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,958
- CONSIDERING THE WAY
IT'S BEEN LATELY,

177
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,458
I'M GUESSING EITHER
A DEMON OR A GOD.

178
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,833
- THE TRANSFER STUDENT
WILL BE A VERY PRETTY GIRL.

179
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,333
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

180
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,583
- IT'S IN THE AIR. I CAN SMELL
"PRETTY" FROM A MILE AWAY.

181
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,208
MY NOSE HAS NEVER
BEEN WRONG BEFORE.

182
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,625
- YOU HAVE A VERY WEIRD NOSE
KIND OF LIKE THE REST OF YOU.

183
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,166
- YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

184
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,208
- ITSUKI'S SENSE OF
SMELL IS RIGHT ON TARGET

185
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,166
WHEN IT COMES TO GIRLS.

186
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,166
- WHAT DOES IT EVEN MATTER
WHETHER IT'S A GUY OR A GIRL?

187
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,166
- YOU'RE REALLY NOT INTERESTED?

188
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,500
OH, WELL YOU'VE
ALREADY GOT KAEDE

189
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,333
SO I GUESS IT'S NOT
ALL THAT SURPRISING.

190
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,250
- COME ON, THAT'S
NOT THE WAY IT IS.

191
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,375
- AW, RIN. IF YOU LOSE
YOUR INTEREST IN GIRLS,

192
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,333
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE
YOUR MAN CARD FOR EVER.

193
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,333
- AND THAT CAME FROM A GUY
WHO HUGGED ME EARLIER.

194
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,833
- YOU'RE JUST TOO SPOILED
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

195
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,750
YOU'VE GOT A GORGEOUS
GIRL NAMED KAEDE

196
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,625
TAKING CARE OF YOUR EVERY NEED,

197
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,875
SO, YOU'VE BEEN BLINDED.
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

198
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,208
YOU'RE LIVING A MAN'S
DREAM COME TRUE.

199
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,041
- WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

200
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,916
- AH, YOU'RE HOPELESS.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,958
- RIN, DO YOU, DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE LIVING A FULFILLED LIFE

202
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,125
EVERY SINGLE DAY?

203
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,708
YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

204
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,000
WELL, I SAY AFTER SCHOOL,

205
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,416
WE ADD SOME FEMALE
FULFILLMENT TO YOUR LIFE.

206
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,708
- THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE GOING FOR.

207
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,875
- ALL RIGHT CLASS,
BUTTS IN SEATS.

208
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,916
TEN YEARS AGO,
DUE TO THE INCIDENT

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,750
NOW KNOWN AS THE "GATE OPENING,"

210
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,541
THE GATEWAY TO THE
REALM OF THE GODS

211
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,666
AND THE REALM OF THE
DEMONS WAS OPENED.

212
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,833
SOON AFTERWARDS,
THE GODS AND THE DEMONS

213
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,125
BEGAN MIGRATING TO OUR WORLD.

214
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,958
NOW THERE ARE PLACES
WHERE DEMONS, GODS

215
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,916
AND HUMANS ALL STUDY TOGETHER.

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,583
SUCH AS OUR SCHOOL,
VERBENA ACADEMY.

217
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,666
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THE
HISTORY OF THE GATEWAY

218
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,666
WILL BE ON THE FINAL EXAM.

219
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,916
IF YOU GET IT WRONG,

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,541
I'LL MAKE YOU DO BUNNY
HOPS WITH DUMB BELLS.

221
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,958
- All: AW.

222
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,041
- Itsukido: YOU THINK YOU'RE
LIVING A FULFILLED LIFE

223
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,041
EVERY SINGLE DAY?

224
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,916
THE GIRLS ARE WHAT I
ABSOLUTELY LIVE AND DIE FOR.

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,750
- I REALLY LOVE TAKING
CARE OF YOU, RIN.

226
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,708
- MAYUMI LIVES FOR CHASING
THE NEWEST SCOOP.

227
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,458
ASA TRIES TO ENJOY LIFE
TO THE FULLEST EVERY DAY.

228
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,583
THEY ALL HAVE SOMETHING
THAT FULFILLS THEM.

229
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,125
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

230
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,833
- YOU SURE LOOK RELAXED
RIGHT NOW.

231
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,458
MY CLASS IS APPARENTLY
EXTREMELY BORING.

232
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,000
SORRY, I'M SUCH A BAD TEACHER.

233
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,916
- ME, TOO, I MEAN NO,
NOT THAT YOU'RE, THAT I'M...

234
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,041
- ( chuckles )
YOU LUCKED OUT, TSUCHIMI.

235
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,291
- ( sighs )

236
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,958
- COME WITH ME, WE NEED TO TALK.

237
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,958
RIN, DID YOU EVER BECOME
ACQUAINTED WITH GIRLS

238
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,666
FROM OTHER WORLDS
WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

239
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,125
- NO, NOT THAT CAN I REMEMBER.

240
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,166
ALTHOUGH I WASN'T REALLY
AWARE THAT PEOPLE

241
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,458
FROM OTHER WORLDS
EXISTED BACK THEN.

242
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,208
WHY DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

243
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,583
- OH, IT'S NOTHING
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

244
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,000
AT LEAST, I DON'T THINK IT IS.

245
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,458
- YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND.

246
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,875
- HMM, THE ONLY ADVICE I CAN
GIVE YOU FOR NOW, IS THIS,

247
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,416
BE STRONG.

248
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,791
- OKAY.
- GOOD LUCK.

249
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,500
- I'LL HELP YOU
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

250
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,083
- WHA...

251
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,916
- REMEMBER, BE BRAVE.

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,291
STAY STRONG AND DON'T
GIVE UP NO MATTER WHAT.

253
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,916
- HUH? I DON'T GET IT.

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,458
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE FIGHTING?

255
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,208
- READY TO GO HOME, KAEDE?

256
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,666
- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T
GO HOME JUST YET.

257
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,625
- DO YOU NEED
TO STAY LATER TODAY?

258
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,750
- HEY, KAEDE, SORRY FOR
MAKING YOU WAIT SO LONG,

259
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,416
ARE YOU READY TO GO, SWEETIE?

260
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,458
- THAT'S A SURPRISE.
WHY ARE ASA AND KAREHA HERE?

261
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,750
DO YOU HAVE AFTER SCHOOL PLANS
WITH THEM OR SOMETHING?

262
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,916
- OH, HELLO, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU, RIN.

263
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,708
I HEARD SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU TODAY.

264
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,791
I HEARD YOU WERE GETTING
IT ON WITH ITSUKI.

265
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,041
- AH, WHAT KIND OF RUMORS
ARE THE UPPER CLASSMEN

266
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,791
SPREADING AROUND ABOUT ME NOW?

267
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,416
- OH, YOU KNOW, FORBIDDEN LOVE.

268
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,041
- ( laughing )

269
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,625
- WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE
PICTURING IN YOUR HEAD

270
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,208
RIGHT NOW, JUST STOP IT, OKAY?

271
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,958
- OH, COME ON, GET OVER IT.

272
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,500
WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE KAEDE'S
"KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR."

273
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,041
- THE WAY YOU SAY
IT, I'M NOT SURE

274
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,500
HOW I SHOULD TAKE THAT.

275
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,250
- WELL, ANYWAY, MR. KNIGHT.

276
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,500
WE HAVE TO BORROW KAEDE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

277
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,083
- HUH?
- I'M REALLY EXCITED, RIN.

278
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,208
I'M LEARNING HOW TO MAKE
A BRAND NEW RECIPE FOR YOU

279
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,625
TODAY IN COOKING CLUB.
IT'LL BE GREAT.

280
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,291
- ( giggles ) ISN'T IT NICE
TO KNOW A GIRL

281
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,416
WHO'S SO EAGER TO LEARN HOW TO
MAKE YOU GREAT FOOD? LUCKY.

282
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
- ( grunts ) DO YOU HAVE
TO BEAT THE STUFFING

283
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,875
OUT OF ME LIKE THAT?

284
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,291
- AH, LISTEN UP. THE NEW
TRANSFER STUDENT IS A GIRL.

285
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,333
ACTUALLY, THERE ARE TWO OF THEM.

286
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,083
- ( excited chatter )

287
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,208
- ONE OF THEM IS A GOD,
AND ONE OF THEM IS A DEMON,

288
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,958
AND THEY'RE BOTH
RIDICULOUSLY PRETTY.

289
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,208
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
AREN'T YOU EVEN INTERESTED?

290
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,375
- HUH? WHAT DID YOU SAY?

291
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,541
- ( laughs ) YOU'RE CLUELESS.

292
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,291
I GUESS KAEDE STILL
DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY

293
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,416
ABOUT ROMANTIC
RIVALS FOR A WHILE.

294
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,083
- ROMANTIC RIVALS?

295
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,625
- ( laughs ) ANYWAY, YOU READY,
KAEDE? WE SHOULD GET GOING.

296
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,500
- LATER, RIN.
- I'M SO SORRY, RIN.

297
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,708
- I'LL MAKE A
GREAT DINNER FOR YOU

298
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,083
AS SOON AS I GET HOME,
OKAY? I PROMISE.

299
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,541
- OH, DON'T RUSH OR ANYTHING.

300
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,833
I THINK WE NEED SOME MILK.

301
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,416
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT WE'RE OUT OF?

302
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,833
HMM. I WISH I WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF ASKING KAEDE

303
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,833
BEFORE I LEFT THE SCHOOL.

304
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,000
- IF WE NEED ANYTHING ELSE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

305
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,250
I'LL GO SHOPPING LATER.

306
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,000
YOU JUST STAY HOME AND RELAX.

307
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,791
- I KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT SHE WOULD SAY.

308
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,458
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO DO
THE BEST THAT I CAN FOR NOW.

309
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,625
- THOSE EARS, SHE MUST BE A GOD.

310
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,333
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN
HER AROUND HERE BEFORE.

311
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,375
- SO, AS FAR AS COST GOES,
THIS ONE'S LESS EXPENSIVE,

312
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,833
BUT IF I GET MORE WITH THIS ONE,

313
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,708
IT MIGHT BE WORTH
PAYING A LITTLE EXTRA.

314
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,541
- AH, EXCUSE ME.
CAN YOU HELP ME DECIDE

315
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,083
WHICH ONE OF THESE I SHOULD GET?

316
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,750
- UH, SORRY?

317
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,333
- I'VE MANAGED TO NARROW
IT DOWN TO THESE TWO,

318
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,583
BUT I JUST CAN'T
MAKE UP MY MIND.

319
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,875
- OH.
- SEE, I'M COOKING FOR SOMEONE

320
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,458
WHO EATS A LOT,

321
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,708
SO, I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD BUY
TWO OF THESE MEDIUM PACKAGES,

322
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:10,250
OR JUST GET ONE OF THE BIG ONES.
SAVINGS OR QUANTITY?

323
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,458
- AH, MY HEAD HURTS
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

324
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,583
- OH, THAT'S ROUGH.

325
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,833
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

326
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,375
- UM, IF THEY HAVE THAT
BIG OF AN APPETITE,

327
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,541
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET TWO PACKAGES.

328
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,500
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
THANKS, IT'S SETTLED.

329
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,625
I'M GOING TO BUY
TWO OF THESE PACKAGES.

330
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,583
- YOU'VE REALLY BEEN A BIG HELP.
- OH, NO PROBLEM.

331
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,416
- I'M SORRY I CAN'T
STAY AND TALK,

332
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,125
BUT THERE'S A TOILET PAPER
SALE AT THE DRUG STORE

333
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,333
AND I CAN'TMISS IT, YOU KNOW?

334
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:42,166
- OH, OF COURSE. I DON'T
WANT YOU TO MISS YOUR SALE.

335
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,333
I'M GLAD I COULD HELP.

336
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,208
- I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
LATER THEN, RIN.

337
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,583
- I WONDER IF I GOT TOO MUCH?

338
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,791
WELL, AT LEAST KAEDE
WON'T HAVE TO GO SHOPPING

339
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,750
FOR A LITTLE WHILE. HUH?

- OH, I, I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T SCARE YOU DID I?

347
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,666
- UH, UH.

348
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,375
- YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
STANDING THERE

349
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,583
LISTENING TO ME SING THIS
WHOLE TIME, HAVE YOU?

350
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,250
- YEAH, I'M AFRAID SO.
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

351
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,791
- OH, WELL I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT ALL THAT.

352
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,291
IT'S NICE OF YOU TO SAY,

353
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,875
BUT I KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE
WHO SING MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN.

354
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,666
- OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

355
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,666
- ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE
IF I AM BAD,

356
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,958
YOU COULD CALL THAT YOUR
PUNISHMENT FOR SPYING.

357
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,916
AH, SPEAKING OF PUNISHMENT,
IF I DON'T GET HOME PRETTY SOON,

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,791
I'M PROBABLY GONNA
BE IN TROUBLE

359
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,375
- WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT THAT.
SORRY IF I INTERRUPTED YOU.

360
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,708
- NOT AT ALL. I'M REALLY GLAD
WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK.

361
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,916
- ME, TOO. I HOPE I GET
A CHANCE TO HEAR YOU SING AGAIN.

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,458
- WELL, WHO KNOWS.
IT'S A SMALL WORLD, RIN.

363
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,000
KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN,

364
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,291
AND YOU MIGHT HEAR MY VOICE
SOONER THAN YOU THINK YOU WILL.

365
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,750
- ( chuckles ) BYE THEN.

366
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,875
- A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
AND SHE SINGS, TOO.

367
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,000
I ACTUALLY MET TWO NEW GIRLS
FROM BOTH WORLDS TODAY.

368
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,041
HOW FUNNY.

369
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,000
- HUH? WAIT A SEC,
HOW'D THEY KNOW MY NAME?

370
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,708
WOW, THAT'S INTERESTING.

371
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,375
I WONDER IF I'VE MET THOSE
GIRLS SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

372
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,458
LET ME THINK, I DON'T REMEMBER
SEEING THEM AT SCHOOL.

373
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,958
- I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
LATER THEN, RIN.

374
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,125
- IT'S A SMALL WORLD, RIN.

375
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,666
- KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN,

376
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,083
AND YOU MIGHT HEAR MY VOICE
SOONER THAN YOU THINK YOU WILL.

377
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,833
- OH, WELL, ANYWAY.
IF I DO KNOW THEM,

378
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,166
I'M SURE I'LL SEE THEM
AGAIN AT SOME POINT.

379
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,208
- YOU'RE CLUELESS. I GUESS,
KAEDE STILL DOESN'T

380
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,958
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
ROMANTIC RIVALS FOR A WHILE.

381
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,708
- NO WAY.
( chuckles )

382
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,916
- OKAY, TWO NEW PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO BE JOINING

383
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,041
OUR CLASS STARTING TODAY.

384
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,541
- GREAT, I GUESS I DON'T
REALLY NEED TO EXPLAIN.

385
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,166
- COME ON. WOULD YOU
GET A GRIP, PLEASE?

386
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,083
- NO, I CAN'T GET A GRIP.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

387
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,083
THE FIRST IMPRESSION
A GUY MAKES IS CRUCIAL.

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,750
- WHATEVER, BE A FREAK.

389
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,958
- HEY, YOU GUYS, ARE YOU READY?
- YEAH.

390
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,583
- BOYS WILL BE BOYS. YOU CAN
GO AHEAD AND COME IN NOW.

391
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,958
- ( cheering )

392
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,958
- ALL RIGHT NOW. HERE WE GO.

393
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,583
- NOW, THIS IS WHAT I CALL
A HAPPENING SCHOOL.

394
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,083
LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE
A FUN PLACE AFTER ALL.

395
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,250
- WOW, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

396
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,583
THERE'RE SO MANY PRETTY
YOUNG GIRLS AROUND,

397
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,750
I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL
LIKE A YOUNG STUD AGAIN.

398
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,500
- HEY LOOK, SOMETHING
IS WRONG WITH THESE GUYS.

399
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,333
- NO WAY.

400
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,916
- THOSE ARE THE PRETTY GIRLS
THAT ITSUKI SMELLED?

401
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,041
I THOUGHT HIS NOSE NEVER LIED.

402
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,041
- WELL, WHICH KID IS IT?
IS HE HERE RIGHT NOW?

403
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,708
- AH, LOOK, THERE HE IS.

404
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,916
- HMM, HE'S DEFINITELY NOT BAD
TO LOOK AT, IS HE?

405
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,958
HE'S GOING TO MAKE A VERY
FINE PROSPECT FOR MY SIA.

406
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,000
- HEY, NOT SO FAST THERE, SHIN.

407
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,583
RIN HERE HAPPENS TO BE
NERINE'S FIANCE, YOU REMEMBER?

408
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,916
- HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

409
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,958
RIN, TAKE GOOD CARE OF
MY SIA FOR ME, OKAY?

410
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,083
- SURE.

411
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,416
- HEY. LISTEN UP,
PAL, GET WITH IT.

412
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,291
SIA'S GOT A CUTE BODY AND YOU
BETTER HAVE THE ENERGY...

413
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,041
- DAD, GROSS.
DON'T' SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.

414
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,291
- SIA, I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE
THAT HITTING PEOPLE WITH CHAIRS

415
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,916
IS GOING A LITTLE TOO FAR.

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,541
- SIA, THAT WAS
A LITTLE BIT HARSH.

417
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,291
- WAIT, YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

418
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,083
- SO, LET'S LET THESE PEOPLE
INTRODUCE THEMSELVES.

419
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,708
- MY NAME'S LISIANTHUS. I COME
FROM THE WORLD OF THE GODS.

420
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,083
- MY NAME IS KIND OF LONG,
SO YOU CAN CALL ME SIA.

421
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,250
- UH, HI. MY NAME IS NERINE.

422
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,500
I COME FROM THE
REALM OF THE DEMONS.

423
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,083
I WOULD LOVE IT IF EVERYONE
WOULD JUST CALL ME RINA.

424
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,000
- MY NAME'S EUSTOMA.

425
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,416
I AM SIA'S FATHER, AND I'M
KING OF THE GODS AS WELL.

426
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,083
- AND MY NAME IS FORBESII.

427
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,083
I RULE AS KING OF THE DEMONS
AND I'M ALSO NERINE'S FATHER.

428
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,833
- I DIDN'T MEAN YOU PEOPLE.
- UH, UM, TEACHER?

429
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:25,000
DID I JUST HEAR THEM
SAY, THEY WERE, UM,

430
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,125
THE KING OF GODS AND DEMONS?

431
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,625
- YOU JUST HEARD RIGHT.
BEAR WITH ME HERE,

432
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,000
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

433
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,666
TRUST ME, I'VE HAD A HARD TIME
BELIEVING IT MYSELF.

434
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,958
BUT, THESE TWO MEN
REALLY ARE THE KINGS,

435
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,250
WHO RULE THE WORLDS
OF THE GODS AND THE DEMONS.

436
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,375
- UH, WE REALLY DON'T
WANT YOU TO WORRY

437
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,666
ABOUT THE FACT THAT
WE'RE PRINCESSES, OKAY?

438
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,333
- WE'RE SERIOUS, WE WANT
TO HAVE A NORMAL LIFE HERE,

439
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,791
SO TREAT US JUST LIKE
YOU TREAT EVERYONE ELSE.

440
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,458
- SO, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

441
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,041
TSUCHIMI, IT'S GONNA BE YOUR JOB
TO TAKE CARE OF THESE GIRLS.

442
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,458
- WHAT? WHY IS THAT UP TO ME?
WHAT THE?

443
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,041
- I'LL BE HAPPY TO EXPLAIN,
IF YOU'D LIKE.

444
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,208
YOU SEE, RIN, YOU'VE BEEN
CHOSEN AS A PRIME CANDIDATE

445
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,958
TO BE THE HUSBAND
OF EITHER NERINE OR SIA.

446
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,083
- HUH?

447
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,500
- ( all gasps )

448
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,708
- TO PUT IT PLAINLY,

449
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,541
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BECOME KING OF
THE GODS OR KING OF THE DEMONS.

450
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,000
IF YOU PICK MY SIA,

451
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,625
YOU CAN USE THE POWER OF THE
GODS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

452
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,000
BUT CHOOSE NERINE,

453
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,166
AND ALL THE POWER OF THE
DEMONS WILL BE YOURS TO USE,

454
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,833
HOWEVER YOUR HEART DESIRES.

455
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,875
- ( giggles )

456
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,708
- ( laugh awkwardly )

457
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,375
- ALL OF A SUDDEN,

458
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,791
I COULD EITHER BECOME KING OF
THE GODS OR KING OF THE DEMONS.

459
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,791
UH, DO YOU GUYS
LIVE AROUND HERE, TOO?

460
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,833
- YOU BET. WE'RE
JUST ABOUT THERE.

461
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,875
- HMM.

462
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:12,416
- UH, WELL, THIS IS OUR HOUSE.
- OUR PLACE IS RIGHT OVER THERE.

463
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,125
- AH.

464
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,125
- AND OUR HOUSE
IS THAT BIG ONE THERE.

465
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,958
- HUH?
- I'M GLAD WE LIVE SO CLOSE.

466
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,625
- WE'LL HAVE LOTS OF FUN
BEING NEIGHBORS.

467
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,166
- UH, YEAH, SURE.

468
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,083
- IT'S A BIG PARTY.
I CAN'T WAIT.

469
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,000
- ( theme song playing )

470
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,916
- Nerine: SIA, LET'S ENJOY THE
HUMAN WORLD, AND GO OUT TO EAT.

471
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,041
- TEMPURA SUSHI.
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

472
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,958
- MOUNT FUJI.
- WELL, THAT'S...

473
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,416
- GEISHAS.
- THAT SOUNDS YUMMY.

474
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,458
- WHAT?
- NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE,

475
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,875
EPISODE 2:
"I WANTED TO SEE YOU!"

476
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,958
- IS GEISHA REALLY A FOOD?
- MY FATHER SAID IT WAS.
