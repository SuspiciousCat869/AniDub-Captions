1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,583
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,375
- ( doorbell rings )

4
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,041
- HI, THERE, RIN.
GOOD MORNING.

5
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,916
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
WE'RE READY.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,125
- ( singing ) WE ARE ALL
TOGETHER, LET'S GO TO SCHOOL.

7
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,291
- ( grunts )
HEY, HOW MANY TIMES,

8
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,125
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS NOT
TO BE SO NOISY IN THE MORNING?

9
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,750
- AH, PRIMULA, THOSE NEW CLOTHES
LOOK VERY PRETTY ON YOU.

10
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,666
- SO, DID YOU GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP?

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,416
- I DIDN'T HAVE TOO MANY
BAD DREAMS.

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,250
- PRIMULA'S JUST WEARING
MY OLD PAJAMAS FOR NOW.

13
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,291
BUT I'M GONNA TRY AND FIND HER
SOME REGULAR CLOTHES

14
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,583
WHEN I GET HOME.

15
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,708
- THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU,
KAEDE, THANKS A LOT.

16
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,125
- NO PROBLEM.

17
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,125
- BYE, PRIMULA, TAKE CARE
OF THE HOUSE FOR US, OKAY?

18
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,833
- ( gasps )

19
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,750
- RIN, DO YOU THINK THAT'S A
GOOD IDEA FOR HER TO STAY ALONE?

20
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,000
- WELL, WE CAN'T JUST TAKE HER
TO SCHOOL WITH US, CAN WE?

21
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,916
AND IF ANYTHING COMES UP,

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,541
SHE CAN JUST GO RIGHT NEXT
DOOR AND BOTHER THESE GUYS

23
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,708
AS MUCH AS SHE WANTS.

24
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,625
- NO, YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT,
JUST HOLD ON.

25
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,041
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE US
BEHIND, TOO, ARE YOU?

26
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,458
- OH, YEAH, YOU BET.

27
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,875
- ( sighs ) READY TO GO, GIRLS?

28
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,166
- WAIT A SECOND, RIN.

29
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,750
- YOUR UMBRELLA.
- WHAT?

30
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,708
- BUT WHAT WOULD
I NEED THAT FOR?

31
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,708
- IT IS THE RAINY SEASON,
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.

32
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,583
AS THEY SAY, "IT'S BETTER
TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY."

33
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:04,583
- OKAY, WHATEVER. SO, LET'S GET
GOING BEFORE WE END UP LATE.

34
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,833
- NERINE, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.
TAKE DADDY WITH YOU.

35
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,791
- RIMU, DO YOUR BEST TO KEEP
OUR DADS OUT OF TROUBLE

36
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,583
WHILE WE'RE AWAY.

37
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:17,125
- BE GOOD, DADDY.
- COME ON, SIA.

38
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,458
- ( crying )

39
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,750
- BYE, NERINE.

40
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,750
- WOW. IT'S COMING DOWN
REALLY HARD.

41
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:35,208
- WELL, TECHNICALLY SPEAKING,
IT IS THE RAINY SEASON.

42
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,250
- AND I'M ABOUT READY
FOR IT TO BE OVER.

43
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,833
IT'S KIND OF DEPRESSING.

44
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:43,083
- OH, I AGREE. STORMY WEATHER
MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE GLOOMY.

45
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,708
- PERSONALLY, THIS IS ONE OF
MY FAVORITE TIMES OF THE YEAR.

46
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,833
I'D RATHER DIE THAN LOSE
OUT ON THE BEAUTY

47
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,166
THE RAIN HAS TO OFFER.

48
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,458
- EVERYTHING DOES HAVE
A CERTAIN SPARKLE TO IT

49
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,083
WHEN IT'S ALL RAIN SOAKED,
DOESN'T IT?

50
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,541
- BE CAREFUL NOW, BEFORE
YOU START AGREEING WITH HIM,

51
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,833
MAYBE YOU BETTER HEAR
WHAT ELSE HE HAS TO SAY.

52
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,916
- SHARING YOUR UMBRELLA
WITH A PRETTY GIRL

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,916
IS A BRILLIANT EXCUSE TO WRAP
YOUR ARMS AROUND HER.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,250
- ALL THE PRETTY GIRLS IN THE
WORLD WOULD BE MUCH HAPPIER,

55
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,500
IF YOU WRAPPED A NOOSE
AROUND YOUR NECK.

56
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,500
- OBVIOUSLY ITSUKI'S REACTION
TO RAIN IS NOT NORMAL.

57
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,833
- THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO
USUALLY LIKE IT WHEN IT RAINS

59
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,625
ARE THE QUIET, MISERABLE, AND
UTTERLY DEPRESSING TYPES.

60
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,208
- WOW, LOOK, IT'S RAINNG.

61
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,833
- HUH?
- IT'S BEEN TWO WHOLE DAYS.

62
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,875
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

63
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,291
- WOW, SO MUCH FOR MY THEORY.

64
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,791
- LOOK AT IT, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

65
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,208
THE RAINY SEASON
IS FASCINATING.

66
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,958
THE WAY IT REFILLS THE WATER
SUPPLY BEFORE IT GETS HOT,

67
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,916
NATURE IN THE HUMAN WORLD
IS INCREDIBLE. I HAD NO IDEA.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,458
- BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE RAIN IS THAT FASCINATING?

69
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,083
I THINK IT'S BORING, MYSELF.

70
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,625
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

71
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,625
I LOVE GETTING ALL COZY
UNDER AN UMBRELLA.

72
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,791
- WE SHOULD TRY IT SOMETIME.
- HMM. WHAT DID YOU SAY?

73
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,583
- I REMEMBER SOMETHING.
- HUH?

74
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,583
- SEE? GIRL'S AFTER
MY OWN HEART.

75
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,166
AND EVEN BETTER, ONCE
THE RAINY SEASON IS OVER,

76
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,708
WE'LL FINALLY GET
TO ENJOY THE SUMMER.

77
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,708
- YEAH.

78
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,333
I GOT IT.
- ( chuckles )

79
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,083
- All: THE BEACH.

80
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,000
- SO, RIN, WHEN WE DO
GO TO THE BEACH,

81
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,208
YOU ARE GONNA BRING
THAT CUTE LITTLE GIRL

82
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,833
FROM YESTERDAY, AREN'T YOU?

83
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,541
- CUTE LITTLE GIRL? I TOLD YOU
THAT WASN'T WHAT, WHAT...

84
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,708
- COME ON, YOU DON'T
NEED TO HIDE IT.

85
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,750
I'M ACTUALLY PRETTY OPEN- MINDED
ABOUT THIS KIND OF THING.

86
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,000
SO, BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.

87
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,333
- SET YOURSELF FREE, RIN.
- HUH?

88
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,125
- I'M SAYING YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT COMING OUT

89
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,291
OF THE CLOSET WITH THIS.

90
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,208
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

91
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,833
- COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET?

92
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,833
- BECAUSE RIN
IS A CRADLE ROBBER...

93
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,541
- ( grunts )

94
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,666
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
BUTTS IN SEATS.

95
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,500
- NOW, IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR FINAL EXAMS,

96
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,291
SO, LET'S START THE DAY BY
HANDING OUT YOUR TEST SCHEDULES.

97
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,583
- NOW?
- DAMN FINALS.

98
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,708
- THAT SUCKS.

99
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,000
- WHAT A PAIN.

100
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,708
OKAY, SO THIS IS THE LAST
OBSTACLE I HAVE TO FACE,

101
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,958
BEFORE I GET TO ENJOY
MY SWEET SUMMER BREAK.

102
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,625
- ( sighs )

103
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,250
- OKAY, I THINK THAT'LL DO IT.

104
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,916
SO, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT IT, PRIMULA?

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,708
- WILL RIN LIKE IT?
- OF COURSE HE WILL.

106
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,583
- WELL, NOW THAT THAT'S DONE,

107
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,958
I NEED TO DO SOME WORK
IN THE KITCHEN.

108
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,833
- BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
FINISHED EATING DINNER.

109
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,791
- YEAH, BUT THIS
IS SOMETHING ELSE.

110
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,125
- THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO SULK.

111
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:50,541
- OKAY, I'M GONNA GIVE IT
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. HEY, KAEDE,

112
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,958
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,

113
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,791
BUT DO YOU THINK I COULD HAVE
SOMETHING TO SNACK ON?

114
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,208
- I NEED ENERGY TO STUDY.
- I'M ALREADY ON IT.

115
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,958
- ( door bell rings )

116
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,500
- HUH? WHO COULD THAT BE
AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

117
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,541
- EMERGENCY, EMERGENCY.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

118
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,625
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

119
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,250
- TELL ME IT ISN'T TRUE, RIN.

120
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,000
WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING
CALLED A "FAILING GRADE"

121
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,583
ON YOUR FINAL EXAMS,

122
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,208
DO THOSE MONSTERS ACTUALLY TAKE
AWAY YOUR ENTIRE SUMMER BREAK?

123
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,541
- HUH?

124
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,541
- DO THEY REALLY HAUL
YOU AWAY AND IMPRISON YOU

125
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,833
IN SOME "SUMMER SCHOOL" THING,

126
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,916
WHERE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY?

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,375
- WELL, I HATE TO TELL YOU,
BUT SUMMER SCHOOL IS REAL.

128
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,875
- NO WAY, IT CAN'T BE.
NO, THOSE EVIL MONSTERS.

129
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,625
I WAS GOING TO TAKE MY PRECIOUS
DAUGHTER CAMPING AT THE BEACH

130
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,083
FOR SOME FAMILY BONDING TIME

131
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,416
AND THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME.

132
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,750
- I GIVE UP, STOP IT.
YOU'RE CHOKING ME.

133
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,541
- THEN IT'S ON. THEY HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

134
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,916
WHO THEY'RE MESSING WITH.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,583
FINE THEN, I'LL JUST
HAVE TO SUMMON

136
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,458
THE DIVINE SPECIAL FORCES UNIT.

137
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,833
I'LL DESTROY THE SCHOOL
AND THEN THE ENTIRE...

138
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,333
- DAD, WHY ARE YOU SUCH
A PSYCHOTIC FREAK?

139
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,875
RIN, ARE YOU OKAY?

140
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,875
- WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE
I COULD SEE A BRIGHT LIGHT

141
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,125
AT THE END OF A TUNNEL.

142
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,250
- I'M SORRY, I KNEW DAD
WOULD CAUSE TROUBLE

143
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,458
WHEN I SAW HIM RUN OVER HERE

144
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,250
SCREAMING ABOUT AN EMERGENCY.

145
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,500
HOW I DO ON MY EXAMS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS, DAD.

146
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:13,250
- BUT, MY POOR SIA, OUR ENTIRE
SUMMER TOGETHER COULD BE RUINED.

147
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,625
- UM, EXCUSE ME,
BUT COULD I EXPLAIN SOMETHING?

148
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,333
SEE, YOU CAN FAIL THREE EXAMS

149
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,333
AND STILL NOT HAVE TO
TAKE SUMMER SCHOOL.

150
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,000
- WOW, ONLY THREE?
- IS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

151
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,833
- ( laughs awkwardly ) YEAH, AS
FAR AS MY GRADES ARE CONCERNED,

152
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,750
IT'S PRETTY MUCH A DISASTER.

153
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,500
- OH, SIA, YOU ARE SO BRAVE.

154
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,875
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE ON
THIS TERRIBLE CHALLENGE,

155
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,250
EVEN THOUGH IT MAY MEAN
AN END TO YOUR ENTIRE SUMMER.

156
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,291
- I'M REALLY SORRY THAT MY
DAD CAME BARGING IN HERE

157
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,916
LIKE A TOTAL IDIOT.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,208
- WE'LL BE LEAVING NOW.
- BUT DO YOU NEED SOME HELP?

159
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:51,750
- AH. OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
RIN. IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

160
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,875
HEAVY. MAN!

161
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,500
- OH, MAN.

162
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,708
I REALLY HOPE SIA DOESN'T
HAVE TO TAKE SUMMER SCHOOL.

163
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,791
- ( grunts )

164
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,833
- HELLO, WHAT'S UP?

165
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,166
WHAT'S WRONG? YOU LOOK
KIND OF BUMMED OUT.

166
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,541
- HI, ASA. OH, HI, KAREHA.

167
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,541
- HI, RIN.

168
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,708
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SIA?

169
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,708
- OH, I SEE, SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE LOOKING SO SERIOUS

170
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,875
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

171
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,666
SO, IS SHE GONNA BE
YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND?

172
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,041
- WHAT? HEY, NOW,
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

173
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,500
I'M JUST ASKING KAREHA
WHAT SHE KNOWS.

174
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,625
I MEAN SINCE THEY'RE BOTH
FROM THE WORLD OF THE GODS.

175
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,916
- WELL, LET ME THINK.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,458
UM, THIS IS KIND OF OBVIOUS,
BUT SHE'S GOT LOADS OF ENERGY

177
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,333
AND SHE ALWAYS SEEMS CHEERFUL.

178
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,000
OH, I'VE ALSO HEARD,

179
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,500
SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE BIT
OF A STRUGGLE

180
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,625
WITH SOME OF HER GRADES
THIS SEMESTER.

181
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,333
- SHE DID MENTION THAT SHE'S
HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH SCHOOL.

182
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,000
- WELL, OUR WORLD
IS VERY DIFFERENT,

183
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,041
SO IT'S REALLY NOT MUCH
OF A SURPRISE.

184
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,125
IN THE REALM OF THE GODS,
SHE DIDN'T USE ANYTHING,

185
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,750
BUT TRANSLATION MAGIC
TO COMMUNICATE.

186
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,500
SO, READING AND WRITING
ARE NEW TO HER.

187
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,208
- TRANSLATION MAGIC?

188
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,333
- YEAH, IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT
YOU GUYS CALL TELEPATHY HERE.

189
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,625
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
CAN COMMUNICATE

190
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,583
WITH SOMEONE WITHOUT
USING ANY WORDS.

191
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,333
SHE WOULD JUST SEND HER THOUGHTS
STRAIGHT TO THE OTHER PERSON.

192
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,041
- BUT IF SHE'S NEVER USED
LANGUAGE BEFORE,

193
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,041
WHY IS SHE SO FLUENT IN OURS?

194
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,166
- I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE...
- BECAUSE?

195
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,458
- ( giggles ) IT'S BECAUSE...
- KAREHA?

196
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,666
- ( laughing hysterically )

197
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,166
- THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.
AND SHE'S GONE.

198
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,708
- THAT GIRL IS INSANE.

199
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,666
- SEE, I THINK
WHAT SHE'S GETTING AT,

200
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,416
IS THAT SIA MUST
HAVE HAD MOTIVATION

201
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,875
TO LEARN OUR LANGUAGE.

202
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,125
- UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
- YOU'RE SO DENSE.

203
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,875
- SHE WANTED TO BE ABLE
TO TALK TO THE MAN SHE LOVES.

204
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,708
DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU
EXTRA HAPPY TO KNOW

205
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,833
THAT SHE LIKES YOU SO MUCH?

206
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,458
- SHE DOES?
- ( giggles )

207
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,541
- ( grunts ) OKAY, SO, THIS IS
THE MEANING OF THIS WORD.

208
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,041
AND THE OTHER WORD IS A SYNONYM.

209
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,375
- SO, UM, IS THERE
ANY WAY I CAN HELP?

210
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,541
- YOU CAN HELP BY SHUTTING UP.

211
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,583
THE WORDS I WAS JUST
TRYING TO MEMORIZE,

212
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,291
HAVE LEFT MY BRAIN FOREVER.

213
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,583
- OH, I'M SORRY.

214
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,791
- EVERYBODY IS GETTING
SO STRESSED OUT ABOUT EXAMS.

215
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,916
TRUTHFULLY, I CAN'T
EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,875
HOW MUCH I ADORE BEING IN
SUCH A TENSE ENVIRONMENT.

217
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,541
- YOU DO SEEM TO BE
UNUSUALLY RELAXED RIGHT NOW.

218
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,208
- YOU'D NEVER GUESS IT
BY LOOKING BY LOOKING AT HIM,

219
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,083
BUT HE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
THAT GETS REALLY GOOD GRADES,

220
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,500
LIKE YOU, NERINE.

221
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,625
IT'S SO NOT FAIR.
I HATE PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

222
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
- HMM.

223
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,583
- AH. HELLO.
UH, JUST A MINUTE.

224
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,958
YES?

225
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,250
- HELLO.
- RIN, COME IN.

226
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,000
- YOU KIND OF CAUGHT ME
BY SURPRISE THERE.

227
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,416
BUT I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU CAME OVER TO SEE ME.

228
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,666
- HEY.

229
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,083
- HERE, I MADE US SOME TEA,
ARE YOU THIRSTY?

230
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,291
- HUH?

231
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,916
- I MUST BE PRETTY LUCKY
FOR YOU TO COME OVER

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,416
AND HELP ME OUT LIKE THIS.

233
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,416
- WELL, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST

234
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
IF I HELP YOU PASS YOUR EXAMS.

235
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,083
I MEAN, YOUR FATHER
HAS THREATENED

236
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,625
TO DESTROY ALL OF MANKIND,

237
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,708
IF YOU DON'T GET
ENOUGH GOOD GRADES.

238
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,250
- ( laughs ) YOU KNOW WHAT?

239
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,708
MY FATHER MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
CRAZY ENOUGH TO MEAN IT, TOO.

240
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,208
- NOW THAT I THINK
ABOUT IT, THOUGH,

241
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,125
I WISH YOU HAD SOMEONE
BETTER THAN ME TO HELP YOU.

242
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,708
- WELL, EVEN IF I'M NOT THE
GREATEST STUDENT MYSELF,

243
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,583
AT LEAST THERE'S TWO OF US.
AND IT'LL BE MORE FUN THIS WAY.

244
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,583
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

245
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,708
- OKAY, THEN I SUPPOSE WE
SHOULD GET STARTED.

246
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:46,750
- HMM, MM.

247
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,625
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

248
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,875
- HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE THIS?
- HMM.

249
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,750
- I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
"TO BE" INFINITIVE THINGIES

250
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,375
THAT ACTS LIKE AN ADVERB.

251
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,416
SO, IT SEEMS LIKE
THIS WOULD MEAN...

252
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,000
- ( grunting )

253
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:11,291
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. I GIVE UP.
QUICK, THE DICTIONARY.

254
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:15,250
- YES, SIR. HERE YOU GO.
- YES.

255
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:21,750
- HA! THE ANSWER'S RIGHT HERE.
- WELL? SO, WHAT DOES IT SAY?

256
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,083
- IT'S RIGHT THERE, SEE?

257
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,583
- ( heart beating )

258
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:37,208
- SO, ANYWAY.

259
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:43,291
- ( chuckles ) THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME WE'VE EVER BEEN LIKE THIS.

260
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,708
- HUH?

261
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,750
- WE'RE FINALLY ALONE. I'M
GLAD I CAME TO YOUR WORLD.

262
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:53,458
- I REALLY LIKE IT HERE, AND
WE'VE NEVER BEEN ALONE BEFORE.

263
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,500
WHEN I'M NEAR YOU,
EVERYTHING IS SPECIAL.

264
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,500
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE WHEN I FIRST
MET YOU EIGHT YEARS AGO.

265
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,041
- ( crying )

266
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,916
- WHAT'S WRONG?
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,583
COME PLAY WITH ME, INSTEAD.
COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN.

268
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,708
- RIN? DO YOU REMEMBER
THE DAY WE FIRST MET?

269
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,166
- REMEMBER?

270
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:56,083
- UM, WELL, YEAH, SURE. I'D
NEVER FORGET THAT.

271
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,458
NOW, LET'S STUDY.

272
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,583
- YEAH.

273
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,375
- UH, HEY.

274
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,250
- ( chuckles ) IT'S EASIER TO
SEE THINGS WHEN I'M CLOSER.

275
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,333
- WELL, OKAY.

276
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,291
- DO YOU THINK THIS WILL HELP
KEEP ME OUT OF SUMMER SCHOOL?

277
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,041
- WELL, WE'VE STUDIED HARD
SO ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS,

278
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,041
SAY A PRAYER
AND HOPE FOR A MIRACLE.

279
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,708
- ( screams )

280
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,041
- OH, HEAVEN, HEAR MY VOICE.

281
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:34,333
- ( screams ) PLEASE SAVE
MY DAUGHTER FROM THIS AGONY.

282
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,666
- TIME. EVERYONE PUT
DOWN YOUR PENCILS

283
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,708
AND PASS YOUR PAPERS FORWARD.

284
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,250
- YES, EVERYTHING I STUDIED
WAS ON THE TESTS.

285
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,791
- I'M SO DONE FOR.

286
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,666
- ( students chattering )

287
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,375
- HEY, HOW DID IT GO?
NO, LET ME GUESS.

288
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,125
YOU'LL BE SPENDING
ALL YOUR SUNNY SUMMER DAYS

289
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,958
INSIDE A DARK CLASSROOM.

290
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,458
- SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,

291
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,083
BUT MY SUMMER VACATION WILL HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH SCHOOL.

292
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,916
IT WILL BE FILLED WITH
FREEDOM AND FUN.

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,166
IT'LL BE SO PERFECT I CAN
HARDLY STAND IT.

294
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,791
- RIN. I KNOW HOW AWFUL
YOU MUST FEEL,

295
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,916
BUT YOU NEED TO STOP
TRYING TO HIDE YOUR FEELINGS.

296
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

297
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,416
EVEN WHEN YOU
BLOW IT LIKE THIS,

298
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,250
I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR
YOU, MY FRIEND.

299
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,833
- I WOULDN'T TRUST YOU FURTHER
THAN I COULD THROW YOU.

300
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,666
AND I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD BE QUITE SO COCKY.

301
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,375
I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED
IF I GOT WAY BETTER GRADES

302
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,041
THAN YOU DID THIS TIME.

303
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,166
- HUH. THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A CHALLENGE TO ME.

304
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,875
WELL, BRING IT ON.

305
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,208
- DON'T BE SO CONFIDENT, ITSUKI.

306
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,583
YOU KNOW, "PRIDE DOES
GOETH EFORE A FALL."

307
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,083
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY
'TOOK YOU DOWN A NOTCH',

308
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,625
AND THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT BE ME.

309
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,541
- TOUGH TALK, BUT IT'S NO USE
"CRYING OVER SPILLED MILK."

310
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,291
- HA! YOU MIGHT JUST REGRET
THAT CHALLENGE LATER.

311
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,708
- ( both laughing )

312
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,458
- HEY, RIN, HOW'D IT GO?

313
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,125
- NOT TO BRAG, BUT I BELIEVE
MY AMAZING TEST RESULTS

314
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,958
SHOULD MAKE ME INTO A LEGEND IN
MY OWN LIFETIME. HOW'D YOU DO?

315
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,083
- I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
ACTUALLY PASSED TWO SUBJECTS.

316
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,000
BUT I REALLY DON'T HAVE
MUCH HOPE FOR THE OTHER TWO.

317
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,916
- YOU DID CUT IT
KIND OF CLOSE, DIDN'T YOU?

318
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,541
- I'M SO INCREDIBLY
JEALOUS OF RINA RIGHT NOW,

319
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,375
'CAUSE SHE'S GOOD AT EVERYTHING.

320
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,583
- NO, I'M NOT. REALLY,

321
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,916
THERE ARE LOTS OF SUBJECTS THAT
I'M NOT GOOD AT.

322
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,333
I'M HORRIBLY BAD AT P.E. AND
I'M NOT THAT GREAT AT HOME EC.

323
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,791
- WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.
FINAL EXAMS ARE OVER,

324
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,541
AND SUMMER BREAK IS SAFE.

325
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:33,291
TIME TO CUT LOOSE
AND PARTY ALL NIGHT LONG.

326
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,500
- I'M GAME. SO, WHAT'S EVERYBODY
UP FOR? I HAVE AN IDEA.

327
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,916
I KNOW OF THE
COOLEST LITTLE PLACE

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,750
THAT HAS THE MOST
AWESOME KARAOKE.

329
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,291
- WOW, MAYUMI,
YOU REALLY BOUNCED BACK.

330
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,958
- OF COURSE I DID.

331
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,083
LOOK, LIFE'S WAY TOO SHORT TO
DWELL IN THE PAST,

332
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,625
SO, I'M PUTTING ALL
MY STRUGGLES BEHIND ME,

333
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,041
SO, I CAN ENJOY LIFE
IN THE 'HERE AND NOW'.

334
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,833
I'VE DONE MY BEST. IF THAT'S
NOT ENOUGH, WHAT CAN I SAY?

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,416
SEE YOU IN CLASS THIS SUMMER.

336
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,708
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
NO MORE STRESS.

337
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,166
I INTEND TO ENJOY MY SUMMER
VACATION. BUT RIGHT NOW,

338
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,000
I JUST WANT TO SIT BACK AND
ENJOY MY NORMAL PEACEFUL LIFE

339
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,416
TO THE FULLEST.

340
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,041
- ( laughs ) NORMAL, HUH?
YEAH, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

341
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,375
- YEAH, LET'S GO CELEBRATE.
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

342
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,041
- ( whistle )

343
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,250
- GEEZ, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING
ME, YOU GUYS ARE BACK AGAIN?

344
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,666
- YES, WITH REINFORCEMENTS.

345
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,708
NOW, YOU BEST LISTEN
UP, RIN TSUCHIMI.

346
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,291
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
THINK YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

347
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,250
TO MONOPOLIZE
OUR BELOVED KAEDE.

348
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,833
- All: BELOVED KAEDE.
- KAEDE POSE 1, MEN.

349
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,708
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE
HER OUT TO CELEBRATE

350
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,291
AFTER SCHOOL WITHOUT US.

351
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,625
- HUH? WHY WOULD KAEDE
WANT TO GO OUT WITH YOU?

352
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,000
- DON'T CHANGE THE
SUBJECT, PLAYBOY.

353
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,125
THE SIA IMPERIAL GUARD
COMMANDO UNIT,

354
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,416
WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO MONOPOLIZE SIA EITHER.

355
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,958
SHE DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU.

356
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.

357
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,375
THE NERINE SECURITY SHOCK TROUP
DEMANDS YOUR FULL SURRENDER.

358
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,916
- AND IF YOU SHOULD
REFUSE TO SURRENDER...

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,666
- REFUSE TO SURRENDER.

360
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,375
- WE'LL TAKE YOU BY FORCE.
- CHARGE!

361
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,625
- ( screams ) CAN'T WE
JUST TALK ABOUT THIS.

362
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,666
- HE'S GETTING AWAY.
- AFTER HIM.

363
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,833
- ( muttering angrily )

364
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,083
- LOOKS LIKE RIN GOT
WHAT HE WISHED FOR.

365
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,041
NOW, EVERYTHING
IS BACK TO NORMAL.

366
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,625
- WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH
OF THOSE GUYS LATELY.

367
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,666
- MAYBE THEY WERE ALL
TOO BUSY STUDYING.

368
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,666
I'M SURE EVEN THEY WANTED
TO DO WELL ON THEIR EXAMS.

369
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,750
- OKAY, I'LL JUST CROSS RIN OFF
THE KARAOKE LIST. DONE.

370
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,541
- ( whimpers )

371
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,666
- DAMN, WHERE DID THAT BOY
RUN OFF TO?

372
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,958
- ( exhales ) AM I SAFE?

373
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,208
- ( sighs ) YOU'D THINK THEY'D
STOP TRYING AT SOME POINT.

374
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,625
- SIA?
- HUH?

375
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,083
- ( giggles ) HI, RIN.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

376
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,250
- DIDN'T YOU GO OUT TO CELEBRATE
WITH EVERYONE ELSE?

377
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,583
- UH, NO.

378
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,375
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO
GO HOME AFTER SCHOOL

379
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,000
TO MAKE DINNER FOR MY DAD
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

380
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,000
BUT IT STARTED
RAINING REALLY HARD.

381
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,375
SO, NOW, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

382
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,291
- YOU DON'T HAVE AN UMBRELLA?

383
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,166
- I KIND OF LIKE IT
WHEN IT RAINS.

384
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,458
SO, I DON'T USUALLY
CARRY ONE AROUND WITH ME.

385
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,000
- I GOTCHA.
- UH, YOU SURE?

386
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,625
- THANKS A LOT.
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

387
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,041
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO FEEL SORRY ABOUT.

388
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,916
BESIDES, YOU LIVE RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO ME.

389
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,333
ANYWAY, HOW COULD I
POSSIBLY ABANDON SOMEONE

390
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,458
WHO FOUGHT SO BRAVELY TO
PROTECT MANKIND?

391
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,166
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

392
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,916
- WELL, BY PASSING ENOUGH TESTS
TO AVOID SUMMER SCHOOL,

393
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,208
YOU'VE SAVED THE ENTIRE
HUMAN RACE FROM EXTINCTION,

394
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,583
HAVEN'T YOU?

395
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,291
- ( chuckles ) I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THAT

396
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,958
UNTIL WE GET MY
TEST RESULTS BACK.

397
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,333
- EITHER WAY, YOU'VE
WORKED REALLY HARD.

398
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,208
I'M PROUD TO BE SHARING THIS
UMBRELLA WITH YOU.

399
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:07,291
- REALLY? THANKS AND YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE RAIN.

400
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,416
- HEY NOW.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

401
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,416
- OH, NO, YOU'RE
GETTING ALL WET.

402
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,916
- AW, THAT'S NO BIGGIE.

403
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,875
I MEAN THERE ARE TWO OF US
TRYING TO SHARE ONE UMBRELLA.

404
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,791
SO, IT MAKES SENSE THAT I'D
BE GETTING A LITTLE WET.

405
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,791
- BUT YOU...
- HUH? WHAT IS IT?

406
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
- NOTHING.
- TELL ME.

407
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,541
- I WAS JUST THINKING,
YOU'RE AN AMAZINGLY NICE GUY.

408
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,291
- YOU THINK SO? I THOUGHT
I WAS PRETTY NORMAL.

409
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,500
- NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE REALLY
VERY KIND. I KNOW.

410
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,416
- ( laughs )

411
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,750
- Rin: COME ON, HURRY IT UP.

412
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,083
- Sia: HEY, WAIT FOR ME, RIN.

413
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,375
- ( both laughing )

414
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,375
- AH.

415
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,750
- YOU HAVE A VERY SPECIAL
QUALITY ABOUT YOU, RIN.

416
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,750
YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

417
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,458
THAT'S WHY RINA AND I BOTH
FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

418
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,000
- HMM.

419
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:26,166
- HERE, COME CLOSER.
THAT WAY, YOU WON'T GET WET.

420
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,291
BUT, UM...

421
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:32,000
- SEE? WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE RAIN NOW?

422
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,166
- ( theme song playing )

423
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

424
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,708
- Sia: OUR GROCERY BILL
HAD BEEN REALLY HIGH, LATELY.

425
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,166
- Kaede: THEN WHY DON'T
YOU START A GARDEN,

426
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,083
OR PICK WILD BERRIES
OR SOMETHING?

427
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,416
- THAT DOES IT.

428
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,750
I'M GONNA MAKE DAD GET HIS OWN
MEALS FROM NOW ON.

429
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,416
- NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE EPISODE
4, "EGG OMELET OF HAPPINESS."

430
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,041
- Eustomasia: WHERE AM I
SUPPOSED TO GET A CHICKEN?

431
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,250
- GO CATCH ONE.
