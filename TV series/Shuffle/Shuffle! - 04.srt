1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,041
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,875
- ( clock chiming )

4
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,416
- ( coughing )

5
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,375
- Rin: ARE YOU OKAY?

6
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,541
- UH-HUH.

7
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,500
( continues coughing )

8
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,750
- HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

9
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,375
SEE, IF YOU DO IT THIS WAY,
YOU WON'T BREATHE IT IN.

10
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,250
- YOU'RE SO CLEVER, RIN.

11
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,916
- UH... IT'S REALLY NOT
ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,541
- HERE, LET ME TRY IT.

13
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,208
( coughing )

14
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,708
- TRY HOLDING IT
DOWN HERE. LIKE THIS.

15
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,125
- THANK YOU, I...

16
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,000
- OH, UH,
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

17
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,541
- Mayumi: HEY, YOU GUYS
KISSING OVER THERE?

18
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,708
WITH TONGUES?

19
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,541
- HEY, NO KISSING!

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,083
- THANK YOU FOR HELPING.

21
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,625
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

22
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,166
SOMEBODY HAS TO DUMP
THE TRASH AFTER ALL.

23
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,333
- BUT, IT'S MY JOB.

24
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,291
- HEY, IT'S EVERYBODY'S JOB.

25
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,333
AND BESIDES, NO GIRL
SHOULD EVER HAVE TO

26
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,041
CARRY THE TRASH
ALL BY HERSELF.

27
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,250
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

28
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,833
ANYWAY, I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT

29
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,041
I'M GETTING A CHANCE TO SPEND
TIME WITH YOU LIKE THIS.

30
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,458
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
A DREAM OF MINE.

31
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,958
NOW THAT I'M ACTUALLY HERE,

32
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,791
MY DREAM'S FINALLY COMING TRUE
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

33
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,791
- NERINE.

34
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,333
- Man: ( guffaws ) OH PLEASE!

35
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,125
- IT'S SHOCKING!

36
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,958
I'VE HEARD THAT BOY,
RIN TSUCHIMI,

37
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,041
IS QUITE THE WOMANIZER!

38
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,375
- YES! I'VE HEARD THAT EVEN
THOUGH HE'S LIVING WITH KAEDE,

39
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,333
THE BELOVED PRINCESS
OF OUR SCHOOL,

40
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:35,083
HE'S AFTER THE PRINCESSES OF
THE GOD AND DEMON WORLDS, TOO!

41
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,875
THIS GUY IS AN ANIMAL!

42
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,041
- WHAT'S UP WITH YOU TWO?

43
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,750
- OH, SO NOW YOU'RE HOOKING
UP WITH PRINCESSES

44
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,416
SO YOU CAN BECOME
KING OF THE WORLD.

45
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
AH, DISGUSTING!

46
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,541
- JERKS. JUST IGNORE THEM,
IT'S OKAY.

47
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,708
( exclaims )

48
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,750
- ( rumbling )

49
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,625
- ( inhales ) I WON'T LET ANYONE
GET AWAY WITH INSULTING RIN!

50
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,666
- ( both screaming )

51
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,583
- UH, UM, NERINE?

52
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,833
- HOLD ON A SECOND, RIN.

53
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,083
I'M NOT QUITE FINISHED
WITH THESE TWO JUST YET.

54
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "FINISHED?"

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,291
- ( glass shattering )
- ( both screaming )

56
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,333
- WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

57
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,000
- YOU TRYING TO KILL US?

58
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,708
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

59
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,333
YOUR SUFFERING
WON'T LAST TOO MUCH LONGER.

60
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,625
- NERINE! NO!

61
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:30,125
- NOW I'M GONNA SEND YOU
STRAIGHT INTO HELL!

62
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,500
- ( explosion )

63
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,791
- FORTUNATELY THERE WERE
NO CASUALTIES.

64
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,208
BUT, ONE MISSTEP AND
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN

65
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,833
A MAJOR CATASTROPHE!

66
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,208
- BE GLAD THE DAMAGE WAS MINOR.

67
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,375
IT LOOKS LIKE NERINE IS FINALLY
LEARNING TO CONTROL HER POWER .

68
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,500
- THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF MINOR DAMAGE?

69
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,250
- OH, ABSOLUTELY! I MEAN,
IF NERINE HAD USED ALL HER POWER

70
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,250
SHE COULD HAVE BLOWN THIS ENTIRE
SCHOOL TO KINGDOM COME! TWICE!

71
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,625
- SORRY. THEY WERE INSULTING
RIN, SO I COULDN'T HELP IT.

72
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,208
- NERINE, YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

73
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,958
IN FACT, I'M UNBELIEVABLY PROUD

74
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,958
THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO
CONTROL YOUR MAGIC SO WELL!

75
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,750
MAYBE, IT'S BECAUSE OF
YOUR LOVE FOR RIN!

76
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,416
( laughing )

77
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,208
- THIS IS FUNNY TO YOU?
- NO.

78
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,125
- ( door opening )
- Eustoma: YO! MABO!

79
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,791
I HEARD THAT NERINE'S
BEEN GETTING INTO SOME MISCHIEF.

80
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,166
- WELL, THERE WERE SOME
LITTLE DEVILS INSULTING RIN,

81
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,958
SO NERINE GAVE THEM
WHAT THEY DESERVED. THAT'S ALL.

82
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,000
- OH... I SEE.

83
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,458
IN THAT CASE,
I HOPE NERINE SENT THEM

84
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,416
ON A LITTLE TOUR
OF THE UNDERWORLD!

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,333
( laughing )

86
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,000
UGH! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THIS SITUATION.

87
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,333
- HEY! NO BIG DEAL.

88
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,375
MY BEST TEAM OF MAGICIANS
WILL FIX EVERYTHING,

89
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,708
SO DON'T GET YOUR
PANTIES IN A BUNCH!

90
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,666
- IT'S NOW TIME FOR
A FATHER - TEACHER CONFERENCE.

91
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
SO WE CAN DEAL WITH
THE ROOT OF THIS PROBLEM.

92
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,166
- Forbesii: NO, NO! WE'RE
GOING HOME TO CELEBRATE!

93
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,833
- YOU WILL STAY HERE!

94
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:52,875
- ( both exclaiming )

95
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,125
- YOU MEAN, YOU WERE
WAITING FOR US?

96
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,583
- OF COURSE. ARE YOU OKAY?

97
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,041
- WE HEARD YOU TRIED TO DO
DIRTY THINGS TO NERINE

98
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,833
AND SHE GOT MAD
AND USED HER MAGIC

99
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,250
TO BLOW YOU TO SMITHEREENS,
SO WE WERE WORRIED.

100
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,083
- IF YOU KEEP ON MAKING UP
WEIRD RUMORS LIKE THAT

101
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,875
YOU MIGHT JUST END UP SUFFERING
THE SAME FATE AS THAT GYM.

102
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,833
- NERINE, YOU'RE PRETTY
INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU GET MAD!

103
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,416
- I'M SORRY.

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,833
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT!

105
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,583
IF I WAS THERE, I WOULD HAVE
KNOCKED THEM DEAD WITH A CHAIR!

106
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,041
- PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

107
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,291
- DOES THIS MEAN YOU TWO
ARE ALLOWED TO GO HOME NOW?

108
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,666
- YEAH. ACTUALLY,
FORBESII AND EUSTOMA

109
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,958
SEEM TO BE IN MORE TROUBLE
THAN EITHER OF US.

110
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,166
- Sia: MY DAD'S IN TROUBLE?
NO WAY!

111
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,583
ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT REALLY SURE
HOW THAT HAPPENED.

112
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,625
- I'M SO SORRY I'VE
MADE SUCH A MESS

113
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,708
AND CAUSED EVERYONE
TO WORRY SO MUCH.

114
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:46,000
- OH, RINA.
PLEASE DON'T BE UPSET!

115
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,916
- SO, YOU DID ALL OF THAT
FOR ME, RIGHT?

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,041
I'M SORRY FOR THE GYM,
BUT IT MADE ME FEEL GOOD.

117
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,291
- I'M SO GLAD!

118
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,250
- THANKS A LOT, RINA.

119
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,291
- UH! COME ON. THAT'S ENOUGH,
YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS.

120
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,625
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GET A ROOM?

121
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,791
- WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD
HEAD HOME, TOO.

122
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:09,916
- YEAH, SURE.

123
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,291
RIN? IS IT OKAY?

124
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,208
IF I FALL MORE IN LOVE WITH YOU?

125
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,666
- ( heart beats )

126
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,583
- ( door opens )

127
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,083
- GOOD MORNING. ( gasps )

128
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,750
PRIMULA?

129
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,625
- MORNING RIN.

130
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,916
- WHAT THE HECK IS SHE
DOING IN MY DRESS SHIRT?

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
- I'M SORRY.
I WASHED RIMU'S PAJAMAS

132
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,458
BUT THEY WEREN'T DRY IN TIME.

133
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,625
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
GIVE HER ONE OF YOURS?

134
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,666
- I TRIED TO GIVE HER MINE.

135
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,333
SHE INSISTED ON WEARING
ONE OF YOURS INSTEAD.

136
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,708
- NICE?

137
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,333
- ( groans )

138
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,958
OH, I NEED TO PAY
MORE ATTENTION TO PRIMULA

139
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,375
OR THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT
KINDS OF THINGS SHE MIGHT DO.

140
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,416
- ( doorbell ringing )

141
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,250
- MORNING, RIN!

142
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,375
- GOOD MORNING, RIN.

143
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,708
- ( sighs ) GOOD MORNING,
SIA, RINA.

144
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,916
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY
TODAY, ISN'T IT?

145
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,708
RIN, IS IT OKAY IF I FALL
EVEN MORE IN LOVE WITH YOU?

146
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,083
- HEY! WHERE'S KAEDE?

147
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,041
- SHE'S MAKING LUNCH.

148
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,833
- HERE, RIN! IT'S READY!

149
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,416
- THANK YOU.
BUT, WHERE'S YOURS?

150
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,916
- ( gasps ) I FORGOT!

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,916
- KAEDE WORKS REALLY HARD,
DOESN'T SHE?

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,333
- SHE DOES. PRIMULA'S HERE NOW,

153
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,500
SO SHE HAS TO MAKE
LUNCH FOR THREE OF US.

154
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,458
- I WANNA MAKE LUNCH
FOR YOU SOMETIME, RIN!

155
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,041
- OH! THAT WOULD BE NICE.

156
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,541
- YAY! WHY DON'T WE COOK
FOR HIM TOGETHER, RINA!

157
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,166
- ( hesitatingly ) YEAH.

158
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,208
- ( clock chiming )

159
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,708
- ( students chattering )

160
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,583
- ( Itsuki laughing )

161
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,541
HEY, YOU REMEMBER THE PROMISE
WE MADE BEFORE THE EXAM, RIGHT?

162
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,958
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
BUT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

163
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,333
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF TODAY!

164
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,916
- HMMM. WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT,
AREN'T WE?

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,500
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,

166
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,583
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY WAY
YOU COULD HAVE POSSIBLY GOTTEN

167
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,708
A BETTER GRADE THAN ME,
SO BRING IT ON!

168
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,416
- OH, I SEE.
WELL, SHOW ME THEN!

169
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
- HERE...
- WE GO!

170
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,958
- NO WAY!

171
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,500
- COME ON. DON'T BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

172
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,583
I WOULD SAY I GOT LUCKY, EXCEPT
THAT I'M OBVIOUSLY SMARTER.

173
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,000
( laughing deviously )

174
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,708
- YOU ACTUALLY GOT A GOOD
ENOUGH GRADE TO BEAT ITSUKI?

175
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,083
- YEAH, I DID.

176
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,583
THAT'S GREAT. I DID PRETTY
WELL ON MINE, TOO.

177
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,125
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

178
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,625
WE SHOULD ALL BE ABLE TO
ENJOY OUR SUMMER BREAK...

179
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,625
- WORRY FREE.
- RINA! WE NEED A FAVOR!

180
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,250
- PLEASE BLOW UP THE SCHOOL!

181
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,083
- ( gasping )

182
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,916
- OHH! WHY WASN'T I BORN
A FULL - FLEDGED DEMON

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,666
INSTEAD OF A HALF - BLOOD?

184
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,625
- COME ON, RINA! PLEASE!
JUST BLOW THIS JOINT UP!

185
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,125
- LEMME GUESS. YOU GUYS
FAILED, DIDN'T YOU?

186
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,083
- ( both exclaiming )

187
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,000
- UM. WHY ARE YOU ASKING
ME TO BLOWUP THE SCHOOL

188
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,833
FOR SUCH A SILLY REASON?

189
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,125
- BECAUSE YOU
ALMOST DID IT YESTERDAY.

190
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,166
- OH, RIGHT, BUT I WAS ONLY
TRYING TO HELP RIN.

191
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,208
- SO YOU WOULD DO IT
IF I ASKED YOU TO?

192
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,375
- OF COURSE!

193
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,166
- ( groans )

194
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,791
- DO IT, RIN!
C'MON, WISH FOR IT!

195
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,958
WISH FOR THE SCHOOL TO BLOW UP!

196
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,125
- NO.

197
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,041
- ( sobbing ) THIS IS SO UNFAIR!

198
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,875
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING,
RINA! SCHOOL! MAGIC!

199
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,791
YOU'RE GOOD AT EVERYTHING
AND I'M NOT!

200
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,041
- YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE, SIA!

201
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,416
- THERE'S NO GOD
IN THIS CRUEL WORLD!

202
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,000
- Rin: I DON'T THINK
YOUR DAD WOULD LIKE IT

203
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,083
IF HE HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

204
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:49,125
- ( students chattering )

205
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,958
- Kaede: OH, COME ON,
YOU TWO! CHEER UP!

206
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,166
- ( both moaning )

207
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,041
- HEY, WAIT. I THINK
I KNOW OF A WAY

208
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,958
YOU CAN AVOID
SUMMER SCHOOL CLASSES

209
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,083
JUST DO A PAPER
ON LAPLACE'S THEORY.

210
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,333
- COME ON, LIKE
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

211
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:06,000
- WHAT? RINA, YOU CAN WRITE
ABOUT THAT STUFF? NO WAY!

212
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,541
- YEAH. IT'S EASY
IF YOU PAY ATTENTION.

213
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,833
- ALL RIGHT! CAN I
HAVE YOUR NOTES?

214
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,958
- SURE, I GUESS YOU CAN.

215
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,791
- YOU'RE A LIFESAVER! IT'S
SO GREAT TO HAVE A FRIEND

216
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,916
WHO'S AS GOOD AT
EVERYTHING AS YOU!

217
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,000
- I THINK MY APPETITE IS FINALLY
STARTING TO COME BACK!

218
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,208
- OF COURSE, RIN'S LUNCH
LOOKS REALLY GOOD

219
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,791
BECAUSE KAEDE MADE IT,

220
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,458
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT YOURS AND
NERINE'S LUNCH TO LOOK SO YUMMY!

221
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,833
- UM, WELL...

222
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,375
- DID YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF?

223
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,416
- UM-HM. WHILE I'M
EATING BREAKFAST

224
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,625
I TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT
I SHOULD PUT IN MY LUNCH.

225
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,666
THE MORNING GOES BY
A LOT QUICKER THAT WAY!

226
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,166
- HM. I DO THE SAME THING,
ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE.

227
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,875
HOW 'BOUT YOU, RINA?

228
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,291
- UH, WELL, I...

229
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,916
- MAN!

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,833
WHEN IT COMES TO LUNCHES,
NOTHING CAN BEAT HOME - MADE!

231
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,083
( chomping )

232
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,666
- OH, SURE.

233
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,666
- YEAH, YOU ALWAYS HAVE
A HOME - MADE LUNCH, TOO,

234
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,958
DON'T YOU?

235
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,125
- 'COURSE I DO!

236
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,916
- SO, WHO IS IT FROM THIS TIME?

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,791
- A FRESHMAN.

238
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,291
THEY'RE STILL SO
INNOCENT AND TRUSTING

239
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,416
WHEN THEY'RE THAT
YOUNG. TURNS ME ON.

240
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,375
- YOU'RE SUCH A SLIME-BUCKET.

241
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,375
DIDN'T YOU GET YOUR LUNCH
FROM A JUNIOR YESTERDAY?

242
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,375
- YES, I DID. AND THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

243
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,666
- UGH! YOU SUCK!

244
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,208
- ( laughing )

245
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,791
HEY! SINCE THERE
ARE SO MANY OF US

246
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,541
WHO LIKE TO MAKE
HOME- MADE LUNCHES!

247
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,416
WHY DON'T WE PLAN
A BIG PICNIC FOR NEXT SUNDAY?

248
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,958
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN!

249
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,500
- AGREED! WE COULD SAMPLE
EACH OTHER'S FOOD THAT WAY!

250
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,375
- I'M NOT TOUCHING YOURS.

251
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,666
BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY WHATEVER
NERINE AND SIA BRING FOR LUNCH!

252
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,458
- I GET IT. SO MY
COOKING SUCKS. FINE.

253
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,750
- HUH?

254
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,375
SO RIN IS GOING TO BE
EATING MY LUNCH.

255
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,916
I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD MAKE!

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,375
RINA! DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BRING?

257
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,750
- WELL, I, UH...

258
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,375
- I'M SURE IT'LL BE GREAT!

259
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,875
- Kaede: HEY, RIN, I HAVE
A QUESTION ABOUT SUNDAY.

260
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,875
- SURE, WHAT IS IT?

261
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,541
- ASA OVERHEARD US
TALKING ABOUT THE PICNIC,

262
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,791
AND SHE WANTS TO COME WITH US,

263
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,166
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

264
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,666
- YEAH, OF COURSE IT IS.

265
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,833
- OH, GOOD. ITSUKI AND
MAYUMI DIDN'T MIND, EITHER.

266
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,500
- AND NERINE?
- I THINK SHE ALREADY LEFT.

267
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,750
- THAT'S UNUSUAL. BUT I'M SURE
SHE WON'T MIND IF ASA COMES.

268
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,416
- ALL RIGHT! THEN
WE'LL GO AND TELL ASA

269
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,125
THAT SHE'S MORE THAN
WELCOME TO COME!

270
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,250
- YEAH!
- ( Kaede giggles )

271
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,458
- ( sighs )

272
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,750
- Kaede: THAT'S IT.
CUT LITTLE CHUNKS.

273
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,541
NOW BE CAREFUL. IT'S OKAY
TO GO SLOW AT FIRST.

274
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:55,958
- HEY, WHATCHA DOIN' THERE?

275
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,375
- WHOA! WHAT'S THAT FOR?

276
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,500
- COOKING.

277
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,541
- YOU'RE COOKING?

278
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,166
- RIMU TOLD ME SHE REALLY
WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO.

279
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,125
SO I'M TEACHING HER THE BASICS.

280
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,458
- THAT'S GREAT!

281
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,875
I GUESS PRIMULA'S GOT
A DOMESTIC SIDE TO HER.

282
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,875
SO HOW'S IT GOING SO FAR,
IS SHE DOING WELL?

283
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,000
- GOOD.

284
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,625
- ( whimpers )

285
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,458
- SHE HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

286
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,166
- WELL, SHE SHOULDN'T
HAVE ANY PROBLEMS

287
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,625
WITH YOU AS HER INSTRUCTOR.

288
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,458
- BUT I THINK SHE WOULD
LEARN A LOT FASTER

289
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,625
IF SHE COULD TAKE
LESSONS FROM ASA.

290
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,208
- ASA?

291
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,500
- SHE'S REALLY AMAZING.
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO COOK!

292
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,958
- IF SHE'S WILLING,

293
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,375
MAYBE WE COULD GET HER TO
COME AND TEACH A LITTLE BIT.

294
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,791
NO, YOU.

295
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,666
- ( Rin chuckles )

296
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,041
- OKAY THEN. LET'S REVIEW
HOW TO HOLD THE KNIFE.

297
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,583
THIS WAY, REMEMBER?

298
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,791
- THAT'S IT.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

299
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,125
- ( paper shuffling )

300
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,791
- ( tapping )

301
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,958
- Man: DON'T RELY
ON YOUR EYES! FEEL IT!

302
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,791
- Rin: SHE'S GONE AGAIN?

303
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,291
- I REALLY WANTED TO
MAKE PLANS WITH HER

304
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,833
FOR THE PICNIC, YOU KNOW?

305
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,208
- SHE WASN'T HERE FOR
LUNCH, EITHER, WAS SHE?

306
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,250
- NO. IT SEEMS LIKE SHE'S
BEEN LEAVING TO GO SOMEWHERE

307
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,708
AS SOON AS CLASS GETS OUT.

308
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,708
- I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

309
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,291
- MAYUMI AND SIA WERE WORRIED

310
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,333
THAT SOMETHING MIGHT
BE GOING ON WITH HER.

311
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,458
- I SEE.

312
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,791
- ( door opens )

313
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,625
- NERINE!

314
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,875
- OH! ASA!

315
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,791
- ARE YOU OKAY?
LET ME SEE THAT.

316
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,541
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.
HOLD ON, GIMME A SECOND.

317
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,583
- WOW, THOSE ARE HANDY.

318
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,041
- YEAH, THEY'RE A NECESSITY
FOR COOKING CLUB.

319
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,875
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, ASA!

320
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,458
- WELL, YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

321
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,791
BUT, WHAT'RE YOU DOING
HERE ALL ALONE?

322
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,208
YOU'RE COOKING?

323
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,375
- UM, ASA, WILL YOU...
- HMM?

324
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,666
- WILL YOU TEACH ME
HOW TO COOK?

325
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,416
- HEY! WELCOME HOME!

326
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,000
- WHAT ARE YOU
STANDING OUT HERE FOR?

327
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,375
- WELL, NERINE IS
LATER THAN USUAL

328
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,416
GETTING HOME FROM SCHOOL.

329
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,291
DO YOU HAPPEN TO
KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

330
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,333
- NO, I'M AFRAID SHE WAS
ALREADY GONE WHEN WE LEFT.

331
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,833
- HMM...

332
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,333
- DO YOU THINK SHE MIGHT
HAVE STOPPED SOMEWHERE

333
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,833
TO DO SOME SHOPPING?

334
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,208
IT'S STILL EARLY AFTER ALL.

335
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,375
- HUH. I GUESS
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

336
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,875
BUT SHE USUALLY
COMES STRAIGHT HOME

337
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,625
SO FORGIVE ME IF I'M WORRIED.

338
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,333
- WE COULD GO LOOK
FOR HER IF YOU WANT.

339
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,875
- NO! THAT'S OKAY. I'LL JUST
WAIT HERE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

340
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,875
- I HOPE SHE COMES HOME SOON.

341
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,916
- ( chuckles )

342
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,125
- I WONDER WHERE SHE COULD BE?

343
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,958
- Asa: IT'S VERY SHARP, SO
KEEP YOUR FINGERS TUCKED IN.

344
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,083
- 'KAY.

345
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,458
- COME ON, YOU NEED TO
RELAX A LITTLE BIT.

346
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,583
- 'KAY.

347
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,041
- ( door closes )

348
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,250
- Rin: WHERE'S NERINE?

349
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,375
- I THINK THAT SHE LEFT
FOR SCHOOL ALREADY.

350
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,166
HMM?

351
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,250
- AS WE ALL KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE
FOR HUMANS TO BE SPIRITED AWAY

352
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,333
FROM OUR WORLD TO OTHER REALMS.

353
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,000
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE FOR
BEINGS FROM OTHER REALMS

354
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,833
TO APPEAR IN OUR WORLD.

355
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,791
- TSUCCHI.

356
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,666
YOU OWE ME A TEN PAGE REPORT
ON THIS BY TOMORROW!

357
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,833
- NO WAY!

358
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,291
- ( students laughing )

359
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,708
- NERINE!

360
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,916
- WHAT IS IT, RIN?

361
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,958
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN RECENTLY?

362
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,291
I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN COMING
HOME FROM SCHOOL LATE.

363
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,500
AND NOW EVERYONE'S
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

364
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,333
WHAT'S WRONG?

365
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,916
- COME ON. DON'T PRESSURE HER,

366
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,333
MAYBE SHE'S NOT READY TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT YET.

367
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,958
- COME ON, ASA.
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

368
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,750
- NOW, RIN. A GIRL HAS EVERY
RIGHT TO KEEP A SECRET

369
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,666
FOR AS LONG AS SHE WANTS TO.

370
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,791
YOU BE PATIENT.
IT'S UP TO NERINE

371
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,208
TO TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON,

372
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,458
WHEN AND IF SHE
DECIDES SHE'S READY.

373
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,625
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
DON'T YOU TRUST HER JUDGMENT?

374
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,875
CATCH YOU LATER!

375
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,250
RINA, DO YOU NEED TO
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK?

376
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,708
- I'M SORRY.

377
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,291
- SO WHY DID YOU WANT TO
KEEP THIS A SECRET FROM RIN?

378
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,750
WHAT'S WRONG, NERINE?

379
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,583
- UH, WELL, IT'S JUST...

380
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,125
RIN SAID THAT HE WAS
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

381
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,166
TO EATING THE LUNCH
I WAS MAKING, SO...

382
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,458
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT I COULDN'T COOK.

383
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,708
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN
TO LIE TO HIM, BUT

384
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,666
WHEN I IMAGINED HOW DISAPPOINTED
IN ME HE WOULD BE,

385
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,833
I JUST COULDN'T
TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

386
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,625
- OH, I GET IT!

387
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,583
YOU MUST REALLY LIKE RIN
A WHOLE LOT, IS THAT IT?

388
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,750
- YEAH.

389
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,500
- THIS'LL BE EASY THEN!

390
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,875
A MEAL ALWAYS
TURNS OUT THE BEST

391
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,500
WHEN IT'S MADE FOR
SOMEONE SPECIAL.

392
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,458
JUST PUT YOUR HEART AND SOUL
INTO IT AND IT'LL BE DELICIOUS!

393
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,708
- HMM.

394
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,833
- YOU KNOW, I REALLY THINK

395
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,500
YOU SHOULD TELL RIN
THE TRUTH, THOUGH.

396
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,833
IT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

397
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,083
DON'T LOOK SO WORRIED!
IT'LL BE FINE!

398
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,958
BEFORE SUNDAY, I'LL TEACH YOU
A VERY SPECIAL RECIPE!

399
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,250
IT'LL BE AN ABSOLUTE SUCCESS!
I PROMISE YOU!

400
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,833
- THANK YOU.
I'M VERY GRATEFUL.

401
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,625
- NOW GO FIND RIN. THE POOR
GUY'S WORRIED SICK!

402
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:33,083
- 'KAY. THANK YOU, ASA!

403
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,541
- OH, BY THE WAY, I
WAS KIND OF WONDERING

404
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,791
IF MAYBE YOU LIKED
RIN, TOO. DO YOU?

405
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,541
- ( gasps ) WHY DO YOU ASK?

406
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,583
- I HAD A FEELING.

407
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,833
- SILLY! HE AND I ARE
JUST FRIENDS, THAT'S ALL!

408
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,458
HURRY! YOU BETTER GO FIND HIM!

409
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,583
- RIGHT!

410
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,500
- ( sighs )

411
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,333
- ( footsteps approaching )
- ( door opens )

412
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,375
- ( panting )

413
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,083
- NERINE.

414
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,208
- HELLO.

415
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,958
- WHAT IS IT?

416
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,208
- I JUST... I WANTED
YOU TO KNOW THE TRUTH

417
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,500
BEFORE WE WENT ON
THE PICNIC TOGETHER.

418
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,666
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK.

419
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,875
MY DAD'S BEEN MAKING
MY LUNCHES FOR ME.

420
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,041
- NERINE...

421
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,458
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIDE IT,

422
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,333
BUT I WAS AFRAID I WOULD
DISAPPOINT YOU, SO...

423
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,833
- SO, ASA WAS GIVING YOU
COOKING LESSONS?

424
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,208
- I'M SORRY.

425
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,958
- HOW SILLY!

426
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,833
YOU DON'T NEED TO
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT!

427
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,500
- BUT...

428
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,125
- YOU SHOULD NEVER
EVER BE AFRAID

429
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,375
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH,
OKAY, NERINE?

430
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,333
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT
WHATEVER YOU COOK FOR ME

431
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,875
WILL BE DELICIOUS.

432
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,500
IT'S SETTLED THEN.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT!

433
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,416
- SO AM I!

434
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,875
- WELL, I DON'T WANT TO
INTERRUPT YOUR LESSONS.

435
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,708
SO, I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

436
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,125
IT WOULDN'T BE ANY FUN
IF I SAW WHAT YOU WERE MAKING.

437
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,666
IT WOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE.

438
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,875
- RIN, THANK YOU.

439
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,875
- WELL, RINA, I'LL
SEE YOU ON SUNDAY.

440
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,375
HAVE FUN COOKING!
I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY YOUR LUNCH!

441
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,416
- ( giggling )

442
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,250
- ( giggling )

443
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,791
- All: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

444
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,041
- HERE.

445
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,208
- IS IT OKAY TO OPEN IT?

446
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,291
- Both: HUH?

447
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,958
- UH, UM-HM.

448
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:35,875
- All: UHH...

449
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,833
- IT'S AN OMELET.

450
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,750
- I'M REALLY SORRY. YOU SEE,
SO FAR, IT'S ALL I CAN MAKE.

451
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,916
- THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
OMELET I'VE EVER SEEN.

452
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,291
I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT IT!

453
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,000
WOW! IT'S SO GOOD!
IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

454
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,625
YUM! NEED MORE!

455
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,833
- DON'T HOG IT ALL!

456
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,875
LET ME TRY!

457
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,208
- Itsuki: I CAN'T WAIT TO TEST
DRIVE SOME OF NERINE'S OMELET!

458
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,583
- NO! THIS IS MINE!
NERINE MADE IT FOR ME!

459
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,833
- HEY!
- NO FAIR!

460
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,291
- Rin: STOP IT! I'LL BITE YOU!
- Kaede: COME ON, SHARE!

461
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,333
- Rin: I'M SERIOUS!

462
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,708
THERE'S ONLY ENOUGH FOR ME!

463
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,125
- ( theme song playing )

464
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

465
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,791
- Nerine: I HATE
WAKING UP EARLY!

466
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,750
- Kaede: TRY GOING TO
BED EARLIER, SILLY!

467
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,291
