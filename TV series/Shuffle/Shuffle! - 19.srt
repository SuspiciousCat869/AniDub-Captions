1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,583
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,375
- ( thunder rumbles )

4
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,500
- Kaede: I WISH YOU WERE DEAD.

5
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,250
I MEAN IT.

6
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,666
JUST DIE!

7
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,125
- OH, NO.

8
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,291
- HI, THERE! THERE'S SOME
FOOD FOR YOU ON THE TABLE.

9
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,833
- THANK YOU.

10
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,291
IT'S WEIRD YOU DIDN'T
WAKE ME UP THIS MORNING.

11
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,500
- IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A
SCHOOL DAY OR ANYTHING.

12
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,333
I JUST THOUGHT I'D
LET YOU SLEEP IN.

13
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,500
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

14
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,375
YOUR FOOD'S PROBABLY
GOTTEN PRETTY COLD.

15
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,000
- HEY, DON'T BOTHER.

16
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,083
I'M GOING TO HEAD OUT IN A SEC
AND MEET UP WITH ASA, ANYWAY.

17
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,916
- YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY?

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,750
- SORRY, WE'LL GET FOOD. BYE!

19
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,583
- SEE YOU LATER.

20
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,875
I GUESS WHILE HE'S OUT
WE SHOULD TRY TO FINISH

21
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,125
WITH THE DISHES AND GET
SOME OTHER CLEANING DONE.

22
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,291
YOU'LL HELP, RIGHT?

23
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,291
I'M SURE WE CAN KEEP BUSY.

24
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,375
- Woman: I HEARD SHE WAS ON
HER WAY BACK FROM A TRIP

25
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,208
WHEN SHE WAS IN THE ACCIDENT.

26
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,625
- Man: SHE'D GONE WITH
MR. AND MRS. TSUCHIMI.

27
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,541
- Woman: AND NOW, HE'S GOING
TO HAVE TO RAISE HIS DAUGHTER

28
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,458
ALL BY HIMSELF.

29
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,416
THAT'S ROUGH.

30
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,958
- NOT JUST HER.

31
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,416
HE'S GOING TO BE TAKING IN THE
TSUCHIMIS' ONLY CHILD, TOO.

32
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,000
- Woman: OH, WOW.

33
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,750
- RIN, WOULD YOU MIND
IF I ASKED YOU TO HELP

34
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,291
TAKE CARE OF KAEDE
WHILE I'M GONE?

35
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,458
- I'LL BE FINE! PROMISE! RIGHT?
- YEAH!

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,083
- Man: KAEDE? KAEDE!

37
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,291
- WHAT'S WRONG?
WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

38
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,166
- Doctor: YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL

39
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,083
OVER TWO WEEKS AGO.

40
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,750
THE LOSS OF HER MOTHER WAS
OBVIOUSLY A TREMENDOUS SHOCK.

41
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,125
AS FOR HER CONDITION,

42
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,666
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH SHE'S
LOST THE WILL TO LIVE.

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,250
- DOCTOR.

44
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,541
- SHE NEEDS YOU TO GIVE HER
A REASON TO SNAP OUT OF THIS.

45
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,583
ANYTHING THAT MAKES
HER WANT TO LIVE AGAIN.

46
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,375
ANYTHING.

47
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,208
- HEY, KAEDE?

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,125
YOU CAN HEAR ME, CAN'T YOU?

49
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,875
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN.

50
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,125
IT'S ABOUT YOUR MOM.

51
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,458
IT'S JUST...

52
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,166
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL
YOU, BUT I'VE BEEN AFRAID TO.

53
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,333
I'M SORRY.
YOUR MOM DIED BECAUSE OF ME.

54
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,375
I GUESS I'M JUST SELFISH.

55
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,333
IT WAS REALLY
LONELY BEING AT HOME

56
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,833
WITHOUT MY MOM AND DAD AROUND.

57
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,875
SO, I ASKED THEM IF THERE
WAS ANY WAY THEY COULD

58
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,208
COME HOME EARLIER THAN
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO.

59
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,416
AND THEN, THEY GOT IN THAT
ACCIDENT ON THE WAY BACK.

60
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,333
THAT'S WHY.

61
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,541
KAEDE?

62
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,666
- Kaede: REALLY?
- WHAT?

63
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,625
- THAT'S...

64
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,375
THE TRUTH?

65
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,583
- YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,083
- DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON?

67
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,875
- OH, MY LITTLE GIRL!
I'M SO HAPPY!

68
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,916
I HAVE MY LITTLE GIRL BACK!
OH, MY BABY GIRL!

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,583
EVERYTHING IS OKAY!
DADDY'S HERE.

70
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,791
( crying )

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,333
- STARTING TODAY, THIS ROOM
IS GOING TO BE YOURS.

72
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,666
ALL OF YOUR THINGS HAVE
ALREADY BEEN MOVED IN THERE.

73
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,250
GET YOURSELF SETTLED
AND THEN COME DOWN

74
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,708
FOR DINNER WITH KAEDE
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

75
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,833
- OKAY.

76
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,458
- Both: WE'RE LEAVING NOW!

77
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,416
- SEE YA LATER.
YOU TWO BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

78
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,750
- HEY, KAEDE! GOOD MORNING!
- GOOD MORNING!

79
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,750
HEY, DID YOU FINISH
ALL OF YOUR HOMEWORK?

80
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,375
- I ALWAYS DO!

81
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,125
- I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK.
HOW'S IT BEEN LIVING WITH US?

82
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,833
HAVE YOU GOTTEN
USED TO IT YET?

83
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,083
- YEAH.
- THAT'S GOOD.

84
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,875
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, DEAR?

85
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,333
- ARE YOU HAPPY THAT RIN WILL BE
STAYING WITH US FROM NOW ON?

86
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,041
- MMM-HMM.

87
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,916
- ( laughing ) I'M GLAD.

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,500
- SO I WAS BUSY PRACTICING
ALL DAY YESTERDAY.

89
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,041
I THINK I'M GETTING
A LOT BETTER!

90
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,708
YOU SHOULD REALLY SPEND
MORE TIME WORKING ON IT.

91
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,000
IF YOU WANT, I CAN COME OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE AND HELP YOU.

92
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,416
I DROPPED IT.

93
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,333
PICK IT UP.

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,041
PICK IT UP.

95
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,166
- ( gasping )

96
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,583
- ( bell rings )

97
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,916
- Kaede: I WISH YOU WERE DEAD.

98
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,625
TELL ME.

99
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,625
WHY DO YOU THINK MY
MOTHER HAD TO DIE?

100
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,041
BUT YOU STILL GET TO LIVE?

101
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,166
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR.

102
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,291
I WISH YOU WERE DEAD.

103
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,125
I MEAN IT.

104
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,416
JUST DIE!

105
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,333
WHAT?

106
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,708
IT'S MY MOM?

107
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,208
IT'S ADDRESSED TO ME!

108
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,000
THE DATE IS,
THE SAME DAY SHE DIED!

109
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,791
"KAEDE, PLEASE TAKE CARE
AND GET BETTER SOON.

110
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,791
"I'D LIKE IT IF YOU COULD
COME WITH ME NEXT TIME."

111
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,375
I WAS SICK?

112
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,750
"TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
AND GET BETTER?"

113
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,458
- IT'S ME.

114
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,583
SHE'S BEEN GETTING WORSE.

115
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,750
YEAH. COUGHING AND A FEVER.

116
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,750
I FEEL BAD ASKING YOU
TO COME BACK EARLY.

117
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,958
- I WANT MOM TO COME HOME.

118
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,875
- DON'T WORRY. SHE'LL BE
BACK VERY SOON, SWEETHEART.

119
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,750
- ( coughing )

120
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,791
- YOU'RE REALLY WELL
ENOUGH FOR ME TO GO?

121
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,041
I'M STARTING TO
FEEL A BIT GUILTY.

122
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,958
RIN, WOULD YOU MIND
IF I ASKED YOU TO HELP

123
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,416
TAKE CARE OF KAEDE
WHILE I'M GONE?

124
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,541
- OH, I'LL BE FINE!

125
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,666
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME!

126
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,916
- DON'T READ THAT!

127
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,125
- YOU LIED TO ME THAT NIGHT.

128
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,375
HOW COME?

129
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:33,958
HOW COME?

130
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,083
WAS IT MY FAULT?

131
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,208
- DON'T SAY THAT.

132
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,375
- THEN I'M THE ONE.

133
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,166
- I KILLED HER.
- NO YOU DIDN'T!

134
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,583
- I'M THE ONE.

135
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,666
IT WAS MY FAULT.
SHE DIED TRYING TO GET BACK.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,708
( crying ) SHE'S DEAD
BECAUSE OF ME.

137
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,833
- Rin: KAEDE!

138
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,541
KAEDE!

139
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,541
- ( car honking )

140
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,333
- YOU OKAY?

141
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,458
- ( Kaede sobs )

142
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,625
- KAEDE?

143
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,291
- I'M SO SORRY.

144
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,708
I'M SO SORRY.

145
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,625
I'M SORRY.

146
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,166
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

147
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,375
I'M SORRY.

148
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,500
I'M SORRY!

149
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,625
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY.

150
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,208
I'M SO SORRY!

151
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,583
I'M SO SORRY, RIN.

152
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,125
RIN HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.

153
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,458
I REALLY DO OWE HIM.

154
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,166
THAT'S WHY, I'LL MAKE HIM
HAPPY ANY WAY I CAN.

155
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,750
I OWE HIM THAT MUCH.

156
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,000
- YOU GUYS SHOULD
TOTALLY DO IT!

157
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,375
GET THE "LOVEY DOVEY
TROPICAL JUICE" SPECIAL.

158
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,958
DRINKING IT TOGETHER WOULD
BE ALMOST LIKE KISSING!

159
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,708
- NO, THANKS.

160
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,166
- I THINK I'LL JUST
HAVE A MILKSHAKE.

161
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,083
- YOU TWO ARE NO FUN AT ALL.
FINE. I'LL GO GET YOUR ORDER.

162
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,625
- IS IT REALLY A GOOD
IDEA TO COME HERE

163
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,416
WHILE KAREHA'S WORKING?

164
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,791
I KNOW YOU'RE FRIENDS,

165
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,458
BUT YOU DON'T THINK SHE'LL
SPREAD RUMORS ABOUT US

166
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,541
AT SCHOOL, RIGHT?

167
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,416
- WELL, IT WOULDN'T
BOTHER ME. YOU?

168
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,666
( giggling )

169
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,166
( gasps )

170
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,416
- BESIDES, I'VE HAD A
CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT

171
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,916
WHAT HAPPENED THE
OTHER DAY, AND...

172
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,041
YOU OKAY?

173
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,458
EARTH TO ASA!

174
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,833
NOT LISTENING?

175
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,708
- THAT'S RIGHT. NOT A WORD.
- AM I THAT BORING?

176
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,541
- SORRY. I NEED TO MAKE A
QUICK RUN TO THE LADIES' ROOM.

177
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,583
( gasps )

178
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,750
- ASA!

179
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,541
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- MY GOODNESS!

180
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,083
- PLEASE SAY SOMETHING!
- OH, ASA!

181
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,875
- RIN...

182
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,208
SCOOP ME UP AND CARRY
ME LIKE A PRINCESS.

183
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,791
- THAT WAS SCARY.

184
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,500
- I GOT DIZZY WHEN I STOOD UP.

185
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,125
PROBABLY BECAUSE I
PULLED AN ALL-NIGHTER.

186
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,833
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?
LET'S GET UP.

187
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,125
- I DON'T WANT TO.

188
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,833
I'M WAY TOO COMFORTABLE WITH YOU
HOLDING ME LIKE THIS TO GET UP.

189
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,208
- ASA...

190
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,375
- ( door opening )

191
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:19,208
- YOU'RE BACK ALREADY?
THAT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG.

192
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,291
- ASA WASN'T FEELING WELL,
SO I ENDED UP WALKING HER HOME.

193
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,875
- SHE GOT SICK AGAIN?

194
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,833
- SHE SAID SHE HADN'T
GOTTEN ANY SLEEP.

195
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,500
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

196
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,208
- ARE YOU HUNGRY? IT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE YOU GOT TO EAT.

197
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,625
- NOPE.

198
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,333
THINGS WERE SO CRAZY THAT
I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT FOOD.

199
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,125
- I'LL WHIP UP
SOMETHING QUICK.

200
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,916
YOU GUYS GO HANG OUT
AND HAVE SOME FUN.

201
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,375
- HEY, YOU! WHAT'S GOING ON?

202
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,791
- WELL, UM, IT'S JUST...

203
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,125
- I KNOW! LET'S GO AND
PLAY A VIDEO GAME TOGETHER.

204
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,625
I'M GOING TO CHANGE FIRST.
IT'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

205
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,750
- Primula: OKAY.

206
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,125
- ( breathing heavily )

207
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,875
- ( knock on door )

208
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,833
- Ama: CAN I COME IN?
- YEAH, MOM!

209
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,083
- YOU DOING ANY BETTER?

210
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,666
I BROUGHT YOU SOME
MORE MEDICINE.

211
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,041
- THANKS A LOT. YOU CAN PUT
IT DOWN RIGHT OVER THERE.

212
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,375
- DON'T PUSH TOO HARD.
DATING RIN'S FUN,

213
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,791
BUT HE'LL BE TURNED OFF IF HE
ALWAYS HAS TO CARRY YOU HOME.

214
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,333
- MOM! THAT WAS MEAN.

215
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,291
- HEY, WE'RE BOTH A
COUPLE OF TROUBLEMAKERS.

216
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,416
NOW YOU REST AND I'LL
WAKE YOU FOR DINNER. OKAY?

217
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,541
- I'LL TRY.

218
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,250
- YOUR COFFEE'S GOTTEN COLD.
CAN I DUMP IT?

219
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,041
- MMM-HMM.

220
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,166
- DO YOU HAVE ANY SOLID
PLANS TOMORROW,

221
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,708
OR ARE YOU FREE
TO DO SOMETHING?

222
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,500
- HMM.

223
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,541
- I WAS THINKING THAT WE
COULD TAKE RIMU SHOPPING

224
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,041
FOR SOME NEW OUTFITS.

225
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,583
- YOU PROBABLY NEED SOME,
TOO, DON'T YOU?

226
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,375
- HMM.

227
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,875
- AND WHEN WE'RE DONE WE COULD
GO OUT TO DINNER SOMEPLACE.

228
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,375
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE
LAST TIME WE DID THAT.

229
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,583
- ( phone rings )

230
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,500
- IT'S OKAY. I GOT IT!

231
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,791
- Rin: ASA?
- RIN!

232
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,333
YOU WERE WAITING
FOR ME TO CALL!

233
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,333
I'M TOTALLY FINE NOW.

234
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,583
SORRY ABOUT THAT!

235
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,958
YEAH. LISTEN,

236
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,083
IT'S NOT REALLY TO
MAKE UP FOR EARLIER, BUT,

237
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,000
HOW ABOUT WE TRY THAT
DATING THING AGAIN?

238
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,291
- YES! GREAT!

239
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,166
THAT SOUNDS AWESOME. AND,
IT'LL BE YOUR TREAT THIS TIME!

240
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,541
MONEY'S NO OBJECT, RIGHT?

241
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,791
( laughing ) OKAY, OKAY!
YOU'RE ON! SEE YA TOMORROW!

242
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,708
- WAS THAT ASA ON THE PHONE?

243
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,541
- MMM-HMM. WE'RE GOING TO SEE
A MOVIE TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

244
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,583
- OH, WHAT ABOUT ALL
OF US GOING SHOPPING?

245
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,666
- GOING SHOPPING?

246
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,458
- NEVER MIND.

247
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,416
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

248
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,916
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT.

249
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,791
- Rin: OKAY.

250
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,000
- AFTER YOU GUYS GO TO
THE MOVIE, YOU'LL HEAD HOME?

251
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
- MMM, I HAVE NO IDEA.

252
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,833
- I'LL HAVE YOUR DINNER
ALL READY AND WAITING

253
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:20,958
FOR YOU WHEN YOU COME BACK.

254
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,416
- NAH, GO AHEAD
AND EAT WITHOUT ME.

255
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,250
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

256
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,083
- Rin: SEE YOU LATER!
I'M OUT OF HERE!

257
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,541
- UM, ARE WE STILL
GOING TO GO SHOPPING?

258
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,666
- FORGET IT, RIMU.

259
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,583
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

260
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,833
- WHERE'S RIN?
IT'S DARK OUTSIDE.

261
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,000
- IT MUST MEAN HE'S
STILL OUT HAVING FUN.

262
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,458
HE WAS PRETTY JAZZED ABOUT
GOING OUT WITH ASA TODAY,

263
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:04,333
- DON'T YOU THINK?
- I GUESS SO.

264
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,375
- I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER SEEN HIM LOOK

265
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,333
REALLY HAPPY LIKE THAT BEFORE.

266
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,541
- NOT EVEN ONCE.
- Primula: OH?

267
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,083
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS
AS LONG AS RIN'S HAPPY?

268
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,250
WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT
WITH HIM SEEING HER?

269
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,666
CAN YOU STILL BE HAPPY?

270
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,791
- Kaede: OF COURSE I CAN.

271
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,000
CARING FOR RIN
IS MY WHOLE LIFE.

272
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,458
HE'S THAT IMPORTANT TO ME.

273
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,875
HIS HAPPINESS IS
ALL THAT MATTERS.

274
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,416
- ARE YOU SURE?

275
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,083
- ( phone rings )

276
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,583
- HI, THERE.
IS THAT YOU, RIN?

277
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,208
- IT'S ME. ASA'S MOM
INVITED ME TO STAY HERE

278
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,166
AND HAVE DINNER WITH
THEM TONIGHT, SO,

279
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,208
I DON'T REALLY NEED YOU
TO MAKE ANYTHING FOR ME.

280
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,625
IF I ATE ALL THAT, I'D EXPLODE!

281
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,500
- Ama: A BOY YOUR AGE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO EAT TWICE THIS MUCH!

282
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,791
I EXPECT YOU TO
CLEAN YOUR PLATE!

283
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,333
- Asa: SHE'LL MAKE
YOU DO IT, TOO.

284
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,125
YOU'RE NOT DONE UNTIL
SHE DECIDES YOU'RE FINISHED!

285
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,791
- ANYWAY, THAT'S THE DEAL. I'LL
BE BACK LATE. DON'T WAIT UP.

286
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,041
- SO THAT'S IT, THEN.

287
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,416
- ( Kaede sobs )

288
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,625
- KAEDE?

289
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,666
KAEDE? IT'S ME.
SORRY I UPSET YOU YESTERDAY.

290
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,500
HELLO?

291
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,916
KAEDE?

292
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,458
HELLO?

293
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,541
WHERE ARE YOU?

294
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,208
- ( doorbell rings )

295
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,166
- ( gasps )

296
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,541
OH, KAEDE, NO!

297
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,083
KAEDE!

298
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,583
- HI YA!
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK!

299
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,791
- YEAH. IT'S LIKE A MILLION
YEARS SINCE YOU BEEN HERE.

300
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,125
COME ON IN!

301
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,125
- EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY
THE SAME AS I REMEMBER IT!

302
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,250
- GET OUT!

303
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,166
GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

304
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,583
GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

305
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,708
GET OUT. GET OUT.

306
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,833
GET OUT. GET OUT!

307
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,250
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- OUT!

308
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,916
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! GO AWAY!

309
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,500
- STOP IT!

310
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,875
- GIVE HIM BACK.

311
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,750
HE'S MINE.

312
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,541
- WHAT?

313
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,791
- BACK OFF!
- NO!

314
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,333
LET GO OF ME!

315
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,375
- QUIT IT!

316
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,833
- WHY ARE YOU
FREAKING OUT? DAMN!

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,916
- CUT IT OUT!
- LET GO!

318
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,958
- ( panting )

319
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,583
- JUST DIE!
