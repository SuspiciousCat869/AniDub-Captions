1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,166
- Sia: IS IT STILL
OFFICIALLY SUMMER, RIN?

4
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,500
- IT IS SUMMERTIME. YEP.

5
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,875
- THEN WE STILL HAVE
TIME TO GO TO THE BEACH.

6
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,500
- THAT'S TRUE.

7
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,791
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CAN BEAT
THE BEACH IN THE SUMMER TIME.

8
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,875
- JUST THINK OF ALL
THE WONDERFUL MEMORIES

9
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,083
WE'LL HAVE CREATED
BY THE TIME IT'S OVER.

10
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,791
- YEAH. GOOD TIMES AND GREAT
FRIENDS TO SHARE THEM WITH.

11
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,166
- UH-HUH.

12
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,833
- Nerine: UH, GUYS?
- ( both gasping )

13
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:13,458
- THIS IS NO TIME FOR DAYDREAMS.
THERE'S A LOT TO DO.

14
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,333
LIKE FINISHING OUR SUMMER
HOMEWORK BEFORE THE DAY IS DONE.

15
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,250
- OKAY.
- ALWAYS HOMEWORK.

16
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,625
- ( Rin grunts )

17
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL.

18
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,625
- WHICH PART?
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU.

19
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:41,375
- HERE, THIS EQUATION
MAKES NO SENSE.

20
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:45,375
- OH, SILLY. ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS USE THIS FORMULA RIGHT HERE.

21
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,791
SUBSTITUTE THIS NUMBER FOR X
AND CARRY THE REMAINDER.

22
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,208
YOU SEEM A LITTLE DISTRACTED.

23
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,750
- NO. I'M ALL RIGHT.

24
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,541
- REMEMBER TO APPLY THE SAME
RULES TO THESE OTHER EQUATIONS,

25
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,708
AND YOU'LL GET THE
RIGHT ANSWER EVERY TIME.

26
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,875
- OH, I GET IT. YOU KNOW,
THIS REALLY IS SIMPLE.

27
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,083
- YOU SURE ARE A QUICK STUDY.

28
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,541
- OH, BECAUSE YOU'RE A
GOOD TEACHER, NERINE.

29
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,458
THANK YOU FOR TAKING
THE TIME TO HELP ME.

30
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,958
- THAT'S AMAZING. MAYBE YOU
COULD GIVE ME A FEW POINTERS.

31
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,791
- CERTAINLY. WHERE ARE
YOU HAVING TROUBLE?

32
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,083
- ON PROBLEM SEVEN, RIGHT HERE.

33
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,541
- ( chuckling nervously )

34
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,625
- FOR A SECOND THERE, I THOUGHT
NERINE HAD LOST TO YOUR SIA.

35
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,375
- HAD MY DAUGHTER SEIZED THE
MOMENT SHE WOULD'VE WON.

36
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,208
- BUT NERINE'S ABOUT TO
RALLY BACK. YOU WATCH!

37
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,375
- HMM.

38
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,166
IT'S ANYONE'S GAME.

39
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,541
- NOT ANYMORE.

40
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,583
I WIN.

41
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,333
- ( grunts )

42
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,541
( yells )

43
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,250
- Rin: HEY, MAYUMI.
HOW'RE THINGS GOING?

44
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,583
- JUST STOP BOTHERING ME.
I'M BUSY!

45
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,208
- OKAY, OKAY.

46
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,666
I'M JUST RELIEVED TO HEAR THE
SOUND OF YOUR WONDERFUL VOICE.

47
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,916
- THAT'S GREAT.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,750
BUT, RIN, I DON'T HAVE
TIME TO CHAT RIGHT NOW.

49
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,708
JEEZ! I'VE WASTED 5
SECONDS OF MY TIME

50
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,875
TELLING YOU I DON'T HAVE TIME.

51
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,458
GOODBYE.

52
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,583
- PERFECT. WE'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONES SCRAMBLING TO FINISH.

53
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,375
- THAT'S FABULOUS. AND IT
MAKES ME FEEL BETTER SOMEHOW.

54
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,166
- YEAH, BUT WE'RE STILL BEHIND.
SO BACK TO WORK.

55
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,666
- ( groaning )

56
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,291
- Crowd: WHOA!

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,458
- ( grunts )

58
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,000
( breathing heavily )

59
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,583
- YES. I'M DONE.

60
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,750
- I'M JEALOUS, RIN.
WE'RE STILL WORKING.

61
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,208
- CONGRATULATIONS ON
ALL YOUR HARD WORK.

62
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,208
- THANKS, NERINE.
IT WASN'T EASY.

63
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,208
- HUH. I SUPPOSE
NOW YOU'RE GONNA GO

64
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,041
HAVE FUN ON YOUR
OWN, AREN'T YOU?

65
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,916
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ANY FUN.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,666
I HAVE TO START WORKING
ON MY ART ASSIGNMENT NEXT.

67
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,250
- OH, RIGHT. A SKETCH THAT
REFLECTS YOUR SUMMER.

68
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,708
BUT HOW WILL YOU CHOOSE?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DRAW?

69
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,500
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO TO
THE BEACH LIKE I HAD PLANNED,

70
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,125
SO I GUESS I'LL
HEAD ON TO THE RIVER.

71
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,833
- I DON'T THINK WE'LL
EVER FINISH AT THIS RATE.

72
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,250
I'M DONE FOR!

73
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,750
- KAEDE, ARE YOU
GOING SOMEWHERE?

74
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,000
- NOT AT THE MOMENT.

75
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,333
I'M PREPARING A
SANDWICH FOR RIN'S LUNCH.

76
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,291
IF I REMEMBER HIS ITINERARY,

77
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,750
AFTER HE FINISHES HIS MATH
AND LANGUAGE ASSIGNMENTS,

78
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,250
HE'LL BE HEADING OUT TO
DO SKETCH WORK FOR ART.

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,458
- RIN CAN DRAW?
- YES.

80
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,166
THAT'S WHY I DECIDED
TO MAKE HIM SOMETHING

81
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,541
HE COULD EAT ON THE RUN.

82
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,916
- HOW COME YOU'RE SO MUCH
SMARTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE?

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,750
- WELL, ONLY WHEN
IT COMES TO RIN.

84
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,458
- Rin: KAEDE.
MAKE MY LUNCH TO GO.

85
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,625
- SURE, NO PROBLEM.

86
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,958
RIMU, IF YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING, I COULD USE YOUR HELP.

87
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,375
WOULD YOU MIND
FILLING THE THERMOS

88
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,625
THAT'S ON THE TABLE
WITH ICE TEA?

89
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,666
- SURE.

90
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,375
HMM?

91
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,250
OH.

92
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,000
- THIS LANDSCAPE NEEDS
A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE.

93
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,500
GUESS I COULD PUT IN A
FEW RANDOM PEOPLE FISHING.

94
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,041
- HEY, NO CHEATING.

95
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,375
- ( groans )

96
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,125
HONESTLY, ASA,
STOP HITTING ME ALL THE TIME.

97
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,000
SINCE YOU'RE HERE, I'M ASSUMING
YOU FINISHED YOUR HOMEWORK.

98
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,416
- OF COURSE.

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,041
I THOUGHT I'D MARK THE
END OF OUR SUMMER BREAK

100
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,291
BY SIMPLY RELAXING.

101
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,083
SO I SET OUT FOR A WALK.

102
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,250
- MUST BE GREAT TO
FEEL SO CAREFREE.

103
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,250
- BY THE LOOKS OF IT YOU KNOW
A THING OR TWO ABOUT UNWINDING.

104
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,333
THE PICNIC LUNCH
IS A SMART TOUCH.

105
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,833
OH, IS THAT A BOLOGNA SANDWICH?

106
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,416
DELICIOUS! KAEDE'S NUMBER ONE
IN THE KITCHEN.

107
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,583
NOBODY ELSE CAN COME CLOSE.

108
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,916
- THAT'S QUITE A COMPLIMENT
CONSIDERING YOU TRAINED HER.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,375
- AT THE RATE SHE'S PROGRESSING,

110
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,208
SHE'LL BE READY TO BECOME
YOUR WIFE IN NO TIME, RIN.

111
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,291
- MY WIFE?

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,458
- THERE YOU ARE.
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

113
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,958
ARE YOU NOT FEELING OKAY?

114
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,541
- IT'S NOTHING.

115
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,833
( sighs )

116
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,333
- ASA, PLEASE.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

117
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,541
- IF NOT KAEDE,
THEN SIA PERHAPS?

118
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,666
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, THINGS GOT
PRETTY EXCITING THIS SUMMER.

119
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,625
- BUT, THAT WAS A...

120
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,541
- Sia: RIN.

121
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,250
- IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

122
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,041
- OKEE DOKE, I BELIEVE YOU.

123
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,416
IF SIA'S NOT YOUR CHOICE,
IT MUST BE NERINE.

124
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,916
- HERE.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,875
- NERINE'S NO STRANGER
TO THE KITCHEN EITHER.

126
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,125
SHE HAS THE CUTS AND
BLISTERS TO PROVE IT.

127
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,083
SHE'S MORE DETERMINED
THAN EVER TO IMPRESS YOU

128
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,708
WITH HER CULINARY SKILLS.

129
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,375
- YOU'RE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS
THAT AREN'T TRUE.

130
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,375
- IF I'M WRONG ABOUT
THOSE THREE, THEN WHO?

131
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,375
MAYBE YOU FAVOR PRIMULA?

132
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,416
- ( sighs )

133
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,791
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE KIDDING.

134
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,250
- UH-HUH. OF COURSE.

135
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,916
- I GUESS THIS
MOUNTAIN OF HOMEWORK

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
HAS RUINED MY SENSE OF HUMOR.

137
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,166
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY HOW I PLANNED
TO BURN MY LAST DAY OF SUMMER.

138
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,583
- REMEMBER, LOVE WON'T
WAIT ON YOU FOREVER.

139
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,083
- THAT MIGHT BE TRUE.

140
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,791
BUT, I CAN'T THINK ABOUT
WHO I'M SUPPOSED TO SPEND

141
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,541
THE REST OF MY
LIFE WITH RIGHT NOW.

142
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,000
I HAVE TO PASS ART FIRST.

143
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,875
- MOST BOYS WOULD DISAGREE.

144
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,833
- I'M NOT SAYING
I'M NOT FLATTERED.

145
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,291
IT'S JUST THIS FRIENDSHIP WE
ALL HAVE IS MORE IMPORTANT.

146
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,833
- ( Asa sighs )

147
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,750
- WHAT ABOUT YOU? EVER SINCE
THAT INCIDENT WITH TAKIZAWA,

148
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,041
I'VE HEARD A FLOOD OF GUYS

149
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,000
HAVE CONFESSED THEIR
UNDYING DEVOTION FOR YOU.

150
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,875
- YEAH, MAYBE THERE'S A SMIDGE
OF TRUTH IN ALL THE RUMORS.

151
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,041
BUT, PICKING A BEAU IS
A LONG WAY OFF FOR ME.

152
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,125
I'M ALL ABOUT HAVING
FUN WITH MY FRIENDS.

153
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,583
- THEN YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY
WHERE I'M COMING FROM.

154
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,208
- YEAH. I GUESS SO.

155
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,708
- ( both laugh )

156
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,833
- THE POT IS BOILING OVER.

157
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,583
- I FORGOT.

158
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,250
HOW COULD I HAVE
BEEN THIS CARELESS?

159
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,166
- I THINK WE PASSED ONE A WHILE
BACK, BUT I'M STILL FULL.

160
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,875
- AH-HA. DID I CATCH YOU TWO
ON A SECRET RENDEZVOUS?

161
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,916
- NOPE. WE JUST CAME
BACK FROM THE RIVERBED.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,708
- OH, REALLY? THE RIVERBED?
OH! PERFECT!

163
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,125
- KAREHA, GET A GRIP.
- OH-LA-LA-LA.

164
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,958
- I DON'T THINK A THING
YOU OR I CAN SAY

165
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,291
WILL MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

166
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,750
SHE'S MADE UP HER MIND.

167
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,833
- Itsuki: RELAX, RIN!
NOTHING TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

168
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,791
YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN,
SHE A VOLUPTUOUS WOMAN.

169
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,250
CERTAIN URGES CREEP UP.

170
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,875
WHY, IT'S NOTHING UNUSUAL.

171
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,000
- Both: SHUT UP!

172
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,041
- HUH?

173
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,541
( gasps )

174
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,333
( gasps )

175
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,208
( breathing heavily )

176
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,458
- HOW DID SHE GET LIKE THIS?

177
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,666
- I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
IT'S THE WEIRDEST THING.

178
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,708
I FOUND HER LAYING
UNCONSCIOUS IN THE BACKYARD.

179
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,291
- WHAT'S SHE HAVE? A FEVER?

180
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,958
- THAT'S THE THING.
THE THERMOMETER MUST BE BROKEN.

181
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,833
- BROKEN? WHAT MAKES
YOU THINK THAT?

182
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,208
- I TOOK HER TEMPERATURE AND
IT WAS 50 DEGREES CELSIUS.

183
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,625
- FIFTY? THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

184
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,125
- THE NORMAL TEMPERATURE
FOR A HUMAN IS 37.

185
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,125
- OF COURSE, RIMU IS NOT FROM
THIS WORLD, SO WHAT'S NORMAL?

186
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,916
- GOOD POINT.
SHE'S OUT OF HER ELEMENT HERE.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,375
HEY, NERINE, TELL US
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH?

188
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,791
HAS THIS HAPPENED BEFORE?

189
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,416
NERINE?

190
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,750
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT
YOUR KIND TO MAKE A GUESS.

191
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,500
WOULD IT DO ANY GOOD TO
TAKE RIMU TO A DOCTOR?

192
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,041
- MMM-MMM.

193
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,583
- TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

194
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,125
- ( sighs )

195
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,250
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, SIA?

196
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,416
YOU AND NERINE ARE THE EXPERTS.

197
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
WE CAN'T HELP HER
IF YOU WON'T HELP US.

198
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,375
- ( sighs )

199
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,333
- WHY ARE YOU TWO SO
RELUCTANT TO HELP ME?

200
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,666
SPEAK UP! SAY SOMETHING!

201
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,791
- STOP IT, RIN.

202
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,500
- I'M SORRY.

203
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,750
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

204
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,166
- I APOLOGIZE.

205
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,833
- ( breathing heavily )

206
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,375
- YOU REST AND GET
WELL SOON, 'KAY?

207
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,708
- WAIT UP.

208
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,708
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THIS GARDEN?

209
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,000
IS PRIMULA RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THIS?

210
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,083
WHY WOULD SHE TAKE THE TIME?

211
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,416
- Forbesii: SPEAKING OF TIME,
MAY WE HAVE A MINUTE?

212
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,500
I REGRET THE TROUBLE
PRIMULA'S CAUSED YOU.

213
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,750
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

214
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,208
I WANT AN EXPLANATION
FOR HER CONDITION.

215
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,541
YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

216
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,541
- NOW CALM DOWN,
YOU MUST EXERCISE PATIENCE.

217
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,250
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
I WANT ANSWERS.

218
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,166
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, SHIN.

219
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,000
AM I TO UNDERSTAND
PRIMULA IS SUFFERING

220
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,416
FROM A HIGH FEVER AT THE MOMENT?

221
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,666
- YES.

222
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,125
- DEMONS AND GODS RARELY
SUFFER SUCH MALADIES.

223
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,208
IT'S PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF.

224
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,333
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

225
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,041
- PLEASE UNDERSTAND,
PRIMULA IS UNIQUE.

226
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,833
SHE IS NEITHER GOD NOR DEMON.

227
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,958
AND, MOST CERTAINLY,
SHE ISN'T A HUMAN EITHER.

228
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,833
- WELL, THEN. WHAT IS SHE?

229
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,708
- SHE'S SPECIAL.
NO, THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

230
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:13,000
ACTUALLY, PRIMULA IS WHAT YOU
HUMANS WOULD CLASSIFY AS A.I.,

231
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,208
AN ARTIFICIAL LIFE FORM.

232
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,333
- YOU'RE JOKING!

233
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,916
YOU'RE SERIOUS, THEN?

234
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,458
BUT...

235
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,125
- Eustoma: PRIMULA IS
A TOP SECRET ENDEAVOR

236
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,750
BETWEEN SCIENTISTS
ON BOTH OUR WORLDS.

237
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,875
- Forbesii: PROJECT YGGDRASIL.

238
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,625
PRIMULA REPRESENTS AN
EVOLUTIONARY TRIUMPH.

239
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,791
THE MOST OUTSTANDING
SENTIENT LIFE FORM

240
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,625
MAGICAL SCIENCE HAS TO OFFER.

241
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,791
- PRIMULA IS NOT
JUST SOME LAB RAT.

242
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,750
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PURPOSE
OF PROJECT YGGDRASIL?

243
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,791
- LIFE.

244
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,750
THE STUDY OF CREATION.

245
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,541
- CREATION?

246
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,416
- YOU SEE, MAGIC IS
THE POWER OF MIRACLES.

247
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,958
- ( gasps )

248
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,083
- WITH IT, EVEN THE
MOST OUTRAGEOUS DESIRE

249
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,958
CAN BE MADE REALITY.

250
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,583
BUT EVEN THE POWER OF
MAGIC CANNOT HOLD SWAY

251
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,750
OVER THE MOST POWERFUL
FORCE IN THE UNIVERSE.

252
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,875
- HE MEANS, THE GIFT OF LIFE.

253
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,625
- Forbesii: SINCE THE DAWN
OF CREATION,

254
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,750
IT WAS BELIEVED THE DEAD COULD
NOT BE BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE.

255
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,250
AFTER ALL, EVEN THE
RESTORATIVE POWER

256
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,625
OF HEALING MAGIC HAS ITS LIMITS.

257
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,500
BUT WHAT IF WE COULD
ERASE THOSE LIMITATIONS?

258
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,166
WHAT IF WE COULD SAVE
LIVES OF THE TERMINALLY ILL?

259
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,500
OR, INDEED, RETRIEVE PRECIOUS
LIVES THAT WERE ONCE LOST?

260
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,083
THE A.I. PROGRAM WAS
ESTABLISHED TO MAKE THESE

261
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,875
AND OTHER FANTASTIC
ADVANCEMENTS A REALITY.

262
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,125
- YOU MEAN, PRIMULA...

263
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,041
- OH YES, AND SHE IS
AN EXCELLENT SPECIMEN.

264
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,583
- BUT, BECAUSE OF
HER PERFECTION,

265
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,750
SHE'S BEEN FORCED TO SHOULDER
A TERRIBLE RESPONSIBILITY.

266
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,625
- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?

267
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,458
- HER CURRENT STATE IS
AN UNFORTUNATE NECESSITY.

268
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,000
- YOU'RE BACK.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

269
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,875
- OUT WALKING.
WELL, HOW'S SHE DOING?

270
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,583
- SLEEPING. KAEDE'S KEEPING
AN EYE ON HER RIGHT NOW.

271
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,250
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

272
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,875
- YOU SEEM SO UPSET.

273
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,625
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.
I'LL GO CHECK ON HER.

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
- ( door opens )

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,208
- HEY.

276
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,375
- NO CHANGE.
HER FEVER HASN'T GONE DOWN.

277
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,041
- ( breathing heavily )

278
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,583
- Eustoma: THERE'S A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF MAGICAL POWER

279
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,458
PENT UP INSIDE THAT TINY BODY.

280
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,125
SO MUCH THAT SHE CAN
WORK MIRACLES BEYOND THAT

281
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,416
WHICH NORMAL MAGIC
IS CAPABLE OF.

282
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,875
- Forbesii: SHIN AND I
WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY

283
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,458
CONTROLLING SUCH POWER.

284
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,583
FOR PRIMULA, THIS ABILITY
IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD.

285
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,250
A BLESSING AND A CURSE.

286
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,750
- YOU'RE AWFULLY QUIET.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

287
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,625
- KAEDE, I'VE JUST LEARNED
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

288
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,666
WE REALLY DON'T
KNOW PRIMULA AT ALL.

289
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,458
- Sia: RIN, ARE YOU POSITIVE?

290
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,833
- YEAH. DON'T WORRY.
BESIDES, IT'S GETTING LATE.

291
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,833
KAEDE AND I CAN MANAGE
THINGS FROM HERE.

292
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,541
- IF YOU'RE CERTAIN.

293
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,041
BUT, IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, YOU
BE SURE TO CALL US RIGHT AWAY.

294
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,250
- I WILL.
PLEASE GO REST, YOU TWO.

295
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,166
- RIN, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE IT. RIMU'S AWAKE.

296
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,208
- HUH?

297
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,041
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

298
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,291
- NOT SO GOOD, RIN.
- I FEEL TERRIBLE THAT

299
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,708
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

300
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,625
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I KNOW YOU TRIED.

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,375
- LISTEN, RIMU.

302
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,250
I HAVE A FAVOR I WANNA ASK YOU.

303
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,541
- OKAY?

304
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,791
- I WANT YOU TO GO BACK
TO THE DEMON WORLD.

305
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,208
- RIN, WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?

306
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,458
- I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE
A BIZARRE THING TO ASK.

307
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,041
BUT PRIMULA'S ILLNESS
CAN'T BE CURED IN OUR WORLD,

308
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,625
ONLY IN HER OWN.

309
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,416
THAT INFORMATION COMES STRAIGHT
FROM THE KING OF DEMONS HIMSELF.

310
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,166
IF YOU JUST RETURN HOME.

311
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,000
IF YOU WILLINGLY GO
BACK TO THE DEMON REALM.

312
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,333
HE SAYS THEY'LL CURE YOU.

313
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,500
- NO.
- BUT, YOU MUST!

314
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,125
- I WANNA STAY WITH YOU.

315
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,750
- YOU CAN'T GET HEALTHY
IF YOU STAY IN THIS WORLD.

316
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,541
GO HOME FOR NOW
AND WHEN YOU'RE BETTER,

317
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,458
YOU CAN COME BACK HERE.

318
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,666
- I'M NOT LEAVING.

319
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,625
- RIMU, PLEASE.

320
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,208
- Forbesii: THE REASON WE
ALLOWED PRIMULA TO LIVE WITH YOU

321
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,000
WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A CHANCE
SHE MIGHT LEARN TO CONTROL

322
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,833
HER SPECIAL ABILITIES.

323
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,416
THAT WAS THE THOUGHT
BEHIND BRINGING HER HERE.

324
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,458
- I'M NOT SURE
I'M FOLLOWING YOU.

325
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,000
- THROUGH OUR RESEARCH,
ONE FACT BECAME CRYSTAL CLEAR,

326
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,583
EMOTIONS HAVE A HUGE IMPACT
ON HER MAGIC.

327
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,958
- YOU'LL RECALL THAT WHEN
YOU FIRST MET PRIMULA,

328
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,875
IT WAS RARE FOR HER
TO EXPRESS EMOTION.

329
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,041
- THAT'S RIGHT, BUT THEN AS SHE
GOT USED TO US SHE OPENED UP.

330
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,333
- Forbesii: YES, AND YET,
EVERYTHING THAT LITTLE GIRL

331
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,083
HAS GONE THROUGH
HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL,

332
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,666
ROBBING HER OF HER EMOTIONS.

333
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,458
- Rin: GO ON.

334
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,708
- ONE SOLUTION THE RESEARCH
LAB CAME UP WITH WAS THIS.

335
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,625
IF PRIMULA WERE ABLE TO
REGAIN HER HUMANISTIC EMOTIONS,

336
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,708
THEN SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
CONTROL THE MAGIC INSIDE OF HER.

337
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,083
- SO, WE BROUGHT HER HERE,

338
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,916
HOPING SHE TOO WOULD
FIND YOU COMPELLING

339
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,708
THEREBY RESTORING HER
DORMANT EMOTIONS. IT WORKED.

340
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,041
- IT WORKED, HUH?

341
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,125
THEN HOW COME PRIMULA IS
LYING IN BED WITH A FEVER?

342
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,333
- THE RESEARCH WAS
FLAWED, CLEARLY.

343
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:47,208
- THE FUTURE IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO KNOW, EVEN FOR THE TWO OF US.

344
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,625
OUR ONLY CHOICE IS TO RETURN
HER TO THE WORLD OF DEMONS

345
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,916
AND PERFORM MORE TESTS.

346
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,500
- Forbesii: RIN, IT'S IMPERATIVE
YOU CONVINCE PRIMULA

347
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,125
TO RETURN TO HER WORLD.

348
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,458
- Primula: I'M NOT LEAVING.

349
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,958
- ( knocking on door )
- HMM?

350
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,333
- TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

351
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,833
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?

352
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,500
( sighs )

353
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,875
YOU KNEW... YOU KNEW PRIMULA
IS AN ARTIFICIAL LIFE FORM.

354
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,583
AND YOU MUST'VE ALSO KNOWN
THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE

355
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,500
UNLESS SHE GOES BACK
TO THE DEMON WORLD.

356
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,291
- SHE'LL ONLY
LISTEN TO YOU, RIN.

357
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,291
TELL RIMU TO GO HOME
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

358
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,291
- I TRIED THAT,
BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.

359
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,041
- SHE'LL DIE IF SHE STAYS.

360
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,333
- YES, SHE WILL. I KNOW.

361
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,500
BUT THE CHOICE TO STAY
OR GO IS HERS TO MAKE.

362
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,916
- YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

363
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,791
- AW, NERINE.

364
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,333
- I KNOW MY HOME WORLD
CAN SAVE HER.

365
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,500
I COULDN'T BEAR IT IF
ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HER.

366
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,583
NOT NOW.
I CAN'T LOSE ANYONE ELSE.

367
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,000
- YOU WON'T.

368
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,541
- PROMISE ME,
YOU'LL HELP HER, RIN.

369
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,291
- ( giggling )

370
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,958
( gasps )

371
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,916
( sighs )

372
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,458
- ( door opens )

373
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,583
- UH, RIN.

374
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,375
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

375
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,125
- PLEASE LISTEN.
PRIMULA, YOU MUST GO BACK HOME.

376
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,208
- NO, I CAN'T.

377
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,000
- RIN, DON'T.

378
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,958
- PLEASE, DO IT FOR MY SAKE.

379
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,083
- RIN?
- I BEG YOU.

380
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,500
- FOR YOU.

381
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,041
- BE GOOD,
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

382
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,333
- I WILL.

383
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,791
- THANK YOU. BE STRONG.

384
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,333
- RIN, I...

385
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,541
GOODBYE.

386
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,583
- PLEASE COME BACK SOON.

387
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,083
( crying )

388
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,125
- GOODBYE.

389
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,500
HOPE I DID THE RIGHT THING.

390
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,708
- Man: SIR, I'M AFRAID WE WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO LET HER RETURN

391
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,625
TO THE HUMAN WORLD EVER AGAIN.

392
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,750
- ( theme song playing )

393
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

394
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,208
- Kaede: I GOT UP THIS MORNING

395
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,416
AND PREPARED
BREAKFAST FOR THREE.

396
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,416
LATER, AS I WAS ABOUT
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE,

397
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
I CALLED OUT FOR
RIMU TO JOIN ME,

398
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,666
EVEN THOUGH I KNEW
SHE WASN'T THERE.

399
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,000
- Rin: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE,

400
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,708
EPISODE 13, HOUSE OF TWILIGHT.

401
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:16,250
- Kaede: RIN, YOU DO BELIEVE
