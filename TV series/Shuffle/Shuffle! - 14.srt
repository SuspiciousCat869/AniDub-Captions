1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,125
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,750
- Nerine: DO YOU REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME WE MET?

4
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,583
I WAS SITTING ON
THIS SWING SINGING

5
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,583
AND YOU TOLD ME
I HAD A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

6
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:52,083
- YEAH... I COULD NEVER FORGET
HOW PRETTY YOUR VOICE IS.

7
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,666
- THAT WASN'T MY VOICE
YOU HEARD.

8
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,916
IT ISN'T CAPABLE OF
CREATING SUCH BEAUTY.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,208
THE REAL ME COULD NEVER SOUND
LIKE THAT.

10
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,500
- BUT I DID HEAR YOU.

11
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,250
- NO, THE SONG AND THE VOICE
YOU HEARD AREN'T MINE.

12
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,541
THEY BELONG TO SOMEONE
VERY CLOSE TO ME.

13
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,833
- I DON'T GET IT,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,666
- THEY'RE A PART OF
MY OTHER SELF.

15
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,791
LYCORIS.

16
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,500
- LYCORIS?

17
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,166
- SHE WAS A SEPARATE PART OF ME,
MY BETTER HALF.

18
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,625
I AM THE ONE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

19
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,708
FOR ROBBING HER OF EVERYTHING
THAT SHE REALLY WAS.

20
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,208
- WAIT, JUST BACK UP A SECOND,

21
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,875
THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE AT ALL.

22
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,708
- OF COURSE IT DOESN'T.
I'M SORRY, RIN.

23
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:39,250
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHO THIS LYCORIS IS.

24
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,750
- YOU KNOW THE STORY BEHIND RIMU

25
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,041
AND HOW SHE'S AN ARTIFICIAL
LIFE FORM CREATED

26
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,375
BY THE GODS AND DEMONS FOR
EXPERIMENTATION, RIGHT?

27
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,041
- YEAH, AND I DON'T CARE WHO'S
LIFE THE RESEARCH IS SAVING,

28
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,500
USING PRIMULA AS A GUINEA PIG
IS JUST WRONG TO ME.

29
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,000
- RIMU ISN'T THE FIRST.

30
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,666
IT TOOK THEM A FEW TIMES TO
GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED

31
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,875
AND THERE WERE TWO ARTIFICIAL
LIFE FORMS CREATED BEFORE HER.

32
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,500
- THEN YOU'RE TELLING ME
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

33
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,458
THREE INNOCENT BEINGS
LOCKED UP FOR EXPERIMENTATION?

34
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,458
- NO.

35
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,416
THE FIRST WAS A GIRL
CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE DEMONS.

36
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,458
THEY PLANNED TO REINFORCE
HER BODY.

37
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,208
THIS WOULD ALLOW HER
TO CONTROL GREAT MAGIC.

38
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,333
HOWEVER...

39
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,375
HER BODY COULDN'T TOLERATE
THE INTENSIFIED MAGIC.

40
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,541
AND IT CONSUMED HER AND
EVERYONE IN THE LABORATORY.

41
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,250
OBVIOUSLY, THE RESEARCH TEAM
LEARNED THEIR LESSON.

42
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,833
THEY REALIZED THEY NEEDED
THE PARTICIPATION OF SOMEONE

43
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,041
WHO ALREADY POSSESSED
POWERFUL MAGIC.

44
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,041
THEY NEEDED A GIRL
ALMOST AS POWERFUL

45
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,333
AS THE RULER OF THE DEMONS.

46
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,458
- I'M NOT SURE
I WANNA HEAR THIS.

47
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,416
- THEY NEEDED ME.

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,625
OF COURSE MY FATHER
WOULD NEVER ALLOW THEM

49
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,916
TO RISK PUTTING
ME IN SUCH DANGER.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,416
SO THE RESEARCH TEAM WAS
LEFT WITH NO ALTERNATIVE

51
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,458
BUT TO DUPLICATE MY CELLS
AND PRODUCE ANOTHER ME.

52
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,250
- YOU MEAN, THEY CLONED YOU?
- AND THEN CREATED LYCORIS.

53
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,083
SHE WAS A NICE GIRL.

54
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,333
SHE KNEW SHE WAS CREATED
TO BE AN EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECT.

55
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,375
BUT THAT NEVER STOPPED HER
FROM SMILING.

56
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,541
- OH, NERINE,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

57
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,083
- I'M OKAY.

58
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,291
- I HOPE THAT YOU
START FEELING BETTER SOON.

59
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,333
FATHER TOLD ME THE REASON
I'M ALWAYS GETTING SICK

60
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,458
IS BECAUSE MY MAGIC
IS TOO POWERFUL

61
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,625
AND MY BODY HASN'T GROWN
ENOUGH TO HANDLE IT YET.

62
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,916
- DON'T WORRY, NERINE,
I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,583
I'LL MAKE YOU BETTER,
I PROMISE.

64
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,250
- WHAT?

65
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,208
- IF THE EXPERIMENTS ON ME
GO AS PLANNED,

66
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,250
THEY SAY THEY'LL BE
ABLE TO CURE ANY ILLNESS,

67
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,625
NO MATTER WHAT.

68
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,375
SO I KNOW THEY'LL BE
ABLE TO MAKE YOU BETTER.

69
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,291
- I HOPE SO.
- I KNOW.

70
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,208
HOW ABOUT I SING YOU A SONG TO
TAKE YOUR MIND OFF HOW YOU FEEL?

75
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,791
- SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THE
EXPERIMENTS WERE EXCRUCIATING.

76
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,250
IF THAT'S TRUE,

77
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,416
THEN SHE NEVER ONCE LET ON
THAT SHE WAS IN SUCH PAIN.

78
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,125
- SHE MUST HAVE BEEN STRONG.

79
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,875
- LYCORIS WAS VERY KIND, TOO.

80
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,791
THE EXPERIMENTS BEGAN
TO GROW MORE FREQUENT.

81
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,083
SHE RARELY LEFT THE LAB

82
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,166
AND I BEGAN TO SEE
LESS AND LESS OF HER.

83
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,500
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
SO LONELY AT FIRST,

84
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,583
BUT THAT'S WHEN SHE MET RIMU.

85
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,250
- SO, PRIMULA KNEW LYCORIS?

86
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,083
- SHE WAS PRACTICALLY
RIMU'S SISTER

87
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,791
AND FOR A WHILE,
THEY WERE ALL THEY HAD.

88
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,708
- Eustoma: HAS HER CONDITION
IMPROVED AT ALL?

89
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,541
- Researcher: WE'RE TRYING
EVERYTHING WE CAN.

90
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,708
BUT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY

91
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,333
THAT SHE'LL NEVER
REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS.

92
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,583
- THEN WE'RE NEARING THE POINT

93
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,500
WHERE WE HAVE ONLY ONE
OPTION LEFT TO SAVE HER.

94
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,791
- YES, WE BELIEVE THAT
IF WE RESET HER EMOTIONS

95
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,125
THEN THE CHANGES WILL
POTENTIALLY REVIVE HER.

96
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,666
- AN UNFORTUNATE LOSS.

97
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,625
- BUT, SIRE, PRIMULA IS SIMPLY
AN INDEPENDENT LIFE FORM.

98
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,875
SHE HAS NEITHER SIBLINGS
NOR PARENTS

99
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,166
OR ANY EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS.
THERE'S NO ONE TO MOURN...

100
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,833
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

101
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,125
THAT'S NOT TRUE, NOW IS IT?

102
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,333
PRIMULA?

103
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,541
- HELLO.

104
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,291
MY NAME'S LYCORIS.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

105
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,958
- PRIMULA.

106
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,750

00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,083
- I SEE. I LIKE KNOWING PRIMULA
HAD SOMEONE TO CARE FOR HER.

113
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,666
I HAD NO IDEA.

114
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,791
SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO LYCORIS?

115
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,958
IS SHE STILL WITH
PRIMULA IN THE LAB?

116
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,916
THEY'RE NOT STILL CONDUCTING
EXPERIMENTS ON HER, ARE THEY?

117
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,000
- LYCORIS NO LONGER EXISTS.

118
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,625
- HUH?

119
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,583
- RIGHT NOW, I'M ALL
THAT'S LEFT OF HER.

120
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,291
LYCORIS SHE...

121
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,166
SHE SACRIFICED HERSELF
IN ORDER TO SAVE MY LIFE, RIN.

122
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,666
- I HOPE NERINE'S ALL RIGHT.

123
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,416
- I'M SURE SHE'S OKAY,
SHE'S GOT RIN WITH HER.

124
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,541
- RIGHT, I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

125
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,875
- I'M SORRY. I FEEL
LIKE THIS IS MY FAULT,

126
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,416
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO HARSH.

127
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,875
- OH, YOU WEREN'T.

128
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,500
- I'M ASHAMED, ASA.
YOU WERE BEING HONEST.

129
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,791
- SIA.

130
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:00,541
- I WAS TRYING TO BE CONSIDERATE
OF RIN'S FEELINGS TOWARDS RIMU.

131
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,875
BUT WHEN I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID,

132
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,500
I REALIZED I WAS FOOLING
MYSELF INTO THINKING THAT.

133
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,750
- I KNEW HE WAS PRETTY
BROKEN UP ABOUT RIMU,

134
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,541
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN A LITTLE MORE...

135
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,958
- NO WAY.

136
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,166
I THINK YOU TWO HAD EVERY RIGHT
TO SAY WHAT YOU DID.

137
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,750
YOU WERE JUST CONCERNED FOR HIM.

138
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,291
CONSIDERING THE CONDITION
RIMU'S IN,

139
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,666
GOING TO SEE HER COULD
POTENTIALLY BE VERY DANGEROUS.

140
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,166
TRUST ME, I AM AWARE OF THAT.

141
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,791
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND
YOUR RELUCTANCE,

142
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,541
YOU JUST CARE ABOUT HIM AND
YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET HURT.

143
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,875
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT
ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT,

144
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,125
AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
A PERSON HAS TO TAKE A RISK.

145
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,833
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE
YOU CARE ABOUT.

146
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,291
I'M BEING UNUSUALLY
SERIOUS TODAY, HUH?

147
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,958
HOW 'BOUT I MAKE US SOME TEA?
- THAT'S OKAY, I CAN GET IT.

148
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,958
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
I KNOW THIS HOUSE WELL EN...

149
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,125
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- ASA, WHAT'S WRONG?

150
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,666
- SHE SACRIFICED
HERSELF. REALLY?

151
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,791
- YES.

152
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,500
- BUT WHY?

153
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,125
- SINCE LYCORIS WAS MY CLONE,
HER LIFE WAS UNSTABLE.

154
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,375
THE TECHNOLOGY FOR CLONING

155
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,875
IN THE DEMON WORLD
ISN'T EXACTLY PERFECT.

156
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,625
IT'S NOT MUCH BETTER
THAN THE HUMAN TECHNOLOGY.

157
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,375
SO HER PHYSICAL STRUCTURE WAS
ALREADY SOMEWHAT VOLATILE

158
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,458
AND THE EXPERIMENTS ON HER
ONLY MADE IT WORSE.

159
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,750
- THEN WHY DIDN'T
ANYONE STOP THE EXPERIMENTS?

160
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,958
- SHE WAS BORN WITH A BODY

161
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:30,041
THAT WAS NEVER GOING
TO LIVE FOR VERY LONG.

162
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,583
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'D NEVER
GUESS IT BY HOW HAPPY SHE WAS,

163
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,208
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN.

164
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,708
AROUND THAT TIME, I CAME DOWN
WITH A SERIOUS ILLNESS.

165
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,125
- THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO.

166
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,916
- Doctor: NOT EVEN OUR HEALING
MAGIC IS WORKING FOR HER.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,333
I'M SORRY, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO.

168
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,041
- THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

169
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,416
- ( gasping )

170
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,333
- LYCORIS.

171
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,958
- I WANT YOU TO USE MY LIFE
TO SAVE HER.

172
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,833
IF YOU GIVE HER MY REMAINING
LIFE ENERGY,

173
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,833
THEN SHE'LL HAVE ENOUGH
STRENGTH TO RECOVER.

174
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,666
- YES, LYCORIS WAS CLONED BY
EXTRACTING VITALITY FROM NERINE.

175
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,416
IF WE RETURN THAT ORIGINAL
LIFE FORCE TAKEN FROM HER,

176
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,541
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE HER.
- YES.

177
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,666
WAIT. IF WE DO THAT,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO...

178
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,875
- I KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN.

179
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,833
BUT ALL THAT MATTERS TO
ME IS SAVING THE LIFE

180
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,875
OF SOMEONE I CARE ABOUT.

181
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,750
- LYCORIS AND I BECAME ONE

182
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,333
AND BECAUSE SHE GAVE ME
HER LIFE, I AM ALL THAT'S LEFT.

183
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,541
MY LIFE IS WHAT
REMAINS OF LYCORIS.

184
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,541
- I SEE.

185
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,375
- AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,
I TOOK EVEN MORE FROM HER.

186
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,000
I TOOK WHO SHE WAS.

187
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,541
THERE WAS SOMETHING MY FATHER
AND THE DOCTORS DIDN'T REALIZE

188
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,916
ABOUT TRANSFERRING
HER LIFE TO ME.

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,916
- WHAT?

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,458
- WHEN OUR TWO LIVES
WERE MERGED,

191
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,416
I INHERITED ALL OF
LYCORIS' TRAITS,

192
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,375
EVERYTHING THAT MADE HER
WHO SHE WAS.

193
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,750
I ABSORBED HER MEMORIES AND HER
EMOTIONS, ALL OF HER TALENTS.

194
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,500
THE SINGING VOICE YOU SO GREATLY
PRAISED ISN'T EVEN MINE.

195
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,833
HER VOICE WAS KNOWN THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE WORLD OF THE DEMONS.

196
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,916
IT LEFT NO ONE UNMOVED.

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,916
I STOLE THE THING
THAT MADE HER BEAUTIFUL.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,958
- NERINE, YOU CAN'T
BLAME YOURSELF.

199
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,125
- BUT I DID STEAL IT FROM HER,
I ROBBED HER OF HER LIFE.

200
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:34,291
AND I STOLE HER VOICE, THE ONE
THING SHE CHERISHED THE MOST.

201
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,375
NO. THERE'S SOMETHING
EVEN WORSE.

202
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,250
I TOOK SOMETHING
EVEN MORE PRECIOUS

203
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,541
THAN HER SINGING VOICE, RIN.

204
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,833
- WHAT WAS IT?
- I TOOK HER...

205
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,458
( sobs )
- TELL ME.

206
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,791
- I'M SORRY. I JUST
DON'T THINK I COULD HANDLE

207
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,291
LOSING SOMEBODY
CLOSE TO ME AGAIN.

208
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,833
- BUT, NERINE, I...

209
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,833
- I'VE ALREADY LET
ONE PERSON I LOVE TO DIE

210
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,458
AND I COULD NEVER
FORGIVE MYSELF,

211
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,416
IF I WERE TO LET THE SAME
HAPPEN TO RIMU,

212
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,625
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN...

213
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,166
I'M SORRY, RIN.

214
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,000
- NERINE.

215
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,125
- Rin: I'M HOME.

216
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,625
- RIN, SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAPPENED. IT'S ASA.

217
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,416
- ( telephone ringing )

218
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,916
- Ama: YES? OH, HI, RIN.

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,083
- HOW'S ASA,
IS SHE FEELING BETTER?

220
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,208
- YEAH, SHE'S FEELING OKAY NOW.

221
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,083
I GUESS SHE MUST HAVE
FAINTED EARLIER

222
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,875
AND SCARED POOR KAEDE
HALF TO DEATH,

223
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,791
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

224
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,750
YEAH, SHE'S SLEEPING SOUNDLY
RIGHT NOW.

225
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,833
MM-HMM, NO PROBLEM.

226
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,125
HER HEALTH HAS
ALWAYS BEEN FRAGILE,

227
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,791
SO STUFF LIKE THIS
USED TO HAPPEN A LOT

228
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,416
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER.

229
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HER HEALTH IS FRAGILE?

230
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,916
- ( chuckles ) NO, REALLY,

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,791
IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
I PROMISE YOU SHE'S FINE.

232
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,666
- WAIT, AMA, ARE YOU SURE?

233
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,500
- I'M SORRY, THE SOUP
I MADE FOR HER IS STILL

234
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,708
HEATING ON THE STOVE,
I REALLY NEED TO GO.

235
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,833
BYE, RIN.

236
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,500
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

237
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,916
WELL, AMA SAID THAT
ASA'S DOING OKAY NOW.

238
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,625
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

239
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,500
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

240
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,541
- OH, NO,
I'M JUST REALLY EXHAUSTED.

241
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,375
- I DON'T EVER WANNA LOSE
A PERSON I CARE ABOUT AGAIN.

242
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,666
NOT EVER.

243
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,083
- WAS I WRONG?

244
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,208
THE ONLY THING I COULD THINK OF
WAS GOING TO SEE PRIMULA.

245
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,125
AND I IGNORED EVERYBODY ELSE.

246
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,250
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP HER.

247
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,833
BUT I WAS SO FIXATED ON IT

248
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,791
THAT I COULDN'T SEE THAT I WAS
HURTING THE PEOPLE AROUND ME.

249
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,958
- ( knock at door )
- RIN? CAN I COME IN?

250
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,416
HEY, THERE, WANT COFFEE?
- SURE.

251
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,666
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- NOTHING.

252
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,041
- KAEDE?
- YEAH?

253
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,750
- THANKS FOR THE COFFEE.

254
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,875
- AND YOU CALL YOURSELVES
POTENTIAL GIRLFRIENDS FOR RIN?

255
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,958
- I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO THAT?

256
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,916
- POOR ASA.
I WISH YOU WERE HERE.

257
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,791
YOU'D KNOW WHAT TO DO.

258
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,500
- RIN, WHAT'S UP WITH NERINE,
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

259
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,291
- YEAH, IT'S KIND OF WEIRD. IT'S
NOT LIKE HER TO MISS SCHOOL.

260
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,958
DID SHE CATCH A COLD
OR SOMETHING?

261
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,541
- IF THAT'S THE CASE, I'LL DO
MY BEST TO RESTORE HER HEALTH.

262
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,333
I WON'T EVEN LEAVE HER BED
UNTIL SHE'S BETTER.

263
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,041
- DON'T YOU MEAN
"LEAVE HER BEDSIDE"?

264
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,750
- NO. I DON'T THINK IT'S A COLD
OR ANYTHING.

265
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,000
- WELL, HAS SHE
BEEN MOODY LATELY?

266
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,708
IT COULD BE HER TIME
OF THE... ( groans )

267
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,375
- RIN, IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING US?

268
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,500
- MAYBE.

269
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,375
- NO, ASA IS ABSENT TODAY.

270
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,333
- OH, SHE IS?

271
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,541
- YOU LOOK A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

272
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,625
- NO, I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

273
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,666
I JUST KIND OF NEEDED HER ADVICE
ON SOMETHING.

274
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,666
IT'S NOTHING IMPORTANT,
I'LL JUST TALK TO HER TOMORROW.

275
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,500
- YOU COULD ALWAYS JUST GO
SEE HER INSTEAD OF WAITING.

276
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,666
- HUH?

277
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,375
- IF YOU NEED TO ASK HER
FOR SOME ADVICE,

278
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,500
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
VISIT HER, RIN?

279
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,333
- NO, IT'S NOTHING.

280
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,750
- I'M SURE ASA WANTS TO SEE YOU
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO SEE HER.

281
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:05,166
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE.
I GUESS I'LL GO SEE HER.

282
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,083
- Asa: THANKS FOR DROPPING IN
TO CHECK ON ME,

283
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,166
I'VE BEEN SO FREAKIN' BORED.

284
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,375
- HOW' ARE YOU FEELING?

285
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,375
- I THINK IT'S JUST
HEAT EXHAUSTION.

286
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,750
KIND OF SAD SINCE
BEING ENERGETIC

287
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,041
IS MY ONLY REDEEMING TRAIT.

288
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,291
- YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

289
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,291
- COME ON. THAT'S WHEN
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL ME

290
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,625
THAT I HAVE MORE THAN
ONE REDEEMING TRAIT.

291
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,125
- OH, I'M SORRY,

292
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,583
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU
WERE FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS.

293
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,500
THERE'S ALSO
YOUR SENSE OF MODESTY.

294
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,916
- IF I WASN'T STUCK IN BED,
I'D KNOCK YOU TO THE FLOOR

295
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,125
WITH MY SENSE OF
MODESTY, YOU JERK.

296
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,833
- ( laughing )

297
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,375
- BUT REALLY. I AM RELIEVED
TO SEE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

298
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,125
- YEAH. I'M FINE.
SORRY TO MAKE YOU WORRY.

299
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,125
SO, YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

300
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,500
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT, RIGHT?

301
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,625
- AM I THAT OBVIOUS?

302
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,750
- YOU DON'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF SUBTLETY.

303
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,583
WELL, COME ON AND
GET ON WITH IT.

304
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,333
LET'S HEAR WHAT IT IS ALREADY.

305
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,041
- Rin: THE TRUTH IS...
- ( knocking at door )

306
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,458
- NERINE, I'M LEAVING
FOR THE DEMON WORLD.

307
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,083
- IS RIMU...

308
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,125
- NO, NO, THERE STILL HAVEN'T
BEEN ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS

309
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,833
WITH PRIMULA'S CONDITION.

310
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,833
SHIN HAS SOMETHING HE NEEDS TO
DISCUSS WITH ME THAT CAN'T WAIT.

311
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,541
WELL, IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,
I WILL CALL YOU.

312
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,375
TRY TO GET SOME REST NOW, OKAY?

313
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,625
- Asa: I SEE.
SO, NERINE SAID THAT?

314
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,500
- YEAH. AND IT'S NOT LIKE
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND

315
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,500
ABOUT WANTING TO SEE PRIMULA.

316
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,625
I MEAN, SHE'S PART OF MY FAMILY.

317
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,291
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO BE THERE
FOR HER, BUT...

318
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,708
- BUT WHAT?

319
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,500
- HONESTLY, I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

320
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,125
- RIN, LISTEN.

321
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,833
YOU DO REALIZE I'M NOT MAKING
SOME THOUGHTLESS DECISION

322
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,500
BY RECOMMENDING
YOU GO SEE RIMU, RIGHT?

323
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,708
- WELL, SURE.

324
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,708
- I UNDERSTAND HER PAIN.
I'VE BEEN THERE.

325
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,166
- WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

326
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,458
- THERE WAS A TIME IN MY LIFE

327
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,791
WHEN I WAS BASICALLY A
PRISONER TO MY OWN BODY,

328
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,583
AND I HATED MY MOTHER FOR IT.

329
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,541
THIS WAS BEFORE
I MET YOU AND KAEDE.

330
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,625
I HAD SOME PRETTY SERIOUS HEALTH
PROBLEMS WHEN I WAS A KID.

331
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,375
I WAS SICK ALL THE TIME,
BUT EVEN WHEN I WASN'T,

332
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,458
MY BODY WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN,
I RARELY WENT TO SCHOOL.

333
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,333
- ( coughs )

334
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,708
- ( children laughing )

335
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,291
- ( sobbing )

336
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,125
- ( knock at the door )
- Ama: ASA? ARE YOU AWAKE?

337
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,708
HEY, SWEETIE.

338
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,041
HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY,
I MADE YOU A DELICIOUS SOUP

339
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,166
AND IT'S CHOCK
FULL OF NUTRIENTS.

340
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,875
SO IT'LL HELP YOU GET
BACK ON YOUR FEET IN NO TIME.

341
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,833
WELL, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
LET'S OPEN THESE CURTAINS.

342
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,500
GET SOME HEALTHY
SUNLIGHT IN HERE.

343
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,625
- DON'T OPEN THEM.

344
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,916
- BUT, ASA...

345
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,375
- I DON'T WANT THEM
OPEN, STUPID.

346
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,916
- OH, SORRY.

347
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,583
WELL...

348
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,500
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE THE SOUP.

349
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,500
I TRIED USING SOME APPLES AND
HONEY TO SWEETEN IT UP FOR YOU

350
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,375
AND IT TURNED OUT
PRETTY DELICIOUS.

351
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,333
YOU MUST BE HUNGRY, TRY SOME.

352
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,291
HERE, I'LL BLOW ON IT, SO IT'S
NOT TOO HOT FOR YOU. OKAY?

353
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,666
THERE.
- I DON'T WANT IT!

354
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,666
STOP IT! WHY DID YOU
GIVE ME A BODY LIKE THIS?

355
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,750
- ASA!

356
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,166
- WHY DOES IT
ALWAYS HURT SO MUCH,

357
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,458
I JUST WANNA BE LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE?

358
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,000
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT
I'M SUFFERING.

359
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,791
YOU MADE ME THIS WAY.
I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN.

360
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,250
I WISH I'D NEVER EVEN BEEN BORN.

361
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,041
I WISH YOU'D NEVER HAD ME.

362
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,541
- SORRY, ASA.

363
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,291
- ( coughing )

364
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,083
- WHAT'S WRONG?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

365
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:07,125
- ALL THE OTHER KIDS HAVE
HEALTHY BODIES, EXCEPT FOR ME.

366
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,458
BECAUSE OF YOU,
I'M GOING TO DIE.

367
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,875
PRETTY AWFUL, ISN'T IT?

368
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,208
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
MAKES ME WANT TO SLAP MYSELF.

369
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,791
- ASA'S ONE OF THE MOST CHEERFUL
AND ENERGETIC PEOPLE I KNOW.

370
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,000
I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINE

371
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,291
THAT SHE'D GONE THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

372
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,375
- SORRY TO UNLOAD THAT ON YOU.

373
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,458
- NO. I... I HAD NO IDEA, ASA.

374
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,833
- WELL, OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

375
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,708
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON I'VE
FELT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH

376
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,666
TO SHARE THAT WITH.

377
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,208
REALLY. I WAS AWFUL.

378
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,541
BUT NO MATTER WHAT,
MY MOTHER NEVER GOT MAD.

379
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:54,958
NO. ALL SHE EVER DID WAS SIT
BY MY SIDE AND COMFORT ME.

380
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,625
AND EVEN WHEN THINGS
GOT THEIR WORST,

381
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,750
SHE NEVER STOPPED
SMILING FOR ME.

382
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,041
SEEING HOW STRONG SHE WAS,
AND HOW MUCH SHE CARED FOR ME,

383
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,375
I PROMISED MYSELF THAT
I WOULD BECOME AS STRONG

384
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,958
AS MY MOTHER AND
NEVER LOSE MY SMILE.

385
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:12,458
SHE'S THE REASON I GOT BETTER.
IT WASN'T MEDICINE OR DOCTORS.

386
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,625
IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD SOMEBODY
THAT WOULD DO EVERYTHING

387
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,375
THEY COULD TO SHOW ME
HOW MUCH THEY LOVED ME.

388
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,583
BECAUSE I HAD SOMEBODY

389
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,000
THAT WOULD STICK BY MY
SIDE NO MATTER WHAT.

390
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,750
I BECAME THE PERSON
THAT I AM TODAY.

391
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,416
RIN?

392
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,916
- I'M AN IDIOT, AREN'T I?

393
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,125
PRIMULA, SHE NEEDS ME
AND I'M NOT THERE,

394
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVEN HESITATED
ABOUT GOING TO SEE HER.

395
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,333
I'VE JUST ACTED SO SELFISHLY.

396
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,958
- YEAH.

397
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,666
- I COULDN'T HAVE SEEN THAT
WITHOUT YOU. THANK YOU, ASA.

398
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,000
- OH!

399
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,458
HERE, TAKE THIS WITH YOU.
- WHAT?

400
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,458
- I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS
SINCE I'M STUCK IN BED

401
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,875
AND I CAN'T GO WITH YOU.

402
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,916
MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO ME
AND I'VE ALWAYS WORN IT

403
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,083
TO REMIND ME OF HER
LOVE AND HER STRENGTH.

404
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,416
IT'S ALWAYS GIVEN ME COURAGE

405
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,166
AND I THINK IT'LL HELP YOU
GET THROUGH THIS, TOO.

406
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,458
- COURAGE.

407
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,208
I KNOW THIS IS TOUGH FOR YOU.

408
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,458
BUT I NEED YOU TO
LET ME GO SEE PRIMULA.

409
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,625
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

410
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,458
AND NO MATTER WHAT
RISKS MIGHT BE INVOLVED,

411
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,250
I HAVE TO GO SEE HER.

412
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,875
- BUT...

413
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,458
- LISTEN, EVEN IF YOU'RE SCARED,
YOU HAVE TO ALLOW HIM TO DO THIS

414
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,708
OR YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT.

415
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,250
- NERINE.

416
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,208
- RIMU IS WAITING.

417
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,750
- OKAY.

418
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,833
I UNDERSTAND.

419
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,750
IT WOULD BE WRONG OF ME
NOT TO TAKE YOU.

420
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,916
- NERINE, THANK YOU.

421
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,666
SO, THIS IS THE GATE, HUH?

422
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,583
HANG ON, WE'RE COMING FOR YOU,
PRIMULA.

423
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,708
- ( theme song playing )

424
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

425
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,208
- Nerine: I NEVER
THOUGHT I'D RETURN

426
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,750
TO THE DEMON REALM LIKE THIS,

427
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,750
BUT I KNOW HOW
IMPORTANT THIS IS.

428
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,250
I CAN'T LOSE ANOTHER PERSON
CLOSE TO ME AGAIN.

429
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,125
- Rin: WAIT FOR US, PRIMULA.
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU.

430
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,041
- Kaede: ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF
SHUFFLE, "WHAT WAS REGAINED."

431
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:09,291
- Primula: JUST NOW, I THOUGHT
I HEARD MY BIG SIS SINGING.
