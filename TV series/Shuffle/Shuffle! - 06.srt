1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:11,500
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,500
- WATCH THE HOUSE FOR US
WHILE WE'RE OUT!

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,958
- I HOPE YOU LIKE WHAT
I MADE FOR LUNCH TODAY.

5
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,416
IT'S PROBABLY ON THE COUNTER.

6
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,958
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHERE IT USUALLY IS.

7
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,083
- YES, I KNOW.

8
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,000
- COME ON, RIN!
TIME TO GO!

9
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,750
- HELLO, THERE. IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING.

10
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,291
- MORNING, YOU TWO. WE'LL
SEE YOU LATER, PRIMULA!

11
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,583
- TAKE CARE, RIMU.

12
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,166
- HAVE A NICE DAY.

13
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,583
- ( clock ticking )

14
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,083
- I WAS WONDERING...

15
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:04,666
DOESN'T RIMU GET LONELY AT HOME
BY HERSELF? I KNOW I WOULD.

16
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,291
- YEAH, I FEEL KIND OF BAD
FOR LEAVING HER, BUT...

17
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,291
- THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

18
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,041
- SINCE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT,

19
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,208
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
I'VE NOTICED RECENTLY.

20
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,291
SHE NEVER SMILES.

21
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,875
I DON'T THINK SHE'S SMILED
ONCE SINCE SHE'S BEEN HERE.

22
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,916
- Kaede: ( gasps ) YOU'RE RIGHT!

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,541
- I MEAN, KIDS HERE AGE
ARE USUALLY MORE CHEERFUL

24
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,333
AND DOING ANYTHING
THEY CAN TO HAVE FUN.

25
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,291
THEY LAUGH, THEY GET IN TROUBLE.

26
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,416
I CAN'T HELP FEELING
LIKE SHE'S UNHAPPY.

27
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,500
- I KNOW.

28
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,875
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
IT'S OUR FAULT

29
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,708
FOR LEAVING HER
ALONE ALL THE TIME?

30
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,833
- OH, NO!

31
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,041
NO, IT ISN'T YOU. SHE WAS LIKE
THAT EVEN WHEN SHE WAS BACK

32
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,958
IN THE REALM OF THE DEMONS.

33
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,958
- SHE'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS?

34
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,416
- WELL, SHE DOESN'T REALLY
SHOW ANY OF HER EMOTIONS,

35
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,750
SO SHE'S HARD TO READ.

36
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,333
- WE JUST NEED TO BE
A LITTLE MORE PATIENT

37
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,375
AND GIVE HER SOME TIME

38
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,208
TO GET USED TO
LIVING IN THIS WORLD

39
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,291
SHE'LL COME AROUND
AND LOVE BEING HERE, YOU'LL SEE!

40
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,375
- LEMME THINK.
MAYBE WE COULD COME UP

41
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,958
WITH SOME SORT OF EXCUSE.

42
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,083
- AN EXCUSE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

43
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,250
- YOU KNOW, TO TAKE
HER SOMEWHERE FUN.

44
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,625
WHAT DO KIDS LIKE?

45
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,250
IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE
WE CAN ALL GO.

46
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,708
I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL
FIGURE IT OUT.

47
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,500
- YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA!

48
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,541
- ( both giggling )

49
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,791
- ( clattering )

50
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,833
- ALRIGHT! WOULD YOU JUST
LISTEN FOR A SECOND?

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,750
- ( beeping )

52
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,166
- SINCE ANCIENT TIMES MANY HAVE
TRIED TO FIND THE SECRETS

53
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,958
TO ETERNAL YOUTH AND LONG LIFE.

54
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,250
MANY PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE AGES

55
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,958
HAVE BELIEVED MAGIC TO
BE THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION.

56
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,166
ALTHOUGH WE UNDERSTAND THAT
MAGIC CAN DO MANY THINGS,

57
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,083
IT CANNOT REVIVE THE DEAD.

58
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,833
EVEN NOW, THE MYSTERIES
OF LIFE AND DEATH

59
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,416
ARE ACTIVELY BEING RESEARCHED
ON ALL THREE WORLDS.

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,041
- ( thunder rumbling )

61
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,333
- ( gasping )

62
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,583
- Lycoris: PRIMULA.

63
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,416
- ( giggles )

64
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,125
A CAT.

65
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,666
- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S
VERY SPECIAL TO ME.

66
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,208
WHAT THIS TOY
MEANS TO ME IS LOVE.

67
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,791
- LOVE?

68
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,166
- Itsuki: HEYA, RIN!

69
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,708
SO I HEAR YOU'VE
HAD SOME PROBLEMS

70
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,208
WITH YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND.

71
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,375
- SHE'S NOT A GIRLFRIEND.

72
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,291
- COME ON NOW, MAN!

73
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,833
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW

74
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,583
ABOUT THE CRADLE-ROBBIN' THING,

75
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,166
BUT I ACCEPT YA JUST THE WAY
THAT YOU ARE, SO WHAT'S UP? HUH?

76
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,750
- DUDE, I'M NOT A PEDOPHILE.

77
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,208
CUT IT OUT AND WHERE IS
ALL THIS COMING FROM?

78
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,416
- Sia: I AM SO SORRY!

79
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,416
WE DECIDED TO TELL HIM ABOUT
OUR TALK THIS MORNING.

80
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,916
- YEAH, HE SEEMED
LIKE THE KIND OF GUY

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,541
WHO WOULD KNOW HOW
TO CHEER SOMEONE UP,

82
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,250
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D ASK
HIS ADVICE. IS THAT BAD?

83
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,750
- IT'S A COMPLETE WASTE.

84
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,583
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
THINKING ANYWAY?

85
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,416
- ( laughing nervously )

86
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
- JUST LISTEN, ALL
YOU EVER HAVE TO DO

87
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,041
TO GET ON A GIRL'S GOOD SIDE

88
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,458
IS BUY HER A GIFT. IT'S EASY.

89
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,250
- SO I BUY HER A DOLL
AND IT'S ALL OVER, HUH?

90
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,666
- TSK, TSK. RIN, RIN, RIN,
SO MUCH TO LEARN!

91
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,125
OKAY, YOUNG GIRLS
ONLY WANT ONE THING,

92
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,333
AND THAT IS TO FEEL
MORE LIKE GROWN-UPS.

93
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,250
- AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

94
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,500
- IT MEANS LINGERIE!

95
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,750
THAT'S RIGHT,
BUY HER LINGERIE AND THEN

96
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,708
YOU GET TO PICK OUT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANT HER TO WEAR!

97
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,250
- ( sighing ) SOMEHOW I DON'T
THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER,

98
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,791
BUT THANKS.

99
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,458
- OH, THOUGH I BET THAT LITTLE
GIRL WOULD ALSO LOOK GOOD

100
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,125
IN A SCHOOL SWIMSUIT.

101
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,125
- NOT THAT AGAIN.

102
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,458
SOMEONE PLEASE RID HIM
OF THAT STUPID SWIMSUIT FETISH?

103
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,500
- ( together ) COUNT US OUT!

104
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,833
- HEY, ROMEO. IT LOOKS LIKE
YET ANOTHER GIRLFRIEND

105
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,416
HAS APPEARED ON THE SCENE!

106
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,833
- PLEASE DON'T STOOP TO ITSUKI'S
LEVEL WITH THOSE KINDS OF JOKES.

107
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,125
- YOU FLATTER ME.

108
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,166
- DOES SHE LOOK LIKE
A JOKE TO YOU?

109
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:39,958
- Rin: PRIMULA?

110
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,125
- Kaede: ARE YOU OKAY?

111
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,000
- Boy: ( whispering )
WHO'S THAT GIRL?

112
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,291
- WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

113
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,916
- ( whispering ) ANOTHER GIRL
HERE FOR RIN?

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,541
- Girl: OH MY GOSH!
SHE'S SO ADORABLE!

115
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,375
- Boy: ( whispering ) THIS
ONE CAN'T BE A GOOD IDEA,

116
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,208
EVEN FOR HIM!

117
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,291
- HI, RIN.
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

118
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,958
- WHAT HAPPENED? WAS THERE
A PROBLEM AT HOME?

119
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,708
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

120
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,166
- THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
THAT'S BOTHERING HER.

121
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,500
- SO I GUESS THIS MUST BE
THE NEW ONE, RIGHT?

122
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,500
DO YOUR OTHER GIRLFRIENDS
APPROVE OF THIS?

123
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,625
- GIRLFRIENDS? WHERE DO YOU COME
UP WITH THIS STUFF, MAYUMI?

124
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,666
- WELL, THEY ARE YOUR
GIRLFRIENDS, AREN'T THEY?

125
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,625
COME ON, THE TRUTH
NEVER HURT ANYONE.

126
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,875
- THERE IS NOTHING TRUTHFUL
ABOUT THAT STATEMENT!

127
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,708
- RINA! ( screams )

128
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,125
RINA, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
SHE CALLED US RIN'S GIRLFRIENDS!

129
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,583
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
IT'S JUST LIKE A DREAM!

130
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,041
- I KNOW IT'S KIND
OF EMBARRASSING,

131
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,791
BUT THE THOUGHT OF BEING
WITH HIM LIKE THAT

132
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,708
JUST MADE MY HEART BEAT
A LITTLE FASTER!

133
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,333
- RIN'S GIRLFRIEND?

134
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,833
- ( students muttering )

135
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,500
- ( clock chiming )

136
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,583
- LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE, MAYUMI.

137
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,416
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THIS, REALLY?

138
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,208
- WHATEVER, STOP TRYING TO
COVER IT UP AND INTRODUCE HER.

139
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,958
COME ON! WE WANT TO MEET
GIRL NUMBER FOUR, BE POLITE!

140
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,916
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
SOME KIND OF FAN CLUB.

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,958
THIS IS PRIMULA. SHE'S LIKE
NERINE'S LITTLE SISTER

142
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,666
WHO FOLLOWED HER
FROM THE WORLD OF DEMONS.

143
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,958
- ( gasping ) IS THAT TRUE?

144
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,458
- UH, WELL, YES.

145
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,625
- NERINE'S FATHER ASKED
IF SHE COULD STAY WITH US,

146
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,416
SO WE'RE TAKING CARE OF HER NOW!

147
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,250
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS YOU'RE LIVING WITH

148
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,250
THE HOT LITTLE SISTER

149
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,666
WHO ISN'T ACTUALLY
RELATED TO YOU,

150
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,625
SO IF YOU LOOK, IT'S OKAY. NICE!

151
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,750
- YOUR ABILITY TO TURN
AN INNOCENT SITUATION

152
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,333
INTO SOMETHING
OBSCENE AMAZES ME.

153
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,750
OH, HEY, SORRY ABOUT THAT!

154
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,333
SO DID SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN
AT HOME? WHY ARE YOU HERE?

155
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,250
- BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

156
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,541
- OH.

157
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,958
- ( students muttering )

158
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,000
- ER...

159
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,541
LOOK, IT'S JUST...
WHY NOW?

160
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,166
- LOOK.

161
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,041
- IS THIS ABOUT THE TOY?
- HM.

162
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,291
- OH, YEAH.
THE ARM'S RIPPED.

163
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,500
- IT'S NOT BAD!
IT'S JUST THE SEAM.

164
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,791
I CAN FIX IT WHEN I GET HOME
FROM SCHOOL TODAY.

165
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,291
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

166
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,458
NEXT TIME IT'S OKAY FOR YOU
TO WAIT FOR US AT HOME

167
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,416
IF IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY.

168
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,625
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

169
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,500
- WHAT'S GOING ON? THE BELL
STOPPED RINGING A LONG TIME AGO.

170
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,083
- TSUCCHI, ARE YOU CAUSING
A DISTURBANCE AGAIN?

171
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,916
- I'M SORRY, BUT SHE JUST
SORT OF SHOWED UP.

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,333
- I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS,
BUT YOUR CLASS IS ABOUT TO START

173
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,166
AND YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
NEEDS TO GO HOME, NOW.

174
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,583
- IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO
GO BACK TO THE HOUSE.

175
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,916
- OKAY, RIN.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,666
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
BE CAREFUL.

177
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,291
WHAT'S WRONG?

178
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,875
- Nadeshiko: OKAY!
LET'S GET STARTED!

179
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,791
- ( thunder rumbling )

180
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,958
- PLACES SUCH AS THE PYRAMIDS
IN EGYPT, STONEHENGE IN BRITAIN,

181
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,583
MACHU PICCHU IN PERU,

182
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,833
MOHENJO-DARO...

183
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,666
WHY WERE THESE ANCIENT PLACES
BUILT AND HOW WERE THEY MADE?

184
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,583
IN ALL MANKIND'S LONG HISTORY,
THERE HAVE BEEN...

185
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,750
- EXCUSE ME.

186
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,541
- YES?
- GOTTA USE THE RESTROOM.

187
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,125
- TOO WET.

188
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,250
- HEY.
- ( gasping )

189
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,000
RIN!

190
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,416
- IT STARTED POURING RAIN
OUT OF NOWHERE AGAIN.

191
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,666
WHAT A PAIN, HUH?

192
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,250
- SURE IS.

193
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,458
- CLEAR SKIES DON'T
MEAN ANYTHING

194
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:01,083
THIS TIME OF YEAR, YOU KNOW?

195
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,208
- I'M SORRY.
GUESS YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

196
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,250
- UM-UM.

197
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,000
- LISTEN, WHEN YOU GET HOME

198
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,291
MAKE SURE YOU TAKE
A NICE HOT BATH.

199
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,833
THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS FOR YOU TO CA...

200
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,208
( exclaims )

201
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,750
- WHAT'S WRONG, RIN?

202
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,958
- YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T
HAVE A BRA UNDER YOUR SHIRT?

203
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,083
- WHAT'S A BRA?

204
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,750
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOU
PROBABLY DIDN'T NEED ONE

205
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,291
OF THOSE WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

206
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,708
FIGURES.

207
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,166
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE
GOING ON A SHOPPING TRIP SOON.

208
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,208
WHY ME?

209
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,750
- RIN?
- HM?

210
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,666
- FORGOT YOUR UMBRELLA...

211
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,708
- UM-HM.

212
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,708
- I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT!

213
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,500
- ME, EITHER.

214
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,625
ALTHOUGH IN MY DEFENSE,
I AM A GUY.

215
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,041
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO KNOW
ABOUT THOSE THINGS.

216
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,708
- AW, POOR THING.
SHE MUST BE CONFUSED.

217
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,500
I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING FOR HER SOONER.

218
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,458
- LIKE WHAT? I MEAN, IT'S NOT
LIKE YOU COULD HAVE JUST

219
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,375
GIVEN HER ONE OF YOUR OLD ONES.

220
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,708
MAYBE WE COULD GO
SHOPPING ON SUNDAY?

221
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,041
- YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,583
- WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CAT?

223
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,541
- I FIXED IT, BUT IT'S PRETTY
WORN OUT IN SOME PLACES.

224
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,000
IT'LL PROBABLY RIP AGAIN.

225
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,083
- THAT STUFFED ANIMAL
DOES LOOK PRETTY OLD.

226
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,583
IT MAKES ME WONDER
IF IT HAS SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

227
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,500
- MAYBE. BUT HOW WOULD WE KNOW?

228
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,416
SHE HASN'T TOLD US
ANYTHING ABOUT HERSELF.

229
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,916
- YEAH, I KNOW.
SHE'S SO QUIET.

230
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,125
- ( door opening )

231
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,416
- ( giggling )

232
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,791
- HELLO, HOW'S IT GOIN'?
LEMME GUESS?

233
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,750
YOU WANT TO GO SHOPPING.

234
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,083
- WHA... HOW DID YOU KNOW?

235
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,333
WHY IS EVERYONE OUT
HERE WAITING FOR US?

236
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,541
- KAEDE TOLD US YOU WERE
SHOPPING FOR CUTE LINGERIE,

237
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,458
SO WE THOUGHT
WE'D COME HELP OUT.

238
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,916
- YEAH, I MEAN THE THOUGHT OF
YOU PICKING OUT UNDERWEAR ALONE

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,875
IS PRETTY SCARY
TO SAY THE LEAST,

240
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,791
AND IF YOU WANT TO FIND
THE BEST GIFT POSSIBLE

241
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,833
THREE RINGS ARE BETTER THAN ONE!

242
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,666
- ( sighing ) YOU WANT
TO HELP US? RIGHT.

243
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,416
WHY DOES IT SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE JUST USING THIS

244
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,375
AS AN EXCUSE TO GO SHOPPING?

245
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:25,708
- ( laughs ) OH, RIN! YOU WORRY
TOO MUCH, YOU KNOW THAT?

246
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,416
- THANKS. THAT'S COMFORTING.

247
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,041
- SO, IS THERE ANY KIND
OF STYLE IN PARTICULAR

248
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,250
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR?

249
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,666
ANY COLORS OR PATTERNS YOU LIKE?

250
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,666
- DON'T KNOW.
- OKAY!

251
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,791
THEN YOU LEAVE
EVERYTHING TO US!

252
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,000
- YAY, I'M EXCITED! THIS
IS GONNA BE SO MUCH FUN!

253
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,500
- OH, MY GOSH, THESE ONES
ARE SO CUTE! RIN, LOOK AT THIS!

254
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,041
- ( exclaims )

255
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,458
- ORANGE STRIPES.
YOU KNOW, WITH THE RED HAIR?

256
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,000
- YEAH, UM, IT'S GREAT

257
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,083
BUT I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING...

258
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,000
( groans )

259
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,208
WHAT DO YOU THINK? DOES
THIS MAKE ME LOOK SEXY?

260
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,083
- AWW, THAT'S SO SWEET!

261
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,291
ASKING HIS APPROVAL SHOWS

262
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,958
HOW MUCH YOU TWO
RESPECT EACH OTHER.

263
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,083
DO YOU LIKE IT, RIN?
IT'S SO CUTE!

264
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,875
- UH, LISTEN. THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

265
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,541
- COME ON, DON'T BE SHY!
YOU LIKE IT, DON'T YOU?

266
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,791
YOU CAN SAY IT.

267
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,958
- WOULD THIS ONE
LOOK PRETTY ON ME?

268
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,416
- OKAY, SO WHICH DO
YOU LIKE BETTER,

269
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,833
THIS ONE OR THE
ONE I HAD BEFORE?

270
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,666
- Asa: RIN!

271
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,958
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.
DOES THIS MAKE YOU WANT ME?

272
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,333
TELL THE TRUTH.

273
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,916
- I GOTTA GO!
I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE!

274
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,458
( panting )

275
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,250
OKAY, THAT WAS AWKWARD.

276
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,916
- Boy: LET'S GO TO THE ARCADE!

277
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,625
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BEAT ME TODAY!

278
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,416
- RIGHT, THE ARCADE. THAT'LL BE
A GOOD PLACE TO KILL SOME TIME.

279
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,541
- ( Japanese song playing )

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,583
- TOO BAD. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THEY HAVE ANYTHING NEW.

281
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,083
WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

282
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,916
THIS IS WHERE I
FIRST SAW PRIMULA.

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,125
SHE WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE...

284
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,583
STARING AT ONE OF THOSE
CRANE GAMES SO INTENSELY.

285
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,916
THERE WAS SOMETHING I WAS
TRYING TO WIN FOR HER THAT TIME.

286
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,166
SOMETHING IT SEEMED LIKE
SHE REALLY WANTED.

287
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,375
WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER
WHAT IT WAS?

288
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:34,916
RIGHT!

289
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,458
A CAT!

290
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,208
- UM.
- UM-UM.

291
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,916
IT'S MAY BE TOO CONSERVATIVE.

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
- WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING
MORE LIKE THIS?

293
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,333
- IT'S KIND OF SEE-THROUGH.

294
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,750
- ( giggles ) MORE THAN KIND OF.

295
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,083
YOU KNOW THAT SET
OVER THERE MIGHT BE BETTER.

296
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:01,041
OR YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
MORE ON THE MATURE SIDE, RIGHT?

297
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,041
RIMU?

298
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,083
YEAH, SHE AGREES.

299
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,125
- I THINK SHE'D LIKE SOMETHING
A LITTLE LESS FLASHY.

300
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,500
- Kareha: OH, MY GOSH! LOOK!

301
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,333
CHECK THIS OUT!
ISN'T IT PERFECT FOR HER?

302
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,791
- ( giggling and squealing )

303
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,875
- IT'S BOLD!
A NICE CHOICE!

304
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,166
- YOU REALLY HAVE
AN EYE FOR COLORS!

305
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,458
- SO THAT'S THE KIND OF
STYLE YOU'RE INTO?

306
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,541
- IT IS SEXY.

307
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,625
YOU!

308
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,041
- YOU GUYS? CAN YOU COME
OVER HERE FOR A SEC?

309
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,000
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU!

310
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,125
- AGH. WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?

311
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,833
- WE'RE COMING!
- YES?

312
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,958
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

313
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,916
- I CALLED YOU HERE BECAUSE
THERE IS SOMETHING

314
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,208
PRETTY AMAZING
BEHIND THIS CURTAIN!

315
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,625
DUH-DUH-DUH-DUH!

316
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,291
- ( drum roll )

317
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,083
- ( laughing )

318
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,791
- OH, MY GOSH!

319
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,333
- WHERE'D RIN GO?
DO YOU THINK HE LEFT?

320
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,750
- WE WERE IN THERE FOR A WHILE.

321
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,250
MAYBE HE GOT TIRED OF WAITING
AND DECIDED TO GO HOME?

322
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,625
- NO WAY. HE WOULDN'T
LEAVE HER HERE LIKE THAT.

323
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,166
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

324
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,041
- I'M HERE! SORRY!

325
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,208
- PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE!

326
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,625
WE'RE SORRY WE MADE YOU
WAIT SO LONG.

327
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,625
- WE GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

328
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,291
THERE WAS SO MUCH FUN
LINGERIE TO PLAY WITH

329
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,291
AND WE COMPLETELY
LOST TRACK OF TIME.

330
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,083
- YOU PLAYED WITH
"FUN LINGERIE."

331
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,291
OH, GREAT, I'M AFRAID TO ASK.

332
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,500
DID YOU BUY HER SOMETHING LACY,

333
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,750
STRINGY, INAPPROPRIATE
AND SEE-THROUGH?

334
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,333
- ( laughing sheepishly )

335
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,666
THEY DID TRY TO TAKE
SOME OF THAT UP TO THE CASHIER,

336
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,333
BUT I CONVINCED THEM
TO PUT IT BACK.

337
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,208
- YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

338
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,500
AH, WELL. I HOPE
YOU WERE AT LEAST

339
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,458
ABLE TO GET WHAT YOU NEEDED.

340
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,500
- IT TOOK A REALLY LONG TIME.

341
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,083
- ( chuckles )

342
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,458
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
DOING SOME SHOPPING YOURSELF.

343
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,958
- YEAH, I DID. I WANTED
TO GET SOMETHING FOR PRIMULA.

344
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,916
- CAN YOU TELL US WHAT IT IS?

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,500
- WELL, IT'S A SOUVENIR.
YOU SHOULD OPEN IT.

346
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,500
- A SOUVENIR?

347
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,125
- I SUPPOSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE LIKE A PRESENT, THOUGH.

348
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,250
- I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE.

349
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,166
- A CAT.

350
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,833
- YOU WANTED ONE WHEN WE
FIRST MET. DO YOU REMEMBER?

351
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,416
- THANK YOU.

352
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,916
- I HOPE IT'S OKAY,

353
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,208
SINCE IT'S NOT THE SAME ONE
YOU WERE LOOKING AT BEFORE.

354
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,333
- NICE KITTY.

355
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,166
MY CAT.

356
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,291
- YOU LIKE IT?

357
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,750
MY CAT.

358
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,416
- HOW SWEET. AWW.

359
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,541
- AND SHE'S SMILING. IT'S THE
FIRST TIME SHE'S DONE THAT.

360
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,208
- NICE GOING, YOU STUD!

361
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,208
- YOU THINK OF EVERYTHING!

362
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,416
- THANK YOU.
THAT WAS SO NICE.

363
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,791
- HOW DO YOU COME UP
WITH THINGS LIKE THAT?

364
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,083
- OO LA LA-HAH!

365
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,208
- NOW, LOOK. WE ALL
WANTED TO CHEER HER UP!

366
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,958
I'M JUST GLAD SHE SEEMS TO
LIKE HER PRESENT, RIGHT?

367
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,041
- WHAT THIS TOY
MEANS TO ME IS LOVE.

368
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,708
- MY LOVE.

369
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,083
THANK YOU, RIN.

370
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,125
( giggles )

371
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,750
- WAY TO GO, RIN! WAY TO MAKE
HER FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU!

372
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,500
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY, ASA.

373
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,250
- ( theme song playing )

374
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

375
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,583
- Kaede: SO, I'M TEACHING
PRIMULA HOW TO COOK.

376
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,500
- Asa: USE THE TRADITIONAL
COOKING CLUB PRACTICE DRILL

377
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,833
OF A THOUSAND KNIFE SWINGS!

378
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,250
- OH, OF COURSE I WILL!

379
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,916
- AND THE SLICING
AND DICING RACE?

380
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,375
- WE'RE COVERING
ALL THE BASICS!

381
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,958
- Rin: IS ALL THAT
REALLY NECESSARY?

382
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,666
- Asa: NEXT TIME ON SHUFFLE
EPISODE 7, ROMANTIC SCRAMBLE!

383
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,708
- Kaede: NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS FIND A SECLUDED MOUNTAIN

384
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:22,875
WHERE WE CAN TRAIN!

385
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,000
- Rin: WHAT?
