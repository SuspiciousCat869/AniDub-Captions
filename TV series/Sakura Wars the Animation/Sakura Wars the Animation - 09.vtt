[REIJI]
Let's keep it moving!

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.219 position:50% align:center
And be quick about it!

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:13.430 position:50% align:center
We don't know when the
enemy might make a move!

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.182 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
You're kidding me!

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.643 position:50% align:center
Moscow freakin' attacked us!

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
Why would the media think
we're working together?

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] Because they
can't know the truth.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
Tokyo's citizens wouldn't
react well to the realities

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.194 position:50% align:center
we're currently facing.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.487 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
She's right.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.948 position:50% align:center
Accepting that one combat
revue attacked another

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
is asking a lot right now.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA] And there's
a bigger issue at hand.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
There are demons operating
within the WLOF.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
She's not a demon!

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
She's Klara!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
And Klara is a demon.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:45.378 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO growls]

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
Her amnesia may have been an act

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
to fully gain our trust.
A way to hide amongst us.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA] Don't forget Leyla--
Klara's sister is a demon, too.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO growls]

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Commander.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
Do we have any ideas
where Klara might be right now?

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
Well... No.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
Authorities and the
military are searching,

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
but they currently
don't have any leads.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.278 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] What about
the Moscow Combat Revue?

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.448 position:50% align:center
The Sevastopol vanished
from sight last night.

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.408 position:50% align:center
We have no idea where it is.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.869 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Miss Sumire,
you have an incoming call.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
I'm unavailable.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center
Have them
call back another time.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.458 position:50% align:center
Please, Ma'am.
Will you answer?

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
The caller is Captain Kamiyama.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
Seijuro?

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA sighs]

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
There you are, loveliness.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA gasps]

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Kaminski...

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI chuckles] The Imperial
Combat Revue would never think

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.507 position:50% align:center
to look for us underwater.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
It's brilliant, isn't it,
my dear Leyla?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Yes.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
And that angel of mine?

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50% align:center
You know where to find her?

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
The two of you are sisters.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
Kin inexorably bound
by blood and bond.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA whimpers]

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] Klara has
illustrated her full potential.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
Hers is a torch of hope
that could illuminate

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
this dark, stagnant world.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
Leyla your sister
Klara's light will guide

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
the generations en masse.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
She is my true ambition.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
Am I no longer worthy of you?

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
Speak plainly.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA] I gladly offer myself
to you and all of your ambition.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
Klara might not.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
--[KAMINSKI] Sisterly love?
--[gasps]

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
Or envy, Leyla?

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] Either way,
these feelings are gratuitous.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Now, Leyla M. Ruzhkova.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:45.702 position:50% align:center
I, Valery Kaminski hereby,
order this of you--

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
Bring me my angel.

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
It will be done.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
[KLARA panting]

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU]
Good morning, Klara.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Miss Hakushu...?

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
Where am I...?

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU]
You've been here before.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
It's the orphanage
Sakura brought you to.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
I happened upon
you lying unconscious.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
I couldn't just leave you.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should have.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your help.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
Rest more, my dear.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
No... If I don't go,
I'll just bring trouble.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
Someone will get hurt.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
Klara. Do you remember?

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.866 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
That's why... I can't stay.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
And... I can't go back
to the theater. Ever.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
That's exactly why
you should stay!

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
Naoya!

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
[NAOYA] I... told you,
you'll always be welcome here.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
So stay, Klara.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
A demon?

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
It's all right.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
No one here will judge
or bother you, Klara.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
I see...

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
It all makes perfect sense now.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
A fraud?

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Captain.
What do you mean by that?

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
The members of the
Moscow Combat Revue

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
that were attacked at Petrograd.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
They were badly injured,
but managed to survive.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
That's what Kaminski
told you, isn't it?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Yeah. Something
about consuming flames

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
and them being like
phoenixes now or some crap.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
Kaminski lied.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center
I traveled all across Russia.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
I've confirmed that
every one of them is dead.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] The real
Moscow Combat Revue was

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
visiting Petrograd
that fateful day with

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
a specific goal in mind.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center
The entire revue perished
when their airship went down.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 9A]
Gospodin Kamiyama.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
I have got a message
for you here.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Thank you. I'll return later.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA] Sorry for
not getting out of bed.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] I've been in contact
with a woman recently.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50% align:center
A doctor called
Natalia Ruzhkova.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
Hmm.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Wait, Ruzhkova?

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
That's Klara's last name.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Keep talking.

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
You see, she was a scientist
doing research on demons.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
M cells?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA] Yes. You see, I used
cells that had been harvested

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
from a certain greater demon.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
I succeeded in splicing
together human and demon DNA.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center
I created life.
I called them "Nadezhda."

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
They're half-human
and half-demon?

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA] You make something so
complicated sound so simple.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
I failed over and over again.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
I'd nearly given up
all together.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
But I kept going because
I knew what they could do.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
They'd bridge
the gap between us.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
Show the world that
we're not so different.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
Bring a new age.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
My girls were born.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] There were two
Nadezhdas created by Natalia.

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.488 position:50% align:center
The older girl was Leyla.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
The younger one was Klara.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
It's true? The two of them
really are sisters?

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
[KLARA] Leyla and I called
the woman Natalia "mother."

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
She loved us like one.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Mother... She was very kind.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
We were happy before.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Before that day...

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
Kaminski?

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
He volunteered to join us.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
Kaminski said he
could further our research.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.196 position:50% align:center
I was naïve, I know that now.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
He'd never revealed how
he came upon our research,

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
but it seemed he wanted
humans and demons to coexist

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
as much as I did.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
Trusting him was a mistake.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
I should have seen it before.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
Twisted ambition
rots that heart of his.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
What does he want?

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
All he wants is
to rule this world.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA gasps]

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
He'll use my girls to do it.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
The power of the Nadezhda
is what he was after.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
He just waited for his moment.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
[KLARA gasps]

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA gasps]

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA] I took Klara
and ran as far as possible.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
Then I... I contacted the WLOF
and told them everything.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
They would meet her
in Petrograd, they said.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50% align:center
The local revue.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center
So, the Moscow
Combat Revue's mission...

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
It was Klara.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center
But they didn't succeed.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.255 position:50% align:center
No. They didn't.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
Kaminski knew exactly
where to find Klara.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
He arrived in Petrograd
at the same time

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
and many lost their lives.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA grunts]
Quiet.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA gasps]

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
What are they?

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
Kaminski's mechanical dolls!

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.779 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Natalia!

00:10:56.072 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA coughs]
Kaminski is a disturbed man.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
Leyla is one thing, but Klara...

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
If he realizes her true power,

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
he'll do whatever
it takes to use it.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
Save your strength.
I think you need a doctor.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
No.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.550 position:50% align:center
My poor, sweet girls...

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help them before
and I know I can't do it now.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
Captain Kamiyama, please.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
Please promise me
you'll protect my daughters.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
I... I'll try.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
Promise me!

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
Promise me...

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
I promise. I'll protect them.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
I have a very
good friend in Japan.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
I feel sure they
can help you, too.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] There was a lot of
chaos following the airship.

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
Clearly, Kaminski failed
to secure Klara in Petrograd.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
That's when the Imperial
Combat Revue was given

00:11:56.633 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
Moscow's original assignment,
which was to safeguard Klara.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:04.307 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] Without informing us
that she was a Nadezhda.

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
Yes, Commander.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
They must've assumed that we
would decline the assignment.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
Regardless,
Klara is still an innocent.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
We've done our duty.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
The rest of it you know.
That's all I have to report.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.745 position:50% align:center
Now awaiting orders, Commander.

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Thank you, Captain Kamiyama.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
Continue learning what you
can on the European front.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
We'll be in touch shortly.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
Ma'am!

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
Okay, ladies.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Now we know the truth.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
The question is:
what do we do with it?

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
[KLARA] The Imperial
Combat Revue exists only

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
to destroy all demon kind.

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
Now that they know what I really
am, they'll try to kill me.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU]
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
Your mother Natalia and I
aren't the only ones.

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
Many more wish for coexistence.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
[NAOYA] It'll take time until
that world becomes a reality.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
You see,
that's why we stay here.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
This place is for us.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
Not to protect the humans
from the demons,

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
but to protect the
demons from the humans.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
Naoya's right.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
There are several demons
living here right now.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
Human and demon children,
under the same temple roof.

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
All without conflict.
It isn't impossible.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
Because they're... family?

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU]
Yes.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
Well, Klara? What about you?

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
Where's your family?

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.483 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:40.737 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] If I'm completely
honest here, it's too much.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.948 position:50% align:center
Kaminski, Nadezhdas,
everything else...

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
But... I can't get Klara's
face out of my mind.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.496 position:50% align:center
Those tears...

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.915 position:50% align:center
I never want to see
that pain again.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
If Klara came back,
I'd hold her.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
I'd say to her, "Welcome home."

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.299 position:50% align:center
What do you want to do?
Stay here?

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:04.427 position:50% align:center
Maybe even return to Sakura
and the Flower Division?

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
They would accept you.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Yes.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center

[ORPHAN KIDS yelling, sobbing]

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center

Come, Klara.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center
I'll take you where you
truly belong, dear sister.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Now.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
[NAOYA]
No!

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
Klara's not going
anywhere with you, lady!

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
That so?

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center

[NAOYA grunting]

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.599 position:50% align:center
As I suspected.

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
But not all your friends
are demons, are they?

[ORPHAN KIDS screaming]

00:14:58.023 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center

sort of resilience, sister?

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50% align:center

Don't test me.

Are you certain?

[REIJI]
It's been confirmed, ma'am.

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center

They were hiding in the ocean?

Are you kidding me?

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Why resurface now?

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
They're after something.

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Or someone.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
This fake revue has
only ever had one objective.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
They must have found Klara.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shiba!
What's the repair status?

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Just finished up!

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.241 position:50% align:center

when you are, ladies!

Um, Commander?

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Yes. Acting Captain Amamiya.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
Bring her home.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
Do what you have to
and protect this family!

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] The Imperial
Combat Revue is here!

Sakura! Everyone!

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Now that your
little revue act is over...

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50% align:center
...what do you say
we do this right, Leyla?

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
I'm more than willing to
watch your people fail again.

Get ready for disappointment!

Right!

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Heh. Looks like you're
all that's left now, Leyla.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
So it would seem.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed at the effort.
You ladies don't hold back.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for you,
I don't hold back either.

You're nothing but a monster!

Oh, is that right?

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Heh. You think I'm a
monster now, do you?

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
How soon you forget.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
That girl you pretend to care
so much about is just like me.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO growls]

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA] You see?
Do you understand now?

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.293 position:50% align:center
They'll never accept
what you are, Klara.

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
But Kaminski will
embrace you with open arms!

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center
He needs you as much as I do!

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
Just give it a rest, Leyla.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
[WHITE CAPE] You don't know
what you're talking about.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
[WHITE CAPE]
You're wrong.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
You can't see the true
picture, but she can!

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
Klara knows what she needs,
who she needs,

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
and who needs her!

[KLARA gasps]

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
[WHITE CAPE]
The answer is quite clear.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
[KLARA gasps] How?
How do you know all of this?

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
[WHITE CAPE]
Because...

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
I am none other
than Hakushu Murasame.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
The Japanese friend their
mother Natalia spoke of.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Master?

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.968 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU]
I'm sorry, Sakura.

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU] Everything will be
revealed when the time is right.

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
For now, let's focus on Klara.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
Leyla. Think this through.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
Deep down, I know you just want
your sister to be happy.

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA growls]
Klara!

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
My home is with Sakura
and the other girls.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Goodbye, sestra.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Klara!

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
Sakura!

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Welcome home, Klara.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA screams]

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
Kaminski!

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
The spiricle
engine's overloading!

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
It could explode any second!

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
[KLARA groans]

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Sakura!

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
Eject!

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
Sakura, can you hear me?!

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
[KLARA] I'm coming...
I've got you, Sakura.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
[KLARA gasps]
Why?!

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.383 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA] Did you forget how
much power you used yesterday,

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
little sister?
It takes time to regenerate.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
No...

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU grunts]

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
Oh? That's quite impressive.

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
Let's see how you handle this...

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
My angel.
Leyla, bring it to me!

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
No!

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
Sestra!

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center
Let me go!

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
Sakura!

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
Sakura...!

00:23:23.862 --> 00:23:25.655 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA] There's the pain
that comes from being betrayed

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:27.532 position:50% align:center
by those you believe in,
and the pain that comes

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:29.367 position:50% align:center
from betraying your comrades.

00:23:29.451 --> 00:23:32.120 position:50% align:center
But even so, if you continue
to believe in them

00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:33.663 position:50% align:center
in the bottom of your heart,

00:23:33.747 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
someday, you'll
understand each other.

00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:39.419 position:50% align:center
