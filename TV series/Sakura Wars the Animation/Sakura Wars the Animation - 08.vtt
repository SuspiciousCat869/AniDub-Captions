00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.896 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Ethereal...

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center
Absolutely exquisite.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
Power and beauty
in physical form.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
You are the embodiment
of all I have ever desired.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
No! No, don't look at me!

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
Don't look at me!

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center
I marvel at your allure.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
The hour of judgment is nigh.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.044 position:50% align:center
Do not deny us your grace.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
My salvation and humanity's
redemption rest with you.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
He saw the monster.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
And deemed me
something to be cherished.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Now...

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Leyla.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:13.073 position:50% align:center
Today is the day.
The day your sister returns.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get ready.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
It's time for a match.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
The Imperial Combat Revue:
Flower Division versus

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
Moscow Combat Revue!

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50% align:center
I'm your host, Komachi Oba!

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
And I'm your commentator,
Reiji Shiba.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
The match is about
to officially kick off!

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] The Moscow Combat
Revue issued a challenge

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
to the Flower Division!

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Yep! Care to tell us why?

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] We are not Klara M.
Ruzhkova's first revue.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
She is a former member of
the Moscow Combat Revue.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
As you know, she now belongs
to the Imperial Combat Revue:

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
Flower Division.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
But the Moscow Combat Revue
wants Klara back with them!

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] Oh-ho-ho!
So, this whole match is for

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
who gets Klara once and for all?

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] That's right!
And this match is..

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:50.146 position:50% align:center
...being held without
a single audience member!

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.025 position:50% align:center
Aw, man! How am I supposed
to make any money?!

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] The match is,
however, being streamed

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50% align:center
for the entire world to see.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
The whole world's watching!

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.534 position:50% align:center
No pressure at all!

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
I'm pleased you
accepted our challenge.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
We are quite honored.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
An internationally
broadcast campaign?

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
You knew we couldn't decline
without appearing weak.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
I am not impressed.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.423 position:50% align:center
You wound me, Commander.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
Still time to refuse, though
spectators wouldn't be pleased.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] True. Neither
would any of our allies.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
I'm certain every combat revue
in world is also watching.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
A refusal could destroy our
reputation and partnerships.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
You're so right.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
That is quite the conundrum
you've found yourselves in,

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
isn't it? Best of luck,
Imperial Combat Revue.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI grunts]

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
Leyla.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
I leave the rest to you.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
I'm sorry.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Why are you apologizing?

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
This is my fault. I'm causing
problems for you and-- Ahh!

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Don't be silly.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
They wanted a fight,
and we're giving them one.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
Family takes care of each other.
Ain't that right?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center
Now. Just cheer up!

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
We've got this!

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
You don't have to worry
about a thing, Klara.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
We're here for you.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
And we'll protect you
no matter what!

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO chuckles]

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] Well!
The match is ready to begin!

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.412 position:50% align:center
Let's do this thing!

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] The match will
consist of three rounds total.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
The first round will be
a dance battle to see who can

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
swing and sway the best!

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Heck yeah!

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
If you want a dancer,
I'm your girl!

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
The Flower Division is up first.

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
Hatsuho Shinonome
is our first contender!

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
Does our girl have the right
moves to take the win

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
this round, folks?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Hatsuho Shinonome!

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Okay.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
Let's see what
you're really capable of.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.866 position:50% align:center
This ought to be
very interesting.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
I know you can do this.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Hatsuho's dazzling.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] Ah! Hatsuho has
already started her routine!

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
A traditional Shinto dance!

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
The original purpose
was to purify the body

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
and summon a god into oneself!

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] Every movement
is precisely calculated!

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
Superb!

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] Oh! I can see
a whole field of flowers!

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
Those are special
projected images!

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
What amazing technology!

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
Who on Earth could've
made such a thing, huh?

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
It was none other than--

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
It's time turn up the heat!

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.777 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA] Beautiful cherry
blossoms of the East.

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
Well... Kaminski is watching.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center
I will die before
I disappoint him.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
She set the bar pretty high.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Indeed.
But it just won't be enough.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
I have returned!

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
You were amazing!
I'm so proud of you, Hatsuho!

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
Aw. Way to make
a gal blush, Sakura.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
You were like a magical fairy!

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.188 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO chuckles]
Thanks, munchkin!

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Time to cool off!

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.026 position:50% align:center
Up next from the Moscow Combat
Revue is the girl cloaked

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
in a veil of snow
and ice that slays!

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
Leyla!

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
Now. Show them how it's done.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
Let them witness true beauty.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Splendid!

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Huh? What is?

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
It's The Black Swan!

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
This is a dance best known
as a pas de deux,

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.095 position:50% align:center
which is meant to be
performed with a partner

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
and she's doing it
perfectly alone!

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
She moves almost
like she's flying.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
There's more than that.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
She's crying with no one there.

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
It's her sorrow.

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
This stirs emotions.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
It's far more
compelling than ours.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.138 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA panting]

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] That was something
else, ladies and gents!

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
And so ends the first round
of our combat revue match!

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Truly an elegant Black Swan!

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
32 fouettés is not an easy feat!

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
I can't say who did better!

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling a lot
of feelings right now

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
and I don't know
how feel about that!

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that makes
two of us, Shiba!

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.284 position:50% align:center
Here come the scores!

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
First, for technical!

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Matching scores!

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO growls]
Seriously?

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
You're dead even...

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI]
Next up is artistic impression!

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:51.758 position:50% align:center
Ah! Moscow got a perfect score!

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] Artistic impression
determines the winner!

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
Ah. I thought the scores
would be more of a nail-biter.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
The judges are
old-fashioned European.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
Evidently, they chose to favor
the dance they knew best.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
[KOMACHI] The Moscow Combat
Revue wins the first round!

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50% align:center
Klara, I'm so sorry...

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Mm. Don't be.

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
Your dance was
wonderful, Hatsuho!

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
We can make up the difference.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
Hey, she's right.
We're still in!

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.539 position:50% align:center
Let's kick butt
for Klara, ladies!

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.998 position:50% align:center
[IMPERIAL REVUE]
Right!

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
Kaminski!

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center

Understand, my revue
is one of dignity.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:32.233 position:50% align:center
Far too refined to participate
in something so uncouth.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:35.862 position:50% align:center
Thus, Moscow is obligated
to withdraw from this.

A withdraw...?

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center

[REIJI] Each revue has
three units for this round.

we've previously
seen from them,

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center

We have the advantage here.
