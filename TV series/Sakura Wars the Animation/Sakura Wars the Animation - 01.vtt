00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
What a rush!

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
The audience
seemed really into it!

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA] I've got a good
feeling about this show's run!

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
As do I. Well done, everyone.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Go us.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Okay! Who's ready for grub?

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
I'm starved.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
Better change first.
You'll ruin your costume.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
I'm not that messy!

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA sighs]
Nobody's noticed.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
Now's my chance.
I hope he remembers.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
Take care of everyone.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
When I get back,
I'll make it up to you.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.643 position:50% align:center
We'll do something,
just the two of us.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
Whatever you want.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
Seijuro...

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
Will you keep your promise?

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
Here's hoping.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
Then there's the matter of her.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
This girl.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
She's the sole survivor of
the Moscow Combat Revue?

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Yes, Ma'am.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
Regrettably, she remembers
nothing of the incident.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
The WLOF believes the trauma
resulted in retrograde amnesia.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
I hope it's temporary.
But I can't say for sure.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
I see. Where is she now?

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
Kaoru's watching over her.

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
The journey's taken its toll.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
A good night's sleep
is called for.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.935 position:50% align:center
Very good.
We must remain vigilant.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
We cannot afford
to let our guard down.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:55.066 position:50% align:center
I'm concerned the two you
encountered are still a threat.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Unfortunately...

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center
...there was a stipulation.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
Upon my bringing Klara here,

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
I've been ordered to return to
complete the necessary paperwork

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
at headquarters, Ma'am.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
That's rather curious.
Paperwork, you say?

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
Why would they request you to
travel for something so menial?

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Excuse me.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Seijuro, hey!

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
Sakura? Are you okay?

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
No.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.847 position:50% align:center
Just... I really wanted
to ask you something

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
and couldn't wait
another second.

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
We can discuss the show later.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.853 position:50% align:center
For now, get everyone
to the control room.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] Ladies. There
was a major incident

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
in the outskirts
of Petrograd a week ago.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.280 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA] The timing isn't
a coincidence, is it?

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
You're right.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
That's when Seijuro left
for his secret mission.

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI] Correlation.
They're clearly related.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
To say the least. Yes.

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
The cover story was an
unfortunate explosion.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center
However, the truth
is far more disturbing.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
An attack was launched on
the Moscow Combat Revue.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
Their airship crashed.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] Only one member
has been accounted for.

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
The others are considered
missing for the time being.

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
WLOF sent a directive.

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:12.227 position:50% align:center
Combat revues around
the world complied.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
We each sent a member
of our teams to investigate.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
And you sent Seijuro.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
Every revue represented.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell all of you before.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
Shortly after
arriving in Russia,

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
I met with Elise from the
Berlin Combat Revue

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
and Lancelot from London.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.621 position:50% align:center
The three of us were tasked
in securing the only person

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
found after the attack.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
It was Klara.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
You said "securing."

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
What exactly did that entail?

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
Someone appears
to be after Klara.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
After her?!

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] Klara was
found without so much as

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
a scratch on her.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
If that weren't mysterious
enough, she was attacked

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
by two unknown assailants on
the way back to headquarters.

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
It was apparent
they opposed one another.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
Luckily, with the help
of Lancelot and Elise,

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
their missions failed,
but both escaped.

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
One was very powerful.
Almost like a greater demon.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.285 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] Why was Klara
the only one we found?

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
Who exactly is after her?

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
So much is left unanswered.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
Klara remembers nothing.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.172 position:50% align:center
Her life and memories
from before?

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center
They're gone.
But if someone is after her,

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
it's safe to say
she's important.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
I can't speak to who she is
or what she might know.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
But she needs us.

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
The poor thing's been
through quite the ordeal.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
What about the assailants?

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
Can you tell us anything else?

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
No. They haven't
attempted another attack.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
That said... We took
heavy precautions.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
To keep Klara safe,
it was decided that she would

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:47.197 position:50% align:center
leave Russia for a while.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
It's all starting to make
perfect sense now.

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
That's why you brought
her back with you, isn't it?

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] Exactly.
The WLOF wants Klara protected.

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
So I brought her home.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
I mean, what better
place than here?

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
Well. We are the strongest
combat revue, after all.

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.672 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
That's part of it.

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center
But think of what
Klara's been through.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
She's lost comrades.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
She's forgotten herself.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
She's in danger.

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
And she's all alone.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
You're saying she needs us?

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
We're one big family.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
That means we help each other.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Very true.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
We're family.

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think I get
what you're saying, Cap.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
Klara needs people
in her corner.

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
People like you.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
Because we're a family,
she'll trust us.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.748 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
I have faith in you.

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
All of you.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
Don't let me down.
Klara's a part of the team now.

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
I hate that I immediately have
to return to headquarters.

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
But I know the Flower Division
will make her feel welcome.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
Ladies. Show Klara what it means
to be a part of this family.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
Oh, Seijuro...

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
You can count on us, Kamiyama!

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:03.732 position:50% align:center
Yes, Sir.

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
My friends...

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
Seijuro. You don't have
to worry about Klara at all.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.658 position:50% align:center
We're going to
take good care of her!

Looks like they're headed
straight for the theater!

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
Demons?!

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.329 position:50% align:center
We haven't seen a single one
for some time now.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
Curious. Why would they
target the theater?

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center

Is it demons?!

Huh?

No one's going to
hurt you now, Klara.

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
Kamiyama. You know what to do!

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
