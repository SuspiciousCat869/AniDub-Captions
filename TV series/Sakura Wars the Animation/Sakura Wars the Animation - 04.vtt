[KANZAKI] Have you finalized the
paperwork for Klara's transfer?

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.346 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Not yet.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
For some reason, they're giving
me the run around at every turn.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.102 position:50% align:center
I'm hoping to have
it all resolved soon.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
Captain. There's been
a development since you left.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
A group claiming to be the
Moscow Combat Revue has arrived.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
They're demanding
we return Klara.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.487 position:50% align:center
They what?

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
WLOF officials haven't
resolved the matter.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
They won't send an arbitrator.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
Negotiations between us
are at a complete standstill.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
It appears we're on our own.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.584 position:50% align:center
I haven't heard
anything about them.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
But why is that?

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
The revue's return
would change things.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.007 position:50% align:center
Something isn't right.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
I'll get to the bottom of this
and find out what I can.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:52.385 position:50% align:center

Be careful, Captain.

I got my ass kicked.

What'll Kamiyama say about that?

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.043 position:50% align:center
I didn't even tell Sakura
I was leaving.

the girl who just runs away.

Oh no! We're never
gonna see Hatsuho again!

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
Everything's fine. She, uh...

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
Well. She's just... Right!

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
She went back for Spring
festival season.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
Hatsuho had to go and help.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center

[SAKURA] You got yourself
all worried and worked up

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
for nothing, Claris.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
She'll return when
the festival is over.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
I'll be happy to
give her extra lessons.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
Sounds perfect!

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
Oh! I could go help, Hatsuho.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
The shrine could use
the extra support.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
Not to mention it'd get her
home much quicker.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
This is perfect!

[KOMACHI
Eh... Thousand yen?

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI] I can't afford that.
The price is far too steep.

Ha, ha! Can I let you in
on a little secret?

Yes.

call, I wouldn't have left!

who would prepare the shrine?

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.281 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot how excited
I'd get when I knew

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
we were coming here.

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Yeah...

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
The shrine and that beautiful
Thousand Year Cherry Tree.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Kamiyama made
Sakura acting captain.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.798 position:50% align:center
He chose my best friend.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
Why not me?

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Why can't I
stomp down this jealousy?

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
We're looking pretty good now,
don't you think?

00:09:58.515 --> 00:09:59.599 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] I'm gonna
step out for a second

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
if that's all right with you.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Klara. You stay here
and help Hatsuho.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
'Kay...

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.279 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Sakura's a force
to be reckoned with

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
both onstage and in battle.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
She's moving forward and
I'm struggling to keep up.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
I can't help but feel like
she's leaving me behind.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
There!

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
Ochen' krasivo!

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
Looking good!

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
Welcome back.

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:05.957 position:50% align:center
Almost started to worry.

00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
Hey, Klara, you trust me?

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.671 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Hmm?

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
[KLARA gasps]

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Aw, Klara! You look great!

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50% align:center
We're matching!

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Now we're really
ready for the Yoimiya!

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
The Yoimiya?

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
Just think of it as kind of
a pre-festival!

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
There's even ritual dancing!

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Wow!

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Sakura?

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA giggles]
I remember this.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
--Pretty...
--[ringing]

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
[ringing continues]

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
Klara, what's wrong?

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
--[ringing fades]
--[sighs]

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I'm good.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Yukata? I'm so jealous.

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Remember yourself.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
Village Rule 44: Ninja must
never wear flashy outfits.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.325 position:50% align:center
But...

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I am so excited.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
--[gasping]
--Oh, it's starting!

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
Hatsuho?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center

--[ringing]
--[KLARA whimpers]

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
Sestra...

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
Klara?

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Stop. It's nothing.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
Uh. Are you sure?

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Hatsuho!

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO sighs]
I'm exhausted!

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
Here! You did great.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
It was pretty astonishing.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
So. Why in the world
didn't you tell us

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
that you'd being doing
the dance this year?

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
To surprise you.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.703 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Right! I remember
how much you used

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
to struggle with dancing.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
A lot's changed.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
Since then, I've practiced
all kinds of choreography.

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
And I wasn't the only one
struggling back then.

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
Ah! Story time's over!

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Hey, Klara, you
wouldn't believe how many times

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
Sakura tripped over her own
feet when she first started.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA whines]
I said story time is over!

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Aside from the Bon
Odori, my dance experience

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
was fairly limited.
It's hardly my own fault.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
She's come a long way
since then, Klara.

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
You'll catch up.
Just got a feelin'.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
I was a mess before
Seijuro came along.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
I hope everybody can
come next year.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Everybody?

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center
You mean The Revue?

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
The whole team.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
The girls, Kaoru, the commander,
Komachi, Reiji--everybody!

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center
And you, obviously. Heh.

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
--Promise?
--[SAKURA] Mm-hmm.

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] We'll all have to dance
under the cherry blossoms, too.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
Even Seijuro
will have to join us.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.518 position:50% align:center
They don't bloom.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[gasps]

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
Wh-What do you mean?

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] I mean,
the cherry tree hasn't blossomed

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
since that day.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.199 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
What day?

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
You were there.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
We tried to do the dance ritual.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA grunts]

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
Come on.
Can't you do anything right?

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
You're so clumsy!

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.309 position:50% align:center
You're being mean!

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
What? Nuh-uh!

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I'm not like you!

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
You know I'm doing
the best I can!

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
You're so good at everything!

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.527 position:50% align:center
I can't fight or climb
or hopscotch like you!

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
You even dance better than I do!

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Because it's part
of my family's history, dummy.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
No fair!

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
Hey, calm down.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
No fair! No fair! No fair!

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
[sobs]
I want... I want to dance.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
Well, you can't!

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
Shut up! You can do everything,
and it's not fair!

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
It is fair!
It isn't my fault you suck!

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
[sobbing]

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
Big baby! Go home!

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Hmph!

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA sobbing]

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Man... Mother was
so mad at me after you left.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
I was a brat.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
So was I.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
I can't believe neither of us
brought this up before tonight.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
Right. We probably should have
done it sooner than this.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
No! I was a green-eyed
little crybaby

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
who wanted to be just like you!

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
the coolest kid ever!

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
Uh! Where's this coming from?

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing.

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
I've wanted to apologize
for a long time.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
I was ready to do it
when we were younger,

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
but my father stopped doing
business with the shrine.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
I thought...
I'd never see you again.

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me, too.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
Figured I was the reason
you didn't come back.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
I was miserable
that following Spring.

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I'm so sorry, Hatsuho.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
For everything.

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
You're my best friend and
you deserve so much more

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
than I've given you.

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
I think that's my line.

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
I haven't been fair
to you, either.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
Wait, wh-what are
you talking about?

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] I've been a real
pain in the ass lately.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
It was wrong to
take it out on you.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
Don't apologize.

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
Come on, Sakura.
It's the least I could do.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.463 position:50% align:center
I should have
followed your orders.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
I should've listened.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I can't believe I forgot!

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
You were right before!
You should be sorry!

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me!

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA giggles]
You're forgiven.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
I wasn't actually mad.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Just worried.

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
You're my best friend.

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
Sakura...

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA giggles]

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO chuckles] You really
are amazing, you know that?

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
What makes you say that?

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what a mess
the Flower Division was

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:42.580 position:50% align:center
when you first came to
the Grand Imperial Theater?

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
Honestly, the place was
on its last legs.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
Things only turned around
because of you.

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
What? That isn't
even remotely true!

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
If I did anything at all, it was
because I had you with me.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
I was about to quit.
I just couldn't take it anymore.

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] The Shanghai
Combat Revue were the ones

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
protecting Tokyo from demons.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
Our plays were downright awful.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Hatsuho...

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
But then you showed up, Sakura.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
And the captain
came along soon after.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
Everything changed
for the better.

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
We were a real team.
All of us became a family.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
You're why the
Flower Division endures.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
We're nothing without you.
Don't you see that?

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
We're nothing
without our captain.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
Or you, Hatsuho.

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
Or Claris.

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
Or Azami.

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
Or Anastasia.

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
We got here together!
Deep down, you know I'm right.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
Think of all we've been through!

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Mm. Together.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.401 position:50% align:center
[KLARA gasps]

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
Klara?

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center
The cherry tree.
How did it look?

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
Try to remember.

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI gasps]

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
[KLARA sighs]

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
It's blooming!
The Thousand Year Cherry Tree!

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Beautiful...

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
Did you do this?

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
We did. When I watched you two,
my chest began to grow hot.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.810 position:50% align:center
All I did was reach out.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
Wow. I can't believe
we did this!

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
Nice going, Klara!

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
--[gasps] Klara!
--Klara!

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:20.238 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.
I'm just a little tired.

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
Why would you do this?

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
Because of you.

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
No. I owe every
one of you so much.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
Your revue has
been there for me.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:32.083 position:50% align:center
I consider you all my friends.

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.419 position:50% align:center
And when a friend
is sad or needs help.

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
You do just that.

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:37.255 position:50% align:center
By reaching out.

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:43.345 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA giggles]

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI gasps]
The light in her eye...

00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:25.363 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Klara M. Ruzhkova.

00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:27.699 position:50% align:center
Formerly of
the Moscow Combat Revue.

00:23:27.782 --> 00:23:30.910 position:50% align:center
Nothing else is known about her.

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.163 position:50% align:center
Suspicious! Very suspicious!

00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:37.584 position:50% align:center
Village rule 24: If you don't
know it, it's an enemy!

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:40.754 position:50% align:center
Next time on Sakura Wars

the Taisho cherry blossoms!
