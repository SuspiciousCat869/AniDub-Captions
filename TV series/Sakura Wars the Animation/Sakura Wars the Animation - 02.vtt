00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
In reviewing the receipts
you submitted yesterday,

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
I've noticed several of them
appear to be from last month.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
Really? That's weird.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
I must've forgotten to--

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] This isn't the first
time you've done this.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.315 position:50% align:center
Please make it the last.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
It makes my job
needlessly complicated.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
Do we have an understanding,
Miss Amamiya?

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
Ah... I understand.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
Splendid.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
--And you.
--[gasps]

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] Learn from her mistakes.
Turn things in on time.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
Listen up.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center
I'm Komachi Oba and I run
the one-stop shop here!

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
You want anything from toilet
paper to an aerial battleship,

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
I got you covered.
Anything for the right price!

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
Welcome aboard!

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.926 position:50% align:center
A battleship?

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
I'll even give you
a discount! Eh-heh!

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
You know, you've got that
"sweet, young ingénue"

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center
thing going for ya.

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
Yes! Yes! I can work with this!

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
Sorry. What are
you talking about?

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
I'm talking about the sweet,
sweet dough we're gonna make

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
on that even sweeter
mug of yours, little lady!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
You are gonna be a goldmine.

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
Posters, bromides, manju--
all kinds of cool stuff!

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
This is where we bathe!

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
I knew nobody would
be in here in the morning!

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:49.047 position:50% align:center
Bet you've never seen a bath
this big before, have you?

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
The huge space does take a
little getting used to at first,

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
but I know you're
just going to love it.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Huh?

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Klara. Meet Reiji Shiba.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
He's our Chief Engineer.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
Whether it's a prop for a show
or a piece of equipment,

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.735 position:50% align:center
his mechanical skills
are top-notch!

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
Now. What do you have
to say for yourself, mister?

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I wanted a bath
after an all-nighter.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
I assumed I would be alone here.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
All-nighter?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center
There was a build worth losing
a whole night's sleep over?

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50% align:center
Yeah, actually.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Is this... the Type-3 Kobu?

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
On the outside.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
Inside's where
I worked my magic.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
A few dozen tweaks paired with
some new and new-ish parts!

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
And voila, my masterpiece!

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
The Type-3 Kobu Custom!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
The Type-3 Kobu Custom, huh?

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Yep. Tuned up and ready
to go when we need it.

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
Totally worth losing
a night's sleep, right?

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] I don't know about
that, but it's beautiful, Shiba.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] I gotta say,
it was a really fun build.

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.995 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.164 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Last, but certainly not least.

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
The stage!

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
What do you think, Klara?
Impressive, isn't it?

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Oh, yes.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
I know the audience
is going to love you.

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
You think so? Really?

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA giggles]

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:31.107 position:50% align:center
[KLARA] Thank you for
all of this, Sakura!

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
I can't tell you
what it means to me.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
I just... It...

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
While I am happy to
be a part of this revue.

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.202 position:50% align:center
I...

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
You what?

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
No, forget I said anything.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
Ah. I just remembered!

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
There's still one more person
you absolutely have to meet!

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
A tour and now
a field trip, huh?

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
Anything to make her
feel more comfortable.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
Let's just give Klara some time.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
We should all remember
our first days here.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
The girl. Was it chance?

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
Chance?

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
A demon horde emerges
out of nowhere in Tokyo

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
the day she arrives?

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
Is this purely coincidental?

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Demons popping up
ain't unheard of.

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
You're overthinking this.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.203 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
Is she?

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
Kamiyama himself is
still seeking answers.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
No one knows what
really happened to

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
the Moscow Combat
Revue's airship.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA] It is rather
"convenient" that Klara

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
can't remember anything
that happened that day.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
Come on. The three of
you can't be serious here.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Maybe.

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO sighs]
To hell with your maybe.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
You seem to be forgetting
something important.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
Our captain is the person
that brought Klara here.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
He asked us
to treat her like family.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
Family doesn't
suspect each other.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
We accept them.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
Just like Sakura and
the rest of you accepted me.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
You're right, Hatsuho.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
Despite who I was before,
the lot of you embraced me

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
as family.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
Yes. The least we can do is
offer Klara the same treatment.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Mm.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO chuckles]
You're damn right we can!

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Who are we meeting now?

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
Is this person
important, Sakura?

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
She taught me how
to wield a sword.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
Master Hakushu Murasame.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
Your master?

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
Yep. She's a sucker
for our kitchen's omurice.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
You can usually find her
in the dining hall.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
She's basically an honorary
member of the revue.

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
I can't wait for
you to meet her.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:50.205 position:50% align:center
Where are we?

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
This is more or less
her favorite spot.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
She's usually relaxing
around here on a good day.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
Since the weather is nice, I
thought it would be a safer bet

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
than the dojo, but I guess not.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
[bell donging]

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
[KLARA gasps]

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
Hey, Klara.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
Since we're out and about, what
do you say we get some tea?

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back.

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
I see. That's fine.

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:25.365 position:50% align:center
But try to be back
no later than 1500.

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50% align:center
Right. Understood.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
What the heck...?

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
Amamiya? Is there a problem?

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Some weirdo with
a cape and mask is--

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
--[glass shattering]
--[SAKURA shrieks]

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
Amamiya? Amamiya?!

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
Amamiya, what's going on?!

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
White Cape has the nerve
to attack Sakura?!

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
Well. We can't say that
for certain just yet.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
White Cape... Sakura did mention
the attacker wore a cape.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
There is no one else
it could be!

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
White Cape is
definitely the culprit here!

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
But why? Why go after Sakura?

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
Why not?!

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
The reason is moot.
We have to help Sakura.

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
Yes. We are wasting time!

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA panting]

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Who is that?

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
And why are
they coming after us?

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center

This way!

Hatsuho!

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
Just in time!

And here I thought I had

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
a decent head start.
Doesn't matter.

I've still got what it takes to
stomp you out, buddy!

[AZAMI] The mask,
cape and outfit in general

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
aren't exactly
"white," are they?

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Semantics!
Focus on what's important.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
They came after us.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.813 position:50% align:center
To attack a single member
is to attack all of us.

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
Fair point.

I concur!

No, stop!

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
They knew my name.

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center

You're awfully worked up.
What's the matter, Sakura?

00:18:58.263 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
Right. Did you see
anyone peculiar?

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
Maybe wearing a white mask?

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
Well, a very dashing
individual wearing a mask

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
may have crossed my path.

that's the same person.

Yes... I just don't
understand why.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
Maybe the Black Cape attack
freaked her out a little.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.100 position:50% align:center
Maybe she thinks she's
responsible or something.

Could Klara be responsible
for her own revue's attack?

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.067 position:50% align:center
That's ridiculous.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it is.

suspect if Klara could recall
