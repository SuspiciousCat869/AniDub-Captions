00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
Right again.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
A WLOF director was literally
a puppet of Kaminski's.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
Yes. They probably took
advantage of the Genan incident.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
Shameful. They knew where
loyalties rested

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
and exploited us.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
But... the WLOF is
back to normal, right?

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
Yes. But... it may be too late.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, Captain?

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] The European
nations are deeply concerned

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
about Kaminski and
the power he has.

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
I think they're on the verge
of total surrender.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
If they want to yield, let them!

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
But we're not gonna back down!
We're going to fight to the end!

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
We can't leave Klara
with that man.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
She's counting on us!

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.718 position:50% align:center
She's family. Right, Captain?

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] Right. And we
shouldn't abandon Tokyo.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
You have my support.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
Sakura?

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
Sir?

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
I heard you lost your Mugen.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
What will you do?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
I'll adapt.
I'll take the Type-3 Kobu.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
The Kobu?

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?
You might want to reconsider.

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I know that it's old,

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
but it's my only
option right now.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
W-We don't know what
kind of condition it's in.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
Err on the side of caution--

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
That's enough.

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
Miss Sumire...?

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.877 position:50% align:center
Well. Are you sure about that?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] Then I've only
got one thing to say.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
Save Klara.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50% align:center
I know you're there.
Come out.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.099 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] Natalia mentioned
you and I've got more than

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
a few questions,
but now is not the time.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] Though I will ask
you to watch over my girls

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
until I'm able to get back home.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about that?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
I am. Just don't let me down.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
Do everything you can
to put a stop to Kaminski.

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
And bring Klara home.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center
Imperial Combat Revue:
Flower Division, roll out!

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
[FLOWER DIVISION]
Yes, sir!

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
Type-3. Help me once more.

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
Damn, I'm good!

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
It's an old mecha, but she's all
tuned-up and ready to rock!

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.195 position:50% align:center
Listen up, ladies!

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:19.406 position:50% align:center
I repaired them all but it was
a quick turnaround!

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
Your mechas aren't remotely
operating at full power!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
Don't try anything dumb!

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah. Got it!

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] I'm apprehensive
about sending them out

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
in hastily repaired units.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Me, too.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
What are you thinking?

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] We haven't considered
how they're supposed to get

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
to the Sevastopol.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Any idea Shiba?

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
I'm insulted you
even have to ask.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.141 position:50% align:center
I made something
faster than the Skywhale.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.685 position:50% align:center
It's a launching mechanism
that can get a spiricle striker

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
to its target in an instant!

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
I call it... The Great Bow!

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
When did you find the time?

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] Okay, ladies!
Get ready to launch!

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center
Miss Kanzaki.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
Is the "White Cape" persona
really necessary?

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU] You have your rituals
and I have mine.

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center
Are you going with them?

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
I made a promise
to Captain Kamiyama.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
And I won't let him down.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] Listen,
this thing wasn't built for

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
a person to ride in.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
I can't promise
a smooth journey.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.077 position:50% align:center
I'll survive.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Ready to fire!

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
Sakura, you're up first!

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.381 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Right!

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
Hang on, Klara.
I'm coming for you.

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Release!

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Look who decided to show.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.001 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
What should we do?

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
Follow through on
my warning of course.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
Destroying Tokyo would be
the proper response here.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
But where would
the fun be in that?

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
Sir?

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
Ah, hell.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
Look who it is.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
The Moscow fakers!

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
Robots!

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
Just like The Black Cape.

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Well there you have it.

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.334 position:50% align:center
Kaminski must have
been behind everything.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA gasps]
There are so many!

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
We could barely handle
just one in the last battle!

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU]
There's no time for hesitation!

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU growls]

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
Now, follow me ladies!

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Right! Hatsuho?

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
Keep them distracted
any way you possibly can.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
You got it!

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.285 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Azami and I will
strike at their cores!

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
It will be done!

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.164 position:50% align:center
Anastasia, Claris,
provide back up!

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
Roger!

00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Let's go!

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO grunts]

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA growls]

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Hah!

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU] Sakura, I'm leaving
this all with you.

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
I'm off. I have to destroy
this Rage of Tunguska.

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Right, Master! Be careful!

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.316 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU]
You, too.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry...

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Exquisite...

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
Isn't your sister
absolutely beautiful?

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center
Extraordinary.

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
A half-demon's existence
is a delicate balance.

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
There are so many limitations
on what they can do

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
in their fragile human form.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
When they
overexert themselves,

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
they revert to a
crude demonic state.

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
Sadly, they're never
able to turn human again.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
That part of
their heart is lost.

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:59.811 position:50% align:center
And, without a true compass,
they kill and rampage.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
Your sister's abilities in her
simple human form

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
are unparalleled.

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:08.194 position:50% align:center
Oh, Klara.
You are the ultimate half-demon!

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
Sister...

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] You must
be honored to share blood

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
with someone
so significant, Leyla.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Hmm.... Yes.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO yells]

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Hah!

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.176 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA yells]

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA grunts]

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Damn it!

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
There's no end to these
mechanical monsters!

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:46.858 position:50% align:center
How many of them are there?

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Hatsuho!
Complain later, fight now!

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Yes, Captain!

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50% align:center
Sakura! The Kobu is starting
to reach its limit!

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.207 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] I know that!
But I don't have a choice!

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
I have to push on!

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Sakura!

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.258 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Come on!

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
The steam exhaust
valve's been cut!

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
It's not gonna keep up!

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
You've gotta get
out of there now!

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center
I can't!

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Sakura!

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
I'm not leaving this machine
until I've rescued Klara!

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] And how will you do
that if your unit can't fight?

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
Think this through!

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Listen to him, Sakura!

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
I think he's right!

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
Klara would never forgive us

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
if we let something
happen to you.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Quit being stubborn!

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
Leave this to us!

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
You're not alone!

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
We've got your back!

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
Ladies...

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Take this!

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Haah!

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA gasps]

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA grunts]

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
I can't leave you.

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
I will not run when everyone
around me is fighting!

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
[grunting]
Please!

00:18:58.013 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Impossible...

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't function
with all that damage.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I am never giving up!

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI chuckles]

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
Amamiya.

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Are you prepared
to do whatever it takes?

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA gasps]

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
Miss Sumire?
What are you suggesting?

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Don't do this! She's not ready!

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center
It could instantly deplete
all her spirit power!

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
Amamiya.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
Staying on this course could
drain you of your spirit power.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:32.881 position:50% align:center
Even end your life.

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:35.216 position:50% align:center
Do you still wish
to fight knowing this?

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
Yes! Whatever it takes!

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Understood.

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
Promise you'll try
to come back to us.

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
That's an order, Amamiya!

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I promise!

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
Hell's bells.

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
I didn't think I'd be
seeing you again, girl.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Look after Sakura for me.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
What's that?

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
No way...

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
The prototype Obu?

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.644 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA grunts]

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
Sakura...?

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
Ladies! Let's buy our girl time
while the Obu activates!

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:34.901 position:50% align:center
--[AZAMI] Right!
--[CLARISSA] Of course!

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
Indeed.

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA growls]

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
Careful, Sakura.

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
The Obu requires a tremendous
amount of spirit power.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
This is nothing like the mechas
you've dealt with before.

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
Stay calm, be strong and
don't let it overwhelm you!

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
Give 'em hell!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
I can do this!

00:20:57.132 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
Obu... I can't protect my family
without your help.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
I need you to wake up!

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA grunts]
Oh, no!

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Sakura!

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.272 position:50% align:center
Obu. Wake up.

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:14.190 position:50% align:center
Help me do this!

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Prototype Obu,
activation complete!

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.959 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Holy crap.

00:21:33.043 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
She took them all out.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
With one attack.

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Obu, thank you!

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
We're just getting started.

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
Let's go get Klara!

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Sakura Amamiya coming through!

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:25.989 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Leyla. My sister through blood.

00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:29.075 position:50% align:center
She's the only kin
I have in the entire world.

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:31.661 position:50% align:center
But now I have others
that I call family.

00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:32.912 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:36.332 position:50% align:center
Stay safe and please
be careful, Sakura!

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:40.086 position:50% align:center
Next time on Sakura Wars
the Animation, Episode 11:

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.214 position:50% align:center
"A Fantastic, Tragic Love!
Leyla's Heart!"

The winds of adventure blow over
the Taisho cherry blossoms!
