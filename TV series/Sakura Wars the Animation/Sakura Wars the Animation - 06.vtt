'Kay...

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
Her moves...
I've seen them before.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
This way!

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
Are you all right, Sakura?

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
Yes. But I... I'm not
equipped to stop Black Cape.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50% align:center
Don't be too sure about that.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
--[HATSUHO] Sakura!

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Leave it to us!

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
The Imperial Combat Revue:
Flower Division's here!

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
Got an anonymous tip!

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
What?! A tip? When?

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
Minutes ago.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
If only we knew
who gave us the tip off!

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
Get ready, Sakura.
Time to gear up!

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
My mugen...

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
Don't look too surprised there.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
Shiba was able
to launch it unmanned.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Go, Sakura!

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.793 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Right!

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] You ain't getting
away this time, Black Cape!

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.601 position:50% align:center
Not if I have anything
to say about it!

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
Let's get him!

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Where are we?

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
[NAOYA] Somewhere we'll
be safe. Don't worry.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
Miss Hakushu told us to hide
here if something happened.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
Very smart of her.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN whimpering]

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
Not a single one of us have
any other place to go

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
outside of here.
Especially someone like me.

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
Before coming here...

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
...I did a lot of bad things
just to be able to survive.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I would
even hurt people.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
But then... Miss Hakushu
was there to help me out.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
She never judged me for
who I was before we met.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
She started calling me "Naoya."
She gave me a home and a name.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
So what do you think?

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:19.197 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
This could be your
home, too, Klara.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't have to
worry about anything here.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Ceremonial Hammer!

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO growls]
Stop moving around!

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Did we get him?

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.728 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Not yet!

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
Sakura's hunch was right.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
Black Cape isn't a human being.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
Machine? Cyborg? Android?

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
There's no time to
contemplate what it could be.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
Just focus!

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center

[HAKUSHU grunts]

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
Not bad.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
Master!

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
That thing's still moving?

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Not good!

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center

Naoya? Midori's missing.

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
[NAOYA]
Huh?!

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.649 position:50% align:center
[BOY 6A]
She was cleaning out the annex.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.734 position:50% align:center
She might still be there.

00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:22.028 position:50% align:center
[NAOYA]
'Kay. I'll try to find her.

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Wait! I'll go with you.

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
No way. You're
staying right here.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
I should... But...

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
I can help! I'm part of the
Flower Division, remember?

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:39.212 position:50% align:center
Are you sure? Is that where
your family is, Klara?

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Mm-hmm.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.
We better hurry up.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
What in the world
is it doing now?

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.292 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's you!

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. White Cape's here!

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
[WHITE CAPE yells]

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Wow...
She's holding her own there.

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
In fact, I'd say she's more
than a match for that thing!

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
It's her. I'm certain of it.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
It's still coming.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.417 position:50% align:center
And stronger than ever.

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
What will it take
to defeat that thing?

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center
Enjoying this little break
you're having, Sakura?

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.177 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I am not taking a break!

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
Wait, I've been meaning to
ask--how do you know me?

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
[WHITE CAPE] Now's not
the time to discuss that.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center
Look. Do you see
that crystal-like object

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
at the center of its chest?

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
[WHITE CAPE]
Safe to assume that's its core.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
[Destroy its core, Sakura,
and you can end this right now.

It's over now.

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] You mean to
tell me this whole thing

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
was part of some
plot you cooked up?

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
It was. Though I
didn't mean to deceive you,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.733 position:50% align:center
I felt it necessary in order
to force the enemy

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center
to reveal themselves.

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
It was clear they wouldn't
attempt to abduct Klara

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
on theater grounds.

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
And you made sure to
get her out of here, didn't you?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
To use her for bait!

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
I was bait?

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
Klara.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
Your safety was my top priority,
I assure you, little one.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
That's why I had Sakura
accompany the two of us

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
on our outing. Who is
better suited to protect you?

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA sighs]
I guess you have a point.

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
But, wait... How could
you have known that someone

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
was after Klara in the
first place, Master?

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.348 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU chuckles]
Isn't it obvious?

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
What kind of teacher
would I be if I didn't know

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center

little of me, Sakura?

I suppose that answer
will have to do.

will be safe now?

where you belong.

want to be anywhere else.
