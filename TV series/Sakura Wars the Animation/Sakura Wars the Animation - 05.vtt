[AZAMI sighs]

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
That light in her eye...

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI] She's tied to
the Moscow incident.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
Klara could be a saboteur.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.618 position:50% align:center
If that's the case, the whole
theater would be at risk.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
This might end in tragedy.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
Too many uncertainties
surround this girl.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.168 position:50% align:center
I must pursue the truth.

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
Only then will my home
and family be safe.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
I am well-versed
in shadow and secret.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
For I am a ninja.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
Believe me, the manju there
are beyond delicious.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
--[HATSUHO] Oh, wait!
--[AZAMI] Klara's already got

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
her hooks in Sakura and Hatsuho.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
What are you doing?

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Secret shadow!

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.402 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Huh?!

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.487 position:50% align:center
[muffled whimpering]

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
Do you wish for
our theater's demise?

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.324 position:50% align:center
I am trying to save us!

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.450 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
Klara!

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.036 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.580 position:50% align:center
We can no longer ignore
circumstances surrounding

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
the Moscow airship.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.293 position:50% align:center
If Klara's involved, we must
see to it that another revue

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
doesn't suffer the
same fate. Understand?

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.340 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
And what if she's innocent?

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.676 position:50% align:center
Then I'm wrong
and we'll be safe.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.427 position:50% align:center
But I must be certain.

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.346 position:50% align:center
Imagine something happening
that the two of us

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.722 position:50% align:center
could've prevented.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.015 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Ah...

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.852 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
I'm with you.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.270 position:50% align:center
You're so right.

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.314 position:50% align:center
I couldn't to live with myself
if anyone was harmed.

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.316 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Mm.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
And no matter how this pans out.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.782 position:50% align:center
It could serve as inspiration
for my new script!

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.200 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] Excellent stage
whispering, ladies.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.372 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
I'm in, too. Let's get to
the bottom of this, shall we?

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.543 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Shiba?

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.294 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.353 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] If I let something
happen to the theater

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
while Kamiyama was gone,
I could never face him again.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center
And, not that it's a competition
between us or anything,

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.238 position:50% align:center
but I'm way better than he is
when it comes to recon.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
I had no idea!

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
Yep. Kamiyama's a
little too "by the book."

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
A guy like me is all about the
stealth and intrigue, you know?

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
That's so interesting!

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
I forgot you knew
Captain Kamiyama before.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Hmph!

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Why is Claris encouraging him?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA] That's right!
I'd love to hear some stories!

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. There was
this one time when we--

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI] Now is not
the time to reminisce.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
Klara is the matter
at hand here.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
My mistake.

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
Right. Well, with intelligence
gathering in mind.

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
I've got some stuff here
that could prove handy.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Memos that melt in water!

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
Don't need it.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] Ink that
disappears after drying!

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
Maybe another time.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
The Classic Disguise!

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
Already got one.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
Ah... Aw... Of course you do.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
Come by and tell me more about
Captain Kamiyama later, okay?

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.838 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI growls]

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Ah!

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
Azami. Too impatient
to wait for breakfast?

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
Why not make yourself useful?

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
I am!

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
Hey, Claris.
Didn't see you there.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
Hi. Oh, look! There's Klara.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
Unhand me!

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA] Looks like
you could use some help.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
Spasibo!

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Come on, sit down.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
Here's your breakfast.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Ah. That's
what I'm talking about!

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
Isn't it a tad early
for such a big meal?

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:31.539 position:50% align:center
Just eat something already.
Maybe your mood will improve.

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI groans]

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the food!

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the food.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
U-Uh...

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
My poor stomach.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
At least we weren't caught.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
--Look!
--[CLARISSA] Hmm?

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
Suspicious.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say that.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
Why would Klara go back there
outside rehearsal hours?

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Hmm...

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
What are you doing backstage?

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
I thought... Uh, I...

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
And don't lie to me.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
You've been following
Klara since this morning.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
Ohh...

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
You've got it all wrong, Sakura!

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Is that right?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
See... Much to my dismay,

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
writer's block has
reared its ugly head.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center
Azami was kind enough to offer
her assistance on a new story.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
Azami, huh? Azami's been
helping with a script?

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
--Yes!
--[AZAMI chuckles]

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
It's a... You see,
it's a gripping detective story.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
I figured a ninja consultant
could firm up my B-plot.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
A B-plot, really?
This is research for you?

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Uh. Yep!

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
Clever, isn't it?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
We're running all over the
theater for sake of our art.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
Pay us no attention.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Mm, mm, mm!

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA groans]

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Sakura...?

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.298 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
If it's not asking too much,
don't scare any more kids today.

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.856 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I can't believe
Sakura fell for that.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
That was amazing, Claris!

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I'd say that.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
I would. You made that excuse
up right on the spot!

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50% align:center
What actress
doesn't love improv?

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
Though... I wasn't lying.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
Our next play
will be a detective story.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
I still think you're amazing!

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Azami.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to
resume our "research"?

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
There.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.426 position:50% align:center
Where is she going?

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Klara, are you okay?

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Sakura...?

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I'm right here.

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:34.841 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
I am so glad you were
both there for Klara.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
You're, um...

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
...welcome?

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
Where exactly were you going?

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
[KLARA sighs]
Follow me.

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Hmm?

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
Just look at it.
It's like my rodina.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
Your rodina?

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
It means "homeland," doesn't it?

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
You see, I recently read
a poem about Russia.

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
And I recalled some things.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
This right here
makes me feel at home.

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center
A view like your homeland's.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI sighs]

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
Bol'soe Spasibo!

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
Ball show. Uh... What was that?

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Uh...

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
Right, sorry. Thank you.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
You saved my life.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Hmm.

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Shiba.

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
I'm confused as to
why you're here.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
You left the hangar without
proper authorization.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
Ah... Uh...

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA] It's a shame
we never managed to find out

00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
what Klara might be hiding.

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
You're wrong. We did.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.888 position:50% align:center
What? What do you mean?

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
It was exposed during
your second assault.

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
Klara has power.

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
Her ability amplifies another's.

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:13.481 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.
I did feel a lot stronger.

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
This also explains why
the Moscow Combat Revue

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
is so frantic to get her back.

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
That would make sense. But...

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center
Klara's part of the
Flower Division now.

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
She's family.
She's not going anywhere!

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Mm.

00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:10.974 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:13.893 position:50% align:center
Cough alone, work alone.

00:23:13.977 --> 00:23:16.021 position:50% align:center
Be alone...

00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:25.113 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
I can't believe that I,

00:23:25.196 --> 00:23:27.574 position:50% align:center
Clarissa Snowflake,
doubted sweet Klara!

00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:30.702 position:50% align:center
Even though members of the Revue
are supposed to be like family!

00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:32.537 position:50% align:center
I'll have to make up
for my failure!

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.082 position:50% align:center
And I will! Mark my words!

00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:39.669 position:50% align:center
Next time on Sakura Wars
the Animation, Episode 6:

00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:43.048 position:50% align:center
"Strange and Bizarre! The True
Identity of Black Cape!"

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:46.551 position:50% align:center
The winds of adventure blow over
the Taisho cherry blossoms!
