00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:14.931 position:50% align:center
What the heck is that thing?

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.311 position:50% align:center
Something's coming down from it.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.154 position:50% align:center
Who are you?!

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.739 position:50% align:center
Come on, speak up!

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
If it's a fight you're looking
for, you're off to a good start!

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
You're messing with
the Imperial Combat Revue!

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
One of you better start talking!

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
--[AZAMI] Look.
--Huh?

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
There's one more up there.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
Curious displays
never bode well.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.104 position:50% align:center
At least in our experience.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.527 position:50% align:center
Do forgive my ominous arrival.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.363 position:50% align:center
You need not be alarmed.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.114 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:17.285 position:50% align:center
I'm Kaminski. Valery Kaminski.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.372 position:50% align:center
Captain of the renowned
Moscow Combat Revue.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:29.297 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.675 position:50% align:center
Greetings, oh, fairest maiden.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.885 position:50% align:center
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Here you are.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Much appreciated.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
Ah. It is quite delightful.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center
Though...
Might you have any jam?

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
Uh... I'm sorry?

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
A dollop is common back home.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
I suppose we Russians
do have our eccentricities.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
Though I highly
recommend you try it.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Excuse me?

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.513 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Hmm? Yes, lovely?

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
We've received
conflicting reports on

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.893 position:50% align:center
the Moscow Combat
Revue's status.

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
Yes, that.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
The WLOF tasked the revue
with a special assignment.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
We were welcoming a new member.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
She was to await our arrival
amid the outskirts of Petrograd.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
But...

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
Things didn't go accordingly.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
We were ambushed by
an unknown adversary.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
Our airship fell,
the revue along with it.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
Fortunately,
not a single member perished.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
Though my revue will carry
many burdens from that day.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
Flames consumed their skin.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
The girls are now
as you see before you.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
They have been born anew.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center
Like a phoenix rising
from the ashes!

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
Isn't their resilience
awe-inspiring?

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
Behold!

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
Marvel at my
New Moscow Combat Revue!

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
New Moscow Combat Revue?

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
We're pleased
to see you survived.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
That said, what might be
the purpose of this visit?

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
Can't just float over Tokyo.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
Doesn't exactly give off
a great first impression.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
A reasonable person might think
you're up to no good, pal.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
Yes, I see.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
We've come here on
an important family matter.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Family?

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center

Where do you think you--

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
Klara?

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
Stop. You're freaking
the kid out!

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
Leyla.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
Klara. Come along.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
Who are you...?

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?
You know me.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
A-A moment?

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] You see,
Klara remembers nothing.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
Nothing?

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
Yes. We think it's temporary.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
But we can't be certain.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
It matters not.
We will see to her recovery.

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
She's one of our own, after all.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
--Leyla.
--Right.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
Not so fast.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
You want to move.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Klara's with us.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
She's a member of
the Imperial Combat Revue now.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
I am not letting you take her.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] Your assertion of
Klara's allegiance is erroneous.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
Have you not paid attention?

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
This girl is not
an associate of yours.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Klara belongs to
the Moscow Combat Revue.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
None of this is to say that we
are not in your eternal debt.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
Your kindness
will be remembered.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA gasps]
Wait!

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
--Klara. Enough!
--Stop it!

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
Listen to me, Klara!

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
Release me now.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
I don't like this.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
You don't... like this?

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
Even if Klara was
a Moscow member,

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
you can't take her away
if she doesn't want to go.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
Agreed. Handing a terrified
child over to you

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.528 position:50% align:center
doesn't sit right with me.

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
Village Rule 48 applies:

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
Never abandon those
who come to you for help.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
That's right. Sakura?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
See?

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Very well.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
Then it seems we'll have
to take Klara by force.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
Force it is, then, lady!

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
Something the matter?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me
this is all you've got.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
[growls]
I'm just the warming up!

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Hmph.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.397 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO groaning]

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.278 position:50% align:center
Leyla, enough.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO huffs]

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
Stop this now.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
A revue, division
notwithstanding,

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50% align:center
is meant to protect.

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
We fight demons.
Not one another.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
I tire of posturing.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
If you're all quite
finished with this display.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.213 position:50% align:center
Klara.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
Return her to us and we will
conclude this overwrought visit.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
I think...

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
We refuse.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Amamiya...?

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
We don't follow your orders.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
Our captain instructed
the Flower Division

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
to take care of Klara.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
Until we're told
otherwise from him,

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
that's what we're going to do.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center
I respect your obedience.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
So! Just where is
this captain of yours?

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.361 position:50% align:center
He's currently on
mission in Europe.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
When will he return?

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
Not sure.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
[sighs] It appears we've
reached an impasse.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
What's the meaning of all this?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Sumire?

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
Ah. This is a treat!

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
It is an honor to
stand before you, Ma'am.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.634 position:50% align:center
The great Sumire Kanzaki.

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
The heroic woman of Tokyo.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.890 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
And what a woman indeed.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--He only gave Sakura

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
a single stemmed rose.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
Sakura isn't nearly as famous.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA coughs]

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] Your beauty thaws
even the coldest heart.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
I'd feared the Siberian
tundra froze mine.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
A token of my gratitude.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Well, in that case.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
I offer my own thanks in return.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
I can see why it took time

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
to discover Klara's whereabouts.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
Your revue has been
through a great deal.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
To say the least.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I can't
allow Klara to leave.

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Why not?

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
While I am the
revue's commander,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
the decision falls
to our captain.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
My hands are tied here.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
Klara will stay
per Kamiyama's orders.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[GROUP sighs]

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.785 position:50% align:center
Understood. I will be
formally requesting

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
Klara's return through
a sanctioned decree.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
The WLOF has already been
made aware of our resurgence.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine an official
injunction will take very long.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
We'll see each other again.
Soon, I'd wager.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
Until such time, my lady.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Ugh!

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.505 position:50% align:center
Your sister continues
to stir the pot.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
So it would seem.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
It's a temporary delay.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:39.055 position:50% align:center
Klara's place is here.
At my side and nowhere else.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.100 position:50% align:center
We'll get her back.
It's only a matter of time.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
Then our dream will be realized.
And all will be right.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Kaminski?

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Yes, Leyla?

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
Were you speaking truthfully
with their commander

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:53.737 position:50% align:center
about waiting?

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
Are you sure
that's a wise choice?

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'm in no hurry.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:02.454 position:50% align:center
Patience is not about the wait,
but the attitude, Leyla.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
Having said that...

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
An idle mind breeds weakness.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
We'd do well to stay productive.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] Well, ladies. I've
just received official word

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
from the WLOF.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
It's been confirmed that
Kaminski is indeed with

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
the Moscow Combat Review.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] If Kaminski
was telling the truth,

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center
an injunction could
force our hand here.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
We'd have no other
recourse regarding Klara.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
Rules are rules, Hatsuho.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center
We couldn't defy
a direct order from above.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
Agreed. Luckily, this also goes
for the Moscow Combat Revue.

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
Klara's stay here
was sanctioned.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
The Imperial Combat Revue
will not waiver.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
Commander...

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
Klara?

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
Klara, what's wrong?

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
They're coming!

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
No...!

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
What? Who's coming?

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
--[alarm blares]
--[gasping]

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me...

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
--[KAORU] Sumire.
--Ah.

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Confirmed sighting.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
Demons have appeared!

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Mugens at the ready.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.310 position:50% align:center
Prepare for launch.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
Sakura Amamiya.
Ready and raring to go!

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
Anastasia Palma. Ready!

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
Ready. Clarissa Snowflake!

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
Azami Mochizuki. I'm ready!

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
Hatsuho Shinonome.
Ready to kick butt!

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
Imperial Combat Revue, go!

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] The Flower
Division is launching!

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
The Flower Division
is launching!

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
Anyone in the area,
please evacuate!

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
[KAORU] A demon has landed
on a road near Tokyo Bay.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
And now it's moving
up Harumi Street to--

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
It's headed straight
for us, ma'am!

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Acting Captain Amamiya.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
We cannot let
the demon into Ginza.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
Stop it by any means necessary.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA gasps]
It's huge...!

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
Its size doesn't matter.
Stay on task.

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
There's only one of them
and five of you.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Don't worry, Sakura.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
I can attack first,
if you're too scared.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
No, Hatsuho!

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.699 position:50% align:center
We're supposed
to do this together!

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
I've been in
a bad mood all day, bud!

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
Time to take out
some aggression!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
Ah, hell!

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
It's fast!

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
Hatsuho, look out!

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO screams]

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Hatsuho!

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA] This demon isn't
just huge, it's incredibly fast!

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
Hatsuho, stand up now!

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] That last impact
broke something!

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
I can't move at all!

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO grunts]

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
Ah?! Sakura?

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:02.986 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
Sakura!

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center

We've got you!

[AZAMI grunts]

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Hatsuho, are you okay?

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
I'm good, but my Mugen...

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] Your machine is
actually fine, more or less.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.254 position:50% align:center
There is a crack in one of
the steam exhaust vents.

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
Switch to backup
power mode for now.

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Amamiya, can you hear me?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Yes!

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.846 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] The demon is resuming
its march toward Ginza.

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
It's currently at Kachidoki.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
If it makes it across
the Kachidoki bridge...

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
It's just a stone's throw away.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] Imperial Combat

Do you read me?

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
You would appear to be
in a spot of trouble.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
Please. Allow my Moscow
Combat Revue to assist.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
It is rather fortunate
that we're close to

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
your current location.

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Back off, pal!

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
If word got out that we let
another Combat Revue

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
defend Tokyo...

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
...it wouldn't do our
reputation any favors.

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center
Territories mean nothing
in times of crisis,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
my dear fiery ally.

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
Amamiya, was it?

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
What do you say, acting Captain?

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
We don't need any help.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
You tell him, Sakura!

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
Should you change your mind,

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
we will be ready to mobilize.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.732 position:50% align:center
Moscow Combat Revue standing by,
awaiting instruction.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
Everyone heard that, right?

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:27.862 position:50% align:center
Tokyo isn't theirs to protect.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
We need a fortification line.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
Let's set Kachidoki Bridge
as our final defense, ladies.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
Now come on.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50% align:center
Let's show 'em how it's done!

[FLOWER REVUE]
Roger!

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI] The demon remains
on course to Ginza.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
Toward us.

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center

come to the theater?

Hatsuho?

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Yeah, yeah. I'll take
it out for sure this time.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center

No, you won't.

[HATSUHO gasps]

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] You're lucky
it didn't kill you before.

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
It's safer and smarter
to fight as a team.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Smarter? Guess you
know what's best, Captain.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
What is your problem?

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center

Just forget I said anything.

Sakura acting captain.

He chose my best friend.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.157 position:50% align:center
Why not me?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
Why can't I stomp
down this jealousy?

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] You know. I can do
this all on my own, Sakura.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
Just sit back and watch me
kick some demon ass!

Oh, no...

[ANASTASIA]
We'll deal with her later.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
Let's use Hatsuho's tenacity
to our full advantage

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
and coordinate attacks.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center

Good idea.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Watch out!

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
My hammer!

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
No way...

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Hatsuho!

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA grunts]

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Move! Move, damn it!

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO screams]

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.513 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Mechas?

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA] This is the mighty
Imperial Combat Revue?

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
What?!

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:46.978 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Watch and remember.

00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
Witness true power and strength.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Finale.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
Whoa...

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
Oh, my...

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
Their revue is phenomenal.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO growls]

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA gasps]

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Tie those down tight!

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
My how the mighty have fallen.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Can I help you, Captain?

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
No. I Just thought I'd drop by.

00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
There's no harm in that, right?

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
Oh, and a quick word of warning.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.600 position:50% align:center
This will not be the last demon.

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
As long as Klara
stays here in Tokyo,

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
they will return.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
Care to explain
your meaning, Captain?

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
Just a hunch.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
My Combat Revue might
not be there next time.

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
It is always a pleasure
to see you, ladies.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.908 position:50% align:center
Until next we meet.

00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
They think we failed the city...

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
That we can't
protect Tokyo or Klara.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
Yes...

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
Sakura...?

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
What the hell have I done...?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
Damn it...

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:26.614 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO] Hey, Sakura,
remember how we used to always

00:23:26.698 --> 00:23:28.533 position:50% align:center
play together when we were kids?

00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:31.244 position:50% align:center
Do you remember that old cherry
tree at my family's shrine?

00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:32.412 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:34.873 position:50% align:center
Man, I'm getting
all sentimental!

00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:39.961 position:50% align:center
