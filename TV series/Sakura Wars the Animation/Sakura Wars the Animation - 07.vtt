[KAMIYAMA]
Ladies! Good to be home!

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.723 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Hi, Seijuro!

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
Great to see you--

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:17.559 position:50% align:center
Seijuro!

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Klara!

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.730 position:50% align:center
--[gasping]
--Klara...!

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
[KLARA sobbing]
Welcome home... Seijuro!

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
Klara...?

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:32.574 position:50% align:center
[KLARA sobbing softly]

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.298 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] A lot's happened.
Seems you managed without me.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
We did.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center
Our Flower Division did more
than manage, Captain.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:18.888 position:50% align:center
Hakushu Murasame also helped.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, our unknown
foe is still out there.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:25.061 position:50% align:center
They followed us to Tokyo.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.480 position:50% align:center
Commander. We have to stop them.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:31.192 position:50% align:center
I agree with you, we're doing
everything we can on our end.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:34.029 position:50% align:center
Now tell me.
The Moscow Combat Revue.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.114 position:50% align:center
Have you learned
anything yet, Captain?

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:39.617 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's nothing good.
Thought it best to come back.

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.745 position:50% align:center
I'm concerned
about headquarters.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
Speaking to you directly
felt like the only option.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
This Valery Kaminski.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.753 position:50% align:center
There isn't a record of him
being appointed captain.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.088 position:50% align:center
In fact, I can't find anything
to suggest he was even

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.716 position:50% align:center
part of the revue
before the attack.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
I searched every public record
in the WLOF archives.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.889 position:50% align:center
I suspect anything that
could've proved useful

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.350 position:50% align:center
has been destroyed.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
That's troubling.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.979 position:50% align:center
More work lies ahead of us,
Captain Kamiyama.

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
Yes. It certainly does, Ma'am.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
There is one more thing.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50% align:center
The prototype developed
by Kanzaki Heavy Industries

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center
and the Berlin Combat Revue?
It's now in Moscow.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
Unidentified parties
took the model.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
[gasps] My father told me
about this prototype.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
It's a sister version
of the Obu.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
I thought it was gone.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
Lost during
Operation Twin Capitals.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
Kamiyama, I have
a new assignment for you.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I think it's about ready.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
Sakura, since when
did you start cooking?

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:50.355 position:50% align:center
[giggles] I wanted Klara
to eat something good.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
Thought it might be just
the thing to cheer her up!

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] And with Seijuro coming
home from such a long trip,

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
I figured he could
use a taste of home.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
Ahh... Mm! So good!

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
It's the taste of Japan!
The taste of family!

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
--[chuckles]
--I'm glad you're enjoying it!

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
More, please!

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
Sure, sweetheart!
Coming right up.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center
Sakura, you're amazing.
I love our little family,

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
Huh? Family?

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
Mommy!

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
She called me "mommy."
That makes you...

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
Sakura...

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
No way! It finally happened!

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
A real life couple!

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
You and me... Together!

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.861 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Okay, let's get to work!

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
What was I thinking?

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Huh...? But I... What's this?

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
Cooking for Cap
just like you, obviously.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
Fundamental for any ninja.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
Did you know olive oil is
a staple of Greek cuisine?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
Fascinating. My country
is near Germany and France.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
I think our dishes
reflect both rather well.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
Smetana is a key
ingredient for Russians.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
Klara? Everyone's cooking?

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
Sakura, your pot's overflowing!

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Ah! Ah-- Ah...

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Wow! This looks delicious!

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
It's miso soup and nikujaga!

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
Japanese! This looks great!

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.910 position:50% align:center
A real Japanese
meal's got onigiri!

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Whoa! That's a lot of rice.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
Moussaka and taramasalata.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
Hope you like Greek.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
I can't say I've actually
had Greek before.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
Girls, this all looks
so wonderful and tasty.

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA] This is Luxembourg
cuisine, Captain!

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.720 position:50% align:center
Judd mat Gaardebounen
and steamed mussels in wine.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
I hope you enjoy it.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
Huh. Pork and steamed mussels?
That's an unusual combo.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
Good job, Claris!

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
I made something, too.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
It's beef stroganoff.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
Nice, Klara!

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
Guess we might just
have to keep you around!

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.987 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
Prepare to be amazed.
The ninja surprise pot!

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Uh...

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Uh... Surprise pot?

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
Isn't that where you
don't know what's inside?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
It's a forever secret.

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA whimpers]

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
So...

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
Which one are you
going to eat first, Cap?

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Hmm...

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
[CLARISSA]
Hmm.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Hmm.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Hmm.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:28.430 position:50% align:center
[KLARA]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Ah...

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Ladies. Thank you!

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.106 position:50% align:center
You know, since there's
so much food,

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
what if we ate it together?

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
That... That'd be great.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
We'd love to join you.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
Great idea

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Bless this food.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Bless this food!

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA]
Hmm.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.771 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Kaminski, sir.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
We've received
an encrypted message.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.275 position:50% align:center
Our WLOF insider.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
Seems this frivolous gambit of
mine has all but run its course.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.409 position:50% align:center
Well, its fine.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center
Leyla?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
Onto the next phase of my plan.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.625 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:39.918 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Who is it?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:44.839 position:50% align:center
Klara? Is something wrong?

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
This way!

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the mystery.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
Hey there.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
What's all this about?

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
Late for a get-together.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.701 position:50% align:center
But it's gotta be done.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
Kanzaki's meeting
someone at this hour?

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50% align:center
She has to.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
Tonight and tomorrow.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
Things are about
to get more complicated.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] You're leaving
again, aren't you?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
I am. I'll be going back
to Europe soon enough.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
To find out more.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
I understand...

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
Sakura. I know it
hasn't been easy for you.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
I can't thank you enough.
I appreciate all you've done.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center
And I'm really proud of you.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] It's nothing. I just
did what any captain would.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
What you'd do.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
It's more than that, Sakura.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
Just look at Klara.
At her smile.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
You've treated her like one
of our own--like family.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
I know I don't always say it
when I should, but good work.

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Seijuro.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
When I asked you
to be acting captain,

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
there was something
I promised you, wasn't there?

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
When I get back,
I'll make it up to you.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
We'll do something,
just the two of us.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
Whatever you want.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.304 position:50% align:center
You said we'd
go somewhere together.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
Just the two of us.

any other way.

pull one over on me!

You really thought you
could hide this from us?

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center

This is Hiromi.

[REIJI]
Roger.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
From the projected path of
the target, we can assume...

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
Bingo!

Yes, well.

Oh. A date?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no!
It's definitely not a date!

My mistake.
Definitely not a date indeed.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
This seems more
like a family outing?

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
Yeah, something like that.
Right, Klara?

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:30.560 position:50% align:center

[HAKUSHU] Hmm.
Should you go to Hanayashiki,

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.457 position:50% align:center
you'll have nowhere to run.

on Hanayashiki.

--Seijuro! Here!

[HATSUHO]
Ah! Seriously?!

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
They're taking
this on the water?

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.238 position:50% align:center
Aw. They got us!

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
Hurry! Go! Go! Go!

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN 7A]
You'll have to get the next one.

[HATSUHO grunts]

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Wait! We're getting
on there, too!

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN 7A]
Sorry, it's full.

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
We didn't make it...

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
No, wait! Come back!

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
Somebody's running toward us.

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
Who're they?

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
It's him.

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
Catch up!

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center

[screams]

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:00.080 position:50% align:center
Big splash.

00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
It really was.

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
Think they'll be okay?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
Over there! Look it!

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
When you think about it,

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
there really wasn't
a reason to chase them.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Just the thought of them on a
date turned us all a bit nutty.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
They just took Klara out.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
Seems we were
worried about nothing.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
[REIJI]
Ladies? What about our pursuit?!

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
We have--

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Ugh. That was a bust.

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
Anyone down for
having a little fun?

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:37.951 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI] You mean I can hang out
with the Flower Division?

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy I could die!

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:42.580 position:50% align:center
[HIROMI] I don't want to die,
but I'm up for some fun.

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
If you want something
done right, do it yourself!

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.795 position:50% align:center
Or just give it up already.
Considered that yet?

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Never!

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
The good name of the Imperial
Combat Revue is at stake here!

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.926 position:50% align:center
I have no choice but to send
in the brand spanking new

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
automated tailing mecha
that I have been--

[KANZAKI]
What do you think you're doing?

00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] Ruining Kamiyama
and Sakura's date.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
My control room
and its resources...

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.188 position:50% align:center
...are being used
to ruin a date?

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
Is that correct?

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
[REIJI stammer]
It's... Commander... Ma'am, I--

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
No!

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Kaminski, now what?

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
That's enough for now.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:26.291 position:50% align:center
It appears we missed
our opportunity.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
Haven't warmed up?

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
The water was very cold.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you're
not shaking, too.

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
That river is nothing compared
to the Siberian tundra.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
Wandering something
like that changes you.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
Kaminski...

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
I'll always take care of you.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
I know you will.

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center
The time for games has passed.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
I'll show them
how serious I can be.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Look, Klara!

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
The ocean!

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
Shh!

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
She's asleep?

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
All that running
around finally got to her.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:32.148 position:50% align:center
How cute.

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
She looks kind of happy.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she does.
I'm pretty happy myself.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
I am, too.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:41.866 position:50% align:center
I guess it was
a decent family outing.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] I wish you weren't
leaving us again so soon.

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
[KAMIYAMA] I do, too,
but I've got to figure this out.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
At least I know Klara
will be safe with you.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
She will.
Klara's very dear to me.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Seijuro.

00:20:57.674 --> 00:20:59.092 position:50% align:center
I can't tell you what
it means to know that

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.970 position:50% align:center
you trust all of us
to look after her.

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
You're something else.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop. I'm just
doing all that I can.

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center
Ah. What's this?

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
I got it for you.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:14.399 position:50% align:center
Like it?

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
That's for me?

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
Will you accept it?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
Of course I will!

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
[KANZAKI]
Hmm?

00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
Ah... What's this?

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:25.488 position:50% align:center
[REIJI] I just barely managed
to uphold the good name

00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:27.198 position:50% align:center
of the Imperial Combat Revue!

00:23:27.282 --> 00:23:29.576 position:50% align:center
Do I get a thanks?
Of course not!

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.327 position:50% align:center
Kamiyama's left
for Europe again.

00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:32.871 position:50% align:center
And now, a challenge
has been issued to

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:37.250 position:50% align:center
the Imperial Combat Revue!
We absolutely cannot lose!

00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:40.170 position:50% align:center
Next time on Sakura Wars
the Animation, Episode 8:

00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:42.881 position:50% align:center
"No End to the Chaos!
The Combat Revue Challenge!"

the Taisho cherry blossoms!
