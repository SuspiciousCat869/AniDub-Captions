Kaminski!

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
This ends now!

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Flower Division.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
I should've known my golems
wouldn't be enough to stop you.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Klara!

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
I am called Klara.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.948 position:50% align:center
I'm the angel
at Kaminski's side.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
My purpose is to right
the world and puts things

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.744 position:50% align:center
as they should be.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center

[HATSUHO]
You bastard.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
What the hell
did you do to Klara?

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
This world lets
its wounds fester.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
It suffers as a result.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] The denizens are
drenched in self-interest.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
Caring nothing for
their fellow man or milieu.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
The rich exploit
and oppress the poor.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
Conflict is a constant.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
It grows alongside
the widening gap.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
And you think your
new world's gonna be better.

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
That's why you need her?

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Precisely.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.712 position:50% align:center
Klara will help
usher in a new era.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
And the world
will be as it should.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Klara is hope.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
Natalia didn't create her
or Leyla to bring destruction.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
She wanted us all to coexist!

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.643 position:50% align:center
Their powers aren't tools
for you to use for

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.229 position:50% align:center
your own twisted
ideals, Kaminski!

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Hmph. Dear girl.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
You haven't seen
the horrors I have.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
It started like every
other unremarkable day.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
Then light tore
through the heavens.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] I awoke in a daze
and saw the essence of divinity.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
God's radiance
threatened my sight.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
Whether it was God or the devil,
that is not for me to say.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
What I will say and
always remember is this.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
It was surrounded
by chaos and ruin.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
Without a mark to show for it.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
Its power...

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
The flawlessness
and faculty bewitched me.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
With that...

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
...it also served to
remind me of my frailty.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
How I couldn't compare.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
I prepared myself for death.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
But fate beckoned me
to accept a new path.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
It was on that very same day,

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
that I was gifted
an immortal life.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
But there was more.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
From that day on, I possessed
a power so strong

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
that it could only be
described as magic.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
I needed to know
who gave me these abilities.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
And why they chose me.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
This led me on a journey
to discover the truth.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
But instead of
finding my answers,

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
I learned how wicked
the world truly was.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
How it reveled in distortion.

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
Time and time again,
mankind favored greed.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
Hatred surpassed humanity
with unsettling ease.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
How I prayed.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
I implored God to save His
creations from themselves.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
But my prayers went
unanswered every time.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Then realization
finally struck me!

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
My gifts weren't enough
to change the world,

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
or save mankind!

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
Powerful as I was,
it still paled in comparison to

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
the foolhardy
nature of humanity!

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
It required more.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
That's when my
prayers were answered.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
Ethereal...

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
I marvel at your allure, angel.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
Beautiful.,,

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA]
Huh...?

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] In all my pleadings
to God, I hadn't dreamed

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
He would lead me to not
just one angel, but two.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
I'd come to understand
that He had chosen me.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
And that my celestial beings
were not His workings

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
but that of His
troublesome mankind.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
Half-demons built by science.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.219 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA grunts]

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] I failed to
see His grand design,

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
but pushed forward.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
I devoted myself
to Natalia's research.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
And that's when I learned I
wasn't the only one who had been

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
gifted with incredible power.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
The Nadezhda carried the answer.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
They were the keys
to a new world!

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
[LEYLA yelling]

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
I can remedy humanity's ills

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
with their power and mine.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
Don't you see now?

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
I can save this
world by ruling it!

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
This is His answer!

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
All is as God wills it.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
The almighty creator
has chosen me!

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
Now He is no more.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
I am your God!

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:48.968 position:50% align:center
Liar.

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
Heh?

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
You are delusional, Kaminski!

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
What you've done to Klara isn't
helping anyone but yourself!

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
That's not something
God would do!

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
It's time to wake up, Klara!

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.607 position:50% align:center
Let's go home now!

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
Please, Klara!

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
You're wasting your breath.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
Klara won't listen to
anything you have to say.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
It's strange.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
There is something hindering
Klara's words and actions.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.496 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing it's a jerk
with a God Complex.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
Okay, Kaminski.
Release the girl!

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
I must admit that
your courage is admirable.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
Also quite misplaced.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
[ANASTASIA growls]

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] Haven't you
forgotten something important?

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
The Rage of Tunguska's target.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.646 position:50% align:center
It's taken aim
at your beloved Tokyo.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
you destroyed my
new Moscow Combat Revue.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
What do you say?

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
You ladies want to protect
your city and I could use

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
some new pawns on the board.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
End this fruitless endeavor by
throwing down your weapons

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
and Tokyo will be spared.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
Tch!

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
No?

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center
I can't think of a single reason
not to take me up on my offer.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50% align:center
But if you require
more of an incentive,

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
let's turn up
the heat, shall we?

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHO]
Stop! What are you doing?!

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI]
I'm destroying part of Tokyo

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
to prompt your decision!

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
Actions always
speak louder than words!

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50% align:center
Don't you think?

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
This is your doing,
Imperial Combat Revue!

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
Serve me or suffer!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
What is happening?

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
[HAKUSHU]
Sorry I'm late!

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
Master!

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
That took longer
than I expected.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
The Rage of Tunguska is no more.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
[KAMINSKI] Tch. You're nothing
but a deception.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
Your presence
sickens me, false god!

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
Flattery gets you nowhere.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
I don't believe the two of us
have had the pleasure.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
You are Hakushu Murasame.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
And we have met.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
Some years ago.

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
The day that changed my life.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
