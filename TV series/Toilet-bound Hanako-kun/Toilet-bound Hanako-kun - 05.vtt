Aoi was so in shock
we never really got

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
to talk about it.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.826 position:50% align:center
If they got together
because of that tree,

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
that's scary, 'cause Akane
was way into Aoi--

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
Wait! I don't have time
to analyze this!

to clean up!

What will I say when
Hanako confesses to me?

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
For real, though.

When I think of the guys
I want to date,

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
he just doesn't match up.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Why can't he be
a little bit taller?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
And he'd be even cuter
if his hat came off.

[HANAKO]
Hey.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center

He could be cool in other ways.

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
It's not always about looks.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
All right! I'll do it!

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50% align:center

Yes, it does.
I think we should slow down.

[NENE]
This is really happening!

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
The first boy
to confess his love

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
and my very first boyfriend!

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
He's not my type at all,
but it's still so exciting!

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center

this moment might feel like.

Yashiro? Why are you stalling?

When someone tells you
how they feel,

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
the proper thing to do
is reciprocate!

Why would anyone
back away from love

when it brings such happiness?

Hello there, Kodama.

This is my assistant.

Since you only
appear to couples,

I'd say it's a good thing
I have her, wouldn't you?

Uh... huh?

Is that all?

Perhaps you should learn
to mind your own business!

power from rumors

in the first place?

And why did you kiss me
on the cheek the other day?

Just for fun?

You were tired and
vulnerable to attack!

charm so that apparitions

couldn't harm you.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50% align:center
At least for a while!

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center

[NENE] He looked different
with his hat off.

It's the first time he actually
looked like a normal boy.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
And the first time
I realized something.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center
Even though I called
him my friend,

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
I never made an effort
to get to know him.

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
I didn't know any details
about the person he killed,

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
why he died so young, or how.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
I never even asked if
Hanako was his real name.

But suddenly...

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.795 position:50% align:center

And for the first time,

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center

[HANAKO]
Oh, my!

You dirty girl.

[KOU]
Quick question.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
Is there a reason you're
using me as a barrier?

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
Yashiro's being
a little aggressive.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center

your blood type,
your family structure,

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
and your date of death?

What compatibility test
factors in the day you died?

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
Five Death Languages?

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
Anyway...

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
You should do this reading on
someone you're into.

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
Like that Minamoto guy?

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
Minamoto who?

Okay, that's old.
I never really liked him.

He was just a popular hot guy.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
It's like when you see
an actor in a movie,

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
you can say you
want to date them,

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
but you never really expect to.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
I mean, think about it.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
He's the student
council president,

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
so he's smart and hot.

He's also kind and thoughtful.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
Never mind.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center

Wha--? Hot guys always
talk to me, it's fine.

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Hey, big bro!

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
He's your what?!

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center
Where have you been?

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Um... Is this real?

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
You must be Yashiro.
Can't believe we've never met.

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
Wasn't he the one you said
picked up your pencil case?

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you!

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.692 position:50% align:center
I'm Teru Minamoto.

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
Thanks for being a good
friend to my little brother.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Uh... Sure?

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
Now, then. I need to go.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
[TERU] Kou, come with me.
We need to talk.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Oh. 'Kay?

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.885 position:50% align:center
How did I not put it together?
It's the same name!

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
No clue.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
What do you think
you're doing, Kou?

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to exorcise
the Seven Wonders

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
as soon as you find them.
Right?

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
I've tolerated them
because they weren't

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
causing fatal harm to students.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
But lately...

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
I've noticed a change
in these pesky apparitions.

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
The Seven Wonders in particular
are the most powerful,

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
which also makes them
the most dangerous.

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
I think we'd be smart to cut
them off while we can.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Yeah, but...

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
It seems like Hanako hasn't been
doing the things

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
that normal jerk apparitions
usually do.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
[KOU] It still pisses me
off that he hangs around

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
in the girls' bathroom,
but he's not hurting anyone.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
He's actually helped
me and a bunch of

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
the other students out a lot.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.850 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's changed?

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
[TERU]
Don't even.

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
There is no such thing
as a good apparition, Kou.

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
I know, but he's...

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
[TERU] I let you take
the lead on this because

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
I hoped it would help you
grow as an exorcist,

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:54.032 position:50% align:center
but it looks like I was wrong.

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor and stay away
from the Seven Wonders.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of it
from here on out.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Wait!
Just give me some more time!

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
I'll let it slide.

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
But don't make
an idiot out of me.

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
Take care of your
responsibilities.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I will.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
These all suck!

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
I thought there might
be something about

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.981 position:50% align:center
Hanako's history in these books.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
But it's all a bunch
of silly ghost stories 

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
with no real facts.

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
It's weird that I can't find
anything about a boy ghost

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
called Hanako anywhere.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
Just that girl in the red skirt
that everyone talks about.

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
No mention of a
snarky boy in a hat.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
[NENE yelps]

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
Why?! I'm such a klutz!

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you very much!

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
Sorry to trouble you.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Are you interested
in the Seven Wonders?

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
She's so pretty.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
Just like a porcelain doll.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
And her legs are so slender!

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
Well, uh... Yeah.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
I guess it's kind
of obvious, isn't it?

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
Hanako, huh? Yeah.

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
That cat-like kid.

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Meow.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.622 position:50% align:center
Meow, meow.

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
Cat-like how?

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.003 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Meaning he's
strong-willed, selfish,

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
and needy.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
Is that how you'd describe him?

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Is she talking about
the same Hanako that I know?

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
Strong-willed,
selfish, and needy?

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
He's never acted
needy around me.

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
Omigosh, this reminds
me of something!

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL A]
I don't believe it.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.147 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
How could you not know?

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
[NENE] It's like when
the mysterious woman

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
confronts the couple!

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 5A]
How strange.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
He always acts like
a spoiled child around me.

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
They call her the roadblock!

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
Happens in every manga.

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Does that mean she's...

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center
No, that's impossible!

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
Is she Hanako's girlfriend?

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
Such purretty slim legs.

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
You have to stop being so needy.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
If you want to know
more about him,

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:14.172 position:50% align:center
you should visit the fifth
of the Seven Wonders.

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
Hey! Wait!

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
I think I bent my nose.

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI] What the heck
do you think you're doing?

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
Don't you know there's
no running in the library?

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I'm sorry, sir!

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
She's gone.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
The fifth of the Seven Wonders?

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know it!

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
You do?

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
She said I had to visit it.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center
Well, according to the rumors,

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
it's called the
Four O'clock Library.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] There's a special
repository in the school

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
library.
It can only be entered at 4 PM.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.931 position:50% align:center
The books stored inside
are all titled

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
with people's names.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
They contain the records
of that person

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:12.605 position:50% align:center
during their time
at this academy.

00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:14.774 position:50% align:center
What makes these books unique

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
is that they contain both
past and future records.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
What they've done and
what they're going to do.

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.453 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
There're books on everyone?

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
And they even say what
will happen in the future!

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
That's so weird!

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
I mean, like, doesn't it
make you want to read

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
about people we know?

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
What if you could
read Minamoto's?

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] If you want to
know more about him,

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
you should visit the fifth
of the Seven Wonders.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
When she said that,

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
was she trying to tell me
I should look for Hanako's

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
book in that library?

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
Although, if you decide to go
to the Four O'clock Library,

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:54.147 position:50% align:center
there's something else
you need to know.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.982 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Oh, no. Tell me.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
Inside are three types of books.

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
Some are white, some red,
and some black.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
The white books are records
of people who are still alive.

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.618 position:50% align:center
And the black books
are about people

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:08.495 position:50% align:center
who have already passed.

00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:10.205 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Then what are the red ones?

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.669 position:50% align:center
[AOI] All I know about the red
books is they're the ones

00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:17.504 position:50% align:center
you're never supposed to open.

00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:29.015 position:50% align:center
Looks like we won't
need to interfere.

00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:31.935 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO chuckles]
