00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hello, everybody!

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.978 position:50% align:center
It's me, your beloved
heroine, Nene Yashiro!

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.230 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
What are you doing?

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:47.732 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
When our friends went missing,

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.359 position:50% align:center
there was only one thing to do:

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
boldly take on the second
of the Seven Wonders.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.780 position:50% align:center
AKA, the Misaki Stairs.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
[KOU] She tried to scare us
with a bunch of dolls!

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.617 position:50% align:center
[NENE] We knew if we wanted
to take this beast down

00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.786 position:50% align:center
that we needed to find
its greatest weakness,

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.079 position:50% align:center
the Yorishiro.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:03.289 position:50% align:center
We braved every challenge
and overcame obstacles

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.250 position:50% align:center
with grace and serenity.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.419 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
You're so graceful and serene!

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.087 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Is that how you remember it?

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.924 position:50% align:center
[NENE] With determination,
we finally reached the top

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50% align:center
of the tallest staircase.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.235 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Let's go.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.029 position:50% align:center
Look everywhere you can
until we find it!

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.323 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Omigosh!
Is that a floating head?!

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.798 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I can't see
the ground from here.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Look! Over there!

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.052 position:50% align:center
In the chair!

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
[NENE gasps]

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.637 position:50% align:center
What the heck is that?!

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.939 position:50% align:center
Looks like all the parts we've
been collecting reassembled.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
Creepy!

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Yep.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
Uh, is there a reason you
put such a weird leg on it?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
You told us to grab
whatever we could find!

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
You didn't say they
had to match!

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
At least we picked nice legs
and the perfect

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
bust size for this person.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize you had
such a strong opinion

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
about size.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I hear footsteps!

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
Something's coming toward us!

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
Finally.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.223 position:50% align:center
[NENE] That's the voice
from the phone calls!

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
Nice to see you.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
[NENE] She's so pretty.
I didn't expect that.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
Is she Misaki?

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
But how? Wasn't she
missing her entire body?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
[KOU, NENE gasp]

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I can explain!

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
See, we were trying to, um...

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I know how this looks,
but I promise we tried.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.843 position:50% align:center
[NENE, KOU gasp]

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
Well...

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
It's a wonderful body!

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Yeah?

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
So does that mean you like it?

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
This is quite a relief.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
I was in a terrible bind,
as you know.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
I had no idea what a human
body was supposed

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
to look like even though I've
seen them before.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
But something inside me knew
asking another human

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
was the right thing to do!

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Oh, cool...

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] This one is nothing
like any of the other

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
bodies I've seen so far.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm
certain it will work.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Work how?

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Don't you think so, my Misaki?

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
Now, won't you please
get up and walk for me?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
What a shame.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
Another failure.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.412 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Um, excuse me?

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
I hope this isn't a bad time,

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
but I've been meaning
to ask you,

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.627 position:50% align:center
have you seen other kids
here dressed like me?

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
Others?

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean the
ones who failed, yes.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
There are many.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50% align:center
All you have to do
is look around you.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Later, Nene!
Get better! Call me!

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
It's Aoi!

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
Yashiro!

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
Wake up, Aoi, please!

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
Can you hear me?

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
It's been nothing but
failure after failure.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
I think I've had enough.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
I suppose it's
business as usual.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
Time to cut you
into tiny pieces.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
I've got this, Nene, stay back!

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
Hey! What the hell's going on?!

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
Looks like that thing is what
turns humans into dolls

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
when they've been cut.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.357 position:50% align:center
Get her away!
Change it back!

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know! Can you do that
thing where you conjure

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
the wind and blow stuff away?

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
Like with the cape and the dust?

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
I cannot.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
Why?!

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Because we're in
Number Two's territory.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50% align:center
To use Haku-joudai's power,
I'd need to ask her permission.

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
That could change if we
broke her Yorishiro.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
But at the moment,
there's no sign of it anywhere.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
So, now what?

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
I think I'll start with you.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
Keep up the good work!
You're doing great!

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
[NENE crying]

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
Come on, stand up.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
Don't quit now.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
She's still alive, you know.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
This world exists on the border
between life and death.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
Nothing is born here,
but nothing dies here, either.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
Just keep fighting for
as long as it takes.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
Refuse to let her beat you,
and you'll win.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
Okay! I'll do anything
to get her back!

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that?

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What the--?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Tight knot, check.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
Strong rope, check.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.362 position:50% align:center
Looks like we're ready to go!

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
[NENE yells]

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Clearly the Yorishiro
isn't up here,

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
which means this is
not the deepest part.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:19.290 position:50% align:center
So, I was thinking... If we've
already explored the very top,

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.751 position:50% align:center
that means our next
destination is the bottom.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
Please don't make me
go without you.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO laughs]

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
I know you won't let me down!

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
[NENE yells]

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Bye!

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
The heck was that?

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but... wait,
what did you do to Nene?

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Don't worry about her.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
I did a thorough inspection
before she left,

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
so she'll be fine. I think.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
You think?

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
No need to fight, boys.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
There's plenty of me
to go around.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to shred both
of you at the same time.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
Get ready, now, and try to stall

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
until Yashiro completes
you-know-what.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
Copy that.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center
Stay back!

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
If you don't, I'm gonna...
do something bad to you!

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
--[MOKKE A] She's dead.
--[MOKKE B] How do you know?

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Poke. Poke, poke.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
You there?

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Am I... in the afterlife?

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
She's still alive.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE B]
See. Told you.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
Last thing I remember
is Hanako pushing me over

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
some kind of wall.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Oh, that's right.

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
It's all coming back now.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Wow.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
It looks completely different
from where I was earlier.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
Is this it?
Is this the deepest part?

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
That Yorishiro better
be easy to find!

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
Why does it hurt so bad?

I don't have time for that!

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] Misaki didn't come
to see me today.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
I didn't have any
lessons to study.

the road and making dolls.

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] I heard a rumor about
something scary today.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
Apparently,
there was an accident 

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
on these stairs recently.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
They say a teacher
fell off and died.

[YAKO] I don't understand
what "died" means.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
I'll ask Misaki when

So. What happened next?

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] I'm worried Misaki
may never come here

I decided that...

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.254 position:50% align:center

It was.

No, it's Misaki's body
that I want to collect.

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
I figured using his name
would eliminate explanations.

You're torturing people

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center

I suppose.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
You ready?

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Yashiro.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
Wakey wakey.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
Is that you, Hanako?

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
Sure is!

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness, we made it back.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
But where's Kou?

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Right here.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
Kou, is that you?!

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
A true, valiant hero who
fought until the very end.

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
He makes a really cute plushie.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
He'll be turned back
to normal, right?

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
Aoi and the others, too?

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
Yes, I fully intend to
have it taken care of.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:29.544 position:50% align:center
By her.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Who's that?

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
The real Misaki Stairs.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
A fox?

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] She's an Inari
statue that moves.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
Come on, Number Two. Apologize.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
Hmph!

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
You know, fox meat
makes delicious soup!

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
Stop! Put the knife down!

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.855 position:50% align:center
What's gonna happen
to everyone who was turned

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
into dolls?

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] I guess they'll all
turn back to their old

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
boring form come morning.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
I don't have much power left.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
They probably won't
even remember me.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
Oh, good!

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hey, little fox.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Here.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
Hey! I'm still mad at you!

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
And you're not forgiven!

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:14.756 position:50% align:center
So don't get confused!

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
You scared the heck out
of me down there!

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
I really thought
I was gonna die!

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
But even though I had
a very good reason,

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
I know that I broke
something that was important

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
to you.

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for that. Okay?

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
Do not caress my ear!

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
You and I will never be friends!

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
By the way...

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
I have a name, and it's Yako.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
If you ever call me
"Little Fox" again,

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
I'll bite your hand
off and eat it!

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
Maybe fox soup wasn't
such a bad idea after all.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
Nah. Gross.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
What a jerk.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
Watch out!

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
Hey, wall.

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize how exhausted
I was until just now.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Good. Stay right there.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:16.234 position:50% align:center
Reward for your hard work.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
It's a charm to make
you feel better.

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What?!

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:35.420 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
Hey. You just like to keep
us waiting, don't you?

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
[door opens, closes]

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
Hello? You there? Look, it ca--

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] You can't yell
across a room like that.

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:52.354 position:50% align:center
The teachers will find us.

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:53.855 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
'Kay.

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Welcome back, Koku-joudai.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.322 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:05.575 position:50% align:center
I'd say it went very well, then.

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.369 position:50% align:center
I couldn't be happier.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:15.210 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What the--?

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:16.711 position:50% align:center
Did they forget about me?
