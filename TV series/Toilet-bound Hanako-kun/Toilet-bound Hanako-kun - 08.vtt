[KOU] Look who scored
the opening shot!

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
That lame-ass earring you're
wearing is full of lies.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.358 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Remember that time
I heard a rumor

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
about a ghost at
the school entrance

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.779 position:50% align:center
and then snatched
him up like a boss?

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.155 position:50% align:center
I've been trying this
thing where I don't

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.533 position:50% align:center
exorcise ghosts
unless they're askin' for it.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.201 position:50% align:center
Instead, I decided
to help this little guy

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.745 position:50% align:center
free himself from regrets
that were holding him back!

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.997 position:50% align:center
I know what you're
really after, sicko!

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
You see a cute, gentle ghost
and all you can think about

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.501 position:50% align:center
is pulling us
to the dark side!

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:07.502 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Don't start.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.170 position:50% align:center
Your mind is littered with porn!

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.755 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What? Seriously?

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.757 position:50% align:center
I just don't want to be
in your porn, okay?!

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.391 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
So, you gonna be all right?

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.727 position:50% align:center
And what do you care?

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.438 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Crap, I can't be weak
around evil spirits!

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.523 position:50% align:center
My name is Kou Minamoto!

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.609 position:50% align:center
I am a descendant of
an ancient exorcist clan!

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
Exorcists?

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.031 position:50% align:center
Wow, you've watched
way too much anime.

Shut up!

[MITSUBA]
Ooh, I'm so scared!

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50% align:center
You've got five seconds
to tell me your name

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
and start listing your regrets.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
After that, I'm evaporating you.

[KOU]
What grade?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
I'll try again.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
What grade did you die in?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
Tell me what you regret.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.608 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Ah...!

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.568 position:50% align:center
Okay, just kidding!
It's photography, all right?

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
I regret photography!

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What's that mean?

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
A photograph.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
You just started demanding
answers to heavy questions

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50% align:center
out of nowhere!

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
I got flustered.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
But yeah, there was a photo
I wish I had taken

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
before I died.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
I regret that.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
So, I guess if you want
to help me do something

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
I never got a chance to do,
then go get my camera.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
It was donated to
the photography club.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center

All right, I'm on it!

Did you get it?

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.643 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba! Hello?

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Hmm?

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Let's wrap this
session up, all right?

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Excuse me?

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
Are you really trying to
rush me to take the photo

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
I didn't get to take
before I died?

great exorcist throne

not as merciful
as he claims to be?

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he really is
just a lying predator

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
using empty promises
and his lame-ass earring

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
[KOU] All you've been doing
is taking pictures

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center

bugs and animals.

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
What about friends?

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
Or clubs you used
to be involved with?

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Oh.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it is easier to
win awards for photos

of people and stuff
like that, but it's fine.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center

Gimme back my camera!

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
You just want me to
take dirty pictures of you

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
and I'm not interested!

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center

insisting I'm gross?

Hey, Kou!
I thought that was you!

something random, I swear.

Hold on, that camera
looks familiar.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
Didn't that used
to belong to Mitsuba?

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
You knew him?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
[YOKOO] I think he passed
sometime this winter.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center

of weird accident.

Really?

He was in our first-year class.

You don't remember?

What? Shut up, no he wasn't!

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
[YOKOO]
Uh, okay.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.539 position:50% align:center
Well, he moved
to a different class,

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
so you may have
forgotten about him.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center

Yeah, I guess I must've.

So um...

[KOU]
Do you know why?

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
Because of somebody's stupid
opinion that I was too "girly"

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
or "stuck up."

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center

Right. Sorry!

to start junior high off
on the right foot.

I was very careful to always
be friendly so no one could say

I was rude to them.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center

Look what came of it.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center

may or may not notice.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
Sounds like that was
your plan, though.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
There was nothing wrong
with who you were.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to change.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
You obviously have issues,
man, but it's not your fault.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
I don't hate you or anything.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Too late for all that now.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.018 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Yeah, guess so.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.742 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Can I ask you something?

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
Um, if I were still alive,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
do you think that we
would've been friends?

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
Just because you're dead

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean we
can't be friends.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Come on guys, I said quit it!

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone!

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
[YOKOO]
Don't let him go until he does!

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
Seriously, dude?
What are you shooting?

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
The skyline?

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
Just something that's becoming
important to me lately, ya know?

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Uh... 'Kay?

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
It's nothing! Let's go.

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.161 position:50% align:center
Wait...

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
Stay with me till
it develops tomorrow.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.375 position:50% align:center
If you do...

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
I'm sure things'll work out.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
Okay... Sure.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I'll see
you tomorrow, then?

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
Yeah, see ya then.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Hi, Mitsuba!

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
We can't have you running
off on your own, now.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Hanako?

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
No, that's not him.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
Who is this guy?

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.406 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] You up and left
without even telling me where

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
you were going.

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
That's not nice.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
No...

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you doing?!

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mitsuba. You asked me to
grant you a wish, right?

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.017 position:50% align:center
You wanted everyone
to remember you.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
You're satisfied with just one?

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
That doesn't sound right.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
Does it?

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba?

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.861 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.613 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute. Hold it
right there, evil spirit.

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
You mind telling me who the
hell you're supposed to be?

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
Get your hands off him.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
I'm not kidding, punk!

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
Leave my friend alone
or you'll regret it!

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
[KOU grunts]

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
I'm an apparition.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
I grant wishes for
those who ask,

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
and I choose one thing
to take as payment.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
It's similar to the
way Amane works.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.727 position:50% align:center
Although, he grants wishes for
the living in this life,

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
and I grant them for those
who have passed on

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
to the next.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
Like this guy.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
He made a wish,
and it's my job to grant it.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
But I get to choose how!

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
A radio?

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
What the heck's he
gonna do with that?

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
The time has come, Mitsuba.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna make your
wish come true!

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
Hey Sakura,
everything's ready to go!

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
All right.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.968 position:50% align:center
Who's heard of the Broken
Neck Boy of the entrance?

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA gasps]

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] As you approach the
junior high entrance,

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
you might be greeted by
a ghost with a broken neck.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
He's suffering from
crippling loneliness.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
Some have felt his grip
as he reached for them

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
or heard a voice say, "Hey."

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA whimpers]

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
"Do you remember me?

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
Or have you forgotten?"

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba!

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] The key is to answer
by saying his name.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
And if you can't,

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
he'll break your neck
and make you lonely

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
just like him.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
[F STUDENT A]
Wow! That's so creepy!

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.641 position:50% align:center
[M STUDENT B] I heard from
a friend of a friend

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
that it was some kind of
strange accident in winter.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
If you don't know his name,

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.772 position:50% align:center
he'll make it happen
to you, too.

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
[F STUDENT B] Yeah, I heard
he'll break your neck

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
if you can't remember his name.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
[F STUDENT A]
That's so scary.

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:58.945 position:50% align:center
What if we don't know it?

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA screaming]

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
What's happening?
Where's Mitsuba?

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Kou's my friend.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
What's the matter, Haku-joudai?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
There!

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
Now you're a legend and
your name will be passed on

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
for generations, and you'll
never be forgotten.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
What do you think, Mitsuba?

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50% align:center
Isn't that exciting?

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
The Seven Wonders
say their purpose

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
is to maintain proper
relations between humans

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
and apparitions, but I don't
see a need for that.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:05.595 position:50% align:center
Why should we be forced
to behave unnaturally?

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
If living our truth is what
would destroy the world,

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:11.601 position:50% align:center
then maybe it's
better off broken.

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.020 position:50% align:center
Why should we try to
be something we're not?

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Why him? I don't get it.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba's wish
was kinda vague,

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
so there were a lot
of gaps to fill in.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
He didn't really know
what he wanted

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
to stay here to do.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
He just didn't want it
to end so suddenly.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
He said he wanted
everyone to remember him.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center
With a wish that vague,
I could only complete it

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
halfway without fully
understanding it.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
But things are different now.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
And it's all thanks to you.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
What did I do?

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Well...

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
You were able to draw out
Mitsuba's actual wish

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
for me so I could complete it.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
When an apparition
makes a specific wish,

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
it stems from deep regret.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:53.226 position:50% align:center
And, as we know,
the strength of the regret

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.770 position:50% align:center
determines the strength
of that apparition.

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
He doesn't just want
to be remembered.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
He wanted to have friends.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
And he wanted to be
with those friends.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
Forever and ever.

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
Eternally.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What?

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
What does that have
to do with anything?

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
Quit wasting my time
with this crap

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
and turn Mitsuba back to normal!

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
And besides, his regret
was about a photo

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
he wanted to take!

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Hmm.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
Thing is, the more people
that allow you to live

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
in their memories,
the longer it'll feel as though

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
you never left this world.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
Oh! And another thing.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
If you can find a way to
make that boy like you,

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
that means you'll have
a friend with you forever!

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Huh?

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.025 position:50% align:center
No matter what or
who you have to hurt

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
to get what you want,
I'll forgive you for everything.

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
The price you'll pay for
your wish is "reason."

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
There's no need
to justify your actions.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
It's time for you
to begin the struggle,

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
and I know that you
have what it takes

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
to defy the world's design.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
Awaken.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba, don't!

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center

Cut it out! Seriously!

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center

[KOU grunting]

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba, stop this!

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
If you can hear me in there,

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
this is not the way
you treat your friends!

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
And it's all thanks to you.

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
What's his deal?

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's not what I thought.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
Please... say... something.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
[KOU gasps]

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
[KOU coughing]

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center
Hanako!

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA laughs]

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi there, Amane!

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
How many years has it been?

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
Ten? Or 20, or never mind!

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
We just saw each other
on the roof the other day!

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Why would you do this? Tsukasa?

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Mmm...

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
I guess I like the way
people look when they stop

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
holding everything in.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
What a great time
we had back then.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
I smile when I think of
that night you killed me.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Now that's a good look for you.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
You know I love you,
don't you, Amane?

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's play together,
like we used to.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
Please?

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Mitsuba, wake up! Mitsuba!

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Oh, my.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
So glad to see you.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
You can reverse this crap
and turn him back

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
to normal, can't you?

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
You know, like with
the Misaki Stairs and Aoi

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
and like when I had
that doll arm?

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
[KOU crying]

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
Get up, Mitsuba!

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
This is... It isn't you!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
This isn't my buddy.

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba is...

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
He's a stuck-up, pretentious,
super girly, selfish,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
moody AF punk and he
would never stay this quiet

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
for so long!

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
And, he, uh...

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
He's a camera nerd.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
He can be so dramatic.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
He's fake when he's picked on.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
And...

00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:57.220 position:50% align:center
And he's my friend!

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
My annoying friend
with the biggest heart!

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba!

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
It's pointless.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
What? But why?

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
Don't you know?

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
Because that's
the way death works.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
Wandering the world of the
living unnoticed as a spirit.

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
That isn't a
continuation of life.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
When you die, that's it.

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
There's nothing more.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
Nothing new begins.

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
No matter how much
you regret or wish,

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:32.672 position:50% align:center
if you couldn't do
something in life,

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
you can't suddenly
do it when you die.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:38.803 position:50% align:center
That's just how it works.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
No way to defy it.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
Try and you end up like this.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
I thought that you might
be able to sever his regrets

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
and relieve him of his
attachment to the living world,

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:50.523 position:50% align:center
but it looks like it backfired.

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:53.902 position:50% align:center
A lesson for you.

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
Don't work so hard for the dead.

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
It's wasted energy, you see.

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
We no longer have
futures to fight for.

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
There's more.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
There has to be something more.

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center
Something I could have
or should have done.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
I wish I was more like Teru.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
He never would've
let this happen!

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
You can't blame yourself.

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
For the dead,
it seems like annihilation

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
is the only possible salvation.

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
This was for the best.

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.072 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
It was not!

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Nothing about this
is for the best!

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center
How can you say
disappearing suddenly

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
from those who care about you
is a salvation for anyone?

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
I will never forgive him
for what he did!

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
Mitsuba didn't deserve this!

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
I see.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.519 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Hanako was probably
right about some things.

00:21:51.603 --> 00:21:53.563 position:50% align:center
Like the world having a system.

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
Stuff being in place
that's beyond our control.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
He said there's nothing
I can do to change it.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
I get where he's coming from.

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
But maybe it doesn't stop there.

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
Maybe there's a reason
I was given the power

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
to see and interfere with
unearthly apparitions.

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:10.205 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm supposed
to turn that "nothing"

00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
we can do into
"something" we can do.

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:16.211 position:50% align:center
It makes sense to me.

00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:18.129 position:50% align:center
Now this... I don't get.

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:23.385 position:50% align:center
What the...

00:22:23.468 --> 00:22:24.469 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.225 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Seriously, dude?
What are you shooting?

00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:34.396 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Uh...

00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:37.315 position:50% align:center
Just something that's becoming
important to me lately,

00:22:37.399 --> 00:22:38.483 position:50% align:center
ya know?

00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:39.651 position:50% align:center
[KOU crying]

00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:45.115 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Mitsuba.
