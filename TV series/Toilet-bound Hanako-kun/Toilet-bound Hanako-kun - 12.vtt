00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.364 position:50% align:center
[NENE] It's been three days
since we were shoved

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.408 position:50% align:center
out of the Hell of Mirrors.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.034 position:50% align:center
Strange knowing there's
a different world

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.245 position:50% align:center
on the other side
of our reflections.

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:05.417 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful that we
made it back safely.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.002 position:50% align:center
But I still think of Mitsuba,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.422 position:50% align:center
the cute ghost boy I met there,
and wonder how he is.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.549 position:50% align:center
I don't know why he was
so snobbish and awkward

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:16.052 position:50% align:center
at first, because later
he tried to protect me.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.762 position:50% align:center
At least I got to know
who he was before

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.850 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa convinced him to become
Wonder Number Three. Right?

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
Also wondering if it
was safe to leave

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.358 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa there with him.

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Kou must be
worried about that, too.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.323 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize how
close they had become.

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
Kou told me about
everything after

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.910 position:50% align:center
we got back from
the Hell of Mirrors.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
So, yeah. I know he's a ghost.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.416 position:50% align:center
But he's still my friend.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50% align:center
I thought it sucked the first
time he disappeared

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50% align:center
on me like that.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
I hated that I
couldn't save him.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd
get to see him again.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
And then... I did.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Who the hell are you?

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Man, I know how it sounds.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50% align:center
This is hard to explain.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
Whatever. It's fine that he
decided to stay with that

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.816 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa creep for now.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.194 position:50% align:center
Kou, wait a sec.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
No, really. It's okay.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
I'll find a way
to see him again.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.327 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
He may have been smiling,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
but I heard him talk
about Mitsuba earlier

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
and I could tell.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
He was worried.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.507 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
What a pleasant surprise.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.176 position:50% align:center
I found you, Princess.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A]
As we discussed last class,

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
Cominform was
established to coordinate

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
the efforts of Europe's
communist parties...

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
It's not that bad, is it?

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
[NENE yells]

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.074 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Keep it down!

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.118 position:50% align:center
You're disrupting
essential learning!

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
in here, Hanako?

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
I had a sudden urge to see you.
Is that bad?

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
I don't believe you. What's up?

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.002 position:50% align:center
So you're accusing me
of lying to you?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
Fine. Just don't do anything
that's going to get me

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
kicked out of class.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
I won't.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Oh, great.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
Nene's talking to herself again.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
So?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Don't! I just
braided that this morning.

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
What were you thinking about?

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Hm?

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I was thinking about
Kou and worried

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
that he might be upset.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Hmm... About what?

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Seriously?

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
He was really good
friends with Mitsuba.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
I'm sure being
forgotten like that hurt

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
and probably made
him feel lonely.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
--[HANAKO] Really?
--[NENE] Yes, really!

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
I was trying to think of ways
we could cheer him up.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
Do you have any ideas?

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] He's the only one
you're worried about?

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Um, Hanako?

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Did you worry about
me when you got sucked

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.608 position:50% align:center
into the mirror?

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
I was lonely too, ya know.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.904 position:50% align:center
Well? And you?

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
Were you lonely at all?

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What? I don't know!

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
Now is not the time
or the place!

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
Do you have to be so close?

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for
worrying about you.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
Why would you be worried?

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I think he might
actually be telling the truth.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
All done!

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.194 position:50% align:center
[NENE yells]

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] I love it!
The epitome of daikon beauty!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
[NENE yelling]

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A] Miss Yashiro,
would you mind saving

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
dress-up time for after class?

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Sorry.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Oh, my gosh.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
Have you seen a big
clock on campus?

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
Apparently it's haunted.

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
Guess it's true.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
Different species will never
understand each other.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you something?

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.393 position:50% align:center
Are you secretly in love
with someone?

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
See, well...

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.354 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Seashell?

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hanako.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
You're always sticking your
nose in my business

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
and teasing me about everything.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
But you won't tell me
anything about yourself.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
Even so, there are
times I see what

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
you don't say,
and I can't leave you.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
I just wish I could
understand why.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
Maybe it would be better
if I were a ghost too.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
What was that?

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
Did someone say they
would like to become a ghost?

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.385 position:50% align:center
Well, what a coincidence!

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
We cannot wait to
grant you your wish!

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
Who's there?
Is someone trying to talk to me?

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Poor Nene!

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Hey! Down here!

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
You're looking the wrong way!

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
It is my pleasure to make
your acquaintance,

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
Your Highness.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]
Un-hun!

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
What the fish?!

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.034 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
What's with you?

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Nene, wait!

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Let me tell you something.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
I'm the assistant to the boss
of the Seven Wonders!

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center
I'm also very good friends
with one of the

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
most powerful exorcists!

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
Are you picking up
what I'm putting down?

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
If I were you,
I wouldn't mess with me!

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
I'm warning you,
I've got hooks and spears!

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Forgive me, but...

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
...that sounds
like a tank of poo.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]
Un-hun!

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I'm being serious!

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.774 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH groans]

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
I do not wish to lure you
from your safe space,

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
Your Highness, but please
listen to what I have to say.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
We are here as scaled heroes

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
who wish to help you
escape the clutches

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
of that dreadful
School Wonder of the loo!

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]
Un-hun!

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Wait, you mean Hanako?

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
Why would I need to
"escape" from him?

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Perhaps you have forgotten?

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
You are not meant to serve
or assist anyone,

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
for you have a portion
of the Mermaid's body

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
within you!

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
I do?
You mean that scale I ate?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
The very one.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
That's right.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.475 position:50% align:center
And it's because
I swallowed the scale

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
that Hanako and I are bound.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] You see,
our law commands that the one

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
who consumes the flesh
and blood of our mistress

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
shall become our next ruler.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say is,
you are our princess!

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.366 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] I must say,
I'm tickled to find out

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
you're a looker!

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]
Un-hun!

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] Typically this
does not interest humans

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
as they lack taste
and standards.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
But, if you came to our world,

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
your status as a princess
along with your extraordinary

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
beauty would mean you could hook
any beau who struck your fancy!

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Any guy?
Go back and talk slow.

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
[branch cracks]

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
[NENE yells]

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] Besides,
I have this feeling in my gills

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:21.061 position:50% align:center
that this will be much
better for you as well.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What do you mean?

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] I mean that I
have observed Your Highness

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
for quite some time,

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
and the way that
School Wonder treats you

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
is a shocking affront
to your dignity.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]
Un-hun!

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] Look at how
he attacked you when you

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
gave him a gift.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
No appreciation whatsoever!

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That was weird.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] When was the
last time he shared anything

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
about himself?

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
All he does is use your
kind heart as he sees fit.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
Trust me.
I know an urchin when I see one,

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
and that is one
toxic toilet urchin!

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:54.010 position:50% align:center
He's really not that bad.

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] Now, I know
she may not appear as such,

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
but our mistress is quite kind.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
And unlike that toilet urchin,

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
we love and respect you,
Your Highness.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
Please, Princess, take this.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
Inside this vile is the
mermaid's lifeblood.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
Drink it at once and
free yourself of "toxins." 

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Her blood?

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] It will
overwrite your unfortunate bond

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
to that Toilet Bowl
Wonder and formally

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
establish your bond
with the most beautiful

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
and gracious mermaid!

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
So if I drink this,

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
then I wouldn't be in debt
to Hanako anymore?

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Precisely.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
Not only that, but your
body will no longer

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
inconveniently change
when you come

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.841 position:50% align:center
into contact with water.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Really?

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Your most unfortunate Highness,

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
I assure you that
in coming with us,

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
your life will be filled
with much happiness.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]
Un-hun!

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Sleep on it.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
We will return for you tomorrow.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
But we will require
an answer at that time.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.234 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to do.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
Haku-joudai, What's the matter?

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
So the mermaid's
at it again, you say?

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50% align:center
She's trying to take away
my cleaning assistant.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
Such nerve.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
[AOI] And you have to cut
ties with him completely?

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Yeah.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling
that's why you were

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
being so weird.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
You fell in love, didn't you?

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
What?! No!
At least, I don't think so.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
What would you do
if you were me?

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:40.617 position:50% align:center
And the other person
wasn't even that into you?

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Hmm...

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[AKANE] I'd stay strong
and never give up!

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
Listen. I would rather
cut off my own head

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
than to ever cut ties with Aoi.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Wow, Akane,
that's pretty hardcore!

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
I love Aoi more
than my own head!

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
[AOI giggles]

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
Five points.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
[NENE] He said he'd chop
his head off for you!

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
[AKANE]
Five points? Huh.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
That's more than last time!

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
You realize that's five
out of 100, don't you?

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
Just let me have this!

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
He's genuinely happy about it?

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
I mean, you might as well do it.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Really?

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.240 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] We're discussing
Number Seven, right?

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
He's an inconsiderate,
inappropriate,

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
obstinate and filthy brat.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.371 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Oh. I wouldn't go that far.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] Humans and apparitions
really shouldn't be mingling.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
I'm sure some part of
you realizes that by now.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] Of course, none of
this applies to a good man

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
like Misaki!

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
A mermaid, huh?

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
Well, watch out for hooks.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Seriously? That's it?

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
I came here so you
would stop me!

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI] "Princess wanted,
no experience necessary,

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
no academic requirements."

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you qualify, right?

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
Can't you see I'm
in real trouble here?!

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Yes, I am painfully aware!

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:02.866 position:50% align:center
What do Number Seven
'n Friends think?

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I haven't asked them.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
Kou's been upset so I don't
want to bother him.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
I never know how Hanako
will respond to anything.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
It stresses me out.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
By the way, sir?

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
You've known Hanako
for a long time,

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
haven't you?

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Can you please tell me
what happened to him

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
in his past?

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
Do you know who Tsukasa is?

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
You know, these are good
questions for him.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
If you've asked before
and he hasn't given you

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
an answer, it's because
he doesn't want you

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
to have that information.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
At least, not right now
for some reason.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I just wish I
could understand why.

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
Does he not trust me?
What does he think I would do?

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI laughs]

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
It might be inconvenient for him
if you were to learn the truth.

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
I mean, why would he want
to risk losing someone

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
who's so willing
to drop everything

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
and make him donuts?

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
It could be simpler.

00:13:57.921 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's afraid
of you finding out.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
Either way, I think you
should decide for yourself.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
Just make sure
you don't regret it.

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
Well, you heard it here first.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you need
to make up your mind.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
What are you gonna do?

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] The new day
has arrived, Your Highness!

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
We're here to
receive your answer!

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]
Un-hun!

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
You can have it back!

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I'm just
not ready to cut ties

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
with Hanako!

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH gasps]
Pardon me?

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I have no doubt that
you would treat me well,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
I just wouldn't feel
right walking away

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
so abruptly.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
Maybe what you said is true,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
and Hanako really
is just using me.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
Maybe he really doesn't
care about me at all.

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
I guess...

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
I'd rather place my trust
in that voice saying

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
"maybe not." 

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Wait. Your Highness!

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
Won't you please reconsider?

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know!
Hurry and show her the pictures!

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
[LITTLE FISH]
Yes, sir! Right away!

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:21.087 position:50% align:center
What? Pictures?

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Why, yes!

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
I thought perhaps
Your Highness would like

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.759 position:50% align:center
to take a look at the
esteemed single gentlemen

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.553 position:50% align:center
who cannot wait
to love and adore you!

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna show me
pictures of mermen?

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
'Cause no.
I'm not really that into it.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Behold! These handsome fish!

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
[NENE] What?
Why would you show me fish?

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] Because a fish
as beautiful as Your Highness

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
deserves to have any man
she so desires,

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
of course!

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
But I'm not a fi-- 

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Wow! Such elegance!

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
And what a powerful
tail fin you have!

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]
Un-hun!

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Such reserved pectoral fins.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
[UN'UN]

[PORCUPINEFISH] And those eyes,
so large and bright.

Wait just a darn minute!

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
When you said I was beautiful,
you meant as a fish?!

[FISH]
Cast aside your hideous legs!

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
Come away with us!

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:22.023 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the world of fishes!

[NENE]
No! I don't want to!

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone!

[PORCUPINEFISH]
Are you sure, Your Highness?

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
You don't even like
your human legs,

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
and you can't find
yourself a proper mate.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
If finding love was your goal,
you have failed miserably!

[PORCUPINEFISH]
You poor dear.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
I hate that this is such
a surprise to you.

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
But the truth is you'll
never have a boyfriend

All hope is not lost!

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
Your Highness was merely
born into the wrong world,

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
and we can help you escape.

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
All you have to do is walk away.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
Forget the world of
the living and let us

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
all forget those hideous legs!

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
I promise if you will
come to our world,

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
Your Highness will be
treated like royalty.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
But more than that!

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
You'll be popular!

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
[NENE squeals]
I'll be popular?

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center

Indeed.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Are you positive?

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH] Yes, now, open
wide and drink the

That's enough.

Huh?

lovely your world is

or how broken her life
may be at the present time.

[NENE squeals]

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center
The fact remains.

Yashiro likes being
here with me.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
You're here.
But how did you find out?

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center
[PORCUPINEFISH]
Stop! Unhand the princess!

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
Do it now, School Wonder!

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
Well, this is going to be
a problem, isn't it?

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
Didn't your mistress
ever teach you not

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
to take things that
belong to others?

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
I can't say I mind
all that much.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center

to make sashimi!

See ya later!

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
Can I be honest
with you for a sec?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
I was never planning to go,
but I was kinda curious.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Right.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.630 position:50% align:center
And you thought having
a harem might be fun?

[NENE]
Sorry. Don't judge me!

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
You make no sense.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
You have the opportunity
to stay human,

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
yet you search for ways
to become an apparition.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
I know. I'm sorry.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
I thought if I could be
a part of your world,

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
if I were a ghost, that might
bring us closer somehow.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I thought if I
were more like you,

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
then I'd finally understand
how your mind works.

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
I really want that.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center

mean anything to you.

I meant to tell you
this earlier.

I just couldn't find the time.

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
You're the first girl who's
ever said she liked me.

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
It made me happy.

Before I died...

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
...I had a little brother.

I killed him, though.

Look, Yashiro.

You really want to know
more about me?

If you do,
then I promise one day

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you everything.

stay my assistant?

How are we supposed to know?
