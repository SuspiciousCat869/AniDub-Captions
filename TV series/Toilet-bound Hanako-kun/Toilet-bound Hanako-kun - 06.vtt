What'cha reading, Yashiro?

[NENE] While I was in my new
favorite place, the library,

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.605 position:50% align:center
I decided to read every
book that might have

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
secret information on Hanako.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
That's how I learned about
the fifth of the Seven Wonders,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
the Four o'clock Library.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
If there's a book with
Hanako's school history in it,

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
I want to find it!

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.367 position:50% align:center
I just don't want
to go there alone.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
Um, hi?
I'm still here. I'll go!

Hmm...

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
You're bored, huh? I'm sorry.

Besides, you're my bro now.

I'd do anything for you!

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:58.725 position:50% align:center
And I may or may not
be a little curious to read

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:00.518 position:50% align:center
his book myself.

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.604 position:50% align:center
I had a
feeling that might be it.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
You're trying to find out
his weaknesses

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.191 position:50% align:center
so you can exorcise him,
aren't you?

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center

Don't even.

There is no such thing
as a good apparition, Kou.

I've been doing some thinking.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.453 position:50% align:center
And I honestly can't say I know
that much about the guy,

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:21.122 position:50% align:center
or that I have a real reason
to exorcise him.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.667 position:50% align:center
Well, besides the fact
that he's a toilet germ.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.752 position:50% align:center
Can ghosts even get germs?

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
I've only seen him
fight the bad guys.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
There doesn't seem to be
a reason to get rid of him.

White books are records

Hanako took off his hat
for the first time today!

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
[YAKO, TSUCHIGOMORI]
Yes, sir.

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Okay, I guess
he really is the leader.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
As I was saying,
the seven of us work as a team

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
to maintain the peace
at this school.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
However, it appears
that one of us

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.620 position:50% align:center
has metamorphosed
into a traitor.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
They've found a way to forge
a bond with a human,

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
and that human is spreading
rumors about apparitions

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
that have been altered
to suit their needs.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
Number Two is one
of their victims.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
If it were only involving
Numberless apparitions,

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't be concerned,

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
but they are manipulating
truths about the Wonders.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
[YAKO] Which can only mean
that this criminal is a human

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center
with ties to a Wonder.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
Are you saying there
are other humans like me?

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] It would be extremely
difficult to find them.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
But I've come up
with a solution.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
We'll temporarily cancel
all Seven Wonders!

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.282 position:50% align:center
Cancel?

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] We'll destroy
each Wonder's Yorishiro,

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
and it will lose its power.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
Then we won't have to worry
about finding the traitor,

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.458 position:50% align:center
or everything becoming
a mad mess.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
Sounds like we'd be making
things even more chaotic.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
As soon as the problem's solved,

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
then it's done.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
I can reappoint them.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
What do you say,
Mr. Tsuchigomori?

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
Are you in?

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not.

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
Is what I'd like to say,

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
but as you know,
I hate to stir conflict.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
If you demand my Yorishiro,
I'll comply.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.731 position:50% align:center
But that compliance
has one condition.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
What condition?

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI] I want each
of you to tell me your

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50% align:center
juiciest secrets.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center
--Say what?!
--Why our secrets?

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
Why? Because I find it
entertaining, wouldn't you?

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
And what if they refuse
to share that information?

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
Should I prepare for battle?

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
I'll hand you my Yorishiro,

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
but my revenge will be
utilizing the PA system

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
to tell the whole school
what I already know.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yell]

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
So I'd give me something
to sink my teeth into.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
But I'll have fun either way.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.974 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Okay, I'll go first!

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
My darkest secret is, uh,

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
when I was in junior high,
I wrote love letters

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center
in a diary to an
imaginary boyfriend!

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
I'll give it three.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What? Why?

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
For one, I knew you
were going to say that.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
Second, it's kind of boring.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
And finally,

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
that one is a lie.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:27.836 position:50% align:center
[NENE grunts]

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?
No, it's not!

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
Well, not everything.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
Just the part about it being
when you were in junior high.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
You still write in it.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Dear, Sweet Teru,

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
you did such a great job
addressing the school today

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
during the assembly.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
And I can't even get into
how hot you looked!

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
But don't forget that we're
keeping our relationship

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
secret for now.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
Please stop staring
at me like that

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
with the entire school watching!

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
They're going to figure us out!

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
There was an assembly,
but the rest is pure delusion.

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
Such scandal!

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
Wait... You mean my brother?

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
You've been
fake-secret dating him?

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
No I wasn't! That was...
uh...

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Winner!

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Nene, really?

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
How long has this been going on?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Pathetic.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Let's try to focus
on the matter at hand.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
I guess it's my turn, then!

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Sure. Knock yourself out.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Okay.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
I, um...

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
I hate festival masks!

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
They terrify me!

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
Next! That doesn't count.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What?! It's humiliating!

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
[KOU, NENE groan]

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
[NENE] So basically,
our embarrassment isn't

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
embarrassing enough?

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
Damn it, Hanako, you should have
to tell him something, too!

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
Who, me?

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Omigosh, I hope
he shares something.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.781 position:50% align:center
My, oh, my.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
You want to hear
secrets about me?

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
No thanks.
But I do appreciate the offer.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
I know more than enough.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
I tried, but he's not
interested in my muddy past.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
He wanted to hear
from all of us!

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no fair, Plunger Pants.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
I see.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
I feel like it's more about you
two being uncomfortably nosey.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.056 position:50% align:center
It's your turn!

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Well, all right,
but you only get one, okay?

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
I, uh... I love...

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
Say it!

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
I love donuts.
So much. That's it.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
I said it out loud!

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
Happy now? He's traumatized!

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
Look what you did, you jerk!

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
You two that stupid?

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
Nothing is good enough for him!

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
Hanako? What's your
favorite kind of donut?

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:34.921 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Normal one.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:36.047 position:50% align:center
You mean plain?

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
From where?

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Just homemade.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
You know how to make donuts?

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
How fascinating.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
[YAKO]
Tell me what you're thinking.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
I was observing.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
I can't think of another
time when I've ever seen

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
Number Seven look like that.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
Hey, you brats, it's over!

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
Wait! Please don't
use the PA system!

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't do that.

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
It was just part of a strategy.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
Obviously it failed.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
But perhaps what I saw

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
was worth more
than what was said.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.878 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Follow me.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
Looks like I owe you
my Yorishiro.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.798 position:50% align:center
[NENE gasps]

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI] But,
I'm only letting one of you

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
beyond this point.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
And that's the priestess
who will destroy the Yorishiro.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:26.848 position:50% align:center
"Priestess"?

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.975 position:50% align:center
He means my assistant.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
That's a whole bag of no, dude!

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
Nene's not going
in there with you!

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous--

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
What do you say, Number Seven?

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
After all this time, don't you
know that you can trust me?

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
[NENE gasps]

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Good point.
Take good care of her for me.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Mr. Tsuchigomori.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
You got it.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What's happening?

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
So, uh...

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
How are things going with him?

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Who?

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Number Seven. Working together.

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
Everything all right?

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
Well, most of the time,

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
he's a jerk to me and uses
my emotions as a prop,

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
or leads me on and
then teases me about it.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
But occasionally, he'll say
just the right thing.

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
And he always comes
to my rescue.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
So that's why I can't hate him.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:37.585 position:50% align:center
In fact, I actually think
of him as a friend!

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:39.212 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
I see.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
That's all right, then.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.883 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Was he worried about Hanako?

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
Or just keeping tabs?

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Mr. Tsuchigomori?

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you something?

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Go ahead.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
Would it be possible to
change some things

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
that are written in the books
in the Four O'clock Library?

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
If you're talking about
the future, then no.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
It's basically
impossible to change.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Ugh.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
However, I have seen it once.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Seen what?

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.492 position:50% align:center
Somebody altered
the course of their future.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
We're here.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
This the deepest part
of the Boundary?

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
It's so beautiful!

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
Which one of these
is your Yorishiro,

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
Mr. Tsuchigomori?

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
It's none of them.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
It's filthy!

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
You're filthy!

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
Now, as I said,
I once witnessed a human

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
change the future that had
been written in the book

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:41.358 position:50% align:center
of his life, and he is the
one who gave this to me.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Really?
What kind of stone is it?

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
I believe it's a
moon rock from space.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
So, it's a fake?

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
A fake? No.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
It's quite authentic.

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
It was during the time
when humans first traveled

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
to the moon.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
I was given that rock the day
after that historic date.

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
The day after?

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
So that means the person
who changed his future

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
was an astronaut?

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
But no, he wasn't.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
He was just an ordinary
human on the outside

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
looking in.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
He had a hard time
making friends,

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
so he connected with the stars.

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
He was smart, but...

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
His grades weren't proof.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you know how
to destroy a Yorishiro?

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me what
he wanted to change

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
about his future and why?

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
I guess in theory I could.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
I'll say more than I ought to if
we stay here much longer.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
--[BABY crying]
--[CHILD laughing]

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI] I wish you'd
come out and tell me already.

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
It's getting to be
every day now.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
I want to know
who's doing this to you.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:12.866 position:50% align:center
Yugi?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
Still not gonna say a word, huh?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
You've been the most
stubborn kid here

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
ever since your first year.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
Your bruises never get
a chance to fade.

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
You don't have any friends,

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
and you're afraid
to go to class.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
Did you hear anything I said?

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
Yugi Amane?

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
Please just stop
pressuring me, sir.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
That's not pressure.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
I care about you.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.688 position:50% align:center
And you're worrying me
a lot these days.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
What is there to worry about?

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
Some stupid bruises?

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
I don't mind. Really.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Well, I mind.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
I can't think of anything
that could possibly

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
justify someone
hurting you like this.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.785 position:50% align:center
I'm fine!

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
I don't care if
it's not justified.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
Even if there's
no reason at all.

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.584 position:50% align:center
I don't mind it.
Please believe me.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:10.507 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna know a secret?

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
I've got a moon rock!

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
'Kay?

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
I think I was about
four years old

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
when it fell out of the sky.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
It landed right in front of me.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
You believe me, don't cha?
Look at it.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
No, sorry, I don't.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
That's fine.
I knew you wouldn't.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
And that's okay. We don't
care what anyone thinks.

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
We know it's real.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
So you can say
whatever you want,

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
but I've got a moon rock.

Hey, have you ever
wondered how far apart

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
the moon and the Earth are?

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
Well, the answer is
380,000 kilometers!

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
[laughs] This rock traveled all
that way from the moon!

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
Isn't that amazing?

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
And now I have it!

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
It's fascinating.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
But we're not talking
about the moon right now;

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
we're trying to keep you safe.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
Are you listening?

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
Wow! You can already
see the moon!

I know I have.

The moon is so big
and beautiful.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
I want to go.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.459 position:50% align:center
I know it has to be
the perfect place.

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center

[HANAKO]
No. Please, sir.

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
Did you mean it when you
said you cared about me?

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
Okay then.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
Can I please ask you a favor?

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

[HANAKO]
Yeah. I do.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
And whenever I look at it,

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
I feel like it's telling me
I can go anywhere I want.

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I've decided
never to go anywhere ever again.

Was that, um...

Didn't you see it
with Number Two?

The memories inside
the Yorishiro.

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
Then that means the person you
saw change his future was...

[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Yugi Amane.

Seven used to be.

[NENE]
And now he's Hanako.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI] It was the day
before humanity went to the moon

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
for the first time.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
Back in those days,
it was just a dream.

No one ever thought
it would come true.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
But it did,
which meant that nothing

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
could be seen as impossible.

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
Your dream could manifest
no matter what it was.

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
We could become anything
we wanted to be.

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
We could go anywhere
we wanted to go.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
While society was
filled with hope

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
after travelling
beyond the stars,

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
he decided "not to go anywhere."

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
As his homeroom teacher,

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:19.863 position:50% align:center
I was worried about how
his life would play out.

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
At least, I pretended to be.

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
Pretended?

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
Yeah.

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
I had read the record of
his future sometime prior.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
I would ask him
what he wanted to be

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
even though I knew his fate.
To see if it lined up.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
His book said he would
grow up to be a teacher,

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
but he never voiced a desire.

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.633 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
A science teacher.

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
His love of the stars developed,

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
and he'd eventually
teach at this school.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
If he had lived,
we would've been coworkers.

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
[chuckling]

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:57.317 position:50% align:center
It wasn't his time.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.736 position:50% align:center
He wasn't supposed
to die like that...

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
...while he was still a kid.

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:04.657 position:50% align:center
So there it is.

00:22:04.741 --> 00:22:06.534 position:50% align:center
Yugi Amane is the
only human I know

00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center
who changed his future.

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:11.748 position:50% align:center
I wish I had a more
uplifting explanation.

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.333 position:50% align:center
But the truth is,
he said he didn't want to do

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center
more with his life,
so he cut it short.

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.545 position:50% align:center
He didn't want to leave,
and he's still here

00:22:17.629 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
as the Seventh of
the Seven Wonders.

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:24.803 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd say that's about all
I can tell you for now.

00:22:26.012 --> 00:22:28.765 position:50% align:center
If you want to talk
again later, I'm here.

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:30.934 position:50% align:center
I may not be human,
but I'm still technically

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:33.269 position:50% align:center
your teacher,
whether you like it or not.

00:22:39.442 --> 00:22:40.443 position:50% align:center
[NENE gasps]

00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:44.864 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Yashiro!

00:22:44.948 --> 00:22:46.199 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Calm down!

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.201 position:50% align:center
Thanks for being a pal
and breaking the Yorishiro!

00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:50.036 position:50% align:center
Everything's peaceful
again because of you!

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.288 position:50% align:center
Back off, bro!

00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:53.873 position:50% align:center
Hanako...

00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:57.585 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Squished.

00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:59.087 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, Nene?

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.006 position:50% align:center
Everything's okay.

00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:03.550 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
His body is so cold.

00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:06.011 position:50% align:center
I've always known
that he's a ghost.

00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:07.679 position:50% align:center
That he's already dead.

00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:11.182 position:50% align:center
But sometimes these
reminders still break my heart.

00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:13.768 position:50% align:center
I don't want him to see me cry.

00:23:13.852 --> 00:23:15.478 position:50% align:center
He'll make fun of me.

00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:16.688 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.189 position:50% align:center
I'm right here;
please don't cry.

00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:27.115 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Mr. Tsuchigomori.

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:29.993 position:50% align:center
Hello, Number Seven.
What can I do for you?

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:31.953 position:50% align:center
Did you say something?

00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:34.456 position:50% align:center
Something that perhaps
you shouldn't have?

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:36.583 position:50% align:center
Yashiro is acting very strange.

00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:41.463 position:50% align:center
Well naturally, I had to inform
her about my Yorishiro.

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:44.758 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Hmm. I see.

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:46.426 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
about your Yorishiro;

00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:48.511 position:50% align:center
why don't you
tell me these things?

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:50.221 position:50% align:center
You have no idea what it is?

00:23:54.017 --> 00:23:56.061 position:50% align:center
Is it... a nudie book?

00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:57.270 position:50% align:center
You're not even close.

00:23:57.354 --> 00:23:59.731 position:50% align:center
I know. I'm just
messin' with you.

00:24:04.402 --> 00:24:06.112 position:50% align:center
You never change, do you?

00:24:06.196 --> 00:24:07.447 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
True.
