[NENE]
Hey, have you heard?

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.772 position:50% align:center
There's a ghost who
looks just like Hanako.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:47.482 position:50% align:center
And they don't
seem to get along.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:51.444 position:50% align:center
After what happened on the roof,

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.987 position:50% align:center
things have gotten
even more awkward

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.032 position:50% align:center
between Hanako and me.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.784 position:50% align:center
I have lots of questions
about the boy

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.577 position:50% align:center
who appeared up there,

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.622 position:50% align:center
but I've been too nervous
to bring him up again.

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.124 position:50% align:center
It's all too much.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.006 position:50% align:center
[NENE giggles]

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.133 position:50% align:center
So I've been raising
idols instead.

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.801 position:50% align:center
[IDOL A]
Thanks so much, Producer!

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:15.844 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Don't thank me, thank yourself!

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.224 position:50% align:center
The strength you needed was
always in your heart.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
Hey, Nene!

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.310 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.730 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What's up? What is it?

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Well, there's a
cute boy asking for you,

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
and I think he's
an upperclassman.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.281 position:50% align:center
Right there.
Do you know him?

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.408 position:50% align:center
Guys are falling
all over you lately.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.578 position:50% align:center
Who, lil old me? No way.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Then again,
there could be some way.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
[HOT GUY A]
Dude, you're hot.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50% align:center
[HOT GUY B]
Wanna go out?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.961 position:50% align:center
[HOT GUY C]
Marry me.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.797 position:50% align:center
[NENE giggles]

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
Uh... 'Scuse me!

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
Hello. It's good to see ya.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.733 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
This feels weird.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
I really shouldn't
be following this guy,

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
but, well...

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
He's a total dreamboat!

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
And hot older guys
aren't exactly lining up

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
to take me on walks.

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I wonder what he wants.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
Umm...

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
Hey, you. I was--

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
Right, forgot to say.
My name is Natsuhiko Hyuuga.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
But you can just call me
Natsuhiko, 'kay?

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
I'm a second year. Class B.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
My hobbies include
fishing, karaoke,

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50% align:center
and going on dates with
sweet lil snaccs like you.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
Sorry if this is a weird
question, Hyuuga,

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
but have we ever
actually spoken before?

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:48.603 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
No, no. Call me Natsuhiko.

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
So are we exchanging
numbers or what?

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
No substance.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
[phone chimes]

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Umm...

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center
So why did you ask
for me, anyway?

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
Hm? Because a friend of mine
wanted to talk to you.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
Wait, who wants to talk to me?

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
And also, um... Why?

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
Oh, that's because--

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
Because you're such
a cool girl, I guess.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
He thinks I'm cool!

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
So hey, well, uh...

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
No worries if not,
but could I maybe ask

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
one more question?

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
Course you can.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
Did you pick up
that goldfish bowl

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
for any special reason?

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
Would you care
to guess what it is?

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
No. I, uh...

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Gotcha!

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
This isn't good.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
[splash]

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Why? What is this?
What do you want with me?

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
You know. I want a tasty treat.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Huh?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
Think she's dead.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
She obviously just passed out.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Passed out to death.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.391 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Something smells nice.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
Like pastries.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
Where'd these clothes come from?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.316 position:50% align:center
They're cute!

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
This is still weird though.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center
Could this place be
another Boundary?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
So you're awake.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
I asked those two to treat
you as gently as possible,

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
but naturally,
they ignored my request.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, I know you!

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:38.755 position:50% align:center
We met at the library.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
You're Hanako's girlfriend!

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
--That's not--
--No way!

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
You're dating Amane
and you didn't tell me?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it for a second!
Tell me it's not true!

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
[overlapping chatter]

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Let's not.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
[overlapping chatter]

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Wait, it's the
boy from the roof.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Who are these people?

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
Why are they with him?

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
[smack]

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I'm not dating him.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Understood, ma'am. Sorry.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Well that settled that.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Let's start over.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
I'm pleased to meet you,
Nene Yashiro.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
Apologies for the
late introduction.

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50% align:center
My name is Sakura Nanamine,
and I'm currently a third year.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
Just like you,
I'm a bound human.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
In order to obtain a wish,

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
I consented to enter
an apparition's service.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
You're actually the same as me?

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
I've been bound to
this boy for some time.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
He may act childish, but he's
surprisingly dependable.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.321 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I could say the
same thing about Hanako.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
So then what about Natsuhiko?

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Oh.
I just pretend he's not here.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
Wussup.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh. Gotcha.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Honestly,
I've wanted to speak with you

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
for quite a while now.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
After all, we're both
in the same

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
exceedingly rare position.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
Surely the two of us
can be friends. Right?

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Up close, she's even
prettier than I thought.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
She really is like a doll.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.392 position:50% align:center
Pull yourself together!

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
You can't let your guard down
just because she's pretty.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
Think, Nene! Think!

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
There's no way she
had me fish-ified

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
and kidnapped just so
we could talk about work.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
That's crazy!

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
Plus, the ghost she's
bound to definitely has

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
history with Hanako.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
I don't know what these
people are playing at,

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
but it's shady.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
If they think they
can make me talk,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
they're wrong.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally. And listen.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
You wanna know what's really
annoying about Hanako?

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
The way his mood'll flip
randomly for who-knows-why.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center
It drives me absolutely insane!

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
That sounds tough.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
This tea is delicious.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] It's a green tea
infused with white peach.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
Have some more.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Thanks. Anyway, he also
says weird, misleading stuff

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
and harasses me and
makes me clean toilets

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.650 position:50% align:center
and never considers my feelings.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
Also he calls me a daikon,
which I'm not!

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
A daikon?

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.281 position:50% align:center
I can certainly sympathize
with most of that.

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
My master's awful too.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
He's utterly irrational,
impossible to control,

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
and has no sense
of personal space.

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Are you talkin' smack about me?

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I am. Please get down.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
I can't make him behave,
so I've decided

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
to think of him as more
of a cat than a person.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
A cat...

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50% align:center
So hey. About that boy, um...

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Do you mean me?

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.015 position:50% align:center
My name's Tsukasa!
[chuckles]

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
And I'm Amane's
younger twin brother!

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
You're his twin?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] Well, yeah.
Didn't Amane tell you?

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center
Hey, quick question.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
Is Amane good
at smoochin' or no?

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh?

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
You guys have smooched, right?

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
No, of course we haven't! Why?!

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] You know,
because you're dating him.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
That's not true!

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
He isn't even my type.
Like at all.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Oh. You sure about that?

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
Why don't you slow it down?

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
He really startled me there.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute. Dang it all!

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
Why'd I let myself
get so distracted?

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
I was supposed to be
keeping my guard up.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
Gah, I'm such an idiot.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
Still...

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
This hasn't been going anything
like I was scared it might.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
These guys don't really
seem like bad people.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.570 position:50% align:center
Is it possible that they've
been telling the truth,

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
and the only thing
they want from me

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
is a conversation?

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
If so, then why didn't
they just ask me

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
to come here?

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Sakura.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
This isn't easy on either of us.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
As long as we're bound
to our masters,

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
we can't defy their orders,
even if we'd like to.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.013 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's how it goes!

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
It's funny.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.808 position:50% align:center
Whenever I try to
say no to Hanako,

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
he threatens to turn me
into a fish.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I know how you feel.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Is it the same for you?

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Yeah. It's just the same.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
So I'm sure you see
why I have to do this.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh?

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hey!

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
What the heck's goin' on
with this freaky chair?!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.913 position:50% align:center
Let me go! Come on!

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
Please believe me when
I tell you that this was

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
never what I wanted.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
I'd like nothing more
than to release you.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
But I have no choice
except to do as I've been told.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
Amane and I are pretty
much polar opposites.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
I guess you could
also call us rivals?

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
Arch-nemeses, maybe?

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
Eh, who cares?

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
The point is: I need you
to disappear for me.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.647 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I'm sinking!

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to drown me?

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I'm truly sorry.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad we at least
got the chance to talk,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.613 position:50% align:center
ya know. Farewell.

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Buh-bye!

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Wait! You can't do this!

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
Don't leave me!

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's up?

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
She left you here
to drown with me?

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Well...

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
This is mostly par
for the course with her.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
When it comes to me,
she tends to act kinda...

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
What's the word for it?
Sadistic.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one she treats
this way, so, yeah.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
It's love.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Don't think that's how
love is s'posed to work.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
Anyway...

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.019 position:50% align:center
Are you one of those
people who isn't really

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
scared of dying?

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
'Cause if not,
you might wanna start

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
freakin' out right now.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
Good point.
I'm getting there.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
Wh-What should I do?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
If this keeps up,
I'll sink all the way!

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
Somebody... Help me.
Please! Hanako!

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
Okay, this is
the way it always is.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
I do something dumb, end up in
dangerous situations

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
and almost die,
and then Hanako shows up

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
out of nowhere just in
time to save me.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.979 position:50% align:center
And this is the same.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I'll be fine
this time too.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
Hanako will save me
like he always does.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
He'll come.

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
Hey, Nene. Wake up.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
Ah, rise and shine, Princess.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
Now come here. Taste the lemon.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Uh... Sorry 'bout that.
You startled me.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
S'all good. I'm used to it.

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Wait, what have I done?

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.681 position:50% align:center
How could I waste
that perfect opportunity?

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
I should've just kissed him.

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
Snap out of it!

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
I can't kiss him!

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
He's friends with the people
who tried to disappear me!

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
Also, even if he's hot,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.861 position:50% align:center
there's something not
quite right about him.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
He's definitely not as cool
as I thought he was.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter, Nene?

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
Did we wash out
of that sinking room

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
and end up here?

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
Where is here, anyway?

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
Is it... a Boundary?

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
I see a lot of doors.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
And a lot of little mokke, too.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
But there's no water
on the ground.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] I don't think it's
quite the same as a Boundary.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
I know that voice!

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
That is you, isn't it, Hanako?

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.853 position:50% align:center
Where are you hiding?
Come out already!

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Sure thing, Yashiro.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
See? Right here.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
On the radio?

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
--[HANAKO] Uh-huh.
--[MOKKE A] It's heavy.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Considering where
you are right now,

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.990 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you
got tricked again.

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
The instant I take
my eyes off you,

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
ya run straight for
the nearest ghost or hot guy.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.538 position:50% align:center
Yep. That's me.

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Heh.
Some assistant you are.

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
It was awful, Hanako.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
This cute boy lured me
outside and stuck me

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
in a fishbowl and then
there was a tea party

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
and I tried to keep my guard up.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
There was tea and sweets
and they were really good,

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
And... And, well...

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] So... You just gonna
make excuses, or--?

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I'm sorry for getting tricked.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
There ya go.

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
Now listen up.

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
I don't know how long
this signal's gonna last,

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center
so I'll try to keep
this short and sweet.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
The place you're in
right now isn't the world

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
of the living or the dead.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
It's not even a Boundary--
it's nowhere.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
So we aren't anywhere at all?

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Eh... In a sense,
you're both everywhere

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
and nowhere.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
From your current
lack of location,

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:37.544 position:50% align:center
you can access any place
in the past or the future.

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
It's pretty confusing.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center
I've sent Haku-joudai
to try and track you down

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.717 position:50% align:center
by way of the bond we share.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
But that not-a-place
you're in is real big.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
So I'm gonna need you to help me
as best you can, okay?

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.599 position:50% align:center
Okay, where do you
think I should start?

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] You can see a lot
of doors around you, right?

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Each of those doors
connects to a different place.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center
Most connect to worlds
you've never heard of.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
But look around long
enough and you should

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
be able to find one that
connects to the Earth

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
as you know it.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
So yeah, find a door
that leads to our world

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
and walk on through it.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
'Kay, so, should I just
start opening doors

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
and peeking inside them?

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
Only open doors
