You know the truth,

seemed... angry?

No, it wasn't intense
enough to be anger.

It's said that you must never
step on the fourth stair.

And if you happen
to break that rule...

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center

sucked into another world.

the staircase at twilight,

you'll find the blood
of its victims dripping

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
from that fourth step.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.065 position:50% align:center

told me something creepy,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.959 position:50% align:center

the star of that story.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
existing between the shores
of this life and the next.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
Where spirits go when
they've got no direction.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
Or where they end up
when they've been forgotten

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:41.271 position:50% align:center
along with items that were
once special to someone.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
[NENE] But if... if they
didn't mean to go there,

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
then they can still
come back, right?

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Aww!
Now what's this face for?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
Careful with the moisture.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
We're going to bring
them home, you'll see!

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
And do you know why?

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
Because I'm the seventh
of the Seven Wonders!

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
I get to make sure
pesky apparitions

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
and silly humans
all play nicely together.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
And guess who gets
to be my little helper?

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
It's me. I'm the helper.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
That's right, you sure are!

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.640 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's enough!

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
You don't believe in
positive affirmation?

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
Not from some freaky,
handsy ghost!

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.190 position:50% align:center
Are you seriously gonna take
Nene to this Boundary place

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:25.899 position:50% align:center
with you?

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
I "seriously" am, yeah.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
I'm coming too!

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
I don't trust you
to keep her safe.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50% align:center
That's all right.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
But while my assistant
will have my protection,

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
I can't say the same for you.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
Like I really need help
from a pol-turd-geist!

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
Then I won't expect
to hear from you

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
when you're about
to be shredded, right?

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What? Shut up!

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
Let's just get this
out of the way now!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO laughing]

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Hold still, damnit!

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.215 position:50% align:center
Hey! Come on, just fight me!

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Nene!

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.595 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hold on, Aoi.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
We'll get you out of there.
I promise.

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! So then it's real?

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Aoi...

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Don't worry, Nene.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
I'll protect you no matter what.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
And exorcise this freak, too!

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
Well, let's go, shall we?

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
It's the fourth
stair up, isn't it?

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center
Step number one!

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.255 position:50% align:center
Wait! We're going already?

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Two! Three! Four!

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Where are we?

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Well, hello there,
Misaki Stairs.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
I appreciate an entity with
a flair for bold aesthetics.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I'm just walking
around in the spirit world.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
No big deal.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
Can't believe this is connected
to the school somehow.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
[NENE gasps]

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
These dolls...
They're not real, right?

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Would you rather
stay here and explore?

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
[KOU gasps]

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What is this puddle?

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.365 position:50% align:center
[NENE whimpers]

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Oh, no, the scales!

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Nene?
What's wrong?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.995 position:50% align:center
It's nothing. All good!

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Gotta watch my step down here.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
Kou would not be
understanding if I fished-out

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
in front of him.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
Hey, Toilet Boy!

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
This place is lame so far.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.882 position:50% align:center
Where's all this shredding
you're not protecting me from?

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
You expected to see
the main event right away?

00:11:58.468 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
Then we'd have nowhere
else to go from there,

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
and that wouldn't be fun.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
Personally, I find seeing
someone torn apart

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
bit by bit much
more entertaining. 

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.560 position:50% align:center
You sure are a piece of work.

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Well, at least you get it!

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
I'm shocked at
how many still don't.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
The Seven Wonders of this
school have been leading

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
our fellow apparitions
for ages and it's a shame

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
that more of your kind
don't appreciate us.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
You leave us no choice
but to frighten you.

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
We try being helpful
and protective,

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
but you take the credit
or give it to the "universe"

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center
as some call it.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
However, when we're scary,
you know who did it.

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
That being said,

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
Number Two is taking
it all a step too far.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it needs to end.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
That's a phone?

[ringing continues]

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center

Don't!

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
Hello, who's there?

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
Um... Hi? Can you hear me?

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
Hello.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
This is Misaki.

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
She said "Misaki."

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
As in the Stair Ghost?
Just hang up!

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50% align:center
[VOICE] My classroom was
at the top of these stairs.

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
I adored my students
and they loved to learn.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center
But the place that
filled my life with joy

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
is also the place where
I died and was dismembered.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see you're standing
in the exact spot

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
where it happened.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
Will you do me a favor?

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
Look around and gather
the scattered portions

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
of my body for me?

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
Is Aoi there? Do you know her?

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
Find my arm first.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
My right arm.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
That's the one I use to write
notes on the chalkboard

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
during lessons.

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
Hurry, please.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
Class is about to start,
and students are waiting.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
She hung up on me.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
[creaking]

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
She's giving us a time limit
to find her parts?

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
What if we just stick
one of our arms in there?

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
Do you think it
will still count?

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
Hard to say.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.902 position:50% align:center
But you should try it
and see what happens.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
Or we could just ignore it!

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
Let's keep going and
forget that prank call!

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] To be honest,
I wouldn't advise it.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
We're in her territory
after all.

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center
And like each of
the Seven Wonders,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
it's impossible
to beat her here. 

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
Kinda like me and my bathroom.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
But if you want to risk it,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
I would love to see what
happens when she's angry.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hey, guys.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Why don't we just take
a look around for it

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
like she told us to?

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
With all that's going on,
it might not hurt

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
to have her on our side.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
I guess if you really
want to, we can.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
You should!

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:59.858 position:50% align:center
You never know what you
might find along the way!

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
Like this, for example!

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
We could be twins, right?

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center

can't see the resemblance!

at it! Get it out of my face!

Those magazines are dumb.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
Not all girls look like that.
I should know. I am one.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
But no one's staring
at my pictures that way.

Hold on.

[BABE laughs]

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Is that what's holding
me back from finding true love?

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
Would my whole life
change if I were bigger

like a woman's lost arm

to you, Kou?

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
Hanako, you're the one
who was warning us

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:10.553 position:50% align:center
about taking this seriously
and you're serving up

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center

Did you change your appearance?

Or swallow something lumpy?

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
Course not.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center

I always have!

I doubt we'll ever see one again

is completely empty!

So, then...

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
Does that mean
we missed our chance

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
to turn the arm in?

it to me, won't you?

as part of my routine.

Hey, Number Two.
It's been a while.

recommend being late.

[NENE]
So you're friends?

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
She's a Wonder. I'm a Wonder.
Sometimes it's assumed.

[clatter]

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
Does that mean she
expects us to go on

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
another arm hunt?

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.532 position:50% align:center
Hey, Toilet Breath,
isn't there an easier way?

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
Easier how?

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I don't know!

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
Like something we can
do to take her down!

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
There is.

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] If you want to find her
weakness, it's her Yorishiro.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What's a Yorishiro?

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
Well, there are certain
objects that are linked

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
to the Seven Wonders.

00:20:58.008 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
They supply our power.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
Yeah, how's that work?

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Hmm... It's sort
of like having a battery.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
If you were to find
a way to destroy it,

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
the Wonder would be weakened.

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
Which means she wouldn't
be able to maintain

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
this Boundary anymore.

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Then that's it!

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
Let's look for that instead!

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
Where can we
find this Norishiro?

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
It's a Yorishiro.

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Nori, Yori. Where is it?

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
Hidden in the deepest
part of this Boundary.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
In what direction?

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
I don't know exactly.

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
Wherever the deepest
place may be.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
Probably way past that door,

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:40.800 position:50% align:center
and at the very top
of the tallest stairs.

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
So that could mean...

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:43.261 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I hope not.

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
--[NENE, KOU groan]
--[HANAKO laughs]

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
Well... We better get climbing!

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
Ready, set, go!

00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
[NENE, KOU]
Woot.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
And so we went on.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.409 position:50% align:center
Searching every corner of
the boundary and gathering up

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:10.789 position:50% align:center
the Misaki Stairs' scattered
body parts like she asked us to.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.752 position:50% align:center
This should be the last one.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
It's opening!

00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:25.595 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Now that I think about it,

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:27.806 position:50% align:center
she was making us look
for her missing parts

00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:30.225 position:50% align:center
because she couldn't
do anything without them.

00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:35.563 position:50% align:center
But, if that was true, then...

00:22:37.315 --> 00:22:39.192 position:50% align:center
...who was making
those phone calls?
