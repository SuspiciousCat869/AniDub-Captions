[NENE] Hanako and I
had entered into a bond.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:49.192 position:50% align:center
He granted my wish and
then made me his assistant.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure what to expect,
but a week later I found out.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.492 position:50% align:center
Hanako, Hanako, Hanako!

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.994 position:50% align:center
Can I please go home?! These
toilets are grossing me out!

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.579 position:50% align:center
Not yet!

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.165 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I felt more like a maid
than a paranormal apprentice.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.084 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Please! There's just
something I have to get done

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.043 position:50% align:center
today!

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.378 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Hmm. No.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.338 position:50% align:center
I've also got something
important I need you to do

00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:11.673 position:50% align:center
when you're finished.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.466 position:50% align:center
Sounds like your only
option is to clean faster.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Not fair!

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
You may be eternally
young, but I'm not!

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
I'm in the prime
of my life right now

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.682 position:50% align:center
and I could be missing
my big chance today

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.100 position:50% align:center
because of you!

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:24.019 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Chance for what?!

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
Not trying to brag,
but I got asked out

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.106 position:50% align:center
on a second date by Fuji,
the coolest guy in class!

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.649 position:50% align:center
[FUJI]
Are you free after school today?

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.443 position:50% align:center
[NENE] He really wants to meet
me alone in our classroom later

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.861 position:50% align:center
and I really don't
want to stand him up!

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.237 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
A date?!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.281 position:50% align:center
What exactly are you
expected to do with this kid?

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
If you really wanna know,
I guess I'll have to tell you.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
[stapling]

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
We're meeting in
an empty classroom

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
to organize paperwork
for student council.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.586 position:50% align:center
Fuji said he has to
leave right away though,

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
so I told him I'd finish up.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50% align:center
He's so shy.

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.300 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] If he's leaving,
then does that count as a date?

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Sure!

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
I may be just a woman
of convenience for now,

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.180 position:50% align:center
but eventually,
he'll see I'm a catch!

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Well, that's
one way to look at it,

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.351 position:50% align:center
but there's a fine line
between optimistic and naÃ¯ve.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
Sounds to me like
he's using you.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
Stay. Don't go on this date.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
I'll show you a better
time than that guy will.

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
And I won't leave you alone.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Thank you, Hanako,
but if my choices

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
are to clean bathrooms with
you or sort paperwork alone,

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
then please,
hand me all the stacks.

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Okay, that's fine.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
You must really miss
breathing through your gills.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.926 position:50% align:center
Guess I better go shopping.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
What's your favorite fish food?

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
Nothing brings me more joy
than a sparkling clean bathroom!

[NENE]
What'd I get myself into?

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
I don't want to
clean toilets today.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
I don't actually
believe I could ever be

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
with someone like Fuji.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
But, if anyone could
be accused of using me,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
it's Hanako.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
Did he send an orb to spy on me?

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
I know this is all my fault for
knocking on his stupid stall.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
I agreed to pay a price.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center

[NENE]
It doesn't make sense!

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
Where could they have gone?

Still missing?

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center

anyone talks about lately!

[SAKURA] Have you ever
lost something important

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
even though you were
obsessively careful with it?

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
Has something you rarely
handle suddenly disappeared

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
from its place at the
exact time you go to use it?

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
If so, you've probably
had a visit from Yousei.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
It's important that you
remember to never look

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
directly at it.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
[NENE] They look nothing
like that terrifying monster

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
from earlier.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:19.976 position:50% align:center
They're so cute.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Cut it out.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
They're shapeshifters.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
When they feel threatened
or are about to attack,

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
they'll cluster together
the way you first saw them.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
Normally they aren't aggressive
and don't attack humans.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A] We never wanted
to kill anyone, either.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE B]
But our story is different now.

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:37.035 position:50% align:center
It changed without asking us.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE C]
We didn't want it this way.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
What story?

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.122 position:50% align:center
The rumors humans share.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
Apparitions aren't able
to go against the rumors

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
that are created about them.

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
So even as humans
exaggerate and alter the story,

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
apparitions have no choice
but to act accordingly.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
Those who don't align
with their folklore

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
will eventually vanish
from the world entirely.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
Like disappear?

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE C]
Want one?

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Yashiro.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
I need you to change the rumors
about the mokke for me.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
You want me to do that?

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Yes please.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
As one of the Seven
Wonders of the school,

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
it's my responsibility
to monitor all apparitions

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
on campus and also to maintain
order between humans

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
and our kind.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
So I can't ignore
murderous apparitions.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
If I see them around,
I have to end them.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
However...

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
You have the power to save them.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
They will become whatever
the humans believe.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Please help us.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE B]
Sorry for scaring you earlier.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE C]
Have some candy.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
This is our home.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
We have lived happily
here for centuries.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE B]
We just want to stay, please.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE C]
Yum. Candy.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
I understand they
tried to kill you.

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
So you may not
want to help them.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
No pressure at all--

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I'll do it!

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever
I can to help you!

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
--[MOKKE] Yay!
--[HANAKO] Really?

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Of course!

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
All these precious little
mokke-angels remind me

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
of my baby.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
I miss my little White Inferno.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
I'm sorry, what?

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Sweet White Inferno!

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
He's my old hamster who died.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
He certainly had a name.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Besides, I owe you one.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
I mean, you did just
kinda just save my life.

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
And I haven't forgotten
about the Mermaid.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
So thank you, Hanako.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to help.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to put it together.

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
Was this the important job
you wanted me to do

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
after I was done
cleaning the bathroom?

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
It was.

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
But I'd originally planned
to wait a little longer.

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I knew it! Yay!

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
So I guess that means
I don't need to clean

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
the bathroom anymore!

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Yeah, nice try.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Sad day.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Do you hate it that much?

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
[NENE] C'mon, there aren't
many girls who are dreaming

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
about scrubbing public toilets.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
That's unfortunate.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Personally,
I look forward to it.

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
It's been nice having
something to do after school

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
and having someone to talk to.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
Kinda like having
a friend again.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Just like I remember.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
I miss that.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hey, I know.

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
What if I give you a nickname?

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
That might feel more
like real friends, right?

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
Do you know what
you're going to say?

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm! I think I found
the perfect solution!

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
[NENE] You know how sometimes
you keep losing things

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
for no reason?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
That's because Yousei is trying
to play games with you.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
No way!

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] Don't tell me
you lost something again.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
That's been happening a lot.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
Better hope it's not Yousei
or you could end up dead.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
Huh?

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
They say that if you see Yousei

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
and look directly at it,
it will take your life.

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
However...

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
Candy?

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Yeah, carry some pieces
around in your pocket

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
if you're suffering from
a Yousei attack.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
Candy distracts it so it'll
forget all about stealing

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
your things and won't
want to kill you.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
For real?

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:43.615 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
I've never heard that before!

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Good luck! I gotta go now.

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.661 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLGIRL A] Club meetings?
You're so busy lately.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Nah. I'm going
to visit a friend!

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
In the bathroom?

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
She's so weird.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Hey, runts. Where is he?

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
I'm looking for
your buddy, Hanako.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Who's that?

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
Run!

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Wait! Come back!

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
Fine, whatever.
I'll just track him down myself.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
When I find Hanako,
that will be the end!

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
Time to exorcise!

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E]
What's with him?

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:32.622 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D]
Seems a bit crazy.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:33.998 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E]
Yeah, just keep away from him.

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
[NENE sighs]

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
I wish a hot guy
would fall out of the sky

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
for me that way.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
No, not seriously.

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
I know the difference
between reality and fiction,

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
thank you.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
But I'm working as an
assistant to a ghost,

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
so yeah, sometimes
I wonder about those kinds

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
of experiences.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
What experiences?

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
So many.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
But like in this movie,
for example...

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
A gorgeous young girl is held
captive by an evil spirit.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
And just when she
starts to lose hope,

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
a man falls from the sky
and rescues her!

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
--[PRINCE A] Yah!
--[HANAKO yells]

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
He skillfully strips the evil
spirit from his powers.

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
Then he and the girl
are free to fall in love.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
Was I just exorcised
in that daydream?

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
You have a dangerous mind.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:33.141 position:50% align:center
What's more, dreams
like that are useless.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
You've still got
me here, after all.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.229 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
That's enough!

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare
harm her, evil spirt!

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
[KOU grunts]

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.864 position:50% align:center
I'm from Kamome Academy
Junior High, third year.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.241 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
A boy from the sky?

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
I'm Kou Minamoto!

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
In case they ask you
how you were finally sent

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
to the underworld!

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO gasps]

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec!
Do you know this guy, Hanako?

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
We've never actually
met in person.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
But I know who he is.
He's from the Minamoto clan.

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What does that mean?

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Back when
the night skies were deeper

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:15.684 position:50% align:center
and darker than they are now,
apparitions were called youkai.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
And we were much more
powerful than we are today.

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
That was until those
youkai were dispelled

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
by a brilliant exorcist called
Minamoto no Yorimitsu.

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
He was an ancestor of this kid.

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
So you know your stuff, huh?

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
You should be trembling at
the very mention of my name!

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
And now, it's time to do
my duty as a member

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
of the Minamoto clan.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
Hope you're ready.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
Hanako!

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
Exorcise me?

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.387 position:50% align:center
And do you honestly
expect to pull that off?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
How embarrassing for you.
Oh, well!

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
Hanako, no!

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
This is Raiteijou,
an exorcism tool

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
passed down in our
clan for generations!

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
It's a sacred staff that
transforms the wielder's

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
spiritual power into
demon-slaying lightning!

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
Don't even think
about touching it directly

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
unless you're a moron.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center
This is the end for you!

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Leave him alone!

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?!
You idiot!

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to warn
someone before you butt in!

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. It's fine.

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
So... Who are you?

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
I'm Nene Yashiro
and I'm in high school!

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
I'm Hanako's friend
and his assistant!

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:37.766 position:50% align:center
I suggest you quit
being mean to him

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
if you don't want to
find out what happens

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
when I get mad!

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Wait, what?

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
He's one of the most
evil ghosts out there.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
That's why I've been
trying to exorcise him

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
and keep the school safe.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO groans]

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
Have you lost your mind?
He's not evil!

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:52.906 position:50% align:center
In fact, Hanako saved my life!

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
That is total bullsh-- Nonsense!

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
He's not just some friendly
ghost in a storybook!

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
Hanako the Bathroom Ghost
is a super psychotic,

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
crazy-evil spirit that my
grandma tried so hard

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
to seal away!

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
You ever notice how he
carries a chef's knife around?

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
That means he used
it as a weapon

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
when he was alive!

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
He murdered someone, come on!

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
But I know him, that's not true.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.894 position:50% align:center
[KOU] I'm not surprised
he's lying to you!

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
I know what he is,
please believe me!

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
You can't trust him--

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO laughs]

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Cat's out of the bag now.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Talk about rude.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
What if I wasn't ready to share
that with my new friend

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
just yet?

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
Come, Haku-joudai.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
Yes, I have killed
someone, it's true.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
But I've asked for forgiveness.

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
And, God told me that if
I could fulfill this role...

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
...my sins would be absolved.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
Which means I can't let myself
be exorcised today.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
you're talking about!

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
Hey! We're not done here!

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
Quit making this hard, damnit!

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
Doesn't your hand hurt
with you holding it like that?

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
[KOU laughs]

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
Maybe this time you'll learn!

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
Is it that hard to believe
no one wants you around?

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO chuckles]

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
It didn't work!

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
[KOU gssps]

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Take this!

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
And a little of this!

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
Hey. Listen.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
I'm really loving this staff.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
Let's trade.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
Give it to me,
and I'll let you go.

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
Do people fall for that?

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
Well, it won't work on me!

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
Oh. Worth a shot!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Boop!

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
Looks like I win.

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
There.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
It can't hurt anyone anymore.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
[KOU gasps]

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
That's a family treasure!

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
Seriously?
It won't come off!

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
Fix it, now!

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Oh, it's fixed.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I knew it.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.682 position:50% align:center
You don't know how
to use that staff.

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
The lightning shouldn't
burn your hands like this.

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
Trying to handle power
beyond your capability

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
will bring you nothing
but destruction.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Know what?
Mind your own business!

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
Besides, I don't care if I die
if it means everyone else

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
will be safe as a result!

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Ooh! Such passion!

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
And no patience.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
Stop trying to rush.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
You'll be a great
exorcist one day.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.873 position:50% align:center
And then getting rid
of evil apparitions like me

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
will be a snap.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
I truly believe in you.

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to dispose of you.
Don't you get it?

00:20:58.508 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Of course!

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
That's why I have
to do this now.

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:02.345 position:50% align:center
[KOU grunts]

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
Hey... No fair...

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
You fight dirty.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Winner! Yay!

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Is he okay?

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Yes, he's just
not one to give up easily,

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
so he's exhausted
from the fight.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
He'll be up soon.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What about this staff?

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
Should we hide it now
while he's out?

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
In case he tries
to use it again?

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
Are you honestly
worried about this?

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Of course I am!
Why wouldn't I be?

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
I don't want to lose my friend!

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
I see.

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
You know the truth.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:39.924 position:50% align:center
But you're willing to be
friends with a murderer.

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.017 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] I'm kidding!
Your face was gold! Ha!

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
That boy's gonna be fine,
whether I like it or not.

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
Even if he does wake up
and try to exorcise me,

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
he's not that skilled, yet.

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
But at least it'll
be entertaining.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
However, something
even more exciting

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.615 position:50% align:center
could be coming our way soon.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
I thought it was
better not to respond.

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
Because even though
he's my friend

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:14.334 position:50% align:center
and we work together daily,
I had no idea what that meant.

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:17.462 position:50% align:center
In fact, I don't know
much about him at all.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.258 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
How are you this evening?

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
I heard an interesting
story recently.

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:26.930 position:50% align:center
There's a cursed staircase
with an important rule

00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:28.890 position:50% align:center
that must never be broken.

00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:32.602 position:50% align:center
This rule forbids you from
stepping on the fourth step.

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:36.022 position:50% align:center
Because if you do,
you'll be instantly teleported

00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:37.565 position:50% align:center
to the other side.

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:42.112 position:50% align:center
Has anyone out there
heard this story?

00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:44.864 position:50% align:center
The one about The Misaki Stairs.
