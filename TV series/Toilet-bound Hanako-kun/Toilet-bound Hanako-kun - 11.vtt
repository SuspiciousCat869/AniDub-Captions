[NENE] Hello, it's me,
your Queen of the Daikons!

Why just a four?

[NENE] A mysterious hand
pulled me into the Boundary

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.908 position:50% align:center
belonging to Number Three,
The Hell of Mirrors.

This time it was Tsukasa
who rescued me,

which was a strange
surprise since he tried

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.915 position:50% align:center

I was Hanako's assistant.

Don't you remember

Unless you want to disappear,

squeeze ourselves in,

[TSUCHIGOMORI] Each Boundary
of the Seven Wonders

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
has a special function.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
For example, my library
holds the school records.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
Number Two's is like "space."
Or like a celestial highway.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
You can access almost
any area of the school

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center

Didn't Nene destroy
that Boundary

when she smashed the <i>yorishiro</i> ?

00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
[TSUCHIGOMORI]
No.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
That just took away
her authority over it.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
But the Boundary itself
is still quite accessible.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
I can't say how functional
it would be at this point

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center

to oversee it.

and he's trying
to cope with that.

a pleasant feeling.

But it was a genuine reaction.

Hey.

What did you do? Answer me.

Damn it, tell me what you
did to him this time!

Tell me!

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
All right.
I made Mitsuba's wish come true,

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
and in exchange,
I collected a piece of his soul.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
You were there for
that part, remember?

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
I extracted his reason.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
A fitting payment for
the fulfillment of his wish.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
After that, the rest was easy.

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
I just created a body
by scraping together parts

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
from lesser spirits
who were about to disappear,

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
and then I poured
Mitsuba's soul into it.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
Ta-da! Instant Mitsuba!

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
But he's a totally
different person.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center
Which I guess makes sense.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
The Mitsuba you knew
lived and died as a human.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
He no longer exists
in this world.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Why?

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
Why would you even do that?

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
I'll never see my friend again
and it's all because of you!

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Hmm.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
I guess I've always wanted
to try making one.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
An artificial human.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
But he's a ghost!

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
So I guess that makes him
an artificial ghost?

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
Believe me, I wasn't
expecting him to turn out

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
so weak he couldn't
survive in a living world.

Oh, well.

isn't he?

born with absolutely nothing,

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
Will you let this
new power be taken away?

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
And vanish with it?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
Or do you steal a spot
in the Seven Wonders

a difficult choice, was it?

[MITSUBA]
Huh? What do you mean?

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.603 position:50% align:center
Why would I know you?

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you?

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you done with that?

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
Can I have it back please?

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:02.207 position:50% align:center
Just let go.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait...

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Stop! Don't go yet!

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA] Whoa! What the
heck is your problem?

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA grunts]

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
You know me!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
My name is Kou Minamoto!

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I know you know me!

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
Think about it,
you dumb, girly punk!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
Ugh!

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
That hurt!

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is this?

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
[KOU] Oh, shut up!
You know what it is!

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Huh?

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
Time out!

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
Let's take a break!

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
What are you d-- Huh?

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
We're sorry.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
We've got better things
to do, don't we?

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
No! He's got a knife!

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
Get it away!

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.556 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO gasps]

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
Wow! That was impressive!

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hanako.
What do we do now?

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:09.149 position:50% align:center
If we want to take back
his position as a Wonder,

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
then we have to break
the <i>Yorishiro</i> .

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
But she isn't awake yet, so...

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
We'll have to start by
getting him under control!

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
No! Hanako, wait!

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Listen.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
This body was never truly
alive in the human world.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
You're a pure apparition
and the furthest thing

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
from a human soul.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
That means...

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
You can never become human.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
You'll have to let go.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Yashiro!

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Mitsuba?

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA grunts]
Ow, ow, ow...

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Nene!

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
[NENE gasps]
What's happening?

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
When did Hanako
and Kou get here?

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA groans]

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Are you okay?

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
Your hair...
You look so different.

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:24.057 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess I do.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
[giggles] But...
I'm also stronger!

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
I'm one of the Wonders!

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
And I get to run
this whole place now!

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
So, I really hope you won't
destroy this Boundary thing.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
'Cause it would hurt me.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
It's my home.

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
And... at least, I think
that's how it works.

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:47.497 position:50% align:center
Whatever, just go away!

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Whoa! What the--?

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
Let me go!

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:02.679 position:50% align:center
Help! Something is pulling
me inside this mirror!

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center
Please stop grabbing my ankles!
It's making me super insecure!

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
Hanako! Kou, too?

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
Why are you doing this?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Shh.

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
Stop struggling.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
See you later.

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE B]
Are they died?

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:10.432 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
Man, that was a real mess!

00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:12.559 position:50% align:center
I hope Nene's not
dead or anything.

00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:14.310 position:50% align:center
I'd probably be more
worried about her

00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:16.730 position:50% align:center
if I wasn't in such a hurry.

00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:18.523 position:50% align:center
Took longer than I thought
to get back here

00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:20.567 position:50% align:center
after falling in the
crack of that Boundary

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.485 position:50% align:center
at the tea party.

00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:24.404 position:50% align:center
I'm here!

00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:25.905 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Natsuhiko!

00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:27.991 position:50% align:center
You came back for me!

00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:30.035 position:50% align:center
Being away from you
for so long made me

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:32.871 position:50% align:center
realize how much you mean to me.

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:37.000 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
Sakura! It's gonna be so great!

00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
I'm back!

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.171 position:50% align:center
I missed you so much!

00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:43.131 position:50% align:center
And that's when
Mitsuba crushed them!

00:23:43.214 --> 00:23:45.008 position:50% align:center
Actually, I don't think
I ever touched them.

00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:48.345 position:50% align:center
But still.
Sounds kinda exhausting.

00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:49.971 position:50% align:center
Some tea will help you relax.

00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:51.389 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you.

00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:53.141 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
What if I wanted some tea, too?

00:23:53.224 --> 00:23:55.518 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Who's that?

00:23:57.979 --> 00:24:00.190 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
Looks like they're multiplying.
