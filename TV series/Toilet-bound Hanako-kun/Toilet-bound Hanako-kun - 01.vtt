[SCHOOLGIRL A]
Hey, come here. 

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.272 position:50% align:center
Have you heard the rumors?

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
About the school's
Seven Wonders?

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.193 position:50% align:center
You really haven't?

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh,
well where do I start?

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you the most
famous one first.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
It's the seventh of
the Seven Wonders:

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
Hanako, the Bathroom Ghost.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.125 position:50% align:center
She's on the third floor
of the old building.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
In the third stall
in the girls' bathroom.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
You can go there and
summon her right now

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
if you want!

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
She'll grant you any wish--
no matter what it is!

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center
But she'll take something
precious from you in exchange,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
and you won't know
what it is until it's too late.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.400 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
To call her, knock three times.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
And then say...

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.366 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hanako, Hanako, Hanako.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:15.867 position:50% align:center
Are you in there?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.383 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Hello...

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center
[NENE sighs]

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.311 position:50% align:center
Okay. Hearing things.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
You summoned me?

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.856 position:50% align:center
[NENE whimpers]

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
[NENE gasps]
No!

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.533 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO laughs]

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.493 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
That sounds like a boy.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:01:59.911 position:50% align:center
What's the matter with you?

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.040 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I can see right through him.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.209 position:50% align:center
Such an old uniform.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.794 position:50% align:center
Those look like orbs.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:09.713 position:50% align:center
Are... are you a ghost?

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.381 position:50% align:center
I prefer "apparition."

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.011 position:50% align:center
Or "the seventh of the Seven
Wonders of the School,

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
Hanako, the Bathroom Ghost."

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.473 position:50% align:center
I'm delighted to meet you.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Wait. Are you saying
you're Hanako?

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You rang?

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I'm not stupid!

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
Then where's your bob haircut
and red jump-skirt?

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
Well uh, that's not really
the look I'm into these days.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
These days?

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
Anyway, mind telling
me who you are?

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.
You look like a boy.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
That's because I am a boy.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
Believe me, I'm just as
bothered about that inaccuracy

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
as you are, but the rest
of what you've heard

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
is true.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50% align:center
I will grant your wish
and collect a payment

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
that I see as fit.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
So what is your wish?

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
Please don't tell me
you came here unprepared.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
Why are you in here?

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
What kind of pervy
ghost chooses to haunt

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
the girls' bathroom?

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Okay, we're done.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I take it back!

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
You can haunt any
bathroom you'd like,

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
and I think it's cool
that you're a boy!

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
You think I'm cool?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
In that case, tell me your
name and what it is you wish!

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
He got over that fast.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
My name's Nene Yashiro,
and I'm a first year in class A!

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
My wish is that the guy
I'm crushing on

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
will like me back
as much as I like him!

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
Yashiro.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Got it, and you're asking
for your love to be returned.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
What's the guy's name?

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Everybody calls him Minamoto!

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
He's a second year,
and way smart.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
He's that guy who's so cool
but still nice to everyone!

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
One time I dropped my pencil
case and he picked it up for me.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
Easy enough.
Consider your wish granted!

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
Wait, how does the
wish-granting thing work

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.569 position:50% align:center
from the toilet stall?

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
Do you use a special
item or something?

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
I do.
The one I carry works wonders.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Will you show it to me?

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Voila.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Hear me out.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
If I use my power to help you,

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
we'll have to do
an equivalent exchange.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
And if I'm making a
human heart do something

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
that's not natural, the price
is going to reflect that.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.593 position:50% align:center
Trust me, this is much safer.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
Hold on, what if I'm
okay with any price?

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
Oh, are you?

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
I'd say sorry, I don't have
tools that advanced!

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
You were bluffing?

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
But... Maybe I should try it.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
I mean, he's a ghost
who grants wishes.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
He must know some tricks.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
I can't be the first person
to ask for help

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
in the love department.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
"Method number 78.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50% align:center
Find creative ways to
impress him with your skills."

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center
Let's show you off.
What are your talents?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
Where are we?

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
The best place I could think of
to show what I can do.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
The school's student garden.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
I'm a Garden Club superstar!

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
Why are you looking
at me like that?

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
I can grow flowers too, ya know!
I'm feminine and delicate!

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
That's why I joined.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
A boy I once liked said
he was only attracted

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
to girly girls, and I noticed
there were lots of them

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
in the Garden Club.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
I was also learning
how to cook and sew

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
at the same time.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
I figured once I mastered
all three skills,

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
I'd tell him how I felt.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
How long did you like him?

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
[NENE] Since right after
I started junior high.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center
I only told him how
I felt last month.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
It took me three years
to do it. But...

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
[NENE'S CRUSH]
Hold on.

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
You're saying you like me?
Do I even know you?

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
Creepy.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
Sorry, you're just not my type.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
I'm not into thick daikon legs.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Daikon legs. Daikon. Daikon.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
But that was a month ago!

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
I'm completely over it
and I'm a completely different

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
person now!

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
I don't believe you.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Well, you should!

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
I am totally obsessed
with someone else now!

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
Once that guy sees that
someone like Minamoto

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
loves me back, he'll regret
ever turning me down!

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Is that so? 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
So, anyone'd do?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
No, Mister Smarty Pants!

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
I want Minamoto!
Don't pull any funny stuff.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center
You sure? Because something
tells me you don't know

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
very much about this guy.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
Then answer this question:
what's his full name?

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Oh, look how big this worm is.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
Bet Mr. Carp would
like to eat that.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
That's what I thought. 

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
A blank gift tag?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
Write a sweet message,
then give it to your boy

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
with something you grew!

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.953 position:50% align:center
I call this move
Operation Present!

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Creative title.

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.582 position:50% align:center
I've tried things like this
before. I need magic--

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.710 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] But you haven't tried
exactly this on this day,

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
have you?

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
Make the most of
what you have now.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:30.176 position:50% align:center
Let your hard work
work for you.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
Okay! Let Operation
Present begin!

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Yay!

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.688 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I still think writing
down everything I feel

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
would be too much.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.275 position:50% align:center
Hey, I think you
dropped your pencils.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I'll tell him thank you
for picking up my pencil box

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hanako?

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] I've got everything
ready for you.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
Hope you like it.

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hope I like what?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
What happened to me?

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Ta-da!

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh? What?!

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
Why am I a fish?
Is this a nightmare?

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:22.107 position:50% align:center
Oh, good.
I knew she would love it!

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I don't!

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
I tried to tell you.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
There's a price for everything.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
Eating the scales put you
under the Mermaid's curse.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
All the fish are her servants,
so that explains your look.

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
And the fact that
only you ate one.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
If you had convinced
someone else to swallow

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
a scale with you,
then the curse would've been

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
split between the two of you.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
Most people under
her spell aren't turned

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
into fish completely.

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
You still would've had some
fishlike traits, however.

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh...

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
The thing is,

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
only the person who
consumes the Mermaid's scale

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
is affected.

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
The reason they're called
matchmaking charms

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
is because people
under the same curse

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
will share a special bond
with one another.

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
You didn't give this to him.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
[NENE] When I thought
about what love means,

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
I realized that's not how
I felt about Minamoto.

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
You were right.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
I wanted someone "like"
him to want me back,

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
but it could have been anyone.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
I just wanted love.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize it until now,

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
after I've caused
all this trouble.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
I'm the worst.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID]
Well, well, isn't that tragic?

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Wh-What's happening?

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID] Humans truly are
the most foolish creatures.

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
But I've brought you
a reason to celebrate!

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
From this moment on,
you will be serving me!

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
I'll be so good to you.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
You don't need anyone else.

00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
Look who's here. Hello.

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.234 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID laughs]

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]
That fish has a face!

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
That fish is the mermaid.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
And it looks like she's ready
to collect you as her servant.

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
But I'm not done with you.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
So, she'll have to wait.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID]
Move out of the way, kid!

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Hanako!

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID]
How adorably pathetic!

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
The little School Wonder
boy thought he could

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.467 position:50% align:center
best my powers and
millennia of experience!

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID]
Come to mommy.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Please hold on a second.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID]
Hmm?

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] I haven't had a
chance to grant the girl's wish

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
for summoning me.

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.896 position:50% align:center
Let me finish my work,
I'll then leave you to yours?

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID]
Silence!

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare presume
to command me!

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
I didn't. I asked.

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
But now...

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
...I have no choice
but to use force.

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
[NENE gasps]

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID]
Such audacity!

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID gasps]

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
[MERMAID]
I've been hit!

00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
And by a feeble apparition
barely a few decades old!

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center
Curse you, School Wonder!

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
Score! Catch of the day!

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
She's gone back
to her realm for now.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
She's pretty persistent, though.
So we'll see her again.

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:24.456 position:50% align:center
But at least we've bought
ourselves some time

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
to plan our next move.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
[NENE] I don't want to
go through that again!

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
Can you keep her away?

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
I just can't spend my life with
that awful angry sea witch!

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
This is all because
I wanted a boy to like me.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO chuckles]

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
Humans love ghost stories.

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
But they don't take them
seriously until someone 

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
gets cursed.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
You think every spell
will work in your favor.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
I begged you not to eat
that scale, didn't I?

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50% align:center
You did it anyway.

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:56.029 position:50% align:center
I also urged you not
to use this on your crush.

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
You listened.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
Which means I can
still grant you a wish.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Do you want to be human again?

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
If that's your wish,
I'll grant it.

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
Although, there
will still be a price.

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Oh. What kind of price?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
Well, you know I can't
say until it's done,

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
but I will keep your life
as normal as possible.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
Do you want to risk it?

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.216 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Yes, please turn me back!

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
I wish to be human again!
I understand there's a price!

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
Just get me out of here
as soon as possible!

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:23.264 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
You got it. It's done.

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
As for how you'll
be paying me back,

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
you'll use your body.

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What?

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
--[water splashes]
--[NENE yells]

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
As promised,

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
I'll minimize the curse's
effects on you.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
You and I have now been
linked across the border

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
between this life and the next.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
It's time to pay.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
I want...

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
...a solid work ethic.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh?

00:20:58.216 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Wow, what a relief!

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking this
would be so much easier

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
if I had a human assistant!

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
What'd you think I meant?

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
Yashiro, you dirty daikon!

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
You're hurt?

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
I'm not supposed to be
able to touch you.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
We share a bond now,
and therefore we're linked,

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:17.652 position:50% align:center
like I said.

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:19.863 position:50% align:center
You know, the least you
could do is go easy on me

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
after I granted you
an additional wish.

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.117 position:50% align:center
What extra wish?

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
You did say that you
wanted somebody

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
to share your feelings,
didn't you?

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
Well, now that we've
entered into a bond,

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'll share
all sorts of things.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.969 position:50% align:center
Um, that's kinda stretching it.

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.556 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
That's how we met.

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.017 position:50% align:center
And where it all began.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center
I became friends with a ghost
boy in an empty classroom

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
as he held my hands by
the red rays of twilight.

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] Oh, by the way,
you should let those dry.

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
The moisture makes them flare.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.241 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
[NENE screams]

00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:17.629 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Do you ever
wonder where the things

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
we've forgotten end up?

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:21.216 position:50% align:center
Forgotten moments or souls?

00:22:23.718 --> 00:22:27.764 position:50% align:center
If we don't remember them,
does that mean they're gone?

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:31.643 position:50% align:center
Or, are they still here
in a new form,

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:34.270 position:50% align:center
desperate for us to notice them?

00:22:39.734 --> 00:22:42.195 position:50% align:center
Has anyone out there
heard this story?

00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.698 position:50% align:center
The one about Yousei.
