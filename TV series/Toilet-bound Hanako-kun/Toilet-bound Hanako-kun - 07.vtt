[HANAKO]
Riddle me this, Yashiro.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.022 position:50% align:center
Why have you been
acting so weird lately?

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Huh?

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.025 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Huh?

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Have I? I don't feel different.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
Your reactions have
seemed out of character.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Go! Clean!

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
[NENE] When Cinderella's
family forced her to live a life

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
of servitude, she got
a prince at the end.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
And what do I get?

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.125 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] You don't even grumble
while you clean anymore.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
And isn't that better for you?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
No! You used to make me laugh.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
[NENE groans]

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.549 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO groans]

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
You don't even look
at me anymore!

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.305 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Ow! Ow! Ow! Okay!

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.973 position:50% align:center
I'm looking at you!
I'm looking at you!

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.016 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Thank you.

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Let go! Your hands are so cold!

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
The truth is, he's right.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.499 position:50% align:center
I have been acting weird.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
It's just that after learning
about Hanako's past

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
in the Four O'clock Library,
I see him differently.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
I haven't been able to
look him in the eye since.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
Bye-bye!

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I hate feeling awkward.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
[DUDES]
Heave-ho!

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.314 position:50% align:center
[NENE] But it doesn't mean
something's wrong with me!

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
The things I saw
in the library felt so real!

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
Like they were
actually happening!

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
Not just a memory!

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.867 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what I'm
gonna do about today.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to clean
the bathroom,

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
but I'm not ready
to face Hanako yet.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Shut the barn door!

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
Nene Yashiro's workin'
in the fields?

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
I always wondered who
made it look so good!

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.257 position:50% align:center
Um, wha--?
Why are you here?

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
It's just unexpected.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
Oh, did Hanako
send you to get me?

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
Bathroom duty time already?

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
Nah.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
I actually wanted
to ask you for a favor.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
What is it?

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
Don't laugh.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
But, um, do you know
how to make donuts?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me?

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
Donuts!

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE B]
Doo nuts!

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE C]
Nut dough!

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Oh, man!

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you
know how to cook.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
Mad respect!

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
I tried to make something
with my brother once.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
But let's just say it
didn't go as planned.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
I kinda made a food-splosion.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
Ya think?

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
[KOU] PS, I talked to our Potty
Pal earlier and guess what?

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
He said not to worry about
your toilet maid duties today.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Really? Thank you!

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
Well. Guess we should
start cleaning up?

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Cool!

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
By the way.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
Why'd you want donuts?

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, good question!

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
I, uh... I have a little sister.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
And she wanted some donuts.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
It was pretty random,
but what are ya gonna do, right?

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
I didn't want to say no,
so I got this room,

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50% align:center
and then, I asked you.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
Um... I'm sorry for
the short notice!

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
No worries at all!

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
I was honestly kinda grateful
when you asked me.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
I needed to take a break.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
I've felt a little awkward
around Hanako lately.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
Not awkward like we had
a fight or like he did

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
something inappropriate!

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
I just feel uncomfortable
around him right now

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
and it could totally just be me!

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Stop that.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
It says to be gentle, see?

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.818 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Yeah, that's better.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center
I thought he said
he couldn't cook?

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
It can get pretty
exhausting, can't it?

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
Suddenly being able to see
things that have always

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
been there but that
you never could before.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
I mean, I've always been
able to see them,

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
but it still freaks
me out sometimes.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:37.671 position:50% align:center
Anyway, if you need
to vent to someone

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.005 position:50% align:center
who gets it, I'm here.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not always
here-here, but you know.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
I'm on your side no matter what.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.513 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Kou, but um...

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
Could you back off?

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean it like that!

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
It's just a bad habit I have
from cooking with my sister.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
Not that I cook!

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE A]
He's covered in poison!

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE B]
Is he dying?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
[MOKKE C]
He died.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
I'm not dead, you pink jerks!

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
[NENE giggles]

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Kou.
I appreciate it.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center
There is something
I've had on my mind.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
I'd love to have
your opinion on it.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
That cool?

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Shoot!

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I see.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
And you got that from
the Four O'clock Library?

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
So then...

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
He used to be a student
here back in the day.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
And I was thinking maybe
I shouldn't, you know.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
Maybe I shouldn't try so hard
to stay friends with him.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
It's getting way
too complicated.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
Besides.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
You can't really be friends
with someone who's dead!

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I see your point.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.578 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
He's an evil spirit!

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
That's what a School Wonder is!

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
And he's... he's a murderer!

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
I'm sure of it!

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
It looked like someone
was bullying him.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
I bet he stabbed them with
that knife he carries around!

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
I've always known something
was off about him

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
and he could be scary at times,

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
but this is even heavier
than I imagined!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
It's too much!

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.430 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO sneezes]

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
I don't know what to do.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to act
around him knowing all that?

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
What do I say?
I can't handle it!

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
One thing at a time!

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
Try to calm down.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
But, then...

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
I can't stop.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
I still want to talk to him.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
I have so many questions,
and I would never want to pry.

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
But I can't help it.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
I want to know more about him

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
and what happened
to make him do that.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
And even though there's
probably nothing I can do,

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
I want to help him in some way.

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
Even if he is a ghost
and a murderer.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
[cries]
It's so confusing.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to do.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
I'm with you there.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
That struggle is way too real.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
I was constantly
questioning whether or not

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
I should exorcise him,
and based on what,

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.566 position:50% align:center
"What's the right thing to do?" 

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
So I decided that instead
of looking for what is right,

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
I'll make up my mind
about what it is I want.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
Seems like it's
hard for you, too.

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
Which means neither one
of us has the right answer.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
So let's figure
it out together.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.376 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Aw, yeah! They're finally done!

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center

[KOU] I know you think I'm
weak because I've never

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center

I'll exorcise him
if I have to, okay?

But I'm not like you.

a student tomorrow

and there isn't a reason?

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
Then I'll just have to keep
a closer eye on him

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm here--

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Don't touch me.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO]
'Kay. I'm sorry.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Guess who's back! Hi!

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
[NATSUHIKO screams]

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
Kind of a creepy wardrobe
choice, don't you think?

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.150 position:50% align:center
Oh, is it?

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.526 position:50% align:center
Heh! Come on.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
I hadn't seen him in so long,
I had to celebrate!

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] You went out of your
way to match your brother?

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:56.785 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
He actually seemed
happy to see me!

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Sounds like a fun time.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA laughs]

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
I'm still not moving too great
for some reason

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
and had to take off right away.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:10.507 position:50% align:center
So tell me, Sakura.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
What tasty rumors
are on the menu tonight?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
How about...

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
Has anyone out there
heard this story?

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.275 position:50% align:center
[YOKOO] Can't believe
you haven't heard this.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
Lately, it seems like
everyone's been saying

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
they're seeing it right
by the school entrance.

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
What are they seeing?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
[YOKOO]
A ghost! An evil one!

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
You'll be changing shoes, right?

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
Then suddenly something
grabs your arm.

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center
You turn around
and it's there like...

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
Cut it out!
You're not funny, Satou!

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
What?
I didn't do anything, dude.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.965 position:50% align:center
'Kay? So then...

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Have you forgotten me already?

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
How disappointing.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
[GROUP whimpers]

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
[GROUP screams]

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
There you freakin' are!

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center
Eat this!

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
[KOU grunts]

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:15.155 position:50% align:center
The rumors were like,
nerdy-percent accurate,

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
give or take.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
I got you!

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
Huh? A uniform?

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
Was he a student here?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Can I ask you something?

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Sure.

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
[NENE]
Never mind.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
[NENE] For the most part,
he's acting normal again.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
Except, he won't talk
to me about yesterday.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
It seems like he's pretending
nothing ever happened.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
So I guess that's
what I should do, too.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.287 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Hanako, are you in there?

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA whimpers]

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy!

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
An obnoxious evil spirit I
caught harassing students

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
at the junior high entrance!

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO]
Hmm.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
Well aren't you going
to exorcise him?

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
Yeah... I kinda gave
that reckless life up.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
I just thought there might
be a more spiritually

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
humane way to work
things out, okay?

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO] You could warm
a dead man's heart.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
Well, he's here because
he has regrets,

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.323 position:50% align:center
isn't that right?

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
Seems like that would be
the best place to start.

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
Oh, snap, that's brilliant!

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
That'll solve
everything instantly!

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
Come on, spirit!

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
Let's get rid of those regrets!

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA yells]

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
Should we go with them
just in case?

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
No, they'll be fine.

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
I would advise you to keep
your distance in general,

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
but it's not that dangerous now,

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
and if something
unexpected were to happen,

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
you'll be okay.

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
It would just require
a little extra work.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
Here goes.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center
He doesn't look
very intimidating.

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.659 position:50% align:center
I'm probably safe
to rough him up a bit.

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA yelps]

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
Start spitting up every
regret you've ever had

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
and don't be a loser about it!

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.499 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
That hurts!

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.335 position:50% align:center
Let's crush those miserable
soul weights

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
so you can pass
onto better planes

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
and dimensions, homie!

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:39.924 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA]
Shut up.

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
Huh?

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
That lame-ass earring you're
wearing is full of lies.

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.390 position:50% align:center
Traffic safety my ass!

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
Where's all the traffic
your face is patrolling?

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.144 position:50% align:center
Was there a crash
in your brain, genius?

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
Take yourself for a spin
and drop dead!

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
What?

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:56.149 position:50% align:center
You saw how weak
and helpless I am

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:59.110 position:50% align:center
and just had to have your
way with me, didn't you?

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center
You're a monster!
A ghost predator!

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
And a demented dumbass!

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
I know exactly
how your kind thinks!

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:05.992 position:50% align:center
You see a cute, fragile ghost
and you instantly want

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:07.327 position:50% align:center
to stomp on our purity!

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.121 position:50% align:center
Your mind is filled
with violence and porn!

00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
You can't fool me, sicko!

00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:12.832 position:50% align:center
I know you want to
film me with your phone

00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:14.834 position:50% align:center
in all kinds of lewd
and compromising positions

00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:16.169 position:50% align:center
and then use it
as blackmail to get me

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.213 position:50% align:center
to do your bidding,
morning, noon, and night,

00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:20.131 position:50% align:center
like some kinda
personal porn star.

00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:21.466 position:50% align:center
[KOU]
That's not what--

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:23.968 position:50% align:center
[MITSUBA] I don't want to
be in your porn, okay?!
