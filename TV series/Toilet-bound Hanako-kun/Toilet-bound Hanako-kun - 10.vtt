It's the third of

There's a different world
on the other side

of any mirror,
where another mirror

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
will show you the
truth inside the heart

of anyone who wanders in.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
But here's the catch.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
If your heart is pure,
brave, and kind,

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
your experience will be quick,

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.750 position:50% align:center
and you can go back
to your own world.

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
If it's not, if there's even
the slightest bit

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
of fear in your heart,
the mirror will reflect it

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
and suddenly you'll find
yourself in some horrible hell.

telling me when I started

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
going to school here
that if I felt scared

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center

a little too much.

what they fear or

its strength changes

If I rush in blindly,

I could end up making
it much stronger.

It doesn't show anything for me.

Maybe because I'm a ghost.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
Or it could be that I don't
have any memories

Or my death, either.

[NENE] Oh! Well, since this

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center

That's the <i>Yorishiro</i> ?

I told you it wasn't
gonna be easy, didn't I?

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, there are
stairs to reach the top.
