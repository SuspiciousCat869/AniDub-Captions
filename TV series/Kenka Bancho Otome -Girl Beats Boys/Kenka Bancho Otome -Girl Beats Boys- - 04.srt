1
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,041
I'm not interested in fighting.

2
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,458
It's pointless.

3
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,125
[HINAKO]
Konparu.

4
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,291
You coward!

5
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:02,833
Huh...?

6
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,875
Give back my brother!

7
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,708
[HINAKO]
Your brother?

8
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,625
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,708
I'm here because I got this
letter of challenge from you.

10
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,125
[KONPARU] You're the
one who sent a letter,

11
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,416
you sorry son of a bitch.

12
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,583
[HINAKO]
Huh?

13
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,541
This doesn't make any sense.

14
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,041
[KONPARU]
Don't play dumb!

15
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,458
You've tried to pick a fight
with me every day for weeks.

16
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,500
What? You resort to kidnapping
when you don't get your way?

17
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,625
Bastard!

18
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,333
Just how rotten are you?

19
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,625
What? Kidnapping?

20
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,166
Look man, you're
confused or something.

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,541
Hikaru doesn't roll like that.

22
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,250
Now, are you gonna
fight him or keep babbling?

23
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,833
[GOON LEADER]
Hey, Boss!

24
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,416
[TOTOMARU, HINAKO]
Hmm?

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,750
Don't worry!

26
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,333
We picked up Konparu's
little brat of a brother,

27
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,375
like you said!

28
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,416
[MINORU muffled cries]

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Minoru!

30
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,541
[gasps]
I know that boy!

31
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,583
Wait, seriously?

32
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,250
[GOONS laugh]

33
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,958
[HINAKO] I-I met him on the
way to school the other day.

34
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,750
But those other guys...?

35
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,958
Whatever goes down here,
I got your back, Bro.

36
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,625
I trust you wouldn't stoop to
pulling dirty tricks like that.

37
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,708
Totomaru.

38
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,833
Don't worry, Minoru!

39
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,208
I'll get you out of this!

40
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,666
[GOON LEADER]
Whoa, now.

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,375
One more step and the brat
will have a permanent smile.

42
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,958
Better cool it.

43
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,958
[KONPARU grunts]

44
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,625
You sick, demented psychopath!

45
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,291
What kind of monster
threatens a child

46
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,500
just so they can
have a street fight?

47
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,750
[HINAKO] This is a
misunderstanding, I swear!

48
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,958
[gasps]

49
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,708
[HINAKO]
Mm.

50
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,541
If you want a fight,
you've got one pal!

51
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,958
[KONPARU]
You won't get away with this!

52
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,333
I swear, by the time
I'm done with you.

53
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,916
You'll be crippled!

54
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,166
[KONPARU]
At the time,

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,625
Minoru was in danger,
so I just sorta lost it.

56
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,291
Thinking back to that day,

57
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,625
Hikaru was just trying
to talk some sense into me,

58
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,125
so he was slow
to react, at first.

59
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,916
All right.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,708
Guess I have to do this.

61
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,125
[HINAKO]
Yeah. I realized...

62
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,458
...if I wanted any hope of
getting through to Konparu,

63
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,916
I'd have to snap him out
of it with a few punches.

64
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,541
[gasps]

65
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,291
Huh...?

66
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,291
Now, will you listen, Konparu?

67
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,666
I had nothing to do
with the kidnapping.

68
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,208
Just the thought of doing
something like that

69
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,250
turns my stomach.

70
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,125
I could never--

71
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,916
You're still acting innocent?

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,916
Stop, I don't buy it!

73
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,083
Just leave him alone!

74
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,375
[gasps]

75
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,833
[HINAKO]
Konparu...

76
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,416
[MINORU]
Big Bro!

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,000
[KONPARU]
Huh? Minoru?

78
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,375
[GOONS groan]

79
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,416
[KONPARU]
Thank goodness.

80
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,750
Are you okay?

81
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,166
I'm so sorry.

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,125
I wasn't there.

83
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,833
[MINORU]
I... I can't breathe.

84
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh! Oops.

85
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,000
[MINORU]
That's him, Bro!

86
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,250
Huh?

87
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,916
He's the cute boy that helped me

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,166
when those bullies tried
to take my lunch money!

89
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,333
He was just as cool then, too!

90
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,333
Isn't he awesome?

91
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,916
[KONPARU]
That was you?

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,250
[MINORU]
Thanks, cute boy!

93
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,333
I owe you!

94
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,416
No. Really!

95
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,250
[chuckles]

96
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,291
[KONPARU]
Sorry about this.

97
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,083
Huh?

98
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,250
[TOTOMARU]
Hm?

99
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,208
I was in the wrong here.

100
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,708
I threw punches
without thinking.

101
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,916
I'm ashamed of myself.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,875
I was angry.

103
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,166
You didn't deserve any of this.

104
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,750
Hey, I get it.

105
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,250
I mean, I've been trying to pick
a fight with you for so long.

106
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,708
I'm just sorry your
brother got involved.

107
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,458
[KONPARU]
I don't get it.

108
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,458
Why would those guys
do this in the first place?

109
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,666
[TOTOMARU]
Who knows?

110
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,166
Maybe they thought,
if you two duked it out,

111
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,125
you'd destroy each other.

112
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,875
Freakin' cowards.

113
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,166
[HINAKO]
Hmm...

114
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,208
[TOTOMARU]
Hm?

115
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,250
[KONPARU]
I learned a lot about you today.

116
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,541
Huh?

117
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,458
Not only are you
incredibly strong,

118
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,833
but you've got a kind heart
and look out for the weak,

119
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,041
like you've done
for my little brother.

120
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,583
After all this,

121
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,875
I think you'd make a great
leader for the first-years.

122
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,041
Do you mean that?

123
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,000
I do.

124
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,208
And, you'll have
my full support,

125
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,208
Hikaru Onigashima.

[HINAKO]
Thank you, Konparu.

[TOTOMARU chuckles]

129
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,958
Hell yeah!

130
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,833
All our problems just
flew out the window!

131
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,958
Hikaru's at the
top of the first-years,

132
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,166
and Headphones is a
bonified member of the gang.

133
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,791
Uh... I didn't agree to that.

134
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,125
Sure.

135
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,291
Gah, you're annoying.

136
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,125
Huh? Hikaru?

137
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,125
What's up?

138
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,125
[HINAKO]
Nothing!

00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,666
