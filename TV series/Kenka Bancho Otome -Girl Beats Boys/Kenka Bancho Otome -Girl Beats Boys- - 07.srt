Friends, huh?

00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,500
So much for that.

00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,500
[HINAKO]
Can you help me Kira?

5
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,458
It's about Yuta Mirako.

6
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,583
I thought you might
have the answer.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
You know him, right?

8
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,583
Then tell me, why does he
hate friendship so much?

9
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,666
Know what?

10
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,708
You sound like Rintaro
when you talk like that.

11
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,083
I'll say this once.

12
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,875
It's got nothing to do with you.

13
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,625
[HINAKO]
True.

14
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,958
It's just I feel like
I should do something.

15
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,875
He seems so sad.

16
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,458
I want to help him.

[KIRA gasps]

18
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,541
[HINAKO] I think I understand
what he's feeling.

19
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,750
The loneliness and the hurt.

20
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:07,375
Because for a time, I felt
the same way that he does.

[cries]

22
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,625
I'm really glad I asked Kira.

23
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,875
What he said after that was
more than enough to motivate me.

24
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,416
Tomorrow?

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,583
Sure, I got nothin'
better to do.

26
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,000
You owe me, Hikaru.

27

Tomorrow, we train
for the whole damn day!

28

My wonderfully accepting friends
were gracious enough to help me.

Sorry, fellas. No autographs.

Do we look like your
loser fans, pretty boy?

Don't make me laugh.

52
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,666
The thought of a punk
pretending to be an idol

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,875
makes me wanna puke.

54
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,208
It's pathetic.

broadcast nationally.

Right!

[KIRA] Mirako used to
be a good-natured guy.

89
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,916
He cared a lot
about his friends.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,083
In middle school
he started to rise up,

91
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,625
and he trusted them to back him.

92
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,000
But then, one day,

93
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,250
his friends betrayed that trust.

94
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,541
It taught him that comradery,
like being top of the school,

95
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,708
meant next to nothing.

96
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,583
[KIRA]
After that, he saw friendship

97
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,750
between guys as a fantasy.

98
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,583
A game of pretend
that led to regret.
