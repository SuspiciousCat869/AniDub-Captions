1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,333
[HINAKO]
I don't know why, but...

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:13,291
...I never noticed how
beautiful cherry blossoms were.

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,416
Not until that day, at least.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,791
[HINAKO]
I guess.

5
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,958
I didn't pay attention to them?

6
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,458
They were easy to ignore?

7
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,958
Or maybe it's because...

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:28,875
...before that day,
I always held my head low.

9
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,708
Because, somewhere inside,

10
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:35,000
I felt deeply isolated
from the rest of the world.

11
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,958
But that day was different.

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,416
[HINAKO]
That day.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,833
I felt like anything
was possible.

14
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,541
Like I could
become someone else.

15
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,875
[HIKARU] I'm supposed
to go to Shishiku Academy,

16
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,416
but instead, you'll go there.

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,375
And you'll rise to the top!

18
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,375
There's a rumor goin' around.

19
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,708
Something about
the new first-years.

20
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,208
Hell yeah, I heard that.

21
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,083
They got a few badasses.

22
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,083
Like Totomaru Minowa
and Konparu Takayuki.

23
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,833
They used to own Middle School.

24
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,666
Sure, they're tough.
But they might as well be

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,000
preschoolers compared
to the other guy.

26
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,333
Yeah, no joke.

27
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,958
Name's Onigashima.

28
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,083
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

29
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,458
[ALL 4] He's Houou
Onigashima's little brother!

30
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,625
[HIKARU]
If this is a miracle.

31
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,041
Then we should
make good use of it.

32
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,208
I know!

33
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,291
You'll go to Shishiku's
entrance ceremony

34
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,666
and join the class in my place.

35
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,250
[YANKEE A]
Hold up, Konparu!

36
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,583
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

37
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,875
Put em' up.

38
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,333
[KONPARU]
Fight you?

39
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,000
[YANKEE B grunts]

40
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,375
Screw that.

41
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,125
You clowns aren't
even worth the effort.

42
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,250
[YANKEE A]
Coward!

43
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,833
Say that to my face!

44
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,416
[YANKEE B] Run while you can.
It'll happen sooner or later.

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,333
[YANKEE A] The top
spot's ours, you got that?

46
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,750
Fine, s'all yours.

47
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,625
I don't give a damn.

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,083
[HINAKO]
Huh?

49
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,708
[YANKEE B]
Tsch! Let's bounce.

50
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,291
[YANKEE A]
Yeah.

51
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,375
What the heck
did I get myself into?

52
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,625
[HINAKO]
Huh?!

53
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,833
[HINAKO] I stared at the
brawl for the longest time

54
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,500
and still couldn't
believe it was happening.

55
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,583
Oh, sorry. Excuse me!

56
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,291
So, uh, what exactly
is going on here?

57
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,708
[YANKEE C] Huh?
The hell kinda question is tha--

58
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,750
[YANKEE D]
We're dueling one-on-one

59
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,541
to see who becomes the boss!

60
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,833
Dueling?

61
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,708
I see.

62
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,958
What about the
entrance ceremony?

63
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,125
[YANKEE D] This is the
entrance ceremony, dumbass!

64
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,541
[HINAKO]
Uh...

65
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,375
[YANKEE D] Wanna get in
on the action, short stuff? Huh?

66
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,166
[HINAKO]
Huh?

67
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,708
[YANKEE D]
Ow!

68
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,791
[TOTOMARU] Don't talk a big game
if you ain't got the guts

69
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,083
to take on a real challenge.

70
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,583
[HINAKO]
Huh?

71
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,583
[TOTOMARU] I'm a first-year
student in the Violet Class.

72
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,583
Name's Totomaru Minowa.

73
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,250
Terror of Samejima.

74
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,708
That ring a bell?
If not, you'll learn it.

75
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,125
[TOTOMARU] I'm gonna be
the boss of this sorry bunch.

76
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,958
If anybody's gotta problem,
they can complain to my fists!

77
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,500
Thanks for the save.
I appreci--

78
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,750
[YANKEE E]
Die!

79
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,666
[HINAKO]
After that, I learned

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,000
Shishiku Academy is home
to low-lives and scumbags.

81
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,750
Punks, who duke it out daily

82
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,208
to decide who'll be
the boss of the school.

83
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,875
The "entrance ceremony"
was just one example of this.

84
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,875
[TOTOMARU]
What a freakin' joke.

85
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,625
If any of those wimps
think they could be boss

86
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,958
after that beating, they're
even dumber than they look.

87
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,125
Though...

88
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,625
...I shouldn't brag
too much considering

89
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,375
my two biggest competitors
didn't even bother to show up.

90
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,583
Who're they?

91
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,083
For real?

92
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,166
Did you sign up for this school
by accident or something?

93
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,958
The place is a wolves' den.

94
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,416
Yeah, I've noticed.

95
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,916
Guess I'm pretty clueless.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,208
Uh? No kidding, dude.

97
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,166
I thought you seemed
kinda spacey before,

98
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,791
but you're a total airhead.

99
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,375
They'll eat you alive here.

100
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,041
How comforting.

101
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,166
Why don't you stick
with me for the time being?

102
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,333
Huh?

103
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,625
[TOTOMARU]
What?

104
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,625
I just hate seein' guys
like you get picked on.

105
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,458
Grinds my gears.

106
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,208
If you need help, say the word.

107
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,041
Wow.

108
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,916
Thanks, Totomaru.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
That reminds me,
I never got your name.

110
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,458
Ah. It's Hinako.

111
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,000
Sorry, I meant, Hikaru.

112
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,166
Hikaru Onigashima.

113
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,708
You said you're
in Violet Class, right?

114
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,875
I'm in there, too.

115
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,208
[grunts]

116
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,000
[TOTOMARU]
You're Hikaru Onigashima?

117
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,291
Uh. Yes?

118
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,166
That's a nasty trick,
actin' all weak

119
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,416
so other's will fight
your battles for you.

120
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,416
Now I'm really pissed off.

121
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,458
[HINAKO]
Huh?

122
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,166
You brought this on yourself.

123
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,083
[HINAKO]
Uh...

124
00:05:59,166 --> 00:05:59,875
Fight!

125
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,291
Wait!

126
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,916
[TOTOMARU] Quit dodging
and fight me for real!

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,458
Let's see who gets to the
reach the top of this school!

128
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,666
[gasps]

129
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,125
[HIKARU]
You understand?

130
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,875
You'll go to
Shishiku Academy in my place,

131
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,708
and you'll aim for the top spot!

132
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,333
Super simple!

133
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,125
[HINAKO]
Huh? But... I can't.

134
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,208
I mean... I'm a girl!

135
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,625
[HINAKO]
And just like that.

136
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,083
I realized how beautiful
cherry blossoms were.

137
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,291
And with it came
an incredible feeling.

138
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,250
In that moment,
I felt as if I really could

139
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,250
become a different
person entirely.

140
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,500
Yes.

141
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,500
That was the day I changed.

142
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,625
I lost the old me and
became Hikaru Onigashima.
