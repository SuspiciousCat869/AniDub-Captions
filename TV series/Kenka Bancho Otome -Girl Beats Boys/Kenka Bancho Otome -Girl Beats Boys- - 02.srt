1
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,125
[HARUO]
Hmm.

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,083
[HIKARU, HINAKO cry out]

3
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,166
[HINAKO]
Oh, no, are you okay?

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,125
[HIKARU moans]

5
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,000
[HARUO] I'm a doctor,
conveniently passing by.

6
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:25,833
Gracious!

7
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,500
This is a compound fracture!

8
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,916
Really? Can you
call 119 for him?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,208
[HIKARU]
Wait!

10
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,750
I was heading to my school's
entrance ceremony.

11
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,625
[HINAKO] I don't think you
should worry about that.

12
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:38,958
[HIKARU]
You don't understand.

13
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,166
My school is Shishiku Academy.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,416
[gasps]

15
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,916
You're me.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Uncanny.

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,708
Y'know. If this is a miracle,

18
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,958
then we have to
make good use of it!

19
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,416
Good use?

20
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,000
[HIKARU]
That's right!

21
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,458
Since I'm clearly too
injured to make it, you'll go

22
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:32,333
to the Shishiku Academy
entrance ceremony in my place.

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,291
Wait. Are you serious?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,958
Yes. Not a bad idea.

25
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,125
It could actually work.

26
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,291
Huh?

27
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,083
The Shishiku Academy
he's talking about

28
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,666
is a unique boy's school.

29
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,750
If he misses the ceremony, it's
grounds for immediate expulsion.

30
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,541
But if you were to
attend class in his place

31
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,583
for a little while--

32
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,916
Attend class?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,250
There's no way that would work.

34
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,791
I'd miss out on my own classes!

35
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,083
That won't be a problem.

36
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,958
I'll be going to
your school instead.

37
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,500
Huh?!

38
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,125
[HIKARU]
So don't sweat it.

39
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,875
Just go to Shishiku.

40
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,958
But... I can't.

41
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm a girl, and you're a...

42
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,750
Think this through.

43
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,958
If your actions get him
expelled, then you'll be

44
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,958
financially responsible for
his enormous medical bills.

45
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,875
More like gargantuan.

46
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,708
[HINAKO]
Uh...?

47
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,041
[HIKARU]
Guess it's settled.

48
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,416
For now, you'll go to
Shishiku Academy as a boy,

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,708
and you'll rise to
the top of the school!

50
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,000
Simple as pie!

51
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,875
[HINAKO]
You just added a condition!

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,916
[HIKARU] My name's Hikaru
Onigashima, by the way.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,375
But, starting today, that's
the name you'll be going by.

54
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,250
[HINAKO] Turns out.
That little "accident"

55
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,583
was actually staged to get me
to attend Shishiku Academy.

56
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,416
But that wasn't the half of it.

57
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,958
Sorry.

58
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,375
When the young boss gets
an idea, he stops listening.

59
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,791
[chuckles]
I do.

60
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,458
Young boss?

61
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,833
The surprises didn't stop there.

62
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,750
Uh... Wha... This is...

63
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,958
Uh-huh!

64
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,208
We had everything in
the orphanage shipped

65
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,875
to this apartment.

66
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,500
Get comfy, this is where
you're living from now on.

67
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,291
[HINAKO]
You must be joking!

68
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,583
[HIKARU]
Don't freak out.

69
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,791
We smoothed it over

70
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,125
with that Suzukaze place
you were staying in.

71
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,250
It's fine.

72
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,333
Huh?

73
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,083
It was so easy.
All I had to tell them

74
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,625
was that we were long-lost
twins, and presto!

75
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,000
I mean, look at us.

76
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,083
I don't think
there's anyone alive

77
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,458
who wouldn't think
we were siblings.

78
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,750
HUH?! Siblings?

79
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,583
No way!

80
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,666
Yep.

81
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,666
You and I are
practically family, now.

82
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,916
[HINAKO]
Uh...

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,208
[HIKARU]
And...

84
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,458
As the second son of
the Onigashima Group,

85
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,875
I have an obligation
to take the top spot

86
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,750
at Shishiku for my family.

87
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,875
Wait, are you... yakuza?

88
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,708
Jeez, are you gonna freak
out about everything?

89
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,083
Look... It's Onigashima
family policy.

90
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,125
Every son has to
attend Shishiku Academy,

91
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,500
take it over,

92
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,083
and make it a breeding
ground for future gangsters.

93
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,166
But I've suffered from illness
ever since I was a child.

94
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,958
[coughs]

95
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,125
And I doubt I could manage it.

96
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,625
[HIKARU] On the other hand,
you've been healthy

97
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,708
and studying various
martial arts all this time.

98
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,208
Conquering Shishiku
should be a breeze!

99
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,583
[HINAKO]
When I was growing up.

100
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,708
I didn't have anyone.

101
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,083
I was pretty much alone.

102
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,916
He was the first family
that I'd ever known.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,875
And before I realized it,

104
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,958
I'd agreed to help him.

105
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,958
Hey, did you hear the rumor?

106
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,833
Apparently, Totomaru
from Samejima

107
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,250
got his ass handed to him.

108
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,041
Hell yeah, he did!

109
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,250
That's what happens
when you take on

110
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,000
an Onigashima mano-a-mano!

111
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,125
[SAKUYA] Well, I think he lost
on purpose out of respect.

112
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,125
Hikaru didn't look
like much of a fighter.

113
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,583
[KENTA]
For real?

114
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,375
If that's true it means Hikaru's
status as number one is:

115
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,958
[ALL 4]
A lie!

116
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,166
Uh... 'Scuse me?

117
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,333
[TOTOMARU] Dammit!
I thought I was past this.

118
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,541
I mulled it over a
thousand times yesterday,

119
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,791
but I still can't
face the music.

120
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,375
Talk about lame, huh?

121
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,791
[HINAKO]
Not sure I follow.

122
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,708
[TOTOMARU sighs]

123
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,958
Really, dude?

124
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm tryin' to say you
beat me fair and square.

125
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,875
No other way to slice it.

126
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,291
I accept it.

127
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:28,916
No bull.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,458
It's the truth.

129
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,791
I respect your strength
and your skill as a fighter,

130
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,041
not to mention your family name.

131
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,041
[TOTOMARU] There's no
turning back at this point.

132
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,333
By beating me, you're now the
acting boss of the first-years.

133
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,833
I'll be your right hand.

134
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,083
If anyone challenges you,

135
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,666
I'll back you up with
everything I've got.

136
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,125
Hold on, Minowa.

137
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,916
I didn't mean to do that.

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500
Don't call me that.

139
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,250
"Totomaru" will do just fine.

140
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,000
[HINAKO]
Uh... Really?

141
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,250
Isn't that kind of
overly familiar?

142
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,291
Huh?

143
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,833
I don't think it's a big deal.

144
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,416
I mean, we're bros now.

145
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,416
Bros?

146
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
That means "friend," right?

147
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,125
Well, yeah, you punch it
out with a guy, and you're bros!

148
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,083
That means a lot to me.

149
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,208
Uh...

150
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,041
To... Totomaru.

151
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,166
Uh! Sure, whatever.

152
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,916
[TOTOMARU]
Y'know.

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,333
I used to dream 'bout takin'
over Shishiku Academy.

154
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,458
Well...

155
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,083
Until that fight, anyway.

156
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,458
It's frustrating.

157
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:40,083
But he's the real deal,
so I can't really complain.

158
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,458
Hikaru Onigashima is a badass.

159
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,625
I respect the hell out of him.

160
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,875
[gasps]

161
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,708
[KIRA]
You're unnaturally thin.

162
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,416
[gasps]

163
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,750
[KIRA]
