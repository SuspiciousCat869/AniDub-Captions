1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,250
[HOUOU]
Sorry about all this.

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,875
Seems like you've had
to look after the place

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,333
while I was gone.

4
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:16,291
Didn't mean to dump that on you.

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,500
With Oyamada gone and Mirako
busy with his little solo act--

6
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,291
[KIRA]
It's fine.

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,625
[HOUOU]
Hm?

8
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,666
[KIRA] You never asked me
to look after anything.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,958
And I haven't done
much along those lines.

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,500
So...

11
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,458
[HOUOU] Heh.
Glad you haven't changed.

12
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,416
[HOUOU]
Hm?

13
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,166
By the way, Hikaru,
you wanna hit the arcade?

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,458
Bet I could lick ya!

15
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,166
Huh?

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,250
Forget it.

17
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,250
Hikaru and I are
training this afternoon.

18
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,000
Um, did we plan that?

19
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:48,875
We just did.

20
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,500
Doesn't count!

21
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,500
Sorry! I can't today.

22
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,708
There's somewhere I gotta be.

23
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,125
Maybe next time?

24
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,875
Bye!

25
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:57,958
[KONPARU, TOTOMARU]
Huh?

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,625
So, uh... you wanna
go to the arcade?

27
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,416
I don't.

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,125
Hikaru used to hate
fighting so much,

29
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,458
I was worried this place
would eat him alive.

30
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,333
Looks like he's
getting along fine, though.

31
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,916
Glad I was wrong.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,916
Take a closer look, Houou.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,833
Are you sure that's
really your brother?

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,583
[HOUOU] The hell's
that supposed to mean?

35
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,125
[HINAKO]
I had to finish the paperwork

36
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,125
for leaving the orphanage.

37
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,000
So I went back to
Suzukaze one last time

38
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,291
to say goodbye to my childhood.

39
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,333
[HINAKO]
After all that time away,

40
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,666
seeing the director
again felt great.

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,208
His smile always
gave me comfort.

42
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,208
[HINAKO]
That night.

43
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,000
I went down
memory lane with him.

44
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:06,083
We talked about my
previous life and the new one.

45
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:10,166
But little did I know, our talk
would cause me so much trouble.

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,083
[DIRECTOR]
I'm still in shock over it.

47
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,666
I think I was more
surprised to find out

48
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,708
you had a long-lost twin brother
than you were, to be honest.

49
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,625
Though, don't get me wrong,
I am happy for you.

50
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,250
Come on, tell me about them!

51
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,041
Are things in the new home
going as well as you hoped?

52
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,375
Heh heh... I guess...

53
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,083
Your brother certainly seemed
like a kind young fellow.

54
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,666
Yeah, kind enough to kidnap
his own flesh and blood.

55
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,666
[DIRECTOR]
Hm?

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,500
Uh, nothing, don't listen to me.

57
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,083
You're happy and healthy,
that's all that matters.

58
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,041
So, how are things
going at the new school?

59
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,583
Uh...

60
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,708
[DIRECTOR] You were so excited
about being accepted there.

61
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,916
Is it fun?

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,583
Yeah.

63
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,708
It's a great time!

64
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,458
I made some new friends,
and we fight a lot.

65
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,041
Living the teenage dream.

66
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,208
You fight?

67
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,791
[HINAKO]
Ah! No, I mean, martial arts!

68
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,166
I joined the school club!

69
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,583
Gotta practice
every day, you know?

70
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,416
See? Nothing harmful!

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,958
It's just sparing!

72
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,291
It doesn't surprise me.

73
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,916
From the moment we started
teaching self-defense,

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,333
you loved it!

75
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,958
Of all the kids we've had here,

76
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,500
you were by far
the most motivated.

77
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,250
I was? Really?

78
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,875
[DIRECTOR]
Yes! It was his influence.

79
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,500
That young boy
you called "Big Brother"

80
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,583
and kept following
around like a lost puppy.

81
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,333
I forgot about that.

82
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,208
[BOY]
Come on, don't cry.

83
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,750
It's okay. If anything happens,
I'll be there to protect you.

84
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,666
After all, Hinako...

85
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,250
[HINAKO]
Hmm...

86
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,416
[DIRECTOR]
You two were practically

87
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,625
inseparable back
in those days. Haha!

88
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,333
Man, that really takes me back!

89
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,791
That makes two of us.

90
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,791
It's been so long I forgot
what he looked like,

91
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,750
but I do remember how
good he was at fighting

92
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,291
and how he protected others.

93
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,291
I wanted to be
as strong as he was.

94
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:18,666
That's why I put everything I
had into learning Martial Arts.

95
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,333
[DIRECTOR]
Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,291
Not long after that,
someone called me out.

97
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,791
I didn't know what to expect,

98
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,500
but what ended up
happening... was crazy.

99
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,958
I didn't think you'd
bring your posse along.

100
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,750
Are you afraid to meet me alone?

101
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,958
[HINAKO]
Aside from Mirako,

102
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:46,166
Kira Rintarou was the
head of the second-years.

103
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,333
Cool it hot-shot.

104
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,541
We're only here to see how the
fight plays out, nothin' more.

105
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,125
He is our boss.

106
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,208
We go where he goes.

107
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,625
Yes, of course.

108
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,416
I should have known you'd
take this as a challenge,

109
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,375
but that's not my intent.

110
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,583
Whatever.

111
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,875
I'll get straight
to the point "Hikaru."

112
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,458
How long do you intend
to keep up this act?

113
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,166
Huh?

114
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,583
Come on.

115
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,583
Stop lying about who you are.

116
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,791
Huh? What kinda game
are you playin' here?

117
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,166
Yeah, you're not
making any sense.

118
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,875
[KIRA]
It's simple.

119
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,791
This is <i>not</i> Hikaru Onigashima.

120
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,500
[HINAKO gasps]

121
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,083
Why so quiet suddenly?

122
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,458
I can tell them everything
myself, if you prefer.

123
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,625
[KIRA]
I don't mind, believe me.

124
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,875
Why are you doing this?

125
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,500
Have it your way.

126
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,833
Suzukaze. The orphanage.

127
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,958
I don't know what your problem
is, but I am Hikaru Onigashima!

128
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,083
What are you
basing all of this on?

129
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,583
Huh...?

130
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,125
[KIRA sighs]

131
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,333
If anything happens,
I'll be there to protect you.

[gasps]

133
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,833
[KIRA]
After all...

134
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,791
Well, that was the biggest
let down of the century.

135
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,833
What a wierdo.

136
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,250
Hey, Hikaru.

137
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,166
Do you know what
he was on about?

138
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,750
[HINAKO gasps]

139
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,750

Hikaru?

140
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,375
What's wrong?

141
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,166
If anything happens,
I'll be there to protect you.

142

After all, Hinako,
you're my little sister.
