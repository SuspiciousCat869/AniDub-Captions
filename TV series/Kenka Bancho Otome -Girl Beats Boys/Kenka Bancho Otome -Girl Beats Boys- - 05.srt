Hmmm...

00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,958
[HINAKO] I had
successfully gained control

00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,458
of Shishiku Academy's
first-years.

00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,041
Then it was time to move on.

We set our sights on
the second-year class.

up soon, aren't they?

actually test us at this school.

[HINAKO] "School" being
the operative word.

So, for some reason,
we decided...

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,166
...the best thing to do
was have a study session.

I thought they were easy,
but I had no idea!

21
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,916
I figure they have to
be pretty lenient at Shishiku,

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,541
or most of the students would
fail before the semester's out.

they were moved to tears.

They weren't worth crying over.

So, that means you're
actually good at this crap?

you can't judge a book

Look at Hikaru.

He's a prime example.
