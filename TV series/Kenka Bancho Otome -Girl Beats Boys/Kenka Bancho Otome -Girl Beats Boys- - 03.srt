1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,458
[PUNK LEADER] Your big brother
goes to Shishiku, doesn't he?

2
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,916
Y'know, the punks at
that glorified roach motel

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
make life suck
pretty hard for us.

4
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,916
I think we'll take
some reparations

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,958
out of your sorry little hide.
Sound fair?

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,166
[MINORU]
But, that's my lunch money!

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,166
[HINAKO]
What do you think you're doing?

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,958
Huh?

9
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,208
[PUNK LEADER]
What's it look like, pinky?

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm shakin' the kid down.

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,333
Do you mind?

12
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,875
Shakedown?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,250
Jerk. You'd do that to a child?

14
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,083
[PUNK A]
Hold on, check out the uniform!

15
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,958
This punk's from Shishiku, too!

16
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,250
[PUNK B] Guess the place
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

17
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,750
Run, kid. Hurry!

18
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,916
[PUNK A]
Hey!

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,166
Aww, he got away.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,125
What a shame. Oh well.

21
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,375
Guess you'll pay
our reparations.

22
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,416
How 'bout it, boys.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,958
Should we get to work?

24
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,875
[PUNK B, A laughs]

25
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,750
[roars]

26
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,333
[PUNK LEADER]
What...? What just happened?

27
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,125
[PUNK LEADER growls]

28
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,833
Screw you!

29
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,958
[KONPARU]
Hey, jackass. Outta my way.

30
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,708
Fine, s'all yours.

31
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't give a damn.

32
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,791
Uh! Thank you.

33
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,250
He almost got the drop on me.

34
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,500
[KONPARU]
Whatever.

35
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,833
He was in my way,
so I moved him.

36
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,666
I wasn't trying to help.

37
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,916
[TOTOMARU] So right
now the top two first-years

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,041
are you and this guy.

39
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,708
Uh, who's he?

40
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,083
[TOTOMARU]
Takayuki Konparu!

41
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,708
Don't the headphones
give it away?

42
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,833
[KONPARU]
Whatever.

43
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,166
He was in my way,
so I moved him.

44
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,875
I wasn't trying to help.

45
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,125
[TOTOMARU] The second-years
have two bosses, too.

46
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:09,083
Yuta Mirako and Rintaro Kira.

47
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,291
You're so thin,
it makes me wonder.

48
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,833
Are you really
who you say you are?

49
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,500
Yeah, Kira and I have met.

50
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,958
So, then...

51
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,541
...who is this?

52
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,791
Uh? 

53
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,041
Your big brother,
numbskull, who else?

54
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,750
[HINAKO]
Huh?

55
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,500
[TOTOMARU] Houou Onigashima,
boss of the third-years.

56
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,250
A living legend who took over

57
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,916
Shishiku one month
after enrolling.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,125
Heh, listen to me, telling
you about your own brother.

59
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,458
Yeah. Silly.

60
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,958
If you wanna rule the school,

61
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,375
you're gonna have to take
each of 'em down, one-on-one.

62
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,750
No ifs, ands, or buts about it.

63
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,791
You'll start with Konparu.

64
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,416
He's a first-year
in the Wisteria Class.

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,416
There ain't a punk in Shishiku
that hasn't heard of him.

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,125
After a 153 fights
and zero losses,

67
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,375
he's considered invincible.

68
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,750
Wow. He sounds
incredibly strong.

69
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,166
Hey, you beat me, right?

70
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,375
Don't sweat it.

71
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,875
I know you got what
it takes to win this.

72
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,125
But Konparu already
said he wouldn't be fighting

73
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,750
because he thinks
it's ridiculous.

74
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,916
[TOTOMARU] When two dudes square
off, nobody wins by default.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,583
Either you beat him one-on-one,

76
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,541
or you let any hope of ruling
Shishiku die right here.

77
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,708
[HINAKO]
'Kay... fine.

78
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,041
[KONPARU hums]

79
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,333
[MINORU]
Hey, Bro!

80
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,500
Huh?

81
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,583
One of the boys from
your school saved me

82
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,875
from a gang of
bullies this morning.

83
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,250
[KONPARU]
Huh?

84
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,458
The three of them were
gonna steal my lunch money,

85
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,500
but he totally stopped them.

86
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,125
He was cute looking
but really cool.

87
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,625
[KONPARU]
Huh...

88
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,958
Well, if you see him again,
be sure to thank him.

89
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,041
[MINORU]
Mm-hmm.

90
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,458
[SIBLINGS]
Big Brother!

91
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,333
Is dinner almost ready?

92
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,083
We're hungry!

93
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,916
[KONPARU]
Yep, it's my special Yakisoba!

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,625
[SIBLINGS cheer]

95
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,750
[HINAKO]
Even though I was unofficially

96
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,083
at the top of Shishiku's
first-years at the time,

97
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,541
I could definitely feel
the pressure to win...

98
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,083
..from Totomaru.

99
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,166
[TOTOMARU]
Don't get me wrong,

100
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,500
I got nothing personal
against Konparu.

101
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,708
But, if you want people
to think you've taken over

102
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,041
the first-year's class,
you gotta fight him.

103
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,333
If you don't face him now,
you'll never move forward!

104
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,541
Get what I'm sayin', Bro?

105
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,875
Your only choice
is to fight him!

106
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,333
If you don't, you can't
call yourself a man!

107
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,250
I thought I'd get a
break after I got home,

108
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,916
but it wasn't much better.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't just sit around.

110
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,208
You should be
planning your take-over!

111
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,666
Aim for the very
top of Shishiku,

112
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,875
and rule it for the glory of me!

113
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,833
Fight like there's
no tomorrow, Miss!

114
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:44,708
I couldn't avoid

115
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,583
fighting Konparu if I wanted to.

116
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,541
So I went ahead
and challenged him.

117
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,625
But every time I did he
gave me the same answer.

118
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,541
I'm not interested in fighting.

119
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,458
It's pointless.

120
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,125
I may as well have been
challenging a broken record.

121
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,250
Try as I might, I couldn't get
a different answer out of him.

122
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,250
Totomaru?

123
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,583
I think this situation calls
for drastic measures.

124
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,208
What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,875
Isn't it obvious?

126
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,541
You get out there
and jump his ass.

127
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,750
It's brawling 101.

128
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,791
Sounds like assault and battery.

129
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,166
Yeah, well, it's
better than waiting

130
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,041
for him to change his mind.

131
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,041
Until you pound Konparu
into the pavement,

132
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,166
your road to the top
of Shishiku is closed off.

133
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,125
If he doesn't wanna fight,
it won't happen.

134
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,458
I can't force him.

135
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,958
[TOTOMARU]
Uh... No way.

136
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,583
A letter of challenge?

137
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,500
[HINAKO]
Hm...

138
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,166
[TOTOMARU]
I'll be damned.

139
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,750
He's ready to rumble!

140
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,583
This is your chance, Hikaru!
