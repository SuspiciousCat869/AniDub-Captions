00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,708
[YUTA] I was about to kick-off
my career as an artist,

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:15,250
and my solo debut was set
to be at the school I attended.

3
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:19,958
But Shishiku isn't your
run-of-the-mill institution.

4
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,000
It's the wildest
academy in the country.

5
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:36,500
It was a totally transparent
attempt to generate some buzz.

6
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,833
Although, to be honest,

7
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,833
I couldn't have
cared less about it.

8
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,166
Of course, that's
how I felt at the time.

9
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,416
And if it wasn't for who I met,

10
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,583
I'd still feel that way.

11

[FANGIRLS screech]

12
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,000
Huh?

13
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,291
The hell?

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,291
[HINAKO]
Where have I seen him before?

15
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,375
Girls, please.

16
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,875
I need to get to class,
or I'll be late.

17
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:40,125
Huh? Oh!
The guy from the posters!

18
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,541
Oh...

19
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,125
Hey. You a fan of
mine, too, babe?

20
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,250
Want an autograph?

21
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,791
No, I'm good, thanks!

22
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,416
Why are you here?

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,375
[YUTA]
Hmph.

24
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,916
You mean you don't know?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,416
That hurts.

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
I'm a second-year student
in Cherryblossom Class.

27
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,666
Name's Yuta Mirako.

[FANGIRLS screech]

29
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,708
You're quite the little cutie.

30
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,250
You seem frail and naïve.

31
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,750
It kinda makes me
wanna take care of you.

32
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,208
Got a boyfriend I can replace?

33
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,833
No! I am a boy!

34
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,250
So, you are.

35
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,208
Can't believe
I missed the uniform,

36
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,625
though I'm not sure
I'm convinced.

[HINAKO]
Uh...

38
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,416
I don't make mistakes.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,041
I pride myself on having
an especially keen eye.

40
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,000
And...

41

No guy has wrists like yours.

Huh?

45
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,083
[HINAKO]
I get that a lot, actually.

46
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,666
It's true I'm pretty short,

47
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,458
and I don't have the
most muscular build.

48
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,416
But, I really am a guy!

49

Uh-huh... Well, I'll actually
be attending class

for a change today.

51
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,583
I'll find you.

You'll find me?

53

Yup!

54
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,666
Maybe next time I can be a
little more thorough with you.

55
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,958
Then I'll know for sure whether
you're really a boy or not.

[TOTOMARU]
Hey, Handsy!

58
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,583
Think you could give it a rest?

59
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,958
You're bothering Hikaru.

60
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,875
Not to mention
being a total creep.

61

[KONPARU]
He might be mild-mannered,

62
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,958
but he's the boss
of the first-years.

63

Back off, or we'll make you.

Yeah? A scrawny thing like you?

And you are... who again?

We're his bros.
You got a problem with that?

[YUTA]
"Bros"?

What a load of crap.

Seriously.

71
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,375
Guess the first-years
don't amount to much.

[YUTA]
Been a while, Rintaro.

73

Didn't think you'd be
the one to reach out, first.

It's not like you at all.

the first-years, understand?

Ah, yes.

So, you saw that?

He's quite interesting,
isn't he?

79

I thought he was
a girl, at first.

80
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,500
Maybe, I'll...

81

[chuckles]
All right, kill the scary look.

82
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,666
I'll leave him be, okay?

83
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,958
Besides, he's got a
couple "friends" with him.

What a loser.

There's that pathetic attitude.

You haven't changed
at all, Yuta.

history tear you apart.

of the second-years?

He's putting on
a solo concert here.
