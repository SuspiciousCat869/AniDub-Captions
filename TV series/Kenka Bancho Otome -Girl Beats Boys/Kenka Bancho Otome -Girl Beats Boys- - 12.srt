1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:16,125
[OYAMADA] Ha! They wanna
play at being Knights?

2
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,666
Then they'll bleed
for their Princess.

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,541
[laughter]

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,250
Have at 'em, boys!

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,625
Hikaru, you're the
best bro a guy could want.

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,625
The only thing stronger
than your fists is your heart!

7
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,541
I'll be damned if
I let you waste one punch

8
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,083
on these sacks of garbage!

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,125
Hear that you sorry punks?

10
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,750
You're not getting' past me!

11
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,125
Or me!

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,166
Ever since I fought Hikaru,

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,166
I swore to get stronger so
I could face him again someday!

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,333
I will not lose again.

15
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,000
Not until I've beaten him!

16
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,625
And he won't lose either!

17
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,125
I'll make sure of it!

18
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:05,125
Heh! I must be goin' soft here!

19
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,500
I swore I'd never trust
in friendship again.

20
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,666
But, despite that, I still
found a place to belong!

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,208
And Hikaru is the
one who showed me!

22
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:17,375
[KIRA] As for me, I refused to
see past my memories of her...

23
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,458
Of then...

24
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,416
I was so obsessed, but...

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,208
...you set me free, and I'll do
whatever it takes to repay you!

26
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,666
[HINAKO]
Everything had gone wrong.

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,041
I knew I had to fix it,
but I had no idea how.

28
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:58,000
And the others? They'd put every
ounce of their faith in me.

29
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,250
The lie I'd been telling them

30
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,750
never felt heavier
than in that moment.

31
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,125
[HOUOU]
Hikaru...

32
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,125
Hikaru!

33
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,916
[HINAKO gasps]

34
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:12,916
[THUG H]
That's Houou.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,791
[THUG I]
For real?

36
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,833
[THUG J]
This guy's a legend!

37
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:15,875
[THUG K]
No way.

38
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:16,875
[HOUOU]
Hikaru.

39
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,250
Huh?

40
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know what's
got you so worried

41
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,625
that you're just
standing there.

42
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,625
But if you can't
even handle this,

43
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,666
there's no way you'll
truly rise to the top!

44
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,416
And you sure as hell
won't live up to the faith

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
your friends put in you.

46
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,416
You know what you have to do.

47
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,750
Put up your fists and
show 'em your worth!

48
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,125
[HINAKO gasps]

49
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,458
Thank you.

50
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,958
[TOTOMARU]
Hmm? Heh!

51
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,291
You guys okay?

52
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,916
Huh? 'Course.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,125
Sorry for the wait.

54
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,666
[YUTA]
Hmm?

55
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,291
[HINAKO]
I'm ready now.

56
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,583
[KIRA gasps]

57
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,208
Everyone listen up!

58
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,708
This school's important to me.

59
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,958
Because it's the
first place I made friends!

60
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,250
Friends I could
never bear to lose.

61
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,666
So I'm staying!

62
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,916
Let them say whatever they want.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
One day, I'll rise to the top,
with you at my side!

64
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,791
[TOTOMARU]
Heh!

65
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,833
[YUTA chuckles]

66
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,750
[HOUOU chuckles]

67
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,375
[STUDENT A] Hikaru's just
Hikaru, right, guys?

68
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,500
[STUDENT B]
Why should we care

69
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,791
what some jerks at
another school say?

70
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,375
[PUNK K]
Yeah! Screw 'em!

71
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,250
[STUDENT C] Don't underestimate
our boss just 'cause he's cute!

72
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,333
[PUNK K]
Yeah, you'll be sorry!

73
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,166
Thank you.

74
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,125
Here goes!

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,666
This is for my friends!

76
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,833
[TOSHIYA]
Hey, did you hear?

77
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,583
Hikaru's status is on the
rise after what happened.

78
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,000
Hell yeah.

79
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,416
In the end, all the guys
in Shishiku fell back in line.

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Well, he wiped the floor with
those guys single-handedly.

81
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,458
Who wouldn't?

82
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,333
No joke.

83
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,416
But, he did go a bit overboard.

84
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,291
Behold! Proof. I'm a man!

85
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:52,208
Look close.
Cause it's all you'll get!

86
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,208
[STUDENTS laugh]

87
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,708
[STUDENT D]
No one cares, dude!

88
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,708
[STUDENT E] Thanks for
the free show, though, Boss!

89
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,750
[STUDENT F]
It's cool, man.

90
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:03,375
[ALL 4]
That was so damn lame.

91
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,458
Everyone calmed down
after that, thankfully.

92
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,166
Houou--my big brother--
explained it all.

93
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,291
The guy behind the whole
fiasco was named Oyamada.

94
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:18,083
He was the top of Shishiku's
second-years before him.

95
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,333
When you think about it,
this was kind of my fault.

96
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,708
Since I had to repeat a year,
Oyamada chose to leave.

97
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,583
And I don't think
he ever got over that.

98
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,291
Poor bastard.

99
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:33,041
He lost the moment he went
after you to get to me.

100
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,625
So don't blame yourself
for any of this, okay?

101
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,583
Heh! I still can't
believe what Hikaru did.

102
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,375
Stripping to protect me
was just so selfless.

103
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,791
I didn't even want to
do it in the first place!

104
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,250
So, thanks to this pushy idiot,
I was humiliated!

105
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,208
True.

106
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,666
And it was worth it.

107
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,666
I learned a lot
from this experience.

108
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,791
I know how truly lucky I am.

109
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:02,083
And now, I can get back
to the life I've made.

110
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,583
[HINAKO]
Thanks, guys.

111
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,458
Your help meant a lot to me.

112
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,000
[TOTOMARU]
We're bros, Bro!

113
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,041
What else were we gonna do?

114
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,250
[KIRA] Well, there
isn't much left to do.

115
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,166
'Cept conquering
the third-years.

116
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,708
[KONPARU]
It's quite the goal.

117
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,041
Most wouldn't even dream of it.

118
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,375
Don't disappoint us,
fearless leader.

119
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,750
Never! It's like I said.

120
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,958
Before I came to Shishiku,
I never had any real friends.

121
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,416
But now, I have all of you,

122
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,000
and I promise
I'll never let you down!

123
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,083
[HINAKO]
Umm...

124
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,583
[TOTOMARU] You were serious
about that "no friends" thing?

125
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,458
[HINAKO]
Huh?!

126
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,250
[YUTA]
Like, not even one?

127
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,625
That's a little...

128
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,375
[HINAKO]
Huh?

129
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,291
[KIRA]
Depressing?

130
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,666
[HINAKO]
Uh...

131
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,250
[KONPARU] Probably best
if you never say that again.

132
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,333
[HINAKO]
Right.

133
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,875
[TOTOMARU]
All right, enough of that.

134
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,000
I say we mark the end
of Hikaru's dark days

135
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,083
by going wild at the arcade!

136
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,833
Let's get crazy!

137
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,750
[KIRA]
Whatever.

138
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,125
[YUTA]
Sounds good!

139
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,416
[KONPARU]
I guess I can tag along.

140
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,958
[TOTOMARU chuckles]

141
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,291
How do you like my patented
"Rest in Peace" Sleeper hold?

142
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,166
[YUTA]
Easy does it.

143
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,708
[HINAKO]
Goodbye, dark days.
