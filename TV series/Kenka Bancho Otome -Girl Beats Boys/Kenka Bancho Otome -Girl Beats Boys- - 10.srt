[CHILD A] Aww, little baby
don't got no parents!

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:12,791
Loser!

00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,125
[CHILD B]
Must be lonely.

00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,875
Sucks to be you, kid.

6
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,375
[CHILD C]
Better get used to it.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,666
[KIRA]
Cut it out!

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,750

Crap, it's him again!

Run for it!

[KIRA]
She's not alone, got that?

12
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,458
I'm her big brother!

13
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,041
And if you pick on her again.

14
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,083
I'll make sure you pay!

15
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,250
[KIRA]
They're gone now.

16
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,125
Come on, don't cry.

17
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,500
It's okay.

18
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,250
[HINAKO]
Huh?

19
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,083
Thanks, Big Brother.

20
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,416
If anything happens,
I'll be there to protect you.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,083
'Cause after all,
you're my little sister.

22
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,416
[HINAKO]
Uh-huh

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,875
[KIRA] But you know,
you should get strong, too.

24
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,833
That way, you can
protect yourself.

25
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,625
[KIRA]
You don't belong here.

26
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,958
I won't ask again.

27
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,375
Leave Shishiku or I'll make you.

28
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,500
Where do you get off,
pretty boy?

29
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,083
Totomaru, please.

30
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,166
I don't know what led
to these assumptions, Kira,

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,958
but I'm sick of
listening to them.

32
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,125
I won't put up with it,

33
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,291
and I sure as hell
won't leave this school.

34
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,458
What's the point of this façade?

35
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,416
There's no reason
for you to fight.

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,375
Stop this, and go back
to living like a girl.

37
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,458
Uh?

38
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,625
You heard that too, right?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,458
[HINAKO]
Listen Kira.

40
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,833
For the last time,

41
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,833
my name is Hikaru Onigashima.

42
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,833
[HINAKO]
Don't you get it?

43
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,041
Shishiku Academy is
where I met my friends.

44
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,375
The fact that you're
telling me to leave

45
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,583
means you don't know me at all.

46
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,625
They were scary at first.

47
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,750
But now, I know they're
really good people.

48
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,791
And, truth be told,
I'm happier than I've ever been.

49
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,541
I don't want to
lose that feeling.

50
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,750
I'm staying, and that's that.

51
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,083
[TOTOMARU]
Hmph.

52
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:09,916

[KONPARU]
Hmm...

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,625
You think you can
survive this place?

56
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,458
Back then, all you did was cry.

58
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,041
[KIRA]
So I get a demonstration, then.

59
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,500
You're sure about this?

60
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,041
Yes.

61
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,916
And, once I beat you, you'll
have to admit that I'm a man.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,666
[KIRA]
Fine.

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,708
If that's what you want,
challenge accepted.

64
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,541
Whoa.

65
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,833
He's so determined
I can actually feel it.

66
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,041
But... I can't let
him win this fight!

67
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,708
Hikaru!

68
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,000
There's a reason he's
the top of the second-years.

69
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,875
Hikaru might be in trouble here.

70
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,083
Tsch! Ugh...

71
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,291
[KIRA] I only spent six short
months with Hinako... back then.

72
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,291
But I always wondered
what happened to her.

73
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,166
This might be selfish of me.

74
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,125
But I thought,
if she was the same person,

75
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,333
I could still protect her.

76
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,250
Turns out I was wrong.

77
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,000
[KIRA grunts]

78
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,916
You didn't hesitate.

[pants]

80
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,291
There was no doubt or
fear behind your attacks.

81
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,625
You really are
Hikaru Onigashima.

82
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,500
I see that now.

83
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,500
I can't possibly deny
how strong you've become.

84
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,500
You've grown into one
hell of a young man.

85
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,875
Guess I lose.

86
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,625
[KIRA]
She's not alone, got that?

87
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,166
If anything happens,
I'll be there to protect you.

88
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,375
You're my little sister.

89
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,500
You should get strong, too.

90
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,458
That way,
you can protect yourself.

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,250
Big Brother.

92
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,750
Thanks.

93
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,291
Holy crap.

94
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,291
He won!

95
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,916
Whoa, hold up.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,583
Doesn't that mean?

97
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,875
Hikaru just took over the
second-years in one fell swoop!

98
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,291
Uh... No! What?

99
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,541
This was personal,
it had nothing to do with--

100
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,375
They're right.

101
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,083
I lose.

102
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,750
You earned it, fair and square.

103
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,208
You're the boss now.

104
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,250
You're sure, Kira?

105
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,791
Hell yeah!

106
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,541
That was awesome, Hikaru!

107
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,416
I knew you were
destined for greatness!

108
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,333
Heh. Saw it coming.

109
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,333
Fess up, you were
holdin' back, on him.

110
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,708
Sneaky!

111
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,958
[HINAKO]
Stop...!

112
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,291
[KONPARU] Quick.
He'll noogie your brains out.

113
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,166
[TOTOMARU] One more class
and we rule the school!

114
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,166
[KONPARU]
You're right.

115
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,958
Look at that. Hey.

116
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,833
You're not alone anymore.

117
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,416
And you have all
the strength you need.

118
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,416
So, I guess you don't need me.

119
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:37,041
[HINAKO]
Hmm...

120
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,750
Don't worry, Kira!

121
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,291
I became strong
because I looked up to you.

122
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,666
My big brother!

123
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,541
I wish I could have
said that out loud.

124
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,291
Maybe someday he'll know
how much he did for me.

125
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,708
It had been 72 days
since the entrance ceremony.

126
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,291
In that short amount of time,
I took over two classes,

127
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,541
and made some
of the best friends

128
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,833
I could ever hope to have.
