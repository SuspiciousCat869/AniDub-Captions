[TOSHIYA]
Hey, did you hear the rumor?

4
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,541
They're saying Hikaru
Onigashima's a chick.

5
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:08,958
[TORA]
Hell yeah, I did!

6
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,791
It's the biggest scandal
in Shishiku's history!

7
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,250
[SAKUYA] But, could a
girl really be that tough?

8
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,458
If he is a chick, she still beat
the first- and second-years.

9
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,291
[KENTA]
Whatever the case,

10
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,500
the flyers and internet
chatter are bad news.

11
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,583
The whole school's on edge.

12
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,708
[ALL 4]
This'll be one hell of a storm.

13
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,541
[KIRA] There's a lot
of talk going around.

14
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,166
You okay?

15
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,333
[HINAKO]
I think so.

16
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,416
Sorry for making you all worry.

17
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,541
[TOTOMARU]
Why are you apologizing, dude?

18
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,416
[KONPARU]
You did nothing wrong.

19
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,333
[HINAKO]
But...

20
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,791
[PUNK A]
What the hell is all this?

21
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,250
We're a laughing stock!

22
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,458
[PUNK B]
Explain yourself!

23
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,208
Are you really a chick?

24
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,208
[PUNK C]
We're waiting, Onigashima!

25
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,666
Guys, chill out
and think for a second.

26
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,208
Shishiku's a boy's school.

27
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,666
Why would a girl even come here?

28
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,333
[PUNK D] 'Sup?
Too embarrassed to talk?

29
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,166
[TOTOMARU]
Jeez, what a bunch of dumbasses.

30
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,958
If they'd cool their jets,
they'd realize it was fake.

31
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,083
[KIRA] Do we have any idea
who started the rumor?

32
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,541
[YUTA]
It's my fault.

33
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,666
Huh?

34
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,291
Care to explain? Now?

35
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,833
It was some of my fans.

36
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,291
They started it on
my message board.

37
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,750
They might've thought I was
in a relationship with Hikaru.

38
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,416
[TOTOMARU] You were kind of
creepin' on him for a bit there.

39
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,625
[KONPARU]
Damn, girls are terrifying.

40
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,583
[YUTA]
My bad. Sorry.

41
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,208
Uh! Come on, please don't
bow to me like that, Mirako!

42
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,916
This is my responsibility!

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,708
I should've just worked harder.

44
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,208
If I had,

45
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,791
maybe things wouldn't have
gotten out of hand like this.

46
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,250
Don't be stupid, Bro.

47
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,458
The fault is with the losers
freaking out over this BS.

48
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,708
Those trolls are
just making noise.

49
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,291
They'll get bored, eventually.

50
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,416
[TOTOMARU] So keep your head up
and ride this out, okay?

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,666
No matter what anyone says,

52
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,041
you're our boss
and we respect you.

53
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,583
Right, guys?

54
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,708
You know it.

55
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,750
[KIRA]
Mm.

56
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,041
Thank you.

57
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,583
[TOTOMARU]
If push comes to shove,

58
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,500
just strip!

59
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,166
That'll do it! Real quick!

60
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,875
[KONPARU] Only you would
get naked in front of people

61
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,708
for no reason.

62
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,125
[TOTOMARU]
Whatever dude.

63
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,333
[YUTA]
What do you expect?

64
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,375
He's got no sense of decorum.

65
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,666
[KIRA]
Agreed.

66
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,541
[TOTOMARU]
Oh, I get it.

67
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,791
Gangin' up on ol' Totomaru.

68
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,458
Well, turnabout's
fair play you know!

69
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,833
[PUNK LEADER] The guys at
Shishiku are freakin' pissed!

70
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,625
This is too good!

71
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,166
[GOON LEADER]
Just like we were hoping.

72
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,375
Good work, Oyamada.

73
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,000
[OYAMADA]
Heh. It was easy.

74
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,458
They're punks, but they still
have their own set of rules.

75
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,500
They stick to a hierarchy.

76
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,750
Now, we just gotta
push a little harder.

77
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,625
It was naïve of us to think
everything would just blow over.

78
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,208
The rumors kept getting worse,

79
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,583
and tension at the school
was rising like mad.

80
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,666
What are you gonna do

81
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,791
if they find out
your true identity, huh?

82
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,291
All of my efforts would
have been for nothing!

83
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,500
A brilliant plan, wasted!

84
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,500
Even as Hikaru said that,

85
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,000
I wasn't sure what
I could do to change things.

86
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,208
So I kept quiet,

87
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:41,416
like I had since the
whole thing had started.

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,541
And then, finally,
the day I had dreaded arrived.

89
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,375
[PUNK E]
Prove you're a man! Right now!

90
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,916
[PUNK F]
You owe us that much at least!

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,083
[PUNK G]
Yeah! Whip it out!

92
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,541
[PUNK H]
We want proof!

93
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,166
[TOTOMARU]
How stupid are you guys?

94
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,458
You gonna let gossip
get you riled up like this?

95
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,375
[KONPARU] Everyone in
here knows how strong he is.

96
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,000
No way he's a girl.

97
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,958
Chick's aren't built that way.

98
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,041
Heh...

99
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:09,916
[PUNK I]
Enough excuses!

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,166
Show us your junk!

101
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,583
[PUNK J]
We want visible proof!

102
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,083
[PUNK K]
Yeah! Visible!

103
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,958
[PUNK L] Take it off,
then we'll know for sure.

104
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,458
[PUNK K]
Yeah! Take it off!

105
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,583
[PUNK M] If you're not a girl,
you won't mind stripping!

106
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,791
[PUNK N] That's the only
way to prove you're a man!

107
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,375
[PUNK K]
Yeah! Prove it!

108
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,333
Take it off! Take it off!

109
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:36,375
[STUDENTS] Take it off!
Take it off! Take it off!

110
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:45,250
[STUDENTS] Take it off!
Take it off! Take it off!

111
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,583
[PUNK O]
You're kidding me.

112
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,708
[PUNK P]
For real?

113
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,666
[PUNK Q]
He really is a chick!

114
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,000
[PUNK R] She was lying
to us the whole freakin' time!

115
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,875
[PUNK S]
Tricky bitch!

116
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,541
[PUNK T]
She's gotta pay!

117
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,916
Make her pay!

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,416
[PUNK U]
No chick's gonna be my boss!

119
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,750
[OYAMADA laughs]

120
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,791
I heard Shishiku had
a skirt running things

121
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,041
but didn't believe it.

122
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,083
Looks like all
the rumors had merit.

123
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,541
[KIRA, YUTA]
Huh?

124
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,625
[PUNK V]
Oyamada?

125
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,500
[PUNK W] The hell is Saka
Third High School doing here?

126
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,750
[OYAMADA chuckles] It'd be
hilarious if it weren't so sad.

127
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,083
Don't worry, fellas,

128
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,458
we'll expose this
fraud for what she really is.

129
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,125
You just stand back
and enjoy the show.

130
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,500
[PUNK, GOON LEADER laugh]

131
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,958
You guys...

132
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,791
You ain't layin' a finger on
him, unless you get through us.

133
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,625
By all means, try it.

134
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,250
[OYAMADA growls]
