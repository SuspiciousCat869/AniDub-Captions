1
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:13,000
[KIRA] The moment we met
I could feel something was off.

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:18,666
And, as time went by, that
feeling became total certainty.

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,875
More than anything,
there was the resemblance.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,583
It was uncanny.

5
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,083
[HINAKO]
At some point in time,

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,750
I had just forgotten
all about him.

7
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,875
But I was little,
and it was years ago.

8
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,458
I guess it shouldn't
have surprised me.

9
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,083
My protector, he inspired me
to become strong on my own.

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,000
So, of course,
I would call him "Brother."

11
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,041
[gasps]

12
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,375
Huh?

13
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,958
You're so thin,
I can't help but wonder.

14
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,250
Are you actually
who you say you are?

15
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,541
I want to help him.

16
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,833
[KIRA]
It's simple.

17
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,833
This is <i>not</i> Hikaru Onigashima.

18
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,916
[HINAKO gasps]

19
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:32,375
If anything happens,
I'll be there to protect you.

20
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,166
After all...

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,666
After all, Hinako,
you're my little sister.

22
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:02,291
[approaching footsteps]

23
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:06,166
The next time you ask someone
to meet you, show up on time.

24
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,625
Yeah?

25
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,250
[sighs]

26
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,541
[approaching footsteps]

27
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,958
Huh?

28
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,083
[HOUOU]
S'been awhile, Hikaru.

29
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,875
How are ya?

30
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,708
Have we met before?

31
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,958
Seriously?

32
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,666
D'you forget what your
own brother looks like?

33
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,458
[HINAKO]
So this is Houou Onigashima!

34
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,708
[HINAKO]
Um, 'sup, Big Bro?

35
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,166
[HOUOU]
Hmm?

36
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,708
Uh, Houou?

37
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,375
Hikaru!

38
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,708
Yes?

39
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,458
Must be a cold day in hell.

40
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,041
I never thought
you'd call me "Big Bro"

41
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,708
or anything close to it.

42
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,083
Really?

43
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,458
Well, can you blame me?

44
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,666
All I ever got from
you was "Buzz off!"

45
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,791
or "You're in my way!
I hate your guts!"

46
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,041
What is wrong with you, Hikaru.

47
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,666
[KIRA] So, you gonna
tell me why I'm here?

48
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,958
[YUTA] Thought I might beat
some sense into your ass.

49
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,458
Don't be ridiculous.

50
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,916
[YUTA] Well, you've been
getting on my nerves lately.

51
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,708
Watching you sulk about
isn't all that entertaining.

52
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,541
Do me a solid and get over it.

53
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,333
It's got nothing to do with you.

54
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,708
[HOUOU]
There are two guys

55
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,375
running Shishiku's
second-years.

56
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,375
But I'm the one sittin'
at the top of the dog pile.

57
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:51,291
See, thanks to some trouble,
I ended up repeating.

58
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,916
Whoa. Must be rough.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,583
[HOUOU] Heh!
So, word through the grapevine

60
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,458
is you already took
over the first-years.

61
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,791
Is that true?

62
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,458
Yeah.

63
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,708
I guess.

64
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,583
Heard the fish were a
pretty rowdy bunch, too.

65
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,500
You having trouble
keeping 'em in line?

66
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,416
Well, at first
Totomaru, Konparu,

67
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,041
and I didn't really get along,

68
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,583
but now they're the best
friends I've ever had.

69
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,625
Got ya.

70
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,083
Found yourself some bros?

71
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,416
Uh-huh!

72
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,375
Totamaru can be pretty
straightforward at times,

73
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,541
but he's the best
student in Shishiku!

74
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,625
So much so, the teachers
actually cried over his grades!

75
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,458
And Konparu's about as
stubborn and moody as they come,

76
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,500
but he's super sweet and
cares a lot for his siblings.

77
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,500
Exactly like an
older brother should!

78
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,208
Uhm...!

79
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:32,916
Uh...

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,833
Ah! Not what I meant!

81
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,750
You're great just
the way you are!

82
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,625
[HOUOU chuckles]

83
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,000
Goofball.

84
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,291
Look at you,
actin' all grown up.

85
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,458
That'll help here, but let your
guard down for an instant,

86
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,458
and it's game over.

87
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,125
Understand?

88
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,541
[HOUOU] If anything happens,
just come to me.

89
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,041
I know I haven't been the best
brother to you over the years,

90
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,333
but we're family,
no matter what.

91
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,333
You can always count on me.

92
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,875
[HINAKO]
Thanks.

93
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,875
Anyway, if you can get used
to this school's atmosphere,

94
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,958
everything else
will go smoothly.

95
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,166
That's the problem.

96
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,458
I don't know how.

97
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,958
It's simple.

98
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,291
Stick to what you believe in
and face every foe head on.

99
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,208
Whatever you care
about, fight for it,

100
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,208
with every ounce of
strength you can muster.

101
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,250
Do that,
and you'll be just fine.

102
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,708
[YUTA] You think <i>I</i> haven't
changed at all, right?

103
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,458
But I'm pretty sure <i>you</i> have!

104
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,333
Now which one of us is "letting
ancient history tear him apart"?

105
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,375
Shut up!

106
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,958
I'm sick of watching
you brooding!

107
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,500
Quit running away
from your feelings!

108
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,708
It's pathetic!

109
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,000
And it's pissing me off!

110
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,625
[KIRA]
That's enough!

111
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,875
[YUTA] Since they saved me,
I haven't had the right

112
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,875
to call myself the top
of the second-years!

113
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,416
It's you now.

114
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,208
So get your act together or
we'll never keep them in line!

115
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,833
Got it?

116
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,958
[KIRA] I never asked
to be top of our class.

117
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:34,208
I didn't want it, or to have
anything to do with them.

118
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,375
That's your excuse?

119
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:39,375
[KIRA] But, I'll admit,
you have a point.

120
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:43,333
These feelings,
I can't run from them anymore.

121
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:47,125
I'll fight.

122
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,291
[YUTA chuckles]

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,916
[HINAKO]
That's right.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,458
I need to face my foe head on.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,125
It's time we settled this!
