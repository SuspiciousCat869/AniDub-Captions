00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I had a friend.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
[AI] She was the first
friend I ever made.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
Koito Nagase.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
She was pretty and kind.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.570 position:50% align:center
She complimented the
parts of me I didn't like.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:29.863 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
It's mysterious.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't try to hide it.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.367 position:50% align:center
It's pretty.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
I want you to
be friends with me.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
In fact, let's be best friends.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
If we could, I'd be happy.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
Me, too.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:57.223 position:50% align:center
[AI]
But... she died, suddenly.

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Why? Poor, Koito.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
[AI] After that, I stopped going
to school for a little while.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.661 position:50% align:center
Now, I'm really angry!

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:24.626 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Instead, I started fighting.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
It was my own kind of battle.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:31.633 position:50% align:center
The eggs I bought transported
me to a dream world.

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:35.887 position:50% align:center
[AI] By protecting the
girls inside the Eggs

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.723 position:50% align:center
from Seeno Evils
and their Wonder Killers.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:39.974 position:50% align:center
I could clear my mission.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.563 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Too bad.

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:46.940 position:50% align:center
Only you get saved.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
But you have to cheer up

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.152 position:50% align:center
if you want
your best friend back.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:54.781 position:50% align:center
[AI]
She's a little warm.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
Is it because I saved Kurumi?

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.995 position:50% align:center
Hey, if I save more people,

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.248 position:50% align:center
Then, will Koito come back?

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:06.126 position:50% align:center
Tell me she will!

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:12.465 position:50% align:center
I had so many questions,
about Koito and why she died.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.758 position:50% align:center
[KOITO] I hear
Mister Sawaki's entering it

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.011 position:50% align:center
in the next art exhibition.

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.929 position:50% align:center
He says he wants to win a prize,

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
so he can make
a living as a painter.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
[AI]
A painting of me?

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
Have confidence.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.312 position:50% align:center
If you can't,
then maybe you should decline.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.357 position:50% align:center
Mister Sawaki's
future is on the line.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.860 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Why, Koito?

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:35.905 position:50% align:center
There was a small part
of me that resented Koito.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.367 position:50% align:center
We were friends, so why
didn't she just talk to me?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.123 position:50% align:center
[AI roars]

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:47.125 position:50% align:center
[AI]
So why?!

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Anytime I wanted to buy an Egg,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
I had to go to an
underground shopping mall.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
Then one day,

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
I started making
new friends there.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
But I'll pay you
back for the Egg.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
[AI]
This is Rika.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.360 position:50% align:center
She's cheerful
and full of energy.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
She used to be a junior idol.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.573 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
In a group called All-Out Kiss.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
Ever heard of us?

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
Never.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
We broke up, anyway.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
The other members
were a bunch of uggos.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
So, anyway.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
I kind of forgot
my wallet today.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but...

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
Think you can spot me?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
[AI] Unfortunately,
Rika is an "opportunist"

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
when it comes to money.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
Come see Rika again, okay?

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
Ha, gotcha!

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
[AI] Rika's mission
involved a former fan.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
A girl she wanted
to bring back to life.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] After that, another
fan told me what happened.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
Chiemi had died.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
She was all skin and bones,
like a mummy.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
Couldn't forget her if I tried.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
This... This isn't Chiemi.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE cries]

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.162 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Sorry, uh...

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
What do you see?

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
[AI]
This is Momo.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
She looks boyish,
but she loves cute things.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
Sunflower.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
Well... It's cute... so...

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
[AI] Momo's mission was
to save a classmate named Haruka

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
who had apparently
fallen in love with her.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Wow. You're warm.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
Girls like you,
saying they love me.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Check it out.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.877 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] Yes, we're always
worried about her.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
[AI]
She's so pretty!

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Oh, that.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
[AI]
And this is Neiru.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
Are you sure it's
not for yourself?

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center
How do you mean?

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
You don't like who
you are, so you go.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
Even if you're afraid.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
You want to change
the self you hate.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
[AI] Neiru is really
cool and levelheaded,

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
but she's adorable
when she laughs.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
She actually runs
a giant company.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
This is my first secretary.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
Misaki Tanabe.

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
A pleasure.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
Are you girls familiar
with a group called Plati?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
I heard that only people
with really high IQs

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.879 position:50% align:center
are allowed to be members.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
Like Miss Neiru.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.299 position:50% align:center
She's a member of Japan Plati.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
I'm a product of
artificial insemination.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.973 position:50% align:center
[AI] Neiru's mission is to
fight for her little sister.

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
My sister stabbed me.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
Then, she ran away
and jumped off a bridge.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
The scar aches and
keeps me awake at night.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
Or... it did.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
But the pain has faded a little
since I started coming here.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
When I try to forget her,
my scar aches, like a curse.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
That's why I go.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
No other reason.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
It's for me.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.669 position:50% align:center
[AI] When I went to
hang out at Neiru's place.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
She introduced me to her friend.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
Her name was Kotobuki.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
So who is she?

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.135 position:50% align:center
She's my friend.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
Her name's Kotobuki Awano.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
Born here, like me.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
Hi, Kotobuki.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.434 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] Kotobuki was always
cheerful and optimistic.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:58.478 position:50% align:center
Nothing ever seemed
to get her down.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.231 position:50% align:center
She always told me
to enjoy myself.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
[AI
"Was"?

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.651 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Isn't she just sleeping?

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
She's in a vegetative state.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:07.654 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Huh?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
Kotobuki was
a doctor of psychiatry.

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
She was scientifically
analyzing life's mysteries.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
In particular,
those about death.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
She performed
near-death experiments,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
and eventually,
she didn't come back.

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50% align:center
I saw her in a dream recently.

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
[AI]
A dream?

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
An Egg dream.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI] The me from the world
that you live in really did die.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
But that allowed me
to experience it.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
I was right, Neiru:
Parallel worlds do exist!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center
The possibility of other worlds
that might have been.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
It always was your favorite
genre of science fiction.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI] Yes! Our parallel
selves are alive somewhere!

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI] You've made some
new friends, haven't you?

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
You're soft.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
Softer than you used to be.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] It's different,
they're not like us.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI] Still, you made
connections with people.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
That's a wonderful
thing, regardless.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
Treasure them.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
It's so hard without you there.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
I'll make friends
with those girls

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
if only in some
other world-line.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
That doctor what's-his-name,
he had pride, if nothing else.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
Proud chicken.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
Was it really that funny?

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center

The suicides of young girls.

Nice try, weirdos.

[AI] Acca and Ura-Acca
did a lot to support us.

Like how they gave me

So, I thought they
were on our side.

There were many causes.

another push we didn't see,

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
one that drove them to suicide.

I was told she caused a problem

00:28:27.832 --> 00:28:31.002 position:50% align:center
with a male teacher
at her last school.

00:28:31.086 --> 00:28:33.338 position:50% align:center
He committed suicide after that.

00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:35.465 position:50% align:center
He had a family and everything.

00:28:35.548 --> 00:28:38.593 position:50% align:center
She contacted me
frequently, as well.

00:28:38.677 --> 00:28:41.554 position:50% align:center
She asked me to come
to the roof that day.

00:28:41.638 --> 00:28:43.723 position:50% align:center
Even went so far as
to threaten to jump off

00:28:43.807 --> 00:28:46.101 position:50% align:center
if I didn't show up.

00:28:46.184 --> 00:28:48.436 position:50% align:center
Apparently, she shouted
that I had raped her,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.855 position:50% align:center
and anything else
she could think of.

00:28:50.939 --> 00:28:53.525 position:50% align:center
Then, when no one
was watching her,

00:28:53.608 --> 00:28:57.570 position:50% align:center
she lost her balance
and you know the rest.

I forgot my wallet,

she was like,
"Tough luck, dummy."

for a Makorin photo.

you met at the office

is actually Neiru's
younger sister, Airu.

make up after that, y'know?

she already had.

Did you come back to life, too?

00:37:40.885 --> 00:37:43.138 position:50% align:center
No, because this me never died.

00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:47.058 position:50% align:center
I'm only here because the me

So you're a parallel Kotobuki?

[KOTOBUKI] Ding!
You're quick on the uptake.

00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:56.276 position:50% align:center
"Parallel"?

00:37:56.359 --> 00:37:58.820 position:50% align:center
[AI] She's Kotobuki,

Yeah.

00:38:04.034 --> 00:38:08.163 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI] Right. Let's watch
Neiru's dream together.

00:38:08.246 --> 00:38:11.666 position:50% align:center

The scar on my back aches.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.212 position:50% align:center
[AIRU] All right,
but if you're sending me there,

00:38:16.296 --> 00:38:18.715 position:50% align:center
does that mean you'll stay here?

00:38:18.798 --> 00:38:20.258 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I'll go, too.

00:38:20.342 --> 00:38:22.260 position:50% align:center

Oh?

Sorry to be the

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.432 position:50% align:center

00:38:27.515 --> 00:38:29.434 position:50% align:center
Adios.

If you sacrifice your pet

[FRILL] I think that you

[NEIRU]
Why?

00:39:08.181 --> 00:39:10.600 position:50% align:center
[FRILL] Because you're
just like me, duh!

00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:13.853 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm the only one who
knows what you really want.

The wish you hide because
your friends won't understand.

Oh, apparently the me from here

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:36.042 position:50% align:center
built an AI that

Hmm?

00:39:37.377 --> 00:39:39.504 position:50% align:center
And Neiru was too good.

00:39:39.587 --> 00:39:42.007 position:50% align:center
It made Airu quite jealous.

Count me out.

Yep.

I even met a me

Gotcha.

Come to think of it,

that capsule machine

the same as they were before

focus on resting.
