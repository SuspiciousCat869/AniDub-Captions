00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.311 position:50% align:center
I'm Miwa. And you?

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Miwa, huh? I go by Momo.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
"Momo"?

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.863 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Well, just call me whatever.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then, Momotaro?

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE chuckles softly]

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
So... what happened?

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I was molested.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Yeah?

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
Everyday.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
And always by the same person.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
I finally got fed up.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
One day I worked up my courage

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
and screamed
for someone to help.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
Did it work out?

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.476 position:50% align:center
A bunch of people heard
and came running to my rescue.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Good.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.147 position:50% align:center
But... I didn't understand.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.400 position:50% align:center
Like, why pick me when
I'm not even that attractive?

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50% align:center
It was such a mystery.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.572 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
I'm not pretty, right?

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
That's not remotely true.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.330 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
My assailant was a hot shot
executive at my dad's company.

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center
So, they fired my dad.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50% align:center
My mom asked why I couldn't
just put up with the guy.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
She said being groped just
means I'm an attractive person.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:46.439 position:50% align:center
That he only picked me
because I'm so cute.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:47.982 position:50% align:center
Hey, now.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.151 position:50% align:center
None of that mess
was your fault.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.237 position:50% align:center
You're not to blame. 'Kay?

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.907 position:50% align:center
[MIWA]
Momotaro.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.662 position:50% align:center
Please, don't worry.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.038 position:50% align:center
I'll protect you.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
[MIWA]
Thank you.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:08.294 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:12.173 position:50% align:center
[MIWA]
You have such broad shoulders.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.050 position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
We can't just keep running, Ai!

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What else am I supposed to do?

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
[MAKO]
C'mon! We've got to fight back!

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
But I can't see in this mist!

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
Besides... On my own...

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.742 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Ai!

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
[MAKO, MIKO]
Ai!

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
[MAKO]
Here.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
Maybe you could use
this for something?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Mine, too.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
Your penlights?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
This'll work!

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center
Okay! Bring it on!

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.206 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE laughs]

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
Just let me touch you, Miwa!

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
You secretly like it, right?

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
Adults can tell
how much you want it!

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
Go back home to your wife!

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
You got married because
you love each other!

[AI]
Come out here and fight me!

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.608 position:50% align:center
[SACHIKO]
Not a chance!

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Heads up, guys!

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
Such foolish girls!

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap!

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
[SACHIKO laughs]

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
Which would you rather be?

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
Skewered, or turned to stone?

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
Go to hell!

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
[SACHIKO]
Skewered it is, then!

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center

All women have expiration dates!

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center

[MOMOE]
Stay back, Miwa!

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
You're just a perverted brat
who loves being touched.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Come here and I promise

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
to make you feel
really good, sweetheart!

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
Dirty bastard.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
[MIWA]
Okay.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center
You can touch me.

What song are you playing?

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
[MAKO] A real Yu-Yu fan could
never skewer another fan.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.761 position:50% align:center
Especially not while
Yu-Yu is watching!

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
Okay, Ai. Lift the penlights up!

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
Wave them!

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center

I was actually excited.

My time with you was thrilling
and full of suspense.

Yes, of course.

Why did you trick me?

Isn't it obvious?

Getting your muscles

Yes, thanks to you and the Egg.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
It's a thing I realized.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
It seems like fighting there

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
puts a heavier strain
on our bodies.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.814 position:50% align:center
So, it's like
high-altitude training?

Yes.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center
Oh, I gotcha.

Now that you mention it,
I think I'm starting to get abs.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
Well, why not join a
sports club and test them out?

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
Oh. You don't go
to school, do you?

Yes.
