Whoa, hold up.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
So, you're both involved
with Japan Plati?

What do you mean?

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.148 position:50% align:center
Nice try, weirdos.

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
I totally saw
that Misaki lady talking

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
with the two of you,
don't deny it!

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.988 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] I thought you were at
the company, visiting Kotobuki?

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
Did you leave, instead?

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center

the cat's outta the bag now.

[NEIRU]
They're founders.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
That's right.
They started all this.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center

I'll stop if it's weird.

No, it looks awesome!

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
I gotta say,
it really suits you.

Mm-hmm. You're like a princess!

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
Or no. Maybe a noblewoman?

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
Look here.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Kinda meh.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
How cruel.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
Wait. Does that mean
you were human?

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Technically, we still are.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
We kept our brains but
abandoned our mortal bodies.

Ew. That's so creepy.

We used to be young,

[clears throat] Regardless, I'm
sure you have many questions,

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
[AI]
It's from Momo.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
No answer?

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
She got asked out!

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
Shocker, is it another girl?

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.453 position:50% align:center
A boy?

Hey, c'mon! Let's go up there!

Oh, heck yeah!

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center

Hey! Momo!

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
Uh. So, you changed
your hairstyle.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Yes. You, as well.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center

Mm.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
Am I?

Ugh... Skip the niceties and
just give us the tea already!

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
Uh, right... Sure.
So... I had a date.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Where'd you even meet him?

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
Your school is all chicks.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
He follows me online,

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
and the first time
we met, he asked me.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Asked you what?

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
He... He asked me out.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
So cool.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
It's done!

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
It was our first and last date.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
Was this boy rude to you?

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
[MOME]
Nuh-uh.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
Honestly.

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
It's the first time a boy has
ever asked me to go anywhere.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50% align:center
I went all out.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center
I decided that I was
gonna dress super girly.

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
Bare legs, the whole thing.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
But when I showed up
to the meeting place.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
The guy looked
absolutely horrified.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Horrified? What for?

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
Well, it's probably because
he thought I was a boy.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
Anyway, that's the funny
thing that happened today.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
No way are we laughing at that.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
I wish you would.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center
I'll just feel
worse if you don't.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Oh, here's lunch.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
I made my specialty, so eat up.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.330 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hi, Ohto. Something wrong?

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
I heard.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
Someone said you were
quitting your job here.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI]
Yup. It's true.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.719 position:50% align:center
I think I've figured out a way
to make a living as an artist.

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
You're not just running away?

Running?

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
Ohto.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
Not long from now

Hey, Panic? Are you a boy?

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
Or are you a girl?

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.686 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
It must be nice.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
No one judges your appearance.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center

Oh yeah.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
It's kinda embarrassing
for me to talk like a girl.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
Why do you think that?

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
If it helps, you look
plenty feminine to me.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
Unless you're trying
to play up the contrast?

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
So, what's your name?

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
Sawaki. Or Momotaro.

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
Um... Whatever you want.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center

Momo? Momoko?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
Of course. I get it.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
You don't care
if I'm a girl, do you?

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
Just like Haruka.

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
Haruka?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
She's a girl,
but she said she loves me.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
Oh, a lesbian.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.151 position:50% align:center
That's not really me.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
For real.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
Because inside, I'm a boy.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center

[ADVISOR] You're such a cute
and lovely little thing.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
Almost too fragile to hug.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
No idiot in their right mind
would ever believe

take my sweet Kaoru from me?

Who is this creep?

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
My kendo club advisor.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.234 position:50% align:center
I went to him for advice.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
I thought he was a good teacher.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
But instead he pushed me down
in the boardinghouse and.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
[KAORU]
I got pregnant.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
I felt so bad for the
baby, but... I... I...

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
I've heard enough.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
It isn't your fault!

I'm very strong!

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
So am I!

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
You won his trust,
then exploited him.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
I hate cowards like you
more than anything else!

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR] I won't let a brat
like you touch my sweet Kaoru!

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
I'm going to put an end to you
and your disgusting jealousy!

[ADVISOR shrieks]

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.580 position:50% align:center

[ADVISOR]
What do you think you're doing?

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
Who said you could
get on top of me?

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
I'll destroy any man who
makes a pass at my sweet Kaoru.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center

[URA-ACCA] As nice as it is
that you're always worrying

about the other fighters.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.693 position:50% align:center
You should really
focus on your own battles,

bigger problems.

As it turns out,

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
a painting I recently
did won a prize.

The one of Koito?

It's all the way in the back.

Don't get the wrong idea.

Not all girls want
to be protected

and some of us can protect
ourselves, you know.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
Makes sense. Sorry.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
So what about you?

Uh, I guess it depends
how much younger.

She cleared the game?

[ACCA]
Exactly.

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.320 position:50% align:center
Which means you
need to work hard

so you can follow
in her footsteps.

[RIKA] I guess that kind
of makes Momoe the winner?
