00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.266 position:50% align:center
[AI]
No fever.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Pulse is normal, too.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
Then, don't tell me...

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
Did your company tank?

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.731 position:50% align:center
No.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
Did you kill somebody?

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
I did not.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
Okay! Then why would
you do something like this?

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
Something like what,
invite you to my house?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
Shady.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
You must have a reason.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
Pack of lies!

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.292 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] So, you really
just want to hang out with us?

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Yes, I do.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
Count me in! Thanks!

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.672 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Mm. When works for you?

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.633 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Umm. Sunday might be best.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
I'm in, too!

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
With that settled,
let's plan some activities!

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.181 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
This'll be so fun!

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, question.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.934 position:50% align:center
Do you want me to bring
something to snack on?

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
What do you like?

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.521 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Yes! Make it fancy.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.523 position:50% align:center
I asked Neiru, not you!

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:06.566 position:50% align:center
I've got it!

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
I could bring my <i>takoyaki</i> maker.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
No way, forget that junk.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:11.112 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE
"Junk"?

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.822 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Just trust me.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.908 position:50% align:center
Oh, so, does Sunday
work for you, then?

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Sure.

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.286 position:50% align:center
Hey, what about you guys?

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.829 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Of course, I'm down!

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.831 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
And here, we have a recording

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.262 position:50% align:center
of one of the
president's dreams.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
Using technology
developed in our labs,

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.351 position:50% align:center
it's possible to analyze
a person's brainwaves

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.270 position:50% align:center
and then convert the
subject's dreams to video.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
Hey, but, like
they're not dreams.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
They're not exactly
reality, either.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
Wow, science.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
It's amazing!

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.198 position:50% align:center
Ooh! Ai! You should have
them record your dreams.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
I bet we would get a
steamy fantasy out of it!

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.453 position:50% align:center
Stop projecting--I'm
not like you!

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.372 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] I can't believe you
live at your company.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center
This feels like
a weird field trip.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
Totally. Neiru, who are you?

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
That's quite an
existentialist question.

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Exis-a-what now?

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
Are you girls familiar
with a group called Plati?

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
I heard that only people

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
with really high IQs are
allowed to be members.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
Like Miss Neiru.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
She's a member of Japan Plati.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wow.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
Does that mean
you're a genius, Neiru?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50% align:center
No, I'm just good
at thinking logically.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
She's smart and modest.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
I'm a product of artificial
insemination.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
Oh, so when you said
you never had parents,

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
you meant literally.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:01.991 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
They won't tell you
who your parents are?

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
There's no point.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
It was nothing more
than a pairing.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
This whole thing sure puts
my problems into perspective.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
Floor B9.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
We're here.

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
This is our medical floor.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Are you a doctor too, Neiru?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] No, I'm not normally
in charge of this floor.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
I'm just filling in
for the moment.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.893 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Jeez, are we there yet?

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
--[NEIRU] Here.
--[RIKA] Whoa!

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
If you'll excuse me...

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
Yes. Thank you.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
[RIKA, MOMOE]
Thank you very much, Miss.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
Awesome!
Is this your room, Neiru?

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:45.702 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Dang, book city!

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Hey, Neiru?

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
What's this guy's name?

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
Adam.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
Can I pet him?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Man, you should
clean up all this paper.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Come here, Adam.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.632 position:50% align:center
Ready for that <i>takoyaki</i> party?

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait here a moment.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Ugh, I've got exams next week.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
I haven't studied
for them at all.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
I never do.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Neiru, you're so lucky.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
You're just a kid, but you
run this huge, fancy company.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's like we live in
entirely different universes.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
That's not true.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rika, think it's time?

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
All right, let's get started!

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] Yesterday, Rika and
I really got into planning.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
You know,
fun activities and stuff.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
I love this color.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Well?

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
Do we look mature?

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
We thought it might be fun
if we all painted our nails.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
Have you guys done that?

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
I'll do Neiru's.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:49.432 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Show me your hands.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Give me a chance!

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
I won't screw 'em up!

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
You're good at this, Momo.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center
You could go pro.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.778 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
I do like it, but I'd
rather be a dietitian.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
I'm considering
going to college for it.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
Wow. I'm impressed.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
You're already
planning your life.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
I wanna travel abroad
when I graduate.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
I think working overseas
would be exciting!

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
Then I could get married
to a hot European guy.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
Typical Rika.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
where I'd wanna go.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Hang on, we're not
talking about a vacation.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
[AI] Right. I do know that
I want to try living on my own.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Me, too.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
That's always been
a dream of mine.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
There. All done.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
[AI]
One's a different color.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
We match.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
[AI]
And you, Neiru?

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
What's your big dream?

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Oh yeah,
you haven't told us yet.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
Guess we're doing that.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
Sharing all our big dreams.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
I think I'll probably
just stay like this forever.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
Come on, I didn't
mean that before.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
You don't have to run
a company your whole life.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
Oh! If you like books,
why not become a writer?

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Let me introduce a friend.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
I want you all to meet her.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
Your friend?

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
So, who is she?

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
She's my friend.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
Her name's Kotobuki Awano.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
Born here, like me.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
Hi, Kotobuki.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Adam is her pet rat.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Her hair color.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
She's albino.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
She's beautiful.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
They're good luck.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
At least, I've heard they bring
fortune to those around them.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] Kotobuki was always
cheerful and optimistic.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
Nothing ever seemed
to get her down.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center
She always told me
to enjoy myself.

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
[AI]
"Was"?

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Isn't she just sleeping?

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
She's in a vegetative state.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Huh?

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
Kotobuki was a
doctor of psychiatry.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
She was scientifically
analyzing life's mysteries.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
In particular,
those about death.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
She performed
near-death experiments,

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
and eventually,
she didn't come back.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
That's crazy.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
Scientists want
to solve hard problems.

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
It's in their nature.

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
[AI]
You two were pretty close, huh?

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
Yes. I saw her
in a dream recently.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
[AI]
A dream?

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.465 position:50% align:center
An Egg dream.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
He's incredible.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Pinky.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Is he a type of corn snake?

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Who knows?

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time, Neiru.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Kotobuki.

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Is Adam well?

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Yes.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
You look well, too.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
I guess. I'm not bored.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're here, though.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.410 position:50% align:center
I get a chance
to say goodbye to you.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
I thank God for that.

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
But we're not children of God.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
Did you forget?

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI] Scientists who can't
believe in God are incompetent.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
I'm not a scientist, Kotobuki.

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
You know that.

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
'Course I do.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
I'm just needling you.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
You'll protect me, right?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
Or would you prefer
that I protect you?

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
Oh, nice.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center
A lovely weapon.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Let's really enjoy ourselves.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR SEKI]
There you are!

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Pinky!

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
What is that?

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.543 position:50% align:center
It's hilarious!

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
C'mon, faster! Faster!

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
They'll catch us
if we don't hurry.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
Kotobuki, why did you die?

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
Why couldn't you
come back that time?

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.638 position:50% align:center
When that much
adrenaline enters the brain,

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
they say you see
a field of flowers,

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center
and it helps you overcome
the fear of death.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.894 position:50% align:center
It's true, and when I saw it,

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
I wanted to pick one
and bring it back to you.

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.190 position:50% align:center
This isn't a joke!

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
I won't forgive your clowning.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
The me from the world
that you live in really did die.

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
But that allowed me
to experience it.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
I was right, Neiru:
Parallel worlds do exist!

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
The possibility of other worlds
that might have been.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
It always was your favorite
genre of science fiction.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI] Yes! Our parallel
selves are alive somewhere!

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.378 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Yeah, that's nice,

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
but this version of me
can't see you ever again.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
Being satisfied with just
seeing each other is so common.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
We're not some couple that
can't handle long-distance.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
And I can't be
philosophical about it.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
At stage four Thanatos,
there was a sweet smell.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.902 position:50% align:center
The best way to
describe it is honey-like.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
I felt just like
an insect preyed on

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
by a carnivorous plant.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
The temptation of death?

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Not so much "temptation."

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
More like my mind
and body were abducted.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Abducted? By what?

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
By innocent sorrow.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR SEKI] What chatty
little guinea pigs you are!

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Ow. That hurt.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Where's Pinky?

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Back in my pendant.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.
He'll regenerate soon.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
I see.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.065 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I'm not going to give up.

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
No matter what it takes,

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:33.526 position:50% align:center
I'll go to the place
where you died

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
and bring your
statue back to life--

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
You can't envision dying.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
You can't think outside the box.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
Abstraction was
always difficult for you.

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] Then I'll use
near-death experiments too.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.372 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Don't be ridiculous.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
If you went to that zone,
you'd die, too.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
What would happen to me
in your reality then?

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR SEKI]
Ugh!

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
Where did you go?

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
You must know.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.968 position:50% align:center
The government will come
for my body eventually.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.221 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I won't let them do that.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
It's just a container.

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
But I was attached
to it in my own way.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
I don't want adults
messing with it.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Then you must also understand

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
what I want you to do.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
--No.
--[KOTOBUKI] Stop that.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
I know you're not that obtuse.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Why?

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why
you're always so selfish!

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
It isn't fair.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
You left me to deal with it all!

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
Why can't you just praise me for
my innovative research methods?

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
Don't you ever consider
other's feelings, Kotobuki?

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
That's just how I am.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
It's not normal
to die for science!

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
But isn't abnormality more fun?

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
It's not any fun for me!

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
Aw, look at your sweet face.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
You've made some
new friends, haven't you?

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
How did...?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
You're soft.

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
Softer than you used to be.

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.496 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
It's different.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
They're not like us.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50% align:center
Still, you made
connections with people.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
That's a wonderful
thing, regardless.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
Treasure them.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
It's so hard without you there.

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
I'll make friends
with those girls,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
if only in some
other world-line.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI screams]

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
I finally caught you,
You're mine now, you cocky brat.

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
Ow. Ow!

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR SEKI]
Kotobuki, I won't be satisfied

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
until I cut open that pretty
little chest of yours.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Who are you?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR SEKI] Thanks for asking,
Kotobuki. I'm Doctor Seki!

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
You stole my job as
chief of the medical center!

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
Now, I will analyze every
single micron of your body

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.747 position:50% align:center
and return to those
sweet, glory days!

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
I remember, you're the weird guy
who was obsessed with my body.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
So, this must be
my trauma, then.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
It's true, he is the last person
I would want to dissect me.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
You're right.

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR SEKI]
You fools!

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
I am the world-famous
Doctor Seki!

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
I have numerous doctorates!

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
My papers have been
published in <i>Future Magazine</i> !

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's cute.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
I've been on
the cover of <i>Future</i> .

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
Same here.

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
Ha! I reject that!

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
If it's true,
then solve this problem.

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
It's ultra-difficult with a
zero-percent success rate!

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
Find the radius of a circle

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
that intersects points
A, B, C, and D.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.024 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Only a genius can solve it.

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
This problem
will be easy for me.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Same here, let's do this.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
You moronic children
could never figure it out!

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
You just wait.

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
I'm going to blow your mind!

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
Then answer it!

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
--[KOTOBUKI] Then here goes.
--[NEIRU] Here we go.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
There is no such circle!

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
But it can't be.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
These little girls solved a
problem not even I could?

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.879 position:50% align:center
And they were able
to do so in seconds?

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
There's no need.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.140 position:50% align:center
That doctor what's-his-name.

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
He had pride, if nothing else.

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:35.560 position:50% align:center
Proud chicken.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
Was it really that funny?

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
No, you just sounded
like a friend of mine.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Bravo.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
Take care of the me in reality.

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
You got it.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
What should you do?

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
I wanna hear it in your words.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI] Because I know you'll
always be true to your word.

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] Fine, I will personally
disconnect your life support.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
You should be.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Thank you.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
So Kotobuki was in an Egg?

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:13.139 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Yes.

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
There can't even
be a miracle now.

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
Kotobuki is dead.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
But, even so, like, you're not
a relative, you can't just...

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.107 position:50% align:center
I know that.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.527 position:50% align:center
But, still, if I delay, then the
government will come for her.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
An albino genius is
an invaluable sample.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a crappy excuse!

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
So? Is that a reason
to kill someone?

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
She still looks alive.
Like she's only sleeping.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
She's already dead.

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
It's just a container.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
but I can't support this.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
It's very different

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
from killing Seeno Evils
in there or the Haters.

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Yeah! This is for real.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
That's going too far,

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
whether she asked you
to do it or not.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:57.475 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
you're even considering

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
pulling the plug on her!

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.395 position:50% align:center
Then you should just go home.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
I didn't ask you here
for a field trip.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
It's not fair for you
to put it like that.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
We're worried about this, too.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
Oh? About what?

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.656 position:50% align:center
About you, our friend!

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.033 position:50% align:center
If you go through with it,

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
you'll have trauma and baggage,
or something worse!

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
Good, I see no problem, then.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
I'm not sentimental about
stopping a cadaver's breath.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
The dead don't need
to respire, anyway.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.506 position:50% align:center
Is that what you really feel?

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
Being smart is scary.

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
I'm much more terrified
of the hot-headed passions

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.888 position:50% align:center
of those driven
by their feelings.

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
Like me?

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
Was that a cheap shot at me?
Well, was it?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Stop it, you guys!

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
Kotobuki can hear you!

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
Huh. I guess that's normal
human sentimentality, right?

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
Worrying that she might
be able to hear us.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.653 position:50% align:center
It's absurd.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
Please, just think
about it, okay?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
If nothing else,
sleep on it first.

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center
I have to go back, sorry.

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Hey, Ai!

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
Ai can get close to her.

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
She might reach Neiru.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
Maybe even change
her mind about things.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Yeah, I guess.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
It seems like
Neiru's being stubborn.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
Ai might get through, though.

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI] President Aonuma is
getting closer to the truth

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
behind the temptation of death.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Kotobuki did give her a hint.

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
Innocent sorrow.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
You managed to deflect her

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
with an excuse, though. Heh heh.

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
The suicides of young girls.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
If we gave the real reason,

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
none of them would
be motivated to fight.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Yeah.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
Especially if they knew the
root cause is the two of us.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Do you think so?

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
I think they would
actually fight against you.

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.592 position:50% align:center
Because they're girls,

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
they understand
the sorrows of other girls.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
The heck?

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.306 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
So, Neiru's assistant is
connected to Accas somehow?

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
You came to stop me?

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
[AI] I want to hear
more about Kotobuki.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I see.

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What else did she say?

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
What else?

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Why did she want you to do that?

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
She doesn't want adults
experimenting on her.

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
If you'd told us
that to begin with,

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
the others would have
been more understanding.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Mm.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
You're not very upfront, Neiru.

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU shudders]

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
I tried.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
I tried hard to push it,
but my fingers were shaky.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Mm.

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
This one time, Koito and I tried
fortune-telling with Kokkuri.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
We asked if Koito's
crush liked her back.

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
In hindsight, it was
probably Mister Sawaki.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Yeah.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
[AI]
The coin landed on "yes."

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
I didn't move it,
so I thought Koito did,

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
but she seemed
really happy about it.

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
I wondered if
she'd be that happy

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
if she'd moved the coin herself,

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
I think I would have been able
to tell but she seemed genuine.

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
Was it me?

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
Maybe I moved it without knowing

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
because I wanted
to make Koito happy.

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
I really can't say,
and I think that's fantasy.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
With two of us...

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU, AI]
...it's fantasy.

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Kotobuki's body was scheduled

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
for collection tomorrow morning.

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Yeah.

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
Did you want something
done to her before that?

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
I mean, it was you

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
who made Neiru's Wonder Egg
Kotobuki, wasn't it?

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Just a coincidence.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Thank you.

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
"It is the hour to be drunken!

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
Be drunken, if you would not
be martyred slaves of Time.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
Be drunken continually!

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
With wine, with poetry,
or with virtue, as you will."

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
Let's really enjoy ourselves.

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.618 position:50% align:center
[KOTOBUKI]
We only live once, after all.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.005 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
To be continued.
