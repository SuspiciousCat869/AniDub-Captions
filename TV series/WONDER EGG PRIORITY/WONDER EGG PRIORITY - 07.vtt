[NEIRU]
You look good.

[AI]
You all free today?

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Morning.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
Ai's school has lapel pins?

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.591 position:50% align:center
[AI]
When can I message you?

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:52.469 position:50% align:center
Yup. I'll lose it.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I have a conference at one.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center
Before noon works.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.223 position:50% align:center
[AI] I'll bring
my phone, be in touch!

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
My school allows phones.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Don't copy... my strongman.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
This is cute.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.111 position:50% align:center
Ai- <i>kyun</i> , your skirt's short.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
Rika. Hold up.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Happy birthday.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.005 position:50% align:center
Here, buy yourself
something pretty.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:31.841 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Keep it.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.678 position:50% align:center
Tell me about Dad instead.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.222 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:40.725 position:50% align:center
Still hanging onto that, huh?

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.395 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.230 position:50% align:center
Why do you want
to see him so bad?

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:46.981 position:50% align:center
He left, remember?

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.359 position:50% align:center
I remember he left you.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a cruel thing
to say to your mother.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
Listen, you're too young
to understand, but--

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.533 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
You reek of alcohol!

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
[AI] Get this, Leon will eat
anything, even when he's small.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center

I thought they were carnivorous.

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
[AI]
You're here!

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
Hey, happy birthday!

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Ai!

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
Ooh, we should celebrate.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
For me and Ai
not being a shut-in.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
What's up with the
sudden change of heart?

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
Nothing. I just realized
beating myself up at home

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
wouldn't solve anything.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
Whoa, beating yourself up?

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
You've got some real
weird kinks there, kiddo!

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
That's not what I meant!

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
Whatever you say!

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
How was school today?

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
Didn't you used to get bullied?

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
Oddly enough, it was okay.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
It was bully-free.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
They gave me a lot of space.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
Probably 'cause
I was out for so long.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
You're really okay with that?

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Mm.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't mind.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
Even if I'm alone at school,

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
I have you guys to hang out
with, so it's all good.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
No cap!

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
--[AI] Yeah!
--[MOMOE] Yep!

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
If anything bad
happens, tell us.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] Worse comes to worst,
feed the bullies to Leon.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
After all, he loves Haters.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
Good point!

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I know.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
See?

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
Having friends
can be helpful, huh?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
That's right, so let us
know if you ever need help.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
Oh, I will.

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
Now... I'm gonna make you
guys listen to me complain

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
for the rest of the day!

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
What about?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
Here's my deck of dads.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
Whoa, no way!

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
Sugar-daddies?

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
Ew, gross!

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
I'm saying that one of these
dudes is my real father!

00:04:56.338 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
The question is, which one?

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50% align:center
Wow, for real?

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Check it, I feel
like this guy and I

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
might have
the same eyebrows.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
That said, I have no way
of actually knowing.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
And if I were being honest,

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
it might not be
any of these men.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
What do you mean?

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
This woman promised.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50% align:center
When I got into middle school,

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
I could meet my real dad.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
But then, she bailed on me.

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI laughs]

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
Here's the thing.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
I don't know!

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
Maybe that sounds crazy,
but there is some good news.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
I'm almost positive it's one
of the men in those pictures.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI laughs] C'mon,
what's with the long face?

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
I gave birth to you,
so if nothing else,

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
at least you know that
I'm your legitimate mother!

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.935 position:50% align:center
That should be more than
enough for you, Rika.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
I think that
pissed me off the most.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
That sucks.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know!

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
I'd probably get
along great with my dad.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
I bet you that's the real reason
why she won't let me meet him.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
You think?

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
She'll do anything to
stop me from being happy.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
She's got a major
persecution complex

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
and thinks she some
kinda tragic heroine.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.378 position:50% align:center
That's enough.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
It just feels wrong to listen
to you insult your mother.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
I thought you were on my side.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
I am, it's why I said something.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.192 position:50% align:center
Look, it's not like I enjoy

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
trash talking my
mom or whatever.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
But you know,

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
she's not out winning
any mom of the year awards.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
Like, she throws a fit
when things don't go her way,

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
and all she does is tell me
a bunch of half-assed lies.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
She's never once told me
that she's sorry for anything!

00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
The only thing she cares
about is her stupid pride.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center
Always ranting about how she
"should have been happier."

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
As if it it's not her own fault.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
I think that's why
she hates me so much.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.304 position:50% align:center
I honestly believe she feels
like her life would be easier

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
if I were never in
the picture to begin with.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] I'm sure
your mom has her reasons.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
From the sound of it,
you hate her, too.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.404 position:50% align:center
I believe that's
called "codependence."

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
If you don't make a clean break,
then nothing will change.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center
I don't need a dumb lecture

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
from some goody
two shoes like you!

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
I'm outta here.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Rika!

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Rika!

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Disgusting.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ai.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd chase after me.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.074 position:50% align:center
I figured you wanted me to.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I'll join you.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
For what?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
Trashing our moms.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
Don't force it.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
I've got complaints too, y'know.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
Besides, we're a club.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
The Single-Mom Crew.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.095 position:50% align:center
That's a terrible name.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Ai.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
I'm Serious Rika now.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
So, I'd like to be honest.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna
tell me about earlier?

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
I dunno, I guess
all the bad memories

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
just sort of hit me at once.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center
That must have been
really hard for you.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
I hate my mom, too.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
Right now, at least.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
I'm lowkey worried
that I might end up

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
just like mine one day.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I think we'll both be fine.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Maybe.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Sometimes, grown-ups feel like

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
they're a whole
different species!

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on, don't
they get married and bang

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.604 position:50% align:center
because they're into that stuff?

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
Do I not understand
because I'm still a kid?

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:35.367 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
I just don't get it!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
That was Rika, wasn't it?

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
Sounds like she's fine.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.008 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. Knowing Rika,

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
she'll be back to her
usual self by tomorrow.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
I wonder if I'm not meant
to live in female society.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.477 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Why?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
I always just say
exactly what I think.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
And what I think is
logical and correct.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
wrong with you, Neiru.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's better
than agreeing with everything.

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
It might sound strange,

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
but I don't know what it's
like to worry about parents.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] Oh, do you get
along well with yours, then?

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.166 position:50% align:center
I don't have parents
to argue with.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it's for the best.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
It's spared me a lot of trouble.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] You see the smallest
of the lights, way over there?

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
That's probably our bar.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
Cool.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.474 position:50% align:center
So, question:

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
How often do you see your dad?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
Once I month, I guess.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
You're lucky.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
Your mom doesn't try
to keep him from you.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
Even though your parents broke
up, he's still in your life.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
I fantasize about mine.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
All the time.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
Since I can't see him.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
He said, "A pretty woman
never needs a wallet."

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
His gentle voice
is all I remember.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
But his face is just a blur.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
Someday you'll meet him.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
Someday, huh?

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
I want to meet him right now.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
You know?

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.902 position:50% align:center
Well, moping over!

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:35.403 position:50% align:center
I'll see you later!

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
Thanks for talking.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
Night!

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
[AI]
See ya.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Mannen! You handle the Haters!

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
Teacher?

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
So, this is today's assignment.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
[SHINO]
Thank goodness.

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
Now you can be saved, as well.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER A]
You know Ikeda Clinic?

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.693 position:50% align:center
The old guy there
is awful at giving shots.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER C]
Hi, Rika! Happy birthday.

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER B]
It's her birthday?

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:19.614 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER C]
Yep! It's today.

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
Welcome home.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER D] Wow, how
old's the birthday girl?

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rika!

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center
Don't forget about
your birthday cake!

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER C]
She's at that age.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.587 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Always!

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER D]
She has her mother's eyes.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER A] Will you carry
on this place together?

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI] Who knows?
Youth is wasted on the young!

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Yeah. Drop dead.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
No... I can't...

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:14.002 position:50% align:center
My little turtle, Mannen. <i>Redi.</i>

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
<i>Redi.</i> Come back, okay?

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
[SHINO] Your worries
are about to go away.

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50% align:center
Vanish! Pooof, all gone!

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.433 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Ugh, who's the freak show?

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
My teacher!

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
The only one who
can tell you to connect

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
with the cosmic truth!

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
Yes, entrust everything to me.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
Do so, and you shall be saved!

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
Saved!

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
Sorry, creep,
I don't need saving!

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.457 position:50% align:center
[SHINO screams]

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
That's that.

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
Stupid old wind bag.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
What have you done? Why
would you attack our teacher?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
Teacher?

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
Yes, of love, the universe,
and the spiritual!

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
[SHINO]
Mother was in poor health

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
and Father was
struggling at work.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
We were cursed by karma
from our past lives!

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
So that's why we got rid
of them, earthly attachments!

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
We abandoned our house,
money, everything,

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
so our whole family could
connect to the cosmos instead!

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:23.988 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Are you stupid?

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
You got swindled and
then killed yourselves.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
You say that,
yet you suffer, too.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDE] Deep down,
we're all the same inside.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:40.213 position:50% align:center
Everyone is fixated on worthless
appearances and hierarchies.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
Those who have grow arrogant

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
and those who have
not grow envious.

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
Talk about your new-age BS.

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
Says the girl who cuts herself.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
So join us and vanish.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
It's much easier.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
You'll feel better.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.153 position:50% align:center
It can be easier?

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
[SHINO]
Yes.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Acca, tell me how Rika's doing.

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] You should focus
on your own battles.

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
[AI]
She was crying, I'm worried.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Rika might be in a fix.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
Ura-Acca.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.000 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Please!

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.918 position:50% align:center
Tell me what's happening to her!

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
Well, she's...
given up on fighting.

00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDE] Relax, my child,
everyone who is held in my arms

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
are linked to the
mysteries of the cosmos.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
You're still too tense.

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDE]
See?

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center
It doesn't hurt, does it?

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.276 position:50% align:center
No.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.737 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDE]
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
Your tiny self can
become something greater,

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
you can be part
of a vast energy.

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.828 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
My tiny self.

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:56.206 position:50% align:center
[SHINO] Yes, you'll become
one with the teacher.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDE]
There's no need to envy others.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
You don't need to
hate anyone ever again.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
You'll erase your bad karma

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
and become one
with the universe.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
That sounds great.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.553 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I like that idea.

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Rika!

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
Don't listen to those people!

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Ai?

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
Yep. And not just me.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
Everybody's here.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
Yeah. This isn't like you, Rika.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
Don't give up.

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
Not in a place like this!

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.031 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
And what, exactly, is "like me"?

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
Rika!

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
Pull yourself together!

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Come on!

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Please! Just talk to us, Rika!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.247 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Hang in there!

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Snap out of it!

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Man. I'm just so tired.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDE]
Then relax.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:47.465 position:50% align:center
Surrender yourself to me.

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
[SHINO]
It's okay, Rika.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.848 position:50% align:center
Now you can be saved,
just as I was saved.

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.225 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Yeah. I'd like that.

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
Make it go away.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
Oh my. Will we lose one?

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:05.567 position:50% align:center
Seems possible.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
Now... I shall give
you the hug of life!

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
Father.

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
Mannen.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:30.300 position:50% align:center
What's that turtle doing?

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to deal
with the Haters, remember?

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
Mannen imprinted on me.

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
So he thinks I'm his mom.

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
You have to keep your mom safe.

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:57.827 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Rika!

00:17:57.911 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Please, Rika!

00:17:58.828 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Come back to us!

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
[AI] We're all here
for you, so please!

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
Mannen!

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
That was close.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
Another minute and
I would have turned into

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
a selfish, piece-of-shit mother.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
My mom isn't perfect,
but she did teach me one thing.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
Men who beg women
for their money...

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
...are nothing but
a bunch of fakes!

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
No, that isn't true!

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
My teacher isn't a fake!

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
He channels--the whole cosmos!

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
Believe whatever you want!

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Who cares--if he
channels it--or scrambles it?

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
[RIKA roars]

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
[RIKA laughs]

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
Mannen. Let's go!

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
I'll knock you off your
feet--with a shot to the heart!

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
Whoa! You're a heavy fella.

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
There there.

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
You're weak, too.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
You cut yourself.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
But that's why I have
to keep coming

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:38.803 position:50% align:center
to this place and fighting.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:41.598 position:50% align:center
So I can balance my priorities.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
It's true I'm weak.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
But... that's the real me.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
I may be hurting myself.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
But I'm going to live!

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Rika!

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Ai!
This is the real "hug of life."

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Rika.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Rika.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
Please don't die.

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
Same to you.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
So then! What's on
the agenda today, girls?

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
[AI]
You tell us!

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
You're still awake?

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:40.532 position:50% align:center
I got hungry.

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
There's some cake in the fridge.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
[CHIAKI]
Probably all dried out, though.

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:52.335 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Life is rough.

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
When did I get so damn old?

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
You're only 40.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
I'm 38.

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
You were right.

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
It is dry.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
Sometimes...

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.941 position:50% align:center
...I feel like you'll
abandon me, too, Rika.

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Mm.

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
But... not right now.

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.879 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
To be continued.
