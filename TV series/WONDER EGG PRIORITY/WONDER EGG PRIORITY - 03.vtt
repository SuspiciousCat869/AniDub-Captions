[MONSTER]
I absolutely love young women!

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:22.833 align:middle
Let me gobble them up!

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:24.042 align:middle
[RIKA]
Oh, yeah?

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle
Then just go pay for
a prostitute, creep.

[MONSTER cries out]

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle
[GIRL]
Thank you for protecting me.

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle
For sure, no problem.

00:00:44.708 --> 00:00:46.083 align:middle
Okay?

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.875 align:middle
They're all sweaty. Super gross.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:01.583 align:middle
Well, whatever.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle
You know, I'd look good
in a flower garden.

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:06.625 align:middle
A real cute statue.

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:09.833 align:middle
Not some sweaty fatso like you.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.625 align:middle
[AI hums]

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:47.833 align:middle
[ACCA]
Don't overdo it.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.583 align:middle
Be prudent, not fast.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.333 align:middle
[AI]
Thank you.

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:54.125 align:middle
[URA-ACCA]
See you next time.

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle
Come on, Ura-Acca,
show a little concern.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:58.333 align:middle
[thud]

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:00.917 align:middle
[RIKA whimpers]

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.458 align:middle
Whoa, you okay?

00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:04.125 align:middle
Where does it hurt?

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:07.042 align:middle
[shudders]
Feels like my ribs.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:08.583 align:middle
I think they might be broken.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle
You should go to the--

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.458 align:middle
[cries out]

00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:13.042 align:middle
They never told me
my body would get hurt

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.875 align:middle
in the real world!

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.292 align:middle
[ACCA]
I'm terribly sorry,

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:19.917 align:middle
but what happens to you
is really none of our concern.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.958 align:middle
[URA-ACCA]
That's your responsibility.

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:23.333 align:middle
[AI]
You're so mean!

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:25.333 align:middle
[URA-ACCA]
Get used to it.

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:27.625 align:middle
[exhales]

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.792 align:middle
I guess even
weird adults still suck.

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.208 align:middle
Oh. I'm okay now.

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:38.958 align:middle
Name's Rika Kawai.

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:40.083 align:middle
As in "kawaii."

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:41.417 align:middle
'Cause I'm a cutie.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle
So, are you here
to save your friend, too?

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.333 align:middle
Are those color contacts?

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:46.583 align:middle
Huh?

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle
Mixing the colors
like that totally slays.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle
Viral idea.

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:54.292 align:middle
[AI]
What? I, uh...

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:55.875 align:middle
Does it bother you?

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle
Oh, my bad. So, anyway,

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:01.708 align:middle
I kind of forgot
my wallet today.

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle
Sorry, but think
you can spot me?

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.375 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:07.208 align:middle
The weird bag-faced
guys didn't tell me

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:08.875 align:middle
the second one would cost money.

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.792 align:middle
[ACCA]
I most certainly did tell you.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:11.958 align:middle
Whatevs!

00:04:12.042 --> 00:04:13.917 align:middle
It'd be a pain to
go back for my wallet.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.417 align:middle
Come on! I'll pay you back.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.708 align:middle
Oh, uh, yeah. Fine.

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.417 align:middle
Just this once.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle
Wow, aren't we trusting?

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:25.708 align:middle

Here.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:27.667 align:middle
[RIKA]
Thanks so much!

00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:32.083 align:middle
Come see Rika again, okay?

00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:35.708 align:middle
Ha, gotcha!

[phone buzzes]

00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.333 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.875 align:middle

Whoa, Rika?

Wait, how did
you know where I live?

Ai-kyun, Ai-Ai, I-chan,
Ai-ty, Aijorina.

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:22.125 align:middle
so what's your nickname?

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:27.125 align:middle
"Ohto." I don't
really have a nickname.

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:31.292 align:middle
Oh, it's like that.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:32.833 align:middle
I followed you yesterday.

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle
To pay me back?
That's awesome.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:38.125 align:middle
[RIKA] Actually,
I forgot my wallet again.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:42.083 align:middle
[RIKA]
Are you visiting someone here?

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle

Yeah.

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:44.958 align:middle
Her name's Neiru.

[RIKA]
Neigh-ru?

00:05:45.917 --> 00:05:47.667 align:middle
Is she a horse?

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.083 align:middle
[RIKA laughs]

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle
[DOCTOR]
Don't rush your rehabilitation.

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle
[NEIRU]
I'm fine.

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.292 align:middle
[DOCTOR sighs] You have to
give your body time to rest.

00:05:57.375 --> 00:06:00.292 align:middle
If you don't, you'll
only make things worse.

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:01.542 align:middle
What a pessimist!

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:05.208 align:middle
Calm down. We've got
youth on our side, doc!

00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:08.083 align:middle
[DOCTOR] Well, don't put
too much confidence in that.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle
You're totally right.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:12.625 align:middle
I'll be careful.

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:15.958 align:middle

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.167 align:middle

Thank you.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.417 align:middle

No problem.

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle
Oh! Oh yeah.

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:35.625 align:middle
Here. Don't overdo it, though.

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:39.583 align:middle
I promise. Thank you.

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.917 align:middle

Yeah, it's Kawai
like in "kawaii."

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:47.917 align:middle
'Cause I'm a cutie.

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:53.792 align:middle
I'm sure.

Hey, you wanna form
a unit with me? Get this.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.875 align:middle
I used to be a junior idol,
in a group called All-Out Kiss.

00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:04.875 align:middle
Ever heard of us?

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:05.708 align:middle
Never.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.417 align:middle
We broke up, anyway.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle
The other members
were a bunch of uggos.

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:12.917 align:middle
But you and I would
be supes popular.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.708 align:middle
Not interested.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle
[RIKA]
Your loss.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:20.625 align:middle
[RIKA]
Mmm... Mmm...

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:23.375 align:middle
Man, I love kiwi.

00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle
What about me?

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle
[RIKA]
Hmmm...

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.042 align:middle
[AI gasps]

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:34.208 align:middle
[RIKA]
Hmmm...

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:36.458 align:middle
You've got nice legs, so...

00:07:36.542 --> 00:07:38.333 align:middle
Back-up dancer! 'Kay?

00:07:38.417 --> 00:07:39.542 align:middle
Uh...

Ai?

00:07:51.917 --> 00:07:53.375 align:middle
What the...?

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:54.875 align:middle
Well, hello there!

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.375 align:middle
Are you a friend?

00:07:57.458 --> 00:07:58.583 align:middle
I'm Rika Kawai.

00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:00.375 align:middle
Like "kawaii,"
'cause I'm a cutie.

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle
[AI]
Whoa, hold up!

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle
[SAWAKI] Welcome home,
you brought a friend?

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:06.833 align:middle
I should leave for today.

00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle
I don't want to intrude
on your company.

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:11.292 align:middle
Oh, right. Sure thing.

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:13.208 align:middle
Sorry, Mister Sawaki.

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:14.292 align:middle
[SAWAKI]
Don't be.

00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:15.417 align:middle
Really. It's no trouble.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.625 align:middle
Man, your dad is
kind of a hottie.

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle
[AI]
He's not my dad.

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:20.792 align:middle
[TAE]
Please, make yourself at home.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.125 align:middle
Are you girls hungry?

00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:23.708 align:middle
I have snacks.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle
[RIKA]
Your school counselor?

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:28.833 align:middle
No way.

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.708 align:middle
So... you some kinda shut in?

00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:34.042 align:middle
[AI]
Yeah. Since this semester.

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle
Ah. Is it for attention?

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:37.417 align:middle
I'm sorry?

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.208 align:middle
[RIKA] Like, is it a ploy
to get your hot counselor

00:08:39.292 --> 00:08:40.875 align:middle
to worry about you?

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle
No, of course not!

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:44.958 align:middle
It's because Koito passed away.

00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:47.458 align:middle
[RIKA]
Koito, huh?

00:08:47.542 --> 00:08:49.375 align:middle
She was the only
real friend I had.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:52.042 align:middle
Jeez, can you drop
the depressed act?

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.958 align:middle
You'll make me lose my appetite.

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.708 align:middle
[AI] Aren't you trying
to save your friend, too?

00:08:58.792 --> 00:09:02.792 align:middle
[RIKA] She's not my friend.
She's my fan.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:07.083 align:middle
AKA, my little wallet who'd
buy me anything I wanted.

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:08.917 align:middle
Your "wallet"?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.333 align:middle
My dad says a beautiful woman
doesn't need a wallet.

00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:15.292 align:middle
Because someone will
always offer to pay for her.

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:17.958 align:middle
Though... he's
mega divorced now.

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:20.583 align:middle
Oh, but I'll pay
you back for the Egg.

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:22.375 align:middle
I promise.

00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle
[knocking]

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.000 align:middle
Yeah?

00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:28.875 align:middle
Whoa! Looks amazing!

00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.167 align:middle
Yeah, you'd better.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.167 align:middle
[RIKA] I've been tight on
cash ever since Chiemi died.

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:36.667 align:middle
Which is why
I have to go save her

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle
if I'm ever going
to get my wallet back.

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle
Chiemi's ugly.

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:43.833 align:middle
She's like a giant fatso
and has the grossest,

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.333 align:middle
most sweaty palms
you've ever seen.

00:09:46.417 --> 00:09:49.333 align:middle
I'd be too embarrassed
to call her a friend.

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:52.167 align:middle
Your friends are picked
by their looks?

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.917 align:middle
[RIKA]
Mm-hmm.

00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:00.875 align:middle
You gonna eat that?

00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.833 align:middle
You mind?

00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:04.083 align:middle
I do.

00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:11.458 align:middle
[RIKA]
What about your friend?

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:13.292 align:middle
Was she cute?

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:14.625 align:middle
[AI]
Yeah.

00:10:14.708 --> 00:10:17.833 align:middle
Well, more pretty than cute.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.583 align:middle
[RIKA]
Like the girl from earlier?

00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:23.583 align:middle
[AI] Neiru is cool, but Koito
was more gentle and soft.

00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:26.167 align:middle
She was graceful
and innocent, I guess.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.625 align:middle
[RIKA giggles]
You're just as bad.

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:30.292 align:middle
I'm not!

00:10:30.375 --> 00:10:31.542 align:middle
[RIKA]
Ugh, cold and sticky.

00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:33.667 align:middle
[AI]
Sorry!

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.125 align:middle
[RIKA sighs]

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:39.292 align:middle
[RIKA]
Well, I'll go grab a towel.

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:52.500 align:middle
[RIKA]
Ai, lend me some PJs!

00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:38.708 align:middle
[AI]
Did you call your parents?

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:40.917 align:middle
[RIKA]
"Rika?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.042 align:middle
Who cares about her?"

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:48.625 align:middle
[RIKA] Scratch the surface,
and she's all slimy.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle
Everyone is.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle
[AI] Long baths
will dry out your skin.

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle
[exhales]

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.333 align:middle
I'm done with cutting.

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:11.333 align:middle
I made a promise.

00:12:17.167 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle
[AI]
Koito! Is clu--

00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:22.792 align:middle
[KOITO cries]

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.542 align:middle
Ai?

00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:27.292 align:middle
[SAWAKI]
Ohto?

00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:33.833 align:middle
[AI]
Excuse me!

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle
[AI]
Why Koito?

00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:57.792 align:middle
Was it because of Mister Sawaki?

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:06.417 align:middle
[RIKA]
I knew it.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.208 align:middle
You don't look that great
in a flower garden either.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.458 align:middle
Look.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.792 align:middle
Over there you can see
my little wallet, Chiemi.

00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:18.458 align:middle
From this distance
she looks kinda thin.

00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:22.583 align:middle
Why here?

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:24.083 align:middle
[ACCA]
You synchronized.

00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:25.208 align:middle
What?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.375 align:middle
[ACCA]
You fell asleep near each other

00:13:28.458 --> 00:13:29.875 align:middle
and at almost the same time.

00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.083 align:middle
You're synced.

00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:33.042 align:middle
That makes sense.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:36.042 align:middle
But then, why aren't we
in my dream instead?

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle
[URA-ACCA] You were pulled by
whichever person's feelings

00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:39.625 align:middle
are stronger.

00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:41.708 align:middle
Are you kidding?
There's no way that's true,

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:44.042 align:middle
besides, she calls her friend
a wallet! It's wrong!

00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:48.542 align:middle
So... you ready to crack?

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:51.417 align:middle
[RIKA]
Here we go!

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.375 align:middle
[MAKO]
Miko!

00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:53.708 align:middle
[MIKO]
Mako!

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle
[MIKO, MAKO] You're here!
I got to see you again!

00:13:56.833 --> 00:13:59.458 align:middle
[MIKO] We're giant
fans of Yu-Yu! Right?

00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:00.792 align:middle
[MAKO]
Yep!

00:14:00.875 --> 00:14:03.042 align:middle
We went to meet-ups
and concerts and everything.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:04.417 align:middle
[AI]
Who's Yu-Yu?

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.542 align:middle
[RIKA]
A singer who committed suicide.

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:08.625 align:middle
[MIKO]
We're ride or die for Yu-Yu!

00:14:08.708 --> 00:14:11.833 align:middle
[MAKO] So when Yu-Yu did die,
we naturally followed suit!

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:13.083 align:middle
Are they serious?

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:15.083 align:middle
Yeah, more
serious than you think.

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle
Girls like those two put
the "fan" in fanatical.

00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:19.167 align:middle
[AI]
Okay.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.458 align:middle
So, what do we do?

00:14:20.542 --> 00:14:23.792 align:middle
We just gotta keep 'em
safe until sunset.

00:14:23.875 --> 00:14:26.792 align:middle
Weird, why aren't the
Seeno Evils attacking yet?

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:28.917 align:middle
You mean the bystanders?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle
They're here.

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:32.167 align:middle
On the beach right below us.

00:14:39.542 --> 00:14:42.875 align:middle
[MAKO, MIKO screech]
They're so adorable!

00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:43.833 align:middle
I'm jealous.

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle
Wish we could swap weapons.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle
That way, Ai!

00:14:57.083 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle
Got it! Here!

00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:04.625 align:middle
[gasps]

00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle
Watch out!

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle
What the hell?

00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:09.458 align:middle
Right. Sorry!

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:11.333 align:middle
But you should also
watch where you're going.

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:13.083 align:middle
I said to go that way!

00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:14.167 align:middle
Jeez.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.208 align:middle
[MIKO, MAKO scream]

00:15:16.292 --> 00:15:17.583 align:middle
Aw, man, come on!

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.292 align:middle
Just great.

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:20.875 align:middle
Oh yeah!

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:30.292 align:middle
--[RIKA] Behind you!
--Uh. What?

00:15:34.708 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle
Totally fire right?

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:41.208 align:middle
[AI gasps]
Watch out!

00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:42.708 align:middle
You okay?

00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:48.125 align:middle
[RIKA]
Yeah, I'm good.

00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:49.958 align:middle
[MAKO, MIKO]
Go get 'em!

00:15:50.042 --> 00:15:52.167 align:middle
[AI] Maybe we shouldn't
fight out in the open.

00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:55.958 align:middle
Huh?

00:16:04.042 --> 00:16:11.042 align:middle
[pants]

00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:18.208 align:middle
Your cuts!

00:16:18.292 --> 00:16:19.875 align:middle
Why aren't they healing?

00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.625 align:middle
[RIKA]
Oh. Don't worry.

00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:23.792 align:middle
These are old.

00:16:24.542 --> 00:16:26.958 align:middle
Just youthful whatever.

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:31.667 align:middle
Hey, show's over.

00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle
Tell me about Chiemi.

00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:35.792 align:middle
I want the truth.

00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle
[RIKA] It's none
of your business, okay?

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:39.042 align:middle
Tell me, Rika!

00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.042 align:middle
Handshake events for unpopular
idols are kinda surreal.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:49.333 align:middle
The same few stragglers
just line up over and over.

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:50.958 align:middle
That was Chieme.

00:16:51.042 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle
The idiot.

00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:55.917 align:middle
The girl got in line for me
dozens, maybe hundreds of times.

00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.417 align:middle
[RIKA]
She gave me all her allowance

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle
and New Year's money with a
smile plastered on her fat face.

00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:07.083 align:middle
I thought I'd just gotten lucky
and scored myself a rich patron.

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:10.708 align:middle
But one day I saw her
shoplifting some stuff in town.

00:17:10.792 --> 00:17:13.625 align:middle
She'd been selling
what she took.

00:17:20.292 --> 00:17:22.917 align:middle
[MIKO] Oh yeah,
I definitely know that feeling.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.375 align:middle
[MAKO] That's why we got
ourselves a sugar daddy!

00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle
Well, I didn't want that.

00:17:27.583 --> 00:17:30.833 align:middle
So, I told Chiemi I'd never
be friends with a fan.

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:32.667 align:middle
I said I'd be too
embarrassed to be seen

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle
with a fatty like her
and to never come back.

00:17:38.292 --> 00:17:41.208 align:middle
[RIKA] After that, another
fan told me what happened.

00:17:41.292 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle
Chiemi had died.

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:45.667 align:middle
She was all skin and bones.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.417 align:middle
like a mummy.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle
I couldn't forget
her if I tried.

00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle
This... This isn't Chiemi.

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:56.917 align:middle
[AI]
Run!

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle
[RIKA] If it means
I can see Chiemi again.

00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:09.667 align:middle
I'll kill as many of these
freaks as it takes!

00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle
I know.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.125 align:middle
[AI]
I understand.

00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:46.625 align:middle
There was a small part
of me that resented Koito.

00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:49.833 align:middle
We were friends, so why
didn't she just talk to me?

00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle
So why?

00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:54.667 align:middle
[AI] If she'd asked
me to die with her,

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle
like those girls did for Yu-Yu.

00:18:57.083 --> 00:18:58.333 align:middle
I'd...

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle
I would have!

00:19:04.542 --> 00:19:06.083 align:middle
Ai?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.583 align:middle
[AI]
Rika. We'll kill them.

00:19:32.667 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle
Together.

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:35.750 align:middle
Huh?

00:19:35.833 --> 00:19:38.875 align:middle
[MIKO, MAKO scream]

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.542 align:middle
[UMIBOZU]
All I wanted was to die, too.

00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:46.125 align:middle
To chase after Yu-Yu.

00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:47.167 align:middle
[RIKA]
Wrapping people up?

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.708 align:middle
Is this S and M?

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:51.875 align:middle
[MIKO] This is the lady who
got arrested for stalking Yu-Yu!

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.208 align:middle
[MAKO]
Sachiko, the Asagaya Madame!

00:19:54.292 --> 00:19:55.417 align:middle
Sachiko?

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.042 align:middle
These creeps are everywhere.

00:19:57.125 --> 00:19:59.083 align:middle
Delusional fans
who cross the line.

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:00.542 align:middle
[UMIBOZU]
I can't see Yu-Yu

00:20:00.625 --> 00:20:03.375 align:middle
because you're all
being way too noisy!

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:05.917 align:middle
Yu-Yu doesn't care about
little brats like you.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.875 align:middle
Only mature women!

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.167 align:middle

Help us!

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:19.042 align:middle

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.708 align:middle
[RIKA]
Ai!

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.083 align:middle
Who the hell are you
supposed to be?

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:35.833 align:middle
We protect people.

00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle
From dumb monsters.

00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:41.375 align:middle
You're promoted
from backup dancer.

00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:42.792 align:middle
Stupid girls!

00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:43.917 align:middle
People won't fawn over

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle
your youthful looks
forever, you know!

00:20:46.333 --> 00:20:48.458 align:middle
Well, we won't
turn out like you.

00:20:48.542 --> 00:20:49.958 align:middle
Not even a chance.

Mm. Mm.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.042 align:middle
Just shut up!
