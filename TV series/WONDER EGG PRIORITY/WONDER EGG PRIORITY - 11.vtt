I guess this'll be goodbye

Hello there! I'm Dot.

Don't worry, Dot won't kill you.

Still though, Dot has
to copy what Hyphen does.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
What?

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.791 position:50% align:center
You'd better stay
away from Mannen!

Why are you laughing?

[DOT] "When you laugh,
it makes everyone happy."

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.925 position:50% align:center
That's what Frill said.

--[RIKA] Huh?
--[DOT] That's why...

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center

Are you okay? You wet yourself.

Atmospheric room, am I right?

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
To be honest, it's an old story.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.583 position:50% align:center
Back before either of us
looked like a couple of dummies.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
Back then.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
We decided to make a girl.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
A girl?

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Just for fun.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center

Good morning.

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
Coffee?

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
You make breakfast today.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
We worked for a very
particular research facility.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
Acca and I had work that no one
but the two of us could do.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
I think we were satisfied.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.037 position:50% align:center
But... not completely.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center
We were kept under strict,
24-hour surveillance.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
If we had tried to go public
or sell out to another country,

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
it would have had
severe consequences.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.508 position:50% align:center
We had no intentions of
doing that, of course,

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
but the stress got to us.

Don't jump the gun.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
How about we let her decide?

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
That's a good idea.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
And the visual?

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] Initially, we started
it just to blow off some steam,

but... then we
were consumed by it.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
We tried to picture a being

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
that we could eventually
love like a real daughter.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
Something that would make
us forget she was an AI.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
Unstable and complicated,

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
We decided to give Frill

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
the sort of personality traits

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
that any good father would
want his daughter to have.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
Cheerfulness.
Intelligence. Humor.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
Frill would call us
names sometimes.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.223 position:50% align:center

Over time, Frill began
to steadily mature.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
Perhaps more than
we anticipated.

that Frill wasn't human,

we'll just have to meet

[URA-ACCA] The woman's
name was Azusa Hoshina.

She made a pretty
strong first impression.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
I thought she seemed
like a good person.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
But to be perfectly honest,

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't claim that either of
us were great at judging women.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
I could tell that Acca
was attracted to her.

When I asked him about it,

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
he simply countered
that I was, too, but...

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:40.241 position:50% align:center
...it was so long ago
I don't really remember.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center

In some cases,

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
I would prefer to make her.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
If you two do it,

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
then you might make
a girl prettier than me.

What's that about?

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
Thinking on it.

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
I suspect Frill's sudden request
for a friend might have been

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
her way of redirecting
her jealousy of Azusa.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50% align:center
But back in those days,

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
we simply didn't have the
time to fully understand her.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
Acca was busy
running the company,

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
and I was... I was swamped
with my own research.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
Most importantly.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
We were excited
because Asuza was pregnant.

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:04.302 position:50% align:center
To me, it was the equivalent of
getting a new niece or nephew.

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
The excitement
from those thoughts

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
were still fluttering in
my mind when disaster struck.

[gasps]

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
Frill. Something wrong?

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
So... about Baby Acca.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.860 position:50% align:center
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
A little girl.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
That's what the
ultrasound showed.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
[FRILL]
A girl?

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center

Yes.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
Will you be a good big sister?

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center

I don't think I can.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center

Stop it, that hurts!

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
Ow, let go!

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
You're hurting me!

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50% align:center
It hurts.

Does it though?

Please stop it! No!

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
I hate the dark place!

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
It's scary in here!

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] There was
nothing I could say or do

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.141 position:50% align:center
in those moments.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
The years continued to pass.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
What saved Acca and
me from despair was...

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
...Himari.

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
The daughter that
Azusa left behind.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Himari's presence in our life

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
saved us more than
I can possibly say.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
She was smart like Acca.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
But had a sense
of humor like Azusa.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
Her carefree cheerfulness seemed
like it would bring us back

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
from our lowest point
to how we used to be

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center

Hey, Uncle.

such a ridiculous story?

Ah, so you admit it!

Sure. Why not?

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
I got rejected big time

a note or anything.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
What had caused it?

Bullying at school?

You used Hyphen and Dot somehow.

Then why ask me
if you're so certain?
