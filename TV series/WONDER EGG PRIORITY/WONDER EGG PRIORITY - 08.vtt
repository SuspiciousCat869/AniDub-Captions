Hello.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
Welcome.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
Do you want a Wonder Egg?

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
It's hard.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
What? Are you not sure yet?

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Don't hesitate.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
Have a little courage
and believe in yourself.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.865 position:50% align:center
Break the Egg!

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
It has the thing you want in it.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] You could
say it contains your wish.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.044 position:50% align:center
If you crack it
in the Egg world...

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.921 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] And if you
clear your mission there...

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
[AI]
She's a little warm.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] ...you just might
be able to get it back.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Your friend.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.682 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Your memories.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Your loved one.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.562 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
The first time's free.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
After that, bring your wallet.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] Hm? You want to know how
we make the Wonder Eggs?

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.196 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] Sorry, but I'm
afraid that's a trade secret.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.530 position:50% align:center
We can't just tell you.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:13.865 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
I know.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.951 position:50% align:center
We'll tell you about our
regular customers instead.

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:20.580 position:50% align:center
A group of four
charming, young girls.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
It's our little secret.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
A whole world that
no one else knows about.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:32.092 position:50% align:center
Huh? A whole world that
no one else knows about.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.844 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] Why don't you
give their story a listen?

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.556 position:50% align:center
Then, you can make up your own
mind about purchasing an Egg.

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:44.270 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I'm going out.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.907 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.159 position:50% align:center
Whoa, crazy.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.162 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] This isn't reality,
it's closer to a dream.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:05.333 position:50% align:center
For right now, we'll simply
refer to it as the "Egg World."

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:06.835 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
It's a place only people

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.212 position:50% align:center
who've broken an
Egg can connect to.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
It's strongly influenced
by your mental landscape.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.634 position:50% align:center
And under very
specific conditions,

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:17.637 position:50% align:center
you can even share that
special world with other people.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.638 position:50% align:center
How fun!

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.181 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
You synchronized.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:23.059 position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.477 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
You fell asleep near each other

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
and at almost the same time.

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.313 position:50% align:center
You're synced.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:30.191 position:50% align:center
But then... why aren't
we in my dream instead?

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
You were pulled by

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:34.070 position:50% align:center
whichever person's
feelings are stronger.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Just break it.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.824 position:50% align:center
What are you waiting for?

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
Break what?

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.661 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
The Wonder Egg.

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] See, when you
crack a Wonder Egg,

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
a girl emerges
from inside of it.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.754 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] They're girls
who approached death

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
of their own will and left
their own lives behind.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
Now it's up to you
to protect them.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
But from what?

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
From things like Seeno Evils
and Wonder Killers.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What are they?

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
You should know!

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.985 position:50% align:center
They're Seeno Evils!

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What's that?

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
[KURUMI]
No idea!

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:17.614 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
First up.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
Let's talk about
one of our regulars.

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
This girl's name is Ai Ohto.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
She's a 14-year-old
with heterochromia.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
A second year in middle school.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.960 position:50% align:center
[TAE]
Ai? Your teacher is here.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI] Oh, there's no need
to force her to get up, ma'am.

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.926 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] When we first met
her, she wasn't going to school.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] She says she was
bullied for her heterochromia.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] True,
although that's not the reason

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
she was skipping
school every day.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
What's that?

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
Game.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
You like games?

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.900 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Ai's meeting with Koito Nagase,

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
a new student in her class,

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
changed her destiny in a way
she could never anticipate.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
It's mysterious.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't try to hide it.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I get bullied for it.

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
A lot.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
It's pretty.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
I want you to
be friends with me.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
In fact, let's be best friends.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
If we could, I'd be happy.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
Me, too.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Ai finally made a best friend.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
But then one day, she lost
her without any warning.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What is all this?

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.206 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
Just your classic harassment.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
But why would anyone
do this to you?

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
Is it because you're
friends with me?

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
I doubt it.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
I've heard them
say Mister Sawaki

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
is giving me special treatment.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
They're probably just jealous.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laughing]

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:04.971 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Sorry.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
I was scared.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
Scared of being left out.

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
You got it? Right, Ai?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
So, you were scared.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I'm really sorry.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
It's not your fault.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.166 position:50% align:center
I know you tried your best.

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I'm so sorry.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
It's all my fault.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Because I betrayed you.

Koito Nagase committed suicide.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Why'd she die?

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
What was Ai lacking?

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
Who pushed Koito toward it?

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] Ai is fighting
to get back her best friend.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
The one she lost.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center
So, I'm done with pretending
that I don't see anything!

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I understand.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
There was a small part
of me that resented Koito.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
We were friends, so why
didn't she just talk to me?

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
So why?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
If she'd asked me
to die with her.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center

Now, I'm really angry!

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] In order to clear a
mission in the Egg world,

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
one must defeat what is
known as a Wonder Killer.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
They are the symbol of the Egg's

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50% align:center
She gave me all her allowance
and New Year's money

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
with a smile plastered
on her fat face.

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd just gotten lucky
and scored myself a rich patron.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:21.129 position:50% align:center
But one day I saw her
shoplifting some stuff in town.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center
She'd been selling
what she took.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Oh yeah, I definitely
know that feeling.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.560 position:50% align:center
[MAKO] That's why we got
ourselves a sugar daddy!

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
Well, I didn't want that.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
So, I told Chiemi I'd never
be friends with a fan.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
I said I'd be too
embarrassed to be seen

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
with a fatty like her
and to never come back.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
After that, another fan
told me what happened.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
Chiemi had died.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
She was all skin and bones.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
Like a mummy.

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
I couldn't forget
her if I tried.

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
This... This isn't Chiemi.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Deep down, Rika lives

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
with the regret and knowledge

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
that her words drove
Chiemi to an early death.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
That's why she fights.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Then I'll end you--
with a shot to the heart!

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Rika?

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Yeah, but, like,
what's with those Haters, man?

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
And who said we were heroes?

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
It's not like we're doing all
this stuff for fun, you know.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
Didn't you
"have a solution in mind"?

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
Let's hear it then.

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Yes. Ah, it's arriving now.

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Thanks for waiting!

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] Within that case,
you'll find little somethings

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
to support each of you.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] Basically,
it's like what you call

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
a "power up" in
your video games.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.966 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
So, how do we use these things?

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] First, you have
to hatch them in this world.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Hatch them?

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
Oh, but don't do it here.

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
Take them home and wait to
open them until you're alone.

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
They require imprinting.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
They see whoever meets their
gaze first as their parent.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
Chant " <i>veni</i> ," and it will call
them from their eggs.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
" <i>Redi</i> " will return them.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
<i>Veni</i> .

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
A snake.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
Hey, buddy.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
I'm not quite sure how to react.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
<i>Veni</i> .

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
Whoa, he ate it!

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] Yes, Haters
are their favorite food.

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
Envy and spite are essentially
a helper's bread and butter.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.653 position:50% align:center
Right. Well, enjoy!

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] And finally,
there's Momoe Sawaki.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.995 position:50% align:center
She's a tall, slender girl.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
It's only been a single day.
I still fell in love with you.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
I feel at peace.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we met.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] Momoe says
she's often mistaken for a boy

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
and gets asked out
by other girls.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
Please don't worry.
I'll protect you.

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] To be fair, her
actions do make her come off

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
as cool and handsome.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
Die, you jerk!

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Of the four girls,

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
Momoe is probably
the most normal one.

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKI]
I love you.

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
I don't want to go.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
I would much rather
stay here with you forever.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] There are more
girls than you'd think.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
Girls like you--
saying they love me.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] That's the girl
Momoe wants to save.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
Haruka.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] Momoe has complicated
circumstances of her own.

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
She was one of the few people

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
who was willing
to see me as a girl.

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
Please touch me.

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Your friend who killed herself?

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
But one day in the infirmary,
she just took her clothes off.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
She put the moves on you?

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] I freaked out and
ended up pushing her away.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU, RIKA, MOMOE]
Excuse us!

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
--[MOMOE] Hello, ma'am.
--Oh, hello!

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
Are you related
to Mister Sawaki?

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Momoe Sawaki.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
I'm his niece.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
[TAE] Oh! You're such
a pretty young lady.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
And one of Momoe's relatives,

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
Shuichiro Sawaki,
is Ai's teacher.

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI] There's no reason for
you to have a complex about it.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
Your eyes are charming.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
Unique.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Okay.

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI] I'm going to paint
you exactly how I see you.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
When I'm finished,

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
I hope that you'll have
gained some confidence.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center
[KOITO] I hear Mister Sawaki's
entering it

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:56.071 position:50% align:center
in the next art exhibition.

00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
He says he wants to win a prize,

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
so he can make
a living as a painter.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
[AI]
A painting of me?

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
Have confidence.

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
If you can't, then maybe
you should decline.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
Mister Sawaki's
future is on the line.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I just...

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] You see, Shuichiro Sawaki
occupies many of Ai's thoughts.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] Like his
relationship with Koito Nagase.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] And his relationship
with Ai's mother.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
[TAE]
Please just listen to us.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
We've been thinking that
we might like to start dating.

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] Wait, you mean
that crazy theory?

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
That my uncle might have been
wrapped up in Koito's suicide?

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.533 position:50% align:center
I told you, there's no way.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Annoying.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll never
find out the truth about Koito

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
unless we bring her back
and ask her ourselves.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D]
See ya, Mister S!

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI]
Have a good one!

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] As in there might
be a complicating factor

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
we've yet to consider.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
Ai likes Mister Sawaki, too.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] If the truth
were an easy thing to find,

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
then no one would
ever struggle or grow.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
[ACCA] The human heart
is difficult to fathom.

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] It looks like
Ai's made up her mind

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
to hunt down the truth,

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
but we'll have to see
where that leads her.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I--!

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I'm...

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
I'm coming back to school!

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
There you go!

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
That's pretty much
how you use the Eggs.

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
Huh? You don't seem
too enthusiastic.

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
Hmm.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
You look as though
you don't trust us.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Really?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
After we broke it
down so neatly?

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
That's not fair.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
We protect people.

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
From dumb monsters.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.569 position:50% align:center
[MANTIS] This is a women's-only
car, you sneaky rat!

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.697 position:50% align:center
I can be here
because I'm a girl!

00:22:02.781 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
Get lost, hag!

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:07.869 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Man.

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:09.954 position:50% align:center
I'm just so tired.

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
Make it go away.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Mannen.

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:21.549 position:50% align:center
You have to keep your mom safe.

00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:22.634 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
All right.

00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:24.886 position:50% align:center
Next, we'll tell
you about ourselves.

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:27.681 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
Info about us'll cost you.

00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:29.933 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
However, that's all for today.

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:34.646 position:50% align:center
But please drop in again
if you would like to hear more.

00:22:34.729 --> 00:22:35.855 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
We'll be waiting.

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:39.609 position:50% align:center
Mannen. Let's go!

00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:45.240 position:50% align:center
