[DROOL]
Don't be afraid.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
I am God, after all!

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
What is that thing?

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
And that awful smell.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.446 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
You're God, huh?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.947 position:50% align:center
Like hell you are!

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
You said you wouldn't do any--

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
[DROOL]
Filthy runaway brat.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
A couple of ignorant fools!

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
The driving principle of
capitalism is give-and-take.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
Everybody knows
there's no such thing

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
as give-and-give in this world!

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
[DROOL]
I am God!

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50% align:center
And "God is love," is He not?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
You came looking for love...

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.054 position:50% align:center
...and yet you dare reject me?

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.014 position:50% align:center
Don't try to take him on alone.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
I just can't stand
his looks or smell.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
Makes me wanna fight, you know?

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.396 position:50% align:center
I always have a
hard time understanding

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
how you girls think.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.984 position:50% align:center
But I'm with you there,
he's disgusting.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.620 position:50% align:center
[DROOL]
Come to me.

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:21.664 position:50% align:center
I know you haven't gone too far.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.874 position:50% align:center
Even back then,

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:25.835 position:50% align:center
you only went one subway
stop away from home.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.962 position:50% align:center
You got scared and ran back,

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:31.633 position:50% align:center
but there was no place
for you there anymore, right?

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.760 position:50% align:center
Your parents don't love you.

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:36.846 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one who ever will.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.475 position:50% align:center
When you ran away, weren't
you saved for a moment?

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.435 position:50% align:center
We were blowing off steam.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.355 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of relationship
you could have built with me.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.273 position:50% align:center
You know what I mean?

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
Let's blow off
each other's steam.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.113 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I'll blow it off for you.

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.722 position:50% align:center
Did I blow your mind?

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.850 position:50% align:center
Or did I just break your heart?

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.601 position:50% align:center
[DROOL]
My...?

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.648 position:50% align:center
That was rad!

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:30.525 position:50% align:center
Definitely "mind-blowing"!

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.610 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] Food's gonna
taste weird for a while

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
'cause of that smell.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.783 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
Thank you.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.326 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I didn't do it for you.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.411 position:50% align:center
Give-and-give with that thing

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.289 position:50% align:center
would be too gross
for me to stomach.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:45.999 position:50% align:center
[AYAKA]
I guess so.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:47.500 position:50% align:center
But it made me happy.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center
Having somebody protect me.

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.762 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Is that so?

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
We're a little late, aren't we?

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Yeah, this place
is so hard to find.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.900 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Quiet, that's rude.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
Hey! You get lost?

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Nuh-uh.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
Oh, here. A present.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.746 position:50% align:center
Aw, thank you!

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
Uh, come in!

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's a little
cramped, though.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU, RIKA, MOMOE]
Excuse us!

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
I'm Neiru Aonuma.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
[TAE]
Oh my, how polite.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Hey again, Ai's Mom.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
Hi!

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Hello, ma'am.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello!

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
Are you related
to Mister Sawaki?

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Momoe Sawaki.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
I'm his niece.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
[TAE]
You're such a pretty young lady.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
Ai's Mom!

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
Can we get some cake?

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
Oh, and lay out
Neiru's snacks, too.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
[TAE]
Of course.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
You have so many
friends now, don't you?

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
That's wonderful! Right, Ai?

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
Mom!

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
Pretty, pretty, pretty please!

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Do you really
have no shame?

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
You haven't even
finished yours yet.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Stingy.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Now, now.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
Anyway, are you really a student
at my uncle's school, Ai?

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
He's so hot.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
I hear he's real popular
with all the girls there.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center
Runs in the family.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
I mean, if you were a dude, I
would totally want to date you.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Will you stop?

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
I think Koito liked
Mister Sawaki, too.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Who's Koito?

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
The girl that
Ai's trying to save.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Oh, I see.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Huh.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
I just had a crazy thought.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.363 position:50% align:center
Well, are you gonna share it?

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
Okay, check it out.

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
Maybe Ai's best friend, Koito,

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
was actually secretly
dating Mister Sawaki.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
Then, something terrible
happened, and that's why she--

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI] Oh. Sorry.
Do you have company?

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.424 position:50% align:center
--[TAE] We do, but it's fine.
--[MOMOE] Whoa! Wait a minute!

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
My uncle is not like that.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
He's probably the sweetest
guy in the whole world.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
He rescues a ton of cats!

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Maybe he's the dude
version of a crazy cat lady.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] You'd be surprised
who has a dark side.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
For real!

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
So, a teacher got
handsy with a student...

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
...and when things
got sketch, bam!

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center
He drops her.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
He's not like that!

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
Maybe she got knocked up.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center
Pregnant.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
Yeah, scandalous!

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.995 position:50% align:center
Just give it a rest!

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
I was messing around, jeez.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean it!

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway,
I don't know why Koito died.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
I really wish I did, though.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
You know?

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Why don't you
ask your mom about it?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
I bet Mister Sawaki
knows something, at least.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:20.231 position:50% align:center
Hey, maybe that's the only
reason he checks in on you!

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
He comes by every week

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.986 position:50% align:center
to see if you've got proof of
his little indiscretion!

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
That makes sense,
though, doesn't it?

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I can't ask her.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
My mom really
trusts Mister Sawaki,

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
and I'm always making
her worry as it is.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
But it's weird, though.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
She stopped asking
about my injuries

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
when I clammed up about 'em.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.961 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Clammed up, huh?

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU chuckles]

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Hold on--?

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
Do you have allergies?

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
It's funny.
I can just picture it.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
Ai as a little clam.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
Uh! Hey! Come on!

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
Pro tip: Don't tell
her your injures came

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
from going out to
fight in your sleep,

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
you're only gonna
worry her more.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
She'd probably think
you were on something.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
That, or she
wouldn't believe you.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
That's why we can't
tell anyone what we do.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
It's our little secret.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
A whole world that
no one else knows about.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:18.081 position:50% align:center
A whole world that...
no one else knows about.

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI]
Momoe's here?

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
[TAE] Yes, I recognized her
because she looks just like you.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI]
They go to different schools.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
Where did they meet?

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for you
to have a complex about it.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
Your eyes are charming. Unique.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Okay.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
[SAWAKI] I'm going to paint
you exactly how I see you.

When I'm finished,

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.692 position:50% align:center
I hope that you'll have
gained some confidence.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Okay.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
[KOITO] I hear
Mister Sawaki's entering it

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
in the next art exhibition.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
He says he wants to win a prize,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.202 position:50% align:center
so he can make
a living as a painter.

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
[AI]
A painting of me?

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
Have confidence.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
If you can't, then maybe
you should decline.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
Mister Sawaki's
future is on the line.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I just...

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] You know, I wish my mom
were more like yours, Ai.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Why?

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
What's your mom like?

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
Totally toxic and awful.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:24.731 position:50% align:center
I bet when I was born,

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
and I first saw her face,
I told myself:

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
"This lady wants to stay a vixen
her whole life, doesn't she?"

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.781 position:50% align:center
She was never meant
to be a parent.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
No wonder I'm screwed up.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
It's your turn, Rika.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
I'm lucky.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
I don't know how,

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
but my mom always
does everything perfectly,

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
at work and at home.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
She's a really hard worker.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
But, on the other hand,

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
I think that might be
why my dad left.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
Lots of guys are proud,
their egos get in the way.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
Successful gals threaten
their fragile masculinity.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
Why are you looking at me?

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Because it's your turn, duh.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
That attitude belongs
in the fifties, fool.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.102 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Who you callin' "fool," fool?

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
You, the fool.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center
Coochy-coochy-coochy-coochy-coo.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:08.900 position:50% align:center
Ya ticklish?

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
They really get along.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Yeah.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh!

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
What about this spot?

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Hey, do you do intensive
conditioning treatments?

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
It looks like you may have
some dryness and damage.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
Keep your hands to yourself.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
But I want to be free.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't tie me down, right?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
Oh, whatever.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
Hey, look at my hair,
isn't it pretty?

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.936 position:50% align:center
Not a single split
end to be found.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
I'm at my prettiest right now.

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
Nothing can replace
youth in that regard.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
I don't care.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going to ask me?

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
You must be curious
about why I died.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
I'm just here to
complete my objective.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
Girls grow up into women.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
It's a miraculous thing,
much like a butterfly emerging.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
One, brief moment.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
A fleeting glimpse
of shocking beauty.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
Such evanescence is profound,

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
when you think about it.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
[CURLS]
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:23.683 position:50% align:center
who's the fairest of them all?

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
All too soon, that beauty fades.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
Take my mom, for example.

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
Just a sow.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
No amount of liposuction

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
or hyaluronic acid
will stop her aging.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
Her attempts are futile,
and in fact,

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
they only make her
more hideous in the end.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
So sad, don't you think?

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
You're very pretty, you know.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
Why don't you die, too?

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
Why not end it all when
you're at your most beautiful?

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
What sense is there in clinging
to a meaningless life?

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
This isn't good.

[MOMOE]
Hmm... About six times, I think.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] Is six times a lot?
Or not that many?

Who knows?

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center

All of them were girls,

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center

Haruka took that one for me.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
Your friend who killed herself?

But one day in the infirmary,

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
she just took her clothes off.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
Maybe so.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Jeez, I didn't
even win once against you.

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.019 position:50% align:center
Don't feel bad, games like
that are kind of my thing.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
That was a first for me.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Yeah, same here.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
[ACCA]
You've had your fun.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
Now, buy your Eggs.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
Then go home and
get some sleep, kids.

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
But I don't wanna leave.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:52.035 position:50% align:center
I'm having the time
of my life in this place.

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] Been a while
since I've had this much fun.

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Oh, good grief.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
This is your fault
for spoiling them.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE] Oh hey, Neiru,
can I have your contact info?

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Yeah.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.340 position:50% align:center
Will you tell me yours, too?

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Of course. One sec.

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:08.134 position:50% align:center
Here ya go.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA]
You're too uptight.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
What if we just didn't buy Eggs?

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Now I think about it,

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
Chiemi made the
choice to die, not me.

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
It might be true that I was
the reason, but that isn't fair.

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
Like, why do I have
to take responsibility

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
for her bad decision
to kill herself?

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
Really?

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Well, am I wrong?

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
I knew it.
It's all an act, you are cruel.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
No! I'm a woman,
so, sometimes I get swept up

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
in the moment by my feelings.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Oh, come on.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
What about you, Momoe?

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
Are you responsible?

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
I mean, sure, you feel guilty.

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
I feel the same way.

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
But, still,
should we really take

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:49.634 position:50% align:center
full responsibility like this?

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
To the point that we'd risk
our own lives over it?

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
I don't know.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.726 position:50% align:center
Rika.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
I think that's enough.

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center
Especially, you, Ai.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
She died without
even talking to you.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
That's not your fault.

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
So, why do you have to go
fight for her like it is?

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
Because I want to know
the truth about why she died.

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
I hate being in the dark.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
"Curiosity killed the cat"
is cliché for a reason!

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
My parents are a-holes,
but you've got a great mom.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
Do you really want
to break her heart?

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
You don't even know for sure

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
if Koito wants to come back
to life in the first place!

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
That's not...

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
What, did Koito's
stupid statue tell you

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.850 position:50% align:center
that she wants to come back?

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.435 position:50% align:center
Why would you say
something like that?

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
[MOMOE]
Rika, stop it, for real.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
Someone has to be the bad guy!

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
If you want friends,
you've got 'em!

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm going now.

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
It's not that I want to,
I just have to is all.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
And for what?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.950 position:50% align:center
For someone selfish enough to--

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
Selfish enough
to kill themselves?

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
[AI] Rika, Neiru's trying
to save her sister.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.582 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Wrong about what?

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
My sister stabbed me.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Huh?

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:11.675 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] Then, she ran away
and jumped off a bridge.

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Stabbed you?

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] That's what they told
me when I woke up in the ICU.

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] Then you've got
even less of a reason.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] The scar aches
and keeps me awake at night.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
Or, it did.

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
But the pain has faded a little
since I started coming here.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
When I try to forget her,

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
my scar aches, like a curse.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
That's why I go.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
No other reason.

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
It's for me.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
[URA-ACCA] None of you have
to go if you don't want to.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
Guilt and curiosity fade.

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
Sooner or later,
you'll forget about them.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
You don't have to go.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
You understand?

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
I mean, after all.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
That's just adolescence, right?

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
[AOI] Beauty is only a momentary
season of metamorphosis.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
Dying is the same.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
Killing your own beautiful body

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
is another kind
of metamorphosis.

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
Getting old and ugly or trying
to resist aging are both comedy.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
One of them has
to be the real one.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
Who is it?

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
[CURLS A]
Who?

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
Who?

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
Who?

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.684 position:50% align:center
Guess I'm gonna have
to blow your mind, too.

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
[AOI]
How did you...?

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU] I didn't.
You just got on my nerves.

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
You actually regret it,
don't you?

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
Your choice?

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
After all, no one will
ever call you pretty again.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
"Why don't I die, too?"

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
"Temptation of death,"
indeed, but I resisted.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
Teenage rebellion.

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
They'll want to go
if we say not to.

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
Somewhere, they
know that rebelling

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
helps build their
individual identities.

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
[RIKA]
Hey, Ai, spot me.

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
I'm all out.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.279 position:50% align:center
What? No way!

00:22:58.503 --> 00:22:59.963 position:50% align:center
[NEIRU]
To be continued.
