Now, then,

what happened?

[RIKA] She showed up out

[MOMOE] The girl in mine

Maybe you don't care

If you had shielded Mannen,

you would never have
made it back, Rika!

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:09.903 position:50% align:center

No, it was chosen for me.

Why did you bother
calling out to me?

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.872 position:50% align:center
[RIKA] I swear I'm gonna
get them back for Mannen.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.874 position:50% align:center
I'll make them pay!

Yes, it usually revolves

around a lot of self-interest.

It's only a matter of time

A world free from care.

She got dazzled

She even put her own, selfish,

After Koito died and

I thought I wanted

from Koito about her suicide.

Mm.

I promise to bring you back.
