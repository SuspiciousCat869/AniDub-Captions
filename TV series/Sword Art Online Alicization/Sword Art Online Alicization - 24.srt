Otherwise, you and I,

183
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,920
we would have fought over Alice,

184
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:54,260
me to get back the memory
of the Alice I knew

185
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:00,130
and you to save
Alice the knight’s soul.

186

Kirito: Then get up, and fight!

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,500

Do it!

With a broken sword.

194
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:24,050
Besides, I was weak
and gave in to administrator.

195
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,050
I tried to kill you.

196
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,790
This is how
I can pay for that sin.

Kirito: Like I care!

198

You weren’t
in your right mind, anyway!

199
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,860
You fought back and
snapped yourself out of it

200
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,270
like the badass you are.

201
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,930
If it wasn’t for you,

202
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,970
we couldn’t have
beat administrator,

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,140
so you got nothing
to feel guilty about.

204
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,840
You got nothing to pay for!

Wished I could be
more like you.

Love isn’t something you get.

What’s going on?!

334
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,190
Kikuoka: I can’t
get into that right now.

335
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,330
Listen, kirito. I need you
to locate a girl named Alice.

336
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,570
Find her, and take her to--

337
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,270
Kirito: I don’t
have to look for her.

338
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,940
- She’s right here!
- Kikuoka: You have her?

339
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,900
Higa: You gotta be kidding.
That kid’s awesome!

340
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,540
Kikuoka: Yeah. All right,
once we’re off the line,

341
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,480
i’ll crank the f.L.A. To 1,000.

342
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,410
Then, take Alice and head
to the world’s end altar!

343
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,310
Kirito: I never heard
of that place!

344
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,620
Kikuoka: That’s okay!
Just go out the eastern gate,

345
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,850
and the altar’s due south!

346
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,890
- Nakanishi: Uh, sir!
- ( Kikuoka gasps )

347
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,520
Nakanishi: Two of them
are heading down the corridor,

348
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,360
- toward electric!
- Kikuoka: What?!

349
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,530
Intruder: Be careful.
We just need the mains off.

350
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,700
Whatever you do,
don’t damage the lines

351
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,300
for the light cube cluster.

352
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,700
Intruder 2:
Would you relax, bro?

353
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,940
I know what to cut.

354
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,840
Higa: We’re screwed!
What do we do?!

355
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,610
If they cut
the main power line now,

356
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
it’s gonna cause a surge!

357
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,610
Light cube clusters
should be safe,

358
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,580
but the subcomputer where
kirigaya’s s.T.L. Is won’t be!

359
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,950
The surge’ll cook
his fluctlight!

360
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,890
( Kikuoka gasps ) O-okay,
i’ll handle the lockdown.

361
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,860
Higa, take Dr. Kojiro and asuna
and get to the upper shaft!

362
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,030
Keep kirito safe.

363
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,460
Kirito: Asuna?

364
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,400
What the hell?

365
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,070
What’s she doing at rath?

366
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,570
Security:
They’re cutting the power!

367
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,370
The screw propellers
are going down!

368

Asuna: Kirito. Kirito!

371
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,050
Kirito: Asuna.
