00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,870
in my many years
of service to you,

328
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,270
I would like to present you
with a most impudent request.

329
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,210
I shall happily risk my life

330
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,440
annihilating these traitors.
However...

331
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,580
Once I have fulfilled
your wishes, would you--

332
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,050
( stammers ) W-would you
let me touch your exalted body

333
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,480
and k-k-kiss your lips

334
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,720
and sp-sp-spend one
magical night alone with you?!

335
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,790
Uh, please!

336
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,020
Please!

337
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,290
I would be most grateful

338
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,890
if you granted me
such a delight!

And I swear to you,
I will not let you down.

350
