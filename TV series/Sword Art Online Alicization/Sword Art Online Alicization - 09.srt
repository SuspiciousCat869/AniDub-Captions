what you’re putting
behind your strikes.

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,147
That’s what’s gonna tip things
in your favor.

- Kirito: It’s like,

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,586
for volo, it’s the pride
and responsibility

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,155
that comes
with being from a family

9
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,023
that teaches swordsmanship.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,560
for golgorosso,
it’s the confidence he’s got

11
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,063
from having muscles of steel,

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,697
and for liena,

13
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,166
it’s the pride she takes
in her polished skills.

14
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,901
That’s the reason
why their attacks

are as powerful as they are.

I should put behind my sword?

used to be a woodcutter
in some backwoods hovel.

If that is indeed the case,

He may end up striking you.

stopped just short of that,

then I must accept it.

Eugeo: His power surged.

97

Is that what his arrogance
is capable of?

98

Humbert: Your sword style
is a good match for you,

your outlandish moves
were quite entertaining.

117
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,570

perhaps you should consider

118
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,873
seeking a calling
with the imperial circus.

They should have tried
getting back at me by now.

129
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,575
I wonder why they haven’t.

130

breakin’ the rules,

the school’s
and the taboo index’s.

Those don’t make it easy
to harass people.

133

On the other hand, anything that
doesn’t fall under the rules

is up for debate.

135
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,593
They could be lookin’
for a loophole.

136

Eugeo: You think
they’d go that far

137
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,530
just to spite me?

138
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,998
Kirito: I don’t know.

139
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,701
Maybe they’re not planning
on doing anything.

140
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,737
it’s possible they’re
just trying to psyche you out.

141
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,140
whatever you do,
don’t let it get to you.

No matter what,
you gotta stay cool.

143

Eugeo: What did you say?

144
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,480
- Stay what, now?
- Kirito: Oh, uh...

145
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,382
That’s the secret mantra
of the aincrad style.

146
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,686
It’s pretty much the same
as saying, "stay calm."

147
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,088
You can also use it
to say goodbye to someone.

148
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,390
It’s like another way
of saying, "see you later."

00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,726
Eugeo: Oh. Okay!

150
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,926
I’ll remember that.

151
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,362
"Stay cool."

152
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,397
What an unusual thing to say.

153
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,832
Stay cool? Bizarre.

154
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,667
kirito: All right,
i’m gonna go hit the sack.

155
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:14,735
Eugeo: And why "cool"?

156
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,372
kirito: Oh, hey,
by the way, about tomorrow,

157
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,441
I have to run some errands,
so you’re on your--

158
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,076
eugeo: Oh, no, you don’t!

159
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,079
We promised tiese and ronie
we’d take them out for a picnic,

00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,382
and by "we," I mean us,
so if you think

161
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,883
you can get out of it,
you’re mistaken.

162
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,485
( Kirito sighs )

163
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,054
Eugeo: They’ll be here
at 9:00 sharp,

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,756
so make sure you’re ready
to leave by then. You got it?

165
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,057
Kirito: Okay, okay.

166
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,793
Do me a favor, though,
and wake me up at 8:00.

167
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,795
I need to catch up
on some sleep.

168
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,664
Eugeo: No! 8:00’s way too late!

169
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,032
Make it 7:30!

170
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,601
And stay cool.

171
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,903
Kirito: I know I told you

172
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,704
that phrase
is like saying, "bye,"

173
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,374
but it’s not something you say
to someone goin’ to bed.

174
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,441
Eugeo: Why not?

175
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,377
Kirito: ’cause you don’t.

176
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,513
You use it when you’re really
saying goodbye to someone.

177
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,748
Eugeo: Oh.

178
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,783
What a complicated phrase.

179
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:16,763
If what kirito said is true,
are humbert and raios capable

180
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,933
of sidestepping the laws
of the axiom church?

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,069
( Sighs ) What am I saying?

182
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,706
You can’t even doubt
the taboo index,

183
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,107
much less disobey it.

184
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,877
If there were a way around it,

185
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,845
I could have done something

186
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:36,483
instead of stand there
and watch Alice get taken away.

187
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,853
Why couldn’t I disobey
when I had the chance?

188
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,657
♪

189
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:47,928
Alice.

190
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,668
( Birds chirping )

191
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,902
( Frog chirping )

192
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,637
Tiese: Eugeo, are you listening?

193
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,072
Eugeo?

194
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,774
Eugeo: Huh? Sorry.

195
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,711
I missed that last part.
you were saying?

196
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,445
( Tiese sighs )
You didn’t hear a single word.

197
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,047
Eugeo: I’m sorry. I just--

198
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,917
i was just admiring
how beautiful the forest was.

199
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,586
it has animals
i’ve never seen before.

200
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,621
Tiese: Really?

201
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,989
Eugeo: Yeah, like that one.

202
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,426
Tiese: Oh, that? That’s just
a plain old golden flying fox.

203
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,462
don’t tell me
you’ve never seen one.

204
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,530
They’re in every tree
in the capital.

205
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,033
eugeo: Oh, right.
I guess you’d be used to them,

206
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,834
since you were born
and raised here.

207
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,902
Tiese: That’s true.

208
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,504
Eugeo: Do your folks
live nearby?

209
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,339
tiese: No.
They live in district eight.

210
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,109
It’s a bit of a ways away
from where we are in five.

211
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,643
Eugeo: Oh. You don’t say.

212
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,545
Uh...

213
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,548
Hang on. If i’m not mistaken,

214
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,017
don’t you come
from a family of nobles?

215
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,786
I thought all of the mansions

216
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,888
were in districts
three and four.

217
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,990
tiese: Only nobles
who are fourth rank or higher

218
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,525
get to live in that district.

219
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,061
my father is
a sixth-rank nobleman.

220
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,730
Therefore, he has
no judicial authority.

221
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,132
Eugeo: I didn’t know that.

222
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,033
i thought that was
something every noble has.

223
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,702
Tiese: Certainly not!

224
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,871
Only nobles fourth rank or
higher are granted that power,

225
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,007
whereas nobles who are
ranked fifth and lower

226
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,144
must adhere to the judgment
of those of higher ranking!

227
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,112
Eugeo: Oh. Interesting.

228
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,016
Tiese: Uh, anyway...

229
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,785
That’s why someone like myself,

230
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,786
an heir to a sixth-rank house,

231
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,622
is an aristocrat in name only.

232
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,558
In that sense, our lifestyle

233
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,794
is really no different
from most people’s.

234
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,029
Eugeo: Oh. Really?

235
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,531
Kirito: Okay,
so if your opponent

236
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,399
wants to get the drop on you
from above

237
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,934
with a high-norkian
style attack,

238
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,669
there’s two types of strikes

239
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,172
you gotta be ready
to defend yourself against.

240
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,574
They are a strike from above

241
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,510
or diagonally to the right.

242
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,911
If they do anything else,

243
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,879
that means they’re gonna
switch up their footing,

244
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,148
so you’ll still
have time to block it.

245
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,550
( Eugeo chuckles )

246
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,553
Man, i’m stuffed!

247
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,659
Tiese: Um, if it would be
all right with you two,

248
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,529
we’d like to get
your thoughts on something.

249
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,866
it’s about frenica,
our roommate at the dormitory.

250
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,568
( Both sigh )

251
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,570
Ronie: The elite disciple
whom she unfortunately is forced

252
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,640
to serve under
is a rather crude individual.

253
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,475
Over the past few days,

254
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,146
he’s been giving her orders that
go way beyond inappropriate.

255
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,382
Eugeo: His ranking is no excuse.

256
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:24,751
If he’s making her do things
that violate the school’s rules,

257
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:25,986
he should be reported.

258
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,922
Tiese: That’s just it.

259
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,557
technically,
they’re not violations,

260
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,561
but the demands he makes of
a female student are so obscene.

261
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,897
Eugeo: You don’t
have to say any more.

262
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:40,000
The problem is, the only way
to change frenica’s mentor

263
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,969
is to get the approval
of her current one.

264
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,971
Can you tell us his name?

265
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,041
( Tiese sighs ) Yes.

266
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:51,912
It’s second seat elite disciple,
humbert zizek.

267
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,514
Kirito: I’m not surprised.

268
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,048
( Both gasp )

269
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,585
Eugeo: A few days ago, I had
a sparring match with humbert

270
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,388
in the training hall.
We ended it in a draw.

271
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:05,092
In fact, he seemed
pretty upset by that.

272
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,530
my guess is he’s taking
his frustrations out on frenica.

273
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,465
Ronie: He’s doing this
out of revenge?

274
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,534
How could he be so cruel?

275
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,436
Tiese: I just
can’t understand it.

276
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:20,907
We live in a larger house
than most other civilians

277
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,477
and enjoy
some additional privileges,

278
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,713
but my father
would always remind me

279
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,415
that we should never
take those things for granted.

280
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:31,552
He’d say we were obliged
to ensure everyone,

281
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:32,886
no matter their station,

282
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,522
could live
a happy and peaceful life.

283
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,158
And if war broke out,
it’s our duty

284
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,795
to take up our swords first
and protect the weak.

285
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,131
and yet,
because of the heartless orders

286
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,167
that were issued by a noble,

287
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,670
frenica couldn’t help but cry
herself to sleep last night.

288
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,940
it’s not right. How can
something like this be allowed?

289
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,176
( Sighs )

290
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,745
Thank you.

291
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,048
Kirito: There’s a phrase
in the sacred tongue

292
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,415
that comes to mind,

293
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,050
which--let’s see.

294
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,588
it’s pronounced
noblesse oblige, I think.

295
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:12,826
Basically it means
whoever’s got the power

296
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,995
should use it
for the sake of the vulnerable,

297
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,531
just like your father said.

298
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,567
It’s a code of honor,

299
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,603
and that kind of honor
is more important

300
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,505
than any law or custom.

301
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,641
There are things
you just shouldn’t do,

302
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,777
even if there’s
no law against ’em.

303
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:34,014
At the same time, there might
be stuff you should do,

304
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,717
even if the laws
say you shouldn’t.

305
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,087
Ronie: I think I understand

306
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,821
what it is you’re saying.

307
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,924
If i’m hearing you correctly...

308
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,794
the taboo index
doesn’t cover everything.

309
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,929
In cases like this one,

310
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,565
we have to use
our own personal sense

311
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:52,933
of what’s right
and what’s wrong.

312
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,469
Instead of blindly obeying laws,

313
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:59,740
we need to ask why they exist
and if they’re even honorable.

314
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,940
That self-reflection

315
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,944
is more important
than just blind faith.

316
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,347
kirito: Yup!
That’s exactly right.

317
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,814
It’s super important to learn

318
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,649
how to act and think
for yourself.

319
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,651
That’s worth more
than the best sword

320
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,553
or the flashiest move.

321
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,823
Even though humbert didn’t
technically break the rules,

322
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,359
what he did is still 100% wrong.

323
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,763
Someone’s gotta hold him
accountable for that.

324
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,900
In this case, it looks
like it’s up to us to.

325
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:30,037
eugeo: Right.
We’ll go and sort this out.

326
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,041
Raios: Well, well.

327
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:38,545
To what do we owe the pleasure
of this visit, disciple eugeo?

328
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,415
and on the evening
of our day of rest, no less.

329
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,818
Eugeo: I’ve come to report
a troubling rumor.

330
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,788
unfortunately,
it concerns disciple zizek.

331
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,391
I thought i’d bring this
to your attention

332
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,960
before it damaged
his stellar reputation.

333
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,728
Humbert: Are you mocking me?!

334
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:56,597
Raios: Oh, my.

335
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,131
I must say i’m surprised.

336
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,667
i wouldn’t have
expected this from you.

337
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,669
How thoughtful of you
to be concerned

338
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,972
for the sake
of my friend’s good name.

339
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,841
However, i’m afraid
I have no idea

340
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,677
what this rumor
you speak of could be.

341
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,583
Along with the nature
of these claims,

342
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,086
I must ask where you
acquired this information.

343
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,854
Eugeo: From lord zizek’s page,

344
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,357
along with the girls
who room with her.

345
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,958
As far as the claims
are concerned,

346
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:28,762
they say lord zizek
has been issuing perverse orders

347
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,465
to his page, frenica.

348
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,667
raios: What are
these "perverse orders"?

349
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,737
I’m not following what it is
you’re getting at, sir eugeo.

350
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,072
Which of the school’s
regulations

351
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,141
has he violated specifically?

352
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,643
( Eugeo gasps )

353
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,411
( Sighs )

354
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:48,015
Sir, even if something isn’t
specifically forbidden here,

355
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,817
do you not agree there are
things an elite disciple

356
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,420
should never do
as a primary trainee’s mentor?

357
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,623
raios: Oh, ho!
I can tell this upsets you.

358
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,059
Now then, what exactly
are you insinuating

359
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,462
humbert forced frenica to do?

360
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,063
Eugeo: I couldn’t say.

361
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,966
raios: Well,
what say you, humbert?

362
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,434
Do you have any idea

363
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,803
what it is sir eugeo
could be referring to?

364
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:13,407
Humbert: Not even the foggiest!

365
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,910
Try as I might, I can’t make
heads nor tails of it.

366
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,779
It is true that I asked her

367
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,915
to perform
some menial tasks for me.

368
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,550
But ever since my duel
with sir eugeo,

369
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,054
which regrettably ended
in a draw, i’m a changed man

370
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,023
and have immersed myself
fully in my training!

371
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,427
Why, i’ve been using muscles
I did not know I had,

372
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:36,130
and, as a result,
my body ached so badly.

373
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,398
In such a humbled state
as I was in,

374
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,434
I had no choice but to ask her

375
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,536
to massage me every night
while I bathed.

376
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:43,938
( Eugeo gasps )

377
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,806
Humbert: I was concerned
she would soil her uniform,

378
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:47,942
so I graciously
had her strip down

379
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,776
and massage me
in her undergarments.

380
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,813
honestly, I can’t
for the life of me understand

381
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,149
how anyone
could think that perverse.

382
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:03,490
Eugeo: Because of your behavior,
frenica has been beside herself.

383
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,593
If you continue harassing her,
I will be forced

384
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,596
to bring it to the attention
of our instructors.

385
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:10,864
I hope you understand.

386
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,933
- Humbert: Why, you...
- ( Raios claps )

387
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,540
Raios: I appreciate the warning,
disciple eugeo.

388
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,109
Do whatever you feel is right.

389
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,779
( Eugeo grunts )

390
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:26,880
Kirito: Don’t let
those jerks get to you.

391
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,750
Eugeo: I don’t know
how you kept so calm.

392
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,452
I thought I was going
to lose it in there.

393
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,955
Kirito: Lucky for them,
you didn’t have your sword.

394
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,091
Well, at least,
now i’m pretty sure

395
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,860
they’re up to something more
than just being creeps.

396
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:41,662
- eugeo: What?
- Kirito: I get the feeling

397
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,697
the reason they’re going
to all this trouble

398
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,132
is to set a trap for you.

399
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,367
Eugeo: Really?

400
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,968
Kirito: Yeah. Look,

401
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:51,038
if you’d taken their bait and
started going off on humbert,

402
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:54,474
they could have accused you
of being disrespectful to them,

403
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,444
and they’d be in their rights
to punish you. You see?

404
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,446
( Eugeo sighs )

405
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:02,483
( Kirito sighs ) Don’t worry.

406
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:06,086
if humbert doesn’t stop
messing with frenica, he’ll pay.

407
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,756
For now, all we can do
is tell the teachers,

408
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,824
so stay sharp,
and keep your eyes open.

409
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,827
Eugeo: All right. I’ll do that.

410
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:16,797
kirito: And, eugeo, if
those guys say anything to you

411
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:19,400
when i’m not around,
try not to get yourself

412
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,001
all riled up
like you did back there.

413
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,037
Eugeo: I-I won’t. I promise.

414
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,472
I’ll just, you know, stay cool.

415
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,473
Kirito: Exactly.

416
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,476
Stay cool always.

417
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,913
Tiese: Allow me
to make my report!

418
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:35,749
All chores are done.

419
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,052
The assigned cleaning
has also been completed.

420
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,920
Eugeo: Good work, as usual.

421
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,789
I really appreciate it.

422
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,790
Tiese: Oh, it’s nothing!
I’m your page, after all.

423
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,960
Eugeo: By the way,
if you have the time,

424
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:49,496
i’d like to talk to you
about something.

425
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,765
You don’t have to stand.
Please, sit down.

426
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,001
( Tiese gasps )

427
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,476
Very well. If you insist.

428
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:10,884
Eugeo: Uh...

429
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,954
( Clears throat )

430
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,056
It’s about frenica.

431
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:18,726
I had a talk with humbert
about her yesterday.

432
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,060
Tiese: Did you, really?!

433
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:22,730
Eugeo: I doubt he wants
to get into any trouble,

434
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,732
so i’m pretty sure he won’t be
harassing her anymore.

435
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,467
Tiese: Thank goodness.

436
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,069
You don’t know
how grateful I am,

437
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:31,572
elite disciple eugeo, sir!

438
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,006
Eugeo: Your work’s
done for today,

439
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,942
so please just call me eugeo.

440
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,812
Anyway, there’s something
I need to apologize for.

441
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,916
I wasn’t sure of it yesterday,

442
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:44,551
but now I am.

443
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,753
The reason this happened
in the first place

444
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,624
was all because of the duel
I had with humbert.

445
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,395
Do you think you could set up
a meeting with her for me?

446
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:57,364
I’d like to apologize in person.

447
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,366
( Tiese gasps )

448
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:02,136
Yes. Of course.

449
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,504
Honestly, despite what you say,

450
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,673
none of this
is really your fault.

451
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,008
But i’ll be more than happy

452
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:10,811
to convey your wishes to her,
none the less.

453
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,681
Um, c-could I...

454
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:14,781
Eugeo: Mm?

455
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:17,150
Tiese: C-could I
sit closer to you?

456
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,686
Eugeo: Uh...

457
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:20,921
Sure.

458
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:29,797
Tiese: I’ve been thinking.

459
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:32,666
After I graduate
from the academy,

460
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,769
i’ll take over as head
of the schtrinen family.

461
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:39,006
As is custom, I will then
have to marry a noble

462
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,708
who is of the same rank
or possibly higher.

463
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:46,981
And it terrifies me!

464
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:48,448
( Eugeo gasps )

465
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,550
Tiese: What if the man
who becomes my husband

466
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,420
turns out to be
someone like lord zizek,

467
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,155
someone who is cruel to others

468
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:57,558
and who lacks
the basic principles of honor

469
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,726
my father raised me to uphold?

470
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,828
I’m so scared.

471
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,363
