Aside from us knights,
the human empire

111
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,890
we don’t have an army
is administrator’s fault.

You know why that is?

113
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,390
It’s ’cause she’s scared that,
if the people had weapons,

they could all
rise up against her.

115

If a war happens, the nobles are
supposed to protect the weak,

but she let the upper class
get lazy and corrupt.

this world’s
running out of time,

119

If we can get the word out

120
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,450
before the armies of the dark
show up, we can fight.

we can build our own army.

how corrupt the nobles are!

124
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,460
They would protect
their own interests
before anyone else.

Kirito: Yeah, some of ’em,

just a small group of people.

not everyone
thinks like they do.

128
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,640
The lower-class nobles
and commoners

129
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,840
would join the fight
in a heartbeat.

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,580

is hand out the weapons

132
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,910
you guys have got stashed
here in the tower.

133
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,850
Then we teach everyone
the same sword skills

134
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,850
and sacred arts
you knights know.

135
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,890
If we do that, we could
build an army in a year or so.

136
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,720
Thing is, at this point,

137
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,960
it can’t happen if the pontifex
is still in charge.

138
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,860
You know what scares her more
than the forces of the dark?

139
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,930
It’s people having free will.

140
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,630
If she can’t have an army loyal
to her, there won’t be an army,

141
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,740
so I say we throw a coup.

142
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,070
If we can bring down
administrator,

143
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,810
we’ll free all the people.

144
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Then, we can use
the time we got left

145
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,240
to train them all to fight,
and, with any luck,

146
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,850
