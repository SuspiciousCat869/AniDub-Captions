They were the four staff members
from rath who built this place.

Cardinal: You are correct.

279
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,065
Two males and two females
came to this land.

280
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,568
Each couple raised eight
children each on two farms.

281
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,337
They taught them
to read and write

282
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,007
and how to raise crops
and livestock, too,

283
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,843
and the moral arguments
of good and evil,

284
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,579
which formed the basis
of the taboo index.

285
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,516
Based on how effectively
the first four

286
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,851
were able to pass down
these teachings,

it’s clear that, as humans,

they were
incredibly intelligent.

However...

290
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,593
There was one among them
who was not only brilliant,

291

but devious as well.

292
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,466

such as the hunger
to rule and conquer.

would eventually become
the nobles of this land,

is the pontifex

a woman who controls
everything with an iron fist.

administrator or something.

306

i’ve been talking about.

while I don’t like to admit it,

is my elder twin sister,

after the first four logged out,

312
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,755

was arranged

is to research the sacred arts.
