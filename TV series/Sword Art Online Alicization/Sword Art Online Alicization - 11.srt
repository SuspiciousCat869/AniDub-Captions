is chock-full of ’em!

323
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,203
Eugeo: It’s rare to find one,
but a whole garden full...

324
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,240
I can’t believe
we’re standing here.

325
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:23,778
You and I actually made it
to the central cathedral.

326
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,080
Kirito: Yeah. We’re criminals,
not integrity knights,

327
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,083
but we’re here,
and that’s all that matters.

328
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,584
Eugeo: It’s probably
for the best

329
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,319
that things worked out this way.

330
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,187
If we had become
integrity knights,

331
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,056
we might have
ended up like Alice.

332
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,124
Kirito: They could have
gotten in our heads

333
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,793
and screwed
with our memories, too.

334
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:43,264
I wonder, if they do that
to all the integrity knights,

335
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:47,635
do they forget everything
about who they were before?

336
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:49,236
Eugeo: Who knows?

337
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,805
kirito: Yeah, well,
even if a knight’s memories

338
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,342
got blocked somehow,
they’d at least remember

339
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,644
their parents or
the place where they were born.

340
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,414
stuff like that’s
baked into a person’s soul.

341
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,316
It’d be impossible to swap out

342
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,418
those kind of details
with fake ones.

343
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,819
Eugeo: You have a point.

344
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:09,323
those fake memories
would likely be tenuous at best.

345
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,692
what if they were
flying around while on duty

346
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,161
and came upon
the place they grew up?

347
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,396
Once they saw it,
they would know,

348
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,465
and all their memories
would come--( Gasps )

349
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,535
Kirito: What?

350

You’re worried i’ll find a way

354
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,679
to get my memories back
in that tower, aren’t you?

355

Stop it! Let me go!

Kirito: Man, I told you before
not to worry, and I meant it.

361
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:48,428
Whether I get my memories back
or not, we make a great team,

362
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,197
so we’re stickin’ together

It’s not that I don’t trust you
to keep your word.

366
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,806
You’ve only mentioned it
a million times so far.

367
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,743
But when I think
about how our journey

368
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:07,848
might be coming to an end,
I feel--i don’t know.

369
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,885
Kirito: The fact is
it’s gonna end one day,

370
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,888
but don’t forget
what that’s gonna mean.

371
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:16,857
You’ll get alice’s memory back,

372
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,825
and then you’re
gonna take her home.

373
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,896
There’s another good thing
that’ll come out of it.

374
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,498
You’ll get to pick
another calling.

375
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,134
it might last
the rest of your life,

376
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,237
so you better start thinking
about what you want.

377
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,306
Eugeo: I think I still have
a bit of time to decide.

378
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,641
I know whatever I pick

379
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,677
won’t have anything to do
with woodcutting.

380
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,579
( Kirito laughs )
No surprise there.

381
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,180
