00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,140
madam pontifex, I do
not want your so-called love,

167
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,740
and I do not need you
to fix me!

168
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,940
Administrator:
I’m sad to hear that.

169
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,780
unfortunately,
what you want doesn’t matter.

170
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,710
As soon as I resynthesize you--

171
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,010
and I will--the pesky feelings
that trouble you now

172
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,720
will be erased completely.

173
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,690
Kirito: Kinda like what you did
to yourself way back when,

174
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,790
huh, quinella?

175
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,660
Administrator:
Watch it, little boy.

176
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,660
Dredging up the past
is considered quite rude.

177
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,300
Kirito: Why? You scared
the truth will come out?

178
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,670
no one’s got the power
to erase the past, not even you.

179
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,070
You were born a human
and raised a human.

180
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,040
and no matter
how much power you got,

181
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,980
that’s one thing
you can’t change, can you?

182
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,710
Administrator:
I’m not quite sure

183
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,110
what you’re getting at,

184
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,110
little boy from the outer world.

185
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,220
Kirito: All you want
is to be a god,

186
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,720
but you can never be a god,
’cause you’re human.

187
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,690
being human
means you make mistakes,

188
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,420
and you made a big one.

189
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,960
At this point, there’s nothing
you can do to fix it.

190
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,700
you got
less integrity knights now.

191
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,930
If the dark territory invades,
who’s gonna stop ’em?

192
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,740
They’ll destroy everything.

193
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,100
Administrator:
And who was the one

194
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
who corrupted
some of my best knights?

195
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,940
That was you, boy.

196
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,240
kirito: If you’re
all that’s left after this,

197
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,950
maybe you can start over
with a clean slate.

198
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,710
Maybe that’s what
you always wanted.

199
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,880
Thing is, it ain’t gonna go
the way you want it.

200
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,820
On the other side,

201
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,790
there’s the people
who created this world

202
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,290
and have final say
over what happens to it.

203
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,830
when they see
the human empire fall,

204
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,260
they’ll think,
"oh, well, that didn’t work.

205
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,700
I guess we’ll start over."

206
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,100
And then one of them
will push a button,

207
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,930
and everything’ll disappear,

208
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,410
the mountains, the rivers...

209
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,840
The towns...

210
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,780
Every person here, and you.

211
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,480

in the blink of an eye.

Administrator: Point taken.

214
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,460
But I have a feeling the same
goes for your world, too.

215
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,160
You must have a creator.

216
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,100
Does your kind grapple
with the thought

217
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,430
of living under the whim
of a higher power as well?

218
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,140
Do you strive to please
this being, obeying its laws,

219
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,440
hoping it won’t tire of you
and wipe you out?

( Kirito gasps )

221
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,110
Administrator: I would be
shocked if that were the case.

222
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,010
as you say,
your kind created our world,

223
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,850
and, if we fail them, they
would delete us without a care.

224
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,850
if that is how
your kind treat us, boy,

225
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,790
then you do not have
the right to criticize me.

226
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,760
I reject their authority.

227
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,800
I will not pander
to self-proclaimed gods,

228

groveling for the right
to continue existing.

229
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,100
I refute them all.

230
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,300
I exist for one reason alone,

231
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,870
to rule over all in this world.

232

That singular desire is what
drives me and gives me life.

233

240

Administrator: On the contrary.

241
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,440
I will not allow your kind
to reset the underworld,

242

nor will I allow

Alice: Kirito...

329
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,590
Who is this person?

330
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,560
Kirito: She’s cardinal.

331
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,330
She’s the good pontifex
of this world.

332
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,540
200 years ago,
she fought administrator,

333
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,700
but she had to go into hiding.

334
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,370
She saved eugeo and me and
guided us into the cathedral.

335
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,610
She wants to help.

336
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,840
No one loves this world
more than her.

337
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,380
Alice: I don’t doubt it.

338
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,780
I trust the warmth of her power.

339
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,920
Thank you for healing me,
milady.

340
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,220
Cardinal: Mm.

341
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,560
( Rings clinking )

342
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,230
You stubborn fool.

343
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,640
Did I not relieve you
of your duties?

344
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,240
Did I not thank you
for all your hard work?

345
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,810
why couldn’t you
just stay on your bookshelf?

346
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,980
Kirito: I’m sorry.

347
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,310
Did she have a fluctlight, too?

348
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,480
Cardinal: No.

349
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,920
To borrow a term
from your world,

350
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,790
Charlotte was like an npc.

351
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,490
Kirito: W-wait. What?

352
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,990
But she--

353
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,690
she risked her life to save me.

354
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,830
That’s not something
an npc’d do.

355
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,960
i mean, if she
didn’t have a soul, then--

356
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,930
cardinal: This child
had been alive for 200 years.

357
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,500
She was my constant companion,

358
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,510
and she watched over
a number of people for me.

359
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,440
For the past two years,
she was with you.

360
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,880
after spending
all that time with someone,

361
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,050
one doesn’t need
a fluctlight to care.

362
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,290
Even if the nature
of an intelligence

363
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,460
is just a collection
of input and output data,

364
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,530
it is still possible for it
to have a true soul within

365
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,300
and, in some cases, love.

366
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,530
a concept
you’ll never understand,

367
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,670
as long as you live!

368
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,740
Administrator,
you wretched woman!

369
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,740
