there was
a high-level sacred art

82
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,636

from decreasing.

a passage about that spell

in one of the old books
in the church.

87
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,448
But the problem is,

88
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,017
only the high priests
at the axiom church can use it.

do you have to be

93
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,058
a high priest to use the spell?

94
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,960

could learn it.

it’s not
for regular folk like us.

97
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,068
The arts get their strength
from the sacred power

98
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,871
that solus and terraria
saturate the air and land with.

99
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:36,042
The more elaborate the art,
the more sacred power it takes.

100
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,679
It would take more power
than this forest has,

101
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,981

to zakkaria could wield it.

00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,870
Why’d you even bother?

164
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,773
Eugeo: I guess I was hoping

165
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,541
one day i’d have
the strength to swing it.

166
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,844
I’m still not strong enough to.

167
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,045
Do you think you are?

168
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,713
Kirito: I’m down to try.

169
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,549
I’m a swordsman, after all.

170
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,884
( Hand scraping )

171
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,520
( Grunting )

172
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,121
( Blade rings )

173
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,756
Whoa! Unh!

174
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,857
( Blade clangs )

175
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,924
( Sighs )

176
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,193
( Eugeo chuckles )

177
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,762
looks like it’s
too heavy for you, too.

178
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,096
( Blade rings )

179
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,033
Kirito: It’s not made of steel.
Or is it?

180
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,868
Eugeo: No, I don’t think so.

181
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,170
And it’s not silver
or dragonbone, either.

182
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,506
I think it might be
a divine object.

183
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,807
Kirito: A what?

184
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,010
Eugeo: It’s something
that was either made

185
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:59,780
with the help of the gods
or was created by them.

186
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,549
We call things like that
divine objects.

187
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,884
Kirito: That makes sense.

188
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,052
Hey, eugeo? Could you, like,

189
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,221
check how much life
the gigas cedar has now?

190
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,990
Eugeo: Don’t tell me.
let me guess.

191
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,592
you’re going to try
striking it with the sword.

192
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,561
kirito:
You’re damn straight, I am.

193
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,597
Unless the taboo index
forbids it,

194
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,065
but I bet it doesn’t, does it?

195
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,933
( Eugeo chuckles )
No, it doesn’t.

196
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,970
it’s funny.
All this seems so familiar.

197
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:32,145
Right now, it’s at 232,315.

198
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,214
Kirito: Cool. Remember that.

199
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,216
( Hands scraping )

200
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,184

( Yells )

( Blade rings )

00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,834
( Grunts )

205
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,635
Eugeo: Did you hurt yourself?!

206
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,005
Kirito: No, i’m okay.

207
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,041
Eugeo: I told you before.
That tree is tough.

208
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,008
( Gasps )

209
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:07,047
no way.
You actually cut into it.

210
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,319
And deep, too.

211
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,155
kirito: Go on.
See where its life’s at now.

212
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,624
Eugeo: Oh. Right.

213
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,261
232,314.

214
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,830
Kirito: You’re kidding!

215
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,099
It only went down one point?!

216
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,234
Eugeo: Your hit landed
in the wrong spot.

217
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,203
i bet it would have
decreased its life a lot more

218
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,207
if you got it in the center
of the cut instead of the bark.

219
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,909
looks like
your intuition was right.

220
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,245
the sword is
more effective than the ax.

221
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,682
Even so, we’d have to master
using it to get any results.

222
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,185
Kirito: I can’t hit it straight,
but I bet you could.

223
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:48,122
Eugeo: I can barely hold
the sword, let alone swing it.

224
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,757
Kirito: It’s all
about technique,

225
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,091
and I can help you with that.

226
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,059
( Eugeo sighs )

227
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,095
Okay, i’ll give it a shot.

228
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,099
( Grunting )

229
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,103
S-so heavy!

230
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,938
Kirito: First thing,
find your balance,

231
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,874
and when you swing,
swing with your body.

232
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,642
with swords,
it’s more about momentum,

233
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,876
not just arm strength.

234
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,978
Eugeo: Mm-hmm.

235
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,083
- ( Hands scraping )
- ( Deep breath )

236
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:25,926

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,861
( Blade rings )

238
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,663
( Eugeo grunting )

239
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,834
Kirito: Hey! You all right?

240
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,236
eugeo: I think
I lost some life on that one.

241
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,106
Kirito: Oh, well.
It was a good try.

242
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,646
( Gasps )

243
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:52,085
if durability’s life,
I lost some when I took a swing.

244
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:56,156
Hmm. It says my object control
authority’s at 38.

245
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,092
I guess that’s my parameter.

246
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,231
The sword’s is higher.

247
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,169
- ( Sighs )

248
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,338
That’s what i’m talkin’ about.

249
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,640
( Deep breath )

250
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,911
at this rate,
i’ll never get to centoria.

251
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:21,215
I need eugeo’s help, but he
won’t bail on his calling.

252
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,851
if it wasn’t
for that taboo index,

253
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,854
he could do whatever he wants.

254
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,990
He said the axiom church
came up with it.

255
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,125
Wonder what the deal is
with them.

256
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,195
If i’m right and these people
are a.I. Fluctlights

257
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:37,198
in a simulated civilization,

258
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:40,701
there’s no way the system
would let ’em break a rule.

259
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,236
Hang on.

260
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,039
Eugeo said Alice
broke the taboo index

261
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:49,076
when she accidentally
crossed into the dark territory,

262
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,979
but she was there by choice.

263
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,414
She went against the system.

264
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,151
So is she not an a.I.?

265
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,319
Selka: Hello?
Is someone in there?

266
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,821
Kirito: Y-yeah, there is!

267
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,155
I-i’m almost done!

268
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,826
Selka: Oh! Um, no.
You can take your time.

269
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,127
I was just checking.

270
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,096
Sorry to bother you.
good night.

271
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,998
Kirito: Uh, selka!

272
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,766
I wanted to ask you something.

273
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,067
Selka: Mm...

274
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,704
♪

275
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,842
- ( Knock on door )
- mm?

276
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,380
Selka: So? What was it
you wanted to ask me?

277
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,781
Kirito: Yeah.

278
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,952
Um...

279
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,256
It’s about your older sister.

280
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,757
( Selka gasps )

281
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,425
Kirito: I heard about her,

282
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,026
you know, from eugeo.

283
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,330
And, like, he told me
her name was Alice.

284
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,031
Selka: He did, did he?

285
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,068
What else did he tell you,
besides her name was Alice?

286
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,837
kirito: Oh, um,
he said she was studying

287
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,940
the sacred arts
here at the church

288
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,076
and how, six years ago,
an integrity knight took her.

289
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,411
i got the feeling
he’s really worried about her.

290
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:03,784
selka: I didn’t know.
I thought he forgot about her.

291
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,219
This explains a lot
about him, though.

292
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,489
She’s the reason eugeo’s so sad.

293
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,258
Kirito: I didn’t get that.
He seems fine.

294
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,127
selka: He’s not.
You had to have noticed it,

295
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,130
how quiet and gloomy he is.

296
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,198
Kirito: Oh. Yeah.

297
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,234
Selka: When my sister was here,

298
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,504
every time I saw him,
he had a smile on his face.

299
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:27,307
I don’t remember ever seeing him
without one back then.

300
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:31,946
But not any more. He spends
his days of rest alone,

301
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,849
and the only time I see him
is when he goes to the forest.

302
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,484
Kirito: Selka...

303
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:38,986
You really like him, don’t you?

304
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,220
( Selka squeals )

305
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,857
I didn’t say that! Oh, my gosh!

306
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,525
( Kirito laughs )

307
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,928
Selka: Everyone
compares me to Alice.

308
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,830
No one says it, but I know.

309
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:53,500
When my parents see me,
I remind them of her,

310
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,503
and I can’t stand it any more.

311
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:58,939
That’s probably
why eugeo avoids me.

312
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,274
When he sees me,
he thinks of her,

313
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,477
and I can tell
it makes him sad.

314
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,047
But there’s nothing I can do.

315
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,182
It’s not my fault she’s gone.

316
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,920
( Gasps )

317
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,456
i’m sorry.
I’m acting like a baby.

318
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,491
Kirito: No, not at all.

319
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,259
It’s good to cry.

320
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,328
It’s better than holdin’ it in.

321
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,030
