to have my lunch,

I get to sleep, so there’s that.

what I mean.

Huh. That makes sense.

188
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,330
"Operator" is all
anyone calls me anymore.

189

Eugeo: I think we can help.

190
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,400
We, um...

191
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,310
We came here to bring down
the head of the church,

192
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,610
the one who forced
this calling onto you.

193
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,340
Operator: You don’t say?

194
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,050
Eugeo: If the church is gone,

195
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,010
you’ll be released
from your calling.

196
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,420
You’ll be free
to do whatever you want.

197

Operator: Is that so?

198
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,490
I’m at a loss.

199
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,730
I don’t know anything
of the world outside this shaft.

200
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,300
Therefore, I have no idea
what new calling I would choose.

201
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,540
Although, if I could wish
for anything else to do...

202
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,680
I wish I could fly
this platform outside

203
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,550
and go wherever I wanted.

204
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,990
Thank you for your Patience.

205

This is the 80th floor,

Eugeo: I didn’t think
anything in this world

207
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,570
could be more boring
than my calling,

208
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,970
but it’s nothing
compared to hers.

209
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,270
I could look forward
to growing old and retiring.

210

She’s stuck with hers forever.

211
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Kirito: Cardinal said that
even if you stopped a person

212
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,450
from aging with a sacred art,

213
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,420
there’s no way
to stop their soul from aging.

214
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,550
Little by little,
their memory crumbles,

215
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,990
and in the end
it falls apart.

216
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,960
The axiom church
is straight-up evil.

217
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,330
We’re the only ones
who can stop administrator

218
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,430
and free everyone.

219

is what comes after.

after we defeated administrator,

cardinal would make things
right again. Won’t she?
