00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,950

HAS NO BUSINESS HERE.

DEAR COMMANDER, PRAY TELL,

314
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,270
WHY DID YOU NOT USE
YOUR SWORD’S FULL POWER?

315
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,500
IF YOU HAD, YOU COULD HAVE
SLAUGHTERED THIS LOATHSOME BRAT

318
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,510
\h\h\h\hCOMMITTED TREASON
AGAINST THE GLORIOUS PONTIFEX.
