00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,014
At least try to get back here
before they’re done cleaning.

329
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:43,050
And could you tell me
why you’re coming in

330
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:44,484
through the window
all of a sudden?

331
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,919
Kirito: ’cause it’s
the shortest route

332
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:47,287
from east third street.

333
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,523
it’s way faster
than going through the lobby.

334
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,459
Keep that in mind,
’cause on days

335
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,127
you’re running late,
it’s a lifesaver.

336
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,361
Girls: Oh! Right!

337
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:57,798
Eugeo: Could you
not teach them that?

338
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,800
Hang on. If you’re
coming from east third,

339
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,968
then that bag is from--

340
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,303
kirito: Ha! So much for manners

341
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,206
when your stomach’s rumbling,
eh, eugeo?

342
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,509
Here.

343
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,043
( Girls gasp )

344
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,181
Kirito: Here. I bought extra

345
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,484
so you can share some
with your dormmates.

346
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,786
( Girls laugh )

347
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:22,189
Ronie: Thank you so much,
elite disciple kirito!

Tiese: We’ll head back
as fast as we can

349
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,326
and eat these
before their life decreases!

350
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,494
We’ll see you tomorrow!

351
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,233
Ooh! It’s full of honey pies
from the prancing deer café!

352
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,935
let’s hurry
before they get cold!

353
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,237

356
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:40,808
What’s up?

357
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:43,577
Eugeo: Oh, nothing much, really.

358
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:46,580
It’s just i’m wondering
where your head’s at.

359
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,983
I hope you haven’t gotten
so comfortable lately

360
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,552
that you’ve forgotten why we
came here in the first place.

361
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:54,054
( Kirito chuckles )
Like i’d forget.

We’re closer now than ever.

Eugeo: Mm-hmm.

365
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,001
Almost there.
