00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,950
It’s no boatload of cash,

159
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,350
but you’re taking
forgotten funds

160
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,880
and putting them back
into the Japanese economy.

161
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,520
You’re doing great work here.

162
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,990
Shigechi: Uh--( Laughs )

163
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,420
Really? Do you mean it?
You think it’s great?

164
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,290
does that mean
you think i’m great, too?

165
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,960
Be honest! ( Giggles )

166
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,930
Josuke: Oh, man, talk about
being hidden in plain sight.

167
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,470
I’ve gotta hand it to the guy.

168
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,370
No one would ever think
of collecting money like this.

169
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,370
Okuyasu: I’m so jealous.
He’s a freakin’ genius.

170
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,110
( Shigechi gasps ) I-I may
have heard you incorrectly,

171
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,280
but did you happen to say
I was a "freaking genius"?

172
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,480
No one has ever said anything
like that to me before.

173
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,250
I’ve picked up 120,000 yen
since I started--

174
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,250
both: 120,000?!

175
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,220
Shigechi: But your kind words
make me even happier.

176
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,420
josuke: Hey,
you have 120,000 yen?

177
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,520
Shigechi: Pretty good, huh?

178
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Josuke: And you
scrounged together

179
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,360
all that money around morioh?

180
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,200
shigechi: Yep.
It’s the only way to do things,

181
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,330
since I never
step foot out of town.

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,930
I could get lost,
and some creepo

183
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,840
might take advantage
of my innocence. Hee hee.

184
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,240
Josuke: No fair. I have 12 yen,
and he’s rolling in it.

185
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,510
Hmm?

186
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,340
- Okuyasu...
- ( Okuyasu gasps )

187
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,010
Josuke: What’s wrong
with your left foot?

188
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,350
Okuyasu: Eh...

189
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,950
Whoa, what in the world?!

190
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,320
How did three 50-yen coins

191
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,380
end up hiding
right under my foot?!

192
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,020
You think this random money
might belong to shigekiyo?

193
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,020
He should keep an eye
on his stash.

194
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,390
Josuke: You sneaky dick.

195
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,630
( Shigechi gasps ) Here you go.

196
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,130
I’ll give you guys half.

197
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,060
- Would that make you happy?
- Both: Huh?!

198
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,300
Shigechi: We’re each other’s
bestest friends now, right?

199
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,170
We can all hang out
and do cool things.

200
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,030
Okuyasu: Really?!
Do you mean it?!

201
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,070
Josuke: Lucky us!

202
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,210
( Gasps ) No, wait.
This just isn’t right.

203
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,110
You can’t just hand over
your hard-earned money

204
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,210
to complete strangers
like it’s nothing at all.

205
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,410
Shigechi: Okay, this time,
i’ll put my back into it.

206
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,980
go on. Take it.
Half of all of this is yours.

207
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,350
That’s what friends
are for, isn’t it?

208
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,950
Josuke: Grunting and
scrunching up your face

209
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,290
doesn’t make it right.

210
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,220
- Okuyasu: Let’s talk.
- ( Josuke groans )

211
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,590
Okuyasu: Can you excuse us
for a second, shigechi?

212
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,590
We need to chat. ( Chuckles )

213
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,330
Listen to me, josuke.

214
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,260
Enough of the goody-goody shit.

215
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,330
if this turd boy
wants to give us his money,

216
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,070
then who are we
to turn him down?

217
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,940
Josuke: Sorry, buddy,
but my pride won’t allow me

218
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,240
to do that.
It’s just not right, okay?

219
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,340
Okuyasu: As long as it’s
not some shitty disease,

220
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,080
i’ll take whatever people
are givin’, so don’t you judge!

221
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,550
Josuke: All right, I get it!
I wasn’t judging you! Chill out!

222
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,910
- stop crying.
- Okuyasu: But you said--

223
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,480
josuke: Look,
I know how you feel.

224
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,020
i’m not exactly
raking in yen myself, you know?

225
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,890
But never fear. I just
came up with a little idea

226
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,590
that’ll put
everyone’s minds at ease.

227
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,190
Okuyasu: Huh? You really
think it’s possible

228
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,530
to make everyone happy?

229
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,360
( Josuke chuckles )
Just leave everything to me!

230
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,000
Josuke: So, uh, shigekiyo--

231
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,610
actually, uh, do you mind
if I call you shigechi?

232
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,810
Shigechi: Oh, i’d love that.

233
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,040
Josuke: All right, shigechi,

234
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,610
we can’t take your money.

235
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,080
What you were attempting
to do just now is honestly

236
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,680
no different than trying
to pay for our friendship.

237
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,080
shigechi: But i--
I wasn’t trying to do that.

238
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,690
Josuke: Don’t worry.
I know you weren’t.

239
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,990
But if you ask me,

240
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,860
a friendship is something
you build over time.

241
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,190
Shigechi: All I was trying to do
was make some new friends.

242
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,260
jo: Yeah, I get that,
and I know exactly how you feel.

243
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,360
we stand users
have to stick together.

244
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,870
- ( Shigechi gasps )
- Josuke: And so,

245
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,370
what do you say we all do
a nice round of team building

246
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,900
and strengthen our friendship
with a little business venture?

247
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,270
- shigechi: Huh?
- Okuyasu: Business venture?

248
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,770
Josuke: Yep!
Before you know it,

249
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,610
us three are
gonna be stinking rich.

250
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,880
Shigechi: Oh, do I stink?

251
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,150
Joseph: I mean lots of cash.

252
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,380
Go with me here.

253
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,250
there’s only
so much money you can make

254
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,350
by picking up
leftover change, right?

255
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,650
I know things have worked out
for you so far,

256
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,290
but I have a much more lucrative
approach for harvest.

257
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,960
- Okuyasu: Oh?
- ( Shigechi gasps )

258
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,290
Okuyasu: You have a better plan
than picking up change?

259
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,030
This idea is legal, isn’t it?

260
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,800
Josuke: Yeah, there’s
nothing corrupt about it,

261
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,730
and no one’ll get hurt
in the process.

262
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,700
Shigechi: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
I’m likin’ what i’m hearin’,

263
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,240
so what’s your idea?

264
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,340
Josuke: Well, that’s where
the business part comes in,

265
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,240
and as compensation
for coming up

266
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,180
with this marvelous proposal,
you give us half the profits.

267
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,910
the other half
will go to you, shigechi.

268
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,250
The three of us are gonna
have to put our heads together

269
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,120
if we wanna pull this thing off,
but when all is said and done,

270
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,050
we’ll finally get
the payday we deserve.

271
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,750
Shigechi: That sounds good,
but i’m confused.

272
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,960
what’s my job
supposed to be in all this?

273
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,090
Josuke: Do you know
what i’m holding?

274
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,190
Shigechi: It’s a blue stamp.

275
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,930
Josuke: Right. It comes with

276
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,030
every 100-yen purchase
from kameyu.

277
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,930
You must have heard
of a chain this famous.

278
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,770
It’s one of eastern japan’s
biggest department stores.

279
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,600
And the best part
about these stickers

280
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,710
is there are plenty of people
who just toss ’em.

281
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,770
- Okuyasu: Ooh.
- Shigechi: Hmm?

282
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,210
Josuke: But wait. There’s more.

283
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,780
a 20-yen voucher from
that stationary store, meiwado.

284
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,180
And here’s a voucher
from cd shop Oscar!

285
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,020
Ten will get you 2,000 yen’s
worth of merchandise.

286
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,850
Here’s one from the cleaners,
märchen kids toy store,

287
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,220
and this is a card
from yotsuba electronics.

288
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,160
Now pay attention,
’cause this is important.

289
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,130
With a place like kameyu,
if you use this sticker,

290
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,060
you can get
a little bit of cash back.

291
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,970
Okuyasu: Oh, I see
what you’re getting at!

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,230
You’re as amazing
as ever, josuke.

293
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,270
This is the best plan
i’ve ever heard!

294
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,700

( All laughing )

296
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,670
Shigechi: All right, everybody!

297
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,880
- Go and do what you do best!

299
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,680
Okuyasu: By themselves,
these things

300
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,580
are as worthless
as scraps of paper,

301
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,350
but if you use
harvest to pick up

302
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,990
the tens of thousands of ’em
lying around town,

well, that’s
an entirely different story!

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,060
Okuyasu: If you’re treatin’,
i’m drinkin’.

463
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,100
And you know, I think
I want some calpis water.

464
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,170
Shigechi: Good for you.

465
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,130
( Okuyasu groans )

466
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,570
josuke, how come
you’re throwing those away?!

467
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,540
Josuke: ’cause they’re nothing
but worthless junk now,

468
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,040
just like year-end
lottery tickets.

469
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,710
Okuyasu: I remember telling
shigechi to pick these up

470
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,750
when he was grabbing
all the other tickets.

471
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,050
Josuke: You mean these losing

472
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,050
new year’s postcard
lottery letters?

473
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,790
And just how would you know
if these were losing tickets?

474
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,620
Josuke: That’s an easy one.

475
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,860
No one’s gonna throw away
a winning ticket, you dumb-ass.

476
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,230
Okuyasu: You say that,
but i’ve heard

477
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
that a lot of people
forget to check their numbers

478
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,330
and then end up missing out
on claiming their prizes.

479
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,670
if this wins,
you have to promise me

480
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,240
I can take half of it
for myself. Are we clear?

481
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,340
Shigechi: Fine by me.
half, it is.

482
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,240
And if you win
a sheet of stamps

483
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,910
instead of cold, hard cash,
i’ll let you keep that, too.

484
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,080
( Okuyasu chuckles )

485
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,010
Josuke: Jeez, okuyasu,
I never realized

486
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,650
how much you liked those
cheap, little gambling games.

487
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,750
Okuyasu: That one’s no good.
How ’bout this?

488
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,750
I didn’t really
think about it before,

489
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,920
but do you think I can
collect lottery prizes

490
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,520
if i’m still in high school?

491
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,090
Josuke: I don’t see
why you couldn’t.

492
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,630
So long as you have your I.D.
And name stamp on you,

493
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,060
it should be smooth sailing.

494
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,230
- ( Shigechi chuckles )
- Okuyasu: Sg group 121314.

495
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,570
Aw, man, that’s lame.
It’s just another dud.

496
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,940
Thought I had it this time.
Guess not.

497
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,540
( Grumbles ) Hmm.

498
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,880
( Gasps )

499
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:35,850
Huh? Sg group 121314. Hang on.

500
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,290
Hey, question--

501
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,760
if I happened to win
the lottery by chance,

502
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,820
would I have to take it
to the police?

503
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,660
Josuke: You idiot! Why would
you turn it in to them?

504
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,800
Harvest only picked up
what people threw away.

505
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,800
It’s not stealing.
And besides that,

506
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,900
unless you were
to somehow magically win,

507
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,800
it’s a moot point, right?
but best of luck.

508
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,810
okuyasu: What?!
This says, "sg group 121314"!

509
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,610
- Josuke: Eh?
- Shigechi: Huh?

510
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,780
Okuyasu: "Sg group 121314"?!

511
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,980
It’s sg group 121314!

512
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,320
Josuke: Whoa there. What are
you getting so worked up about?

513
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,320
( Okuyasu gasping )

514
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,690
Yaah! Five million!

515
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,690
There’s no doubt about it!
I won!

516
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,060
( Shrieks )

517
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,260
Josuke: Wait!
Are you kidding me?!

518
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,100
This better not
be a stupid joke.

519
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,900
( Both shrieking, laughing )

520
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,370
Josuke: Great!

521
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,940
♪

522
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,840
Okuyasu: Oh, yeah!
A dream come true!

523
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,270
Incredible!

524
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,710
We’re the first to ever
experience this greatness!

525
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,280
Josuke: Don’t get
ahead of yourself!

526
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,650
( Panting ) Settle down.

527
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,120
Let’s just double-check
to make sure you actually won.

528
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,290
"Sg group 121314,
prize five million yen."

529
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,960
Well, there you go. It’s hard
to believe, but it’s true.

530
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,230
If you hadn’t found this
lottery ticket when you did,

531
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,630
it would have been
off to the incinerator.

532
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,200
Look, it expires in a few days.

533
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,900
We have to get this to the bank.

534
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,700
And if they ask us
a bunch of questions,

535
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,570
we’ll tell them
we bought it fair and square

536
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,900
and hope they believe us
so we can get the cash.

537
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,170
You good on that plan?

538
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,770
Okuyasu: You know it.
Lie and get the dough!

539
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,340
Josuke: All right! We’re gonna
be five million yen richer!

540
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,680
( Okuyasu laughs )

541
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,750
Josuke: Now what
should I buy first?

542
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,750
i know. I’ll get
some sick Italian shoes.

543
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,250
Then i’ll buy
a new designer suit

544
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,690
that complements
my sexy physique.

545
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,020
After that, it’s on to tonio’s
for his most expensive dish.

546
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,730
And of course i’ll have
to go someplace cool abroad.

547
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,990
Okuyasu: I’m saving
all my money!

548
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,660
josuke: Wow!
Talk about playing it safe!

549
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,770
( Both laughing )

550

( Shigechi growls )

551
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,770
My harvest did
all the heavy lifting

552
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,870
while those two goofed around.

553
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,610
Every last yen of that
five million belongs to me.

554
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,980
I won’t let them take it.
