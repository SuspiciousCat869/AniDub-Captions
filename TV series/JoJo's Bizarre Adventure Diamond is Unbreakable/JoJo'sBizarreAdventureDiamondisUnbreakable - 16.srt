00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,160
I could have sworn you said
we were going hunting.

9
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,320
If that’s true,

10
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,430
does that mean
we’re going hunting

11
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,200
for hotties with hot bodies?
’cause you should know

12
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,700

i’ll be able to pull it off.

You’ll have to show me
the ropes.

He confessed.

Josuke: Are you serious?

17
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,240
jotaro: Yeah,
he had quite a lot to say,

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,380
especially regarding
the bow and arrow.

19
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,710
It turns out he also used it
to shoot a rat.

Josuke: He did what?!

21
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,650
Jotaro: That’s right,

22
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,620
but the rat didn’t die.

23
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,520
Even though it was
writhing in agony,

24
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,720
it freed itself from the arrow
and made a break for the hills.

But I need you to remember
one thing while on this hunt.

50
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,200
When dealing with live animals,

51
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,170
you have to prioritize
composure over speed.

52

If you corner the rat
and screw up the shot,

53
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,480
don’t expect it
to be gullible enough

54
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,180
to come within range again,

55
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,350
so hold your fire until you
know you can hit your target.

otoishi shot the rat
near this irrigation canal.

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,330
given the location,
it was probably a brown rat.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,940
Brown rats are agile swimmers,

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,340
adaptable, and can eat
practically anything.

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,510
larger rats can grow

The "s" shape means

These markings are tail tracks.

more than one here. Huh?

There’s a tick on this leaf,

Jotaro: It’s flesh.

97
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,630
at some point,
the flesh of these rats melted

98
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,400
and later congealed.

99
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,540
It seems as though the melting
started from under their flesh.

It took out its fellow rats
to seize the territory,

107

which would mean
it’s highly likely

108
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,490
the rat’s making a nest
in that drain.

109
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
The question now is,

110
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,960
has our culprit used its powers
to wreak any more havoc?

111

all signs point
to the rat being inside.

120
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,690
It’s safe to assume
the owners of this house

121
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,260
have already been killed.

122
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,530
let’s go.
We have to investigate.

123
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,110
The rat will let us approach it
up to a certain point.

124
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,640
It’s intelligent enough to know

125
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,280
that most humans are too slow
to ever catch it,

126
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,480
so it’s not expecting
to be used as target practice.

127
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,950
That’s how we’ll close in

128
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,150
and put an end to this mess
with one shot.

There’s no grass or grain here,
only meat.

or did the refrigerator
just open by itself?

138
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,530

what opened the fridge.

142
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,070
nobody told me rats
could open refrigerator doors.

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,980
so it’d have an easier time
storing them in the fridge?

161
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,220
Oh, and it’s eating them!

162
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,120
damn it.
Jotaro’s not coming back.

163
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,390
I’ll have to kill
this thing myself.

164
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,260
When dealing with live animals,

165
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,530
you have to focus
on composure over speed.

166
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,560
If I don’t tag him
on my first try,

167
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,230
he’ll know my range.

168
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,460
Damn it, jotaro.

169
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,130
I know you said no pressure,
but still...

170
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,170
Of course the table and chair

171
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,000
are positioned just enough
to be in my way.

172
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,470
I have to make sure
I sink this ball bearing

173
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,140
right between
his beady little eyes.

174
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,110
Now stay right there.

175
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,950
Oh, crap. He stopped eating.

176
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,350
If I move closer,
he’ll run for it.

177
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,520
Forget this. It’s now or never.

178
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,520
I’ll blast him from over here.

179
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,260
He’s moving! Now!

180
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,160
- I got it!
- ( Rat squeals )

181
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,400
( Hisses )

182
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,200
josuke: Shit.
It wasn’t a fatal blow.

183
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,700
( Rat roars )

184
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,100
Josuke: Here we go.

185
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,240
That weird machine
must be his stand.

186
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,710
All right, pal,
come and get some

187
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,640
if you think you’ve got
what it takes to beat me.

188
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,050
Just know that my next shot
is gonna take you out for good.

189
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,420
damn it!
He’s running under the table!

190
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,120
No, you don’t!

191
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,660
Jotaro, what the hell
are you doing?!

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,060
The rat’s in here! ( Gasps )

193
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,670
That shape.

194
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,900
Not good!

195
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,000
His stand fires projectiles!

196
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,170
Shining diamond: Dora!

197
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,610
Josuke: What now?

198
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,180
Should I slap it away
with my bare hands?

199
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
No, that’s disgusting.

200
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,610
Where’s the rat?

201
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,350
did I hit it with
my ball bearing, or did I miss?

202
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,180
( Rat squeals )

203
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,390
( Josuke gasps ) You bastard.

204
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,320
( Rat shrieks )

205
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,260
Josuke: Yeah!
I got him after all!

206
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,000
It wasn’t between his eyes like
I said, but he’s still a goner.

207
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,000
That was a close one.

208
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,140
( Sighs )
Hey, jotaro, get over here!

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,110
I took out the rat!
The hunt is over.

210
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,140
Jeez, what were
you doing in there?

211
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,450
You went missing right
when I needed you the most.

212
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,210
I was starting to think
you’d abandoned me.

213
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,120
But, hey, at least it’s dead.

214
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,120
Luckily everything
went according to plan.

215
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,350
Well, for me, that is.

216
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,990
Our rat friend
wasn’t so fortunate.

217
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,260
though his stand shot
some needle-like things at me.

218
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,630
Whatever they were,

219
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,600
I bet they’re what
turn your flesh to goo.

220
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,730
He got to the people
who own this place,

221
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,330
but they’re still alive.

222
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
I’ll fix ’em right up
with shining diamond.

223
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,040
Jotaro: If we don’t
eliminate him by sundown,

224
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,670
things might get even messier.

225
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,480
Josuke: Huh?

226
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,680
Jotaro: There was another rat,

227
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,680
and that one managed to hit me.

228
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,580
( Josuke gasps )
Jotaro, your hand is melting!

229
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,550
Jotaro: It happened
in the other room.

230
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,390
I could have dodged the attack,

231
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,990
but I thought catching
the needle for analysis

232
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,190
was the best choice.

233
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,390
All it takes is a touch,

234
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,760
and its stand’s poison
begins to permeate,

235
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,560
even melting other stands.

236
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,530
Five or six hits,

237
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,140
and you’ll turn into
a quivering mass of flesh.

238
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,540
Josuke: Ohh! Good thing
that needle didn’t hit me.

239
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,340
Never thought i’d be grateful
for being squeamish.

240
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,540
Jotaro: The rat
bolted out the door

241
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,180
after hitting me
with the needle.

242
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,610
Somehow it must have figured out

243
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,280
you killed its kin
here in the kitchen.

244
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,980
Um, sorry to bother,

245
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,420
but would you mind using
your power to fix my hand?

246
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,220
Josuke: Uh, not to worry.
Just leave it to me.

247
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,190
damn it. Why’d those
little s.O.B.S have to multiply?

248
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,730
Man: This is the speedwagon
foundation research department.

249
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,100
jotaro: Hello.
This is jotaro kujo speaking.

250
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,500
Man: Jotaro! Finally.

251
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,710
We’ve tried to reach you
several times.

252
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,410
Jotaro: I was hunting the rat
and had the ringer off.

253
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,310
Is this about otoishi?

254
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,250
Man: Yes. Akira otoishi
was withholding the fact

255
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,550
that he shot two rats
instead of one.

256
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,220
Jotaro: Are you sure?

257
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,350
is there any chance he
could have shot three or four?

258
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,090
Man: No, sir.
We’re sure it’s two.

259
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,690
Jotaro: Oh, good grief, otoishi.

260
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,500
What a fool.

261
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,100
when it comes
to its own territory,

262
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,770
it’ll kill everything,
humans and rats alike.

263
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,100
It cares only about itself.

264
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,240
So this savage’s time on earth
is about to come to a fast end.

265
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,510
Let’s move.

266
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,810
josuke: Jotaro,
hold on a minute, would you?

267
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,610
a pint-sized rodent
just ran into an open field.

268
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,520
How exactly do you plan
on tracking this thing down?

269
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,790
Jotaro: The famous artist
Ernest Thompson seton once said

270
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,750
there’s not an animal
on the planet

271
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,120
that cannot be tracked.

272
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,160
You have to know their habits.

273
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,560
rats are known
to avoid unfamiliar paths,

274
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,560
which means its route of escape

275
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,130
had to be that
irrigation channel from before.

276
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,740
And there’s something else
about rats.

277
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,640
if they’re
not constantly eating,

278
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,510
they’ll starve
within a few hours.

279
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,610
there.
Those are fresh bite marks.

280
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Josuke: Nice going.
This is an awesome start.

281
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,150
Now we’re gonna corner
that bucktoothed bastard!

282
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,590
( Sighs ) Take a look at this.

283
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,460
I don’t think he even gave
a damn that our bait was here.

284
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,160
Jotaro: He’s on tape.

285
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,640
Huh. His ear looks
like a bug-eaten leaf.

286
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,210
what do you say
we call him "bug-eaten"?

287
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,040
He’s being cautious.

288
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,810
This isn’t gonna be
like at the house.

289
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,380
Bug-eaten is gonna
be extra careful

290
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,610
to not let us get
within 20 meters of him.

291
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,220
These are live rifle rounds.

292
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,590
Worst-case scenario, we’ll have
to use these to finish the job.

293
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,390
Josuke: Wait. Those are real?

294
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,590
Jotaro: Yeah, they have to be.
Because of air resistance,

295
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,460
ball bearings lose accuracy
when traveling over 20 meters.

296
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,230
With a bullet nose like this,

297
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,200
we’ll be able to hit our Mark
up to 70 meters away.

298
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,540
Josuke: Will I
have to launch that

299
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,300
with my stand’s hand, too?

300
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,570
’cause I don’t think
i’m ready for that just yet.

301
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,180
Jotaro: Point taken.

302
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
I’ll have to be
the one to do it.

303
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,350
Josuke: Hold it right there.

304
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,220
Just what are you trying to say?

305
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,120
that comment
didn’t sit well with me.

306
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,230
I am the one who nailed the rat
back at the house, remember?

307
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,790
Sure, it wasn’t exactly
a perfect shot, but still...

308
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,030
Jotaro: Guess you’re right.
Take two.

309
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,130
Josuke: Huh? ( Groans )

310
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,740
( Groans ) More pressure.

311
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,780
♪

312
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,080

313
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,760

314
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,340
Jotaro: Be careful.

315

This puddle is full of leeches.

316

suddenly stop here.

322

Josuke: You’ve gotta be joking.

323
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,160
why would they
randomly stop like that?

324
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,300
I know. He’s under us.

325
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
He must have burrowed a hole
and covered himself.

326
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,570
Jotaro: No.

327
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,700
This is called backtracking.

328
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,300
I didn’t know rats
could do this, too.

329
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,770
Josuke: Backtracking?

330
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,610
Narrator: Backtracking is
the way in which a wild animal

331
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,380
reverses itself
by stepping in its own tracks.

332
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,380
This confuses predators
long enough for them to hide.

333
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,650
In Japan, the behavior
has been observed

334
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
with brown bears,
weasels, and rabbits.

335
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,360
However, it is unheard of
among rats and other rodents.

336
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,730
josuke: Okay,
so let me get this straight.

337
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,630
you’re saying
that a common brown rat

338
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,230
pulled a fast one on us?

339
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,000
Jotaro: Things have taken
a turn for the worse.

340
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,430
With this kind of terrain,

341
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,240
the hunters may have
just become the prey.

342
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,240
( Stand clicking )

343
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,710
Josuke: I have this creepy
feeling we’re being watched.

344
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,640
We better duck behind a rock
while we still have the chance.

345
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,450
Jotaro: No sudden movements.

346
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,180
the good news
is bug-eaten’s attack

347
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,750
isn’t too fast for us to see.

348
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,350
Just keep an eye out
for the point of fire.

349
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,790
If we can figure out
where he’s hiding,

350
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,090
we’ll snipe him instead.

along with all
the affected tissue.

You should put a bandage on it.

364
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,030
I was also able to locate
his general whereabouts.

365
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,540

He’s halfway up the hill,

366
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,040

more amazing, you or the rat.

Jotaro: It’s 60 meters away.

372
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,190
So far, no sign
of any more needles.

373
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,160
He knows a random firing
would give away his location,

374
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,230
and its obvious
he doesn’t want to be attacked.

375
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
He’s a stubborn bastard.

376

praising that damn rat?

377

and we have to do it now.

Jotaro: Well spoken, josuke.

379
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,440
We need to give this assault
everything we’ve got,

380
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,610
or bug-eaten’ll kill us both.

381
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,650
All right, i’ll give you
all four rounds.

at this distance,
the rounds’ll rise like sliders,
