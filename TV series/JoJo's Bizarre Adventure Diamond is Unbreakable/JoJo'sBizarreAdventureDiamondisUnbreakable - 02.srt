No. It can change between liquid and vapor.

327
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,770
Josuke! Hurry, and get away from the kettle!

328
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,570
He morphed into steam!

( Shining diamond yelling )

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,750
Josuke: Things just got a lot more difficult.

331
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
We can't catch him with the bottle anymore.

332
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,620
Jotaro: For now, stay away from any steam,

333
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,750
and protect your lungs.

334
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,190
The priority is getting out of here.

Joseph: Easier said than done.

336
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,690
I'm not sure we have much of a choice

337
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,990
as far as leaving's concerned.

338
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,930
Of course. Angelo's already put

339
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,860
a bunch of holes in the roof to make his job easier.

340
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,230
Upstairs is no good,

341
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,800
and we'll be sitting ducks if we go outside.

342

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,590
This liquid morphing stand is way more than I bargained for.

348
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,860
Plus, it's really freaky.

I predicted that you'd break through the wall

and flee into this room, seeking shelter!

I guess it's like picking all the right answers.

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,990
Or maybe I should compare it to winning at the races.

Either way, you can't help but let out a little giggle
