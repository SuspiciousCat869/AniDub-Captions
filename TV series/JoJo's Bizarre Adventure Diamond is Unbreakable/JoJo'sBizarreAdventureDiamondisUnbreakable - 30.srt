163
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,030
What did it do to that sparrow?

164
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,030
I didn’t catch a glimpse
of its stand.

165
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,870
more importantly,
I need to somehow figure out

166
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,670
whether this thing poses
a genuine threat to me.

167
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,040
doesn’t seem like it
wants me dead, but even so...

168
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,780
To be on the safe side,
i’ll have to prune it.

169
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,180
( Flower squeals )

170
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,850
( Yawns )

171
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,920
Kira: It fell asleep
eating its prey.

172
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,920
Is it a type of plant,
or could it be an animal?

173
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,790
Eliminating it would be easy,

174
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,760
so I have time
for a little investigation.

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Psst, psst, psst.

176
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,730
( Flower hisses )

177
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,800
Kira: Hmm. The way it
innately looked back at me

178
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,610
when I called it
appeared almost catlike.

179
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,840
How strange.

180
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,010
( Flower chitters )

181
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,310
The way it seems compelled
to sniff my hand

182
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,310
is also uniquely feline.

183
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,020
It enjoys being petted as well.

184
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,020
( Flower purring )

185
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,090
Kira: Factoring that in
with its eerie purring,

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,590
it’s acting like a cat does
before it falls asleep.

187
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,930
But none of that tells me

188
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
whether it harbors
any ill will toward me.

189
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,770
I have to know for sure,
and there’s only one way.

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,740
( Flower snorting )

191
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,910
( Growling )

192
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,210
( Hisses )

193
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,780
kira: Well,
it’s certainly angry,

194
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,710
but, at the very least,
now I know

195
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,950
this thing doesn’t
want to do me any harm.

196
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,280
There’s no doubt. It’s the cat
I buried here yesterday.

197
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,920
So the gouge in its throat
was from the arrow.

198
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,160
What does it mean?

199
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,290
Shinobu: Um, honey?

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,860
( Kira gasps ) It’s her!

201
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,830
( Flower squeals )

202
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,630
( Shinobu gasps )

203
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,900
I wouldn’t stand in that spot
if I were you.

204
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,830
My toenail got ripped off
right over there.

205
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,200
It’s dangerous, dear.

206
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,210
Kira: I see. The cat
must have gotten angry

207
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,740
and attacked the woman.

208
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,880
If she ever found out
this thing existed...

209
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,410
( Swallows )
She’d run her big mouth,

210
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,910
and gossip
would eventually spread

211
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,820
to jotaro kujo and
his obnoxious cohorts.

212
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,420
I can’t allow that to happen.

213
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,990
Shinobu: What are you doing?

214
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,020
That’s where you
buried the cat, right?

215
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,890
I don’t like that spot.
It feels like it’s cursed.

216
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,260
Kira: I buried the cat
somewhere else.

217
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,760
Now please go back inside,
and nurse your foot.

218
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,330
Shinobu: No, you’re lying!

219
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,270
You’re lying to protect me
from something, aren’t you?

220

kira: Shit.
It looks like I was wrong.

223
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,370
This cat is gonna be
nothing but trouble!

224
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,280
i may not know
what its stand can do,

225
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,810
but i’ll exterminate it
nonetheless.

226
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,980
Deadly queen!

227
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,890
Sorry, but you’re
about to be uprooted.

228
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,990
Bomb type one, switch on!

229

What the--

230
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,470
th-there’s no way
it could be a dud.

231
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,340
Which means this thing did it.

232
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,470
it must have
anti-detonation abilities.

233

( Flower hisses )

234
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,480
Shinobu: Huh? Is that a plant?

235
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,740
Wh-why is it moving?

236
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,850
Kira: Didn’t I just tell you
to go inside?!

( Kira gasps )

243
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,490
The moment that cat-plant

244
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,760
batted away deadly queen’s bomb,
it exploded!

245
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,460
Could this thing’s ability be...

246
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,400
Narrator: As the creature saw
the woman lying unconscious,

247
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,940
it thought,
"i’m going to kill her!"

248
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,240
Kira: That’s quite enough.

249
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,840
Your attacks on her end now.

250
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,350
- You’re about to disappear.
- ( Flower screeches )

Narrator: "If he wants to get
in the way, then he dies, too!"

252
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,450
kira: There’s
no other explanation.

253
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,990
The bomb failed to explode,
because it was deprived of air.

254
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,960
Narrator: The plant
instinctively knew

255
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,830
how best to utilize
its newly acquired abilities

256
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,430
to kill its enemies.

257
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,100
Kira: Wait a minute.

258
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,870
Could its stand ability be
to control the air around it?

259
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,770
It’s coming. It fired something,

260
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,870
but I couldn’t see what.

261
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,410
Deadly queen!

262
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,140
So it did shoot at us.

263
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,450
the little shit,
it’s weaponizing masses of air!

deadly queen: Bastard!
I’ll pound you into fertilizer!

265
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,990
What?! It’s like i’m pressing
on an invisible balloon.

can manipulate the air.

( Gasps ) I can’t see it,

271
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,870
but it must have released

272
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,210
another one of those
compressed air bullets.

273
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,910
but where did
that creature aim it?

Did yoshikage Kira just feel
a sense of relief for this woman

because the cactus needles
missed her eyes?

What is this feeling?

Could I actually be worried
about someone else?

What am I thinking?
My only concern

is what might happen
if this woman dies

but I know
how your tricks work.

293

You simply compress air

25.5-centimeter-sized shoes.
