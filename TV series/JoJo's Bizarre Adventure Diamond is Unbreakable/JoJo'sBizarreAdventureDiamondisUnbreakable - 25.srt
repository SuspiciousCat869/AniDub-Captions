00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,690
He was born in morioh
on January 30, 1966.

69
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,690
He’s nearly two meters tall,

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,400
he weighs 65 kilograms,
and his blood type is a.

He was born to older parents.

72
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,270
When he was 21, his father,
yoshihiro, fell ill and died.

73
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,940
Seems his mother
died soon after.

74
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,880
graduated in 1988
with a degree in literature.

75
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,250
Same year, he starts
at kameyu in s city

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,550
and, in 1993, transfers
to the morioh branch.

77
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,990
He has no previous
criminal record,

78
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,890
has never married,
has no close friends or lover.

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,790
He’s never even had a surgery.

80
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,960
And we can’t find him
with fingerprints,

81
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,700
dental records,
or surgical scars.

82

Josuke: So what
you’re trying to say

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,330
is we’ve reached a dead end.

84
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,530
Josuke: Check it out.
The trophies and plaques,

85
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,200
they all say third place,

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,040
so he certainly
wasn’t a star athlete.

87
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,740
Nothing speaks to his talents.

88
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,650
Was it sports? Music? Writing?

89
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,150
even here,
he’s trying not to stand out.

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,950
he’s never been
the object of ridicule or envy,

91
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,850
and he never reveals
his strengths

92
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,150
or weaknesses to anyone.

93
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,690
Josuke: Which means...

94
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,520
Jotaro: It’s all
been a deception.

95
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,630
he’s been hiding
his talent and intellect.

96
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,330
He knew laying low would be

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,960
the best way
to stay out of trouble.

98
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,930
My hope in coming here

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,700
was to find
hobbies or interests,

100
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,600
any clue in the slightest.

101

I may have found one.

102

Those clippings are his own.

118
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,680
He kept meticulous notes
on the subject.

119
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,450
Jotaro: Notes? You mean
those numbers on the jars?

120
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,850
You mean he’s been collecting
these things since 1983?

121
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,720
That’s 15 years of yuck!

122
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,160
( Gasps ) There are
details about every finger!

123
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,890
According to this, in 1983,
his right thumb grew a nail

124
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,660
that was
31 1/2 centimeters long!

125
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,860
Wait a sec! I’m pretty sure 1983

126
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,600
was the year
reimi sugimoto was murdered!

127
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,740
Jotaro: Yeah, and the records
begin in that year.

128
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,540
He probably reached a point

129
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,440
where he couldn’t repress his
murderous impulses any longer.

130
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,910
Josuke: Whoa!

131
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,450
this is all the info
he collected about his toenails!

132
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,880
Jotaro: Our boring office worker

133
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,580
seems to have
a very interesting hobby.

134

Look.

135
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,520
This is a form of divination.

136
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,520
it’s similar
to ancient Jewish merchants,

137
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,930
who once observed sunspots
to predict economic prospects.

138
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,100
It appears yoshikage Kira
is tying his nail growth

139
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,600
to his physical and
mental preparedness.

140
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,570
His preparedness to kill,
that is.

skulking around the house
under our noses?

151

Jotaro: Seems that way.
Josuke, stay on guard.

152
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,630
Josuke: Could he have been
maybe working with a partner?

153
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,970
jotaro: No way.
He’s too cautious for that.

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,240
more people
means more risk for capture.

155

A partner could
just rat him out.

156
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,770
He wouldn’t even consider it.

Considering reimi’s situation,

169

is stuck in some kind
of spiritual limbo

and the dead.

he made the call from in there,

471
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,410
How’d you get out there?

472
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,750
Were you out here in this tree
crying all night

473
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,720
because you couldn’t
get back into the house?

474
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,720
- ( Shower running )
- We need to talk!

475
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,890
You closed that stupid window
near the tree, didn’t you?

476
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,490
Kira: Hmm.

477
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,820
Shinobu: How many times

478
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,890
am I gonna have to tell you
to leave it open?!

479
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,260
( Kitty meows, hisses )

480
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Shinobu: Oh, my goodness.
What’s the matter, sweetie?

481
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,800
Why are you getting
so worked up?!

482
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,730
( Kitty screeching )

483
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,640
( Handle squeaks )

484
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,610
Kira: I guess cats aren’t
the biggest fans of water.

485
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
My apologies. I wasn’t thinking
and acted carelessly.

486
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,580
Sorry. It won’t happen again.

487
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,590
( Shinobu gasps )

488
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,420
There’s definitely something
strange going on with him.

489
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,730
First he starts cooking for me
out of the blue,

490
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,690
and now he’s
using an actual blade

491
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,330
instead of his electric razor.

492
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,560
Blades always
give him razor burn.

493
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,430
- ( Doorbell rings )
- ( Gasps )

494
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,400
Man: Listen, pal!
You still haven’t paid

495
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,400
last month’s rent,
you cheapskate!

496
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,710
Now you owe for this month,
so fork over the yen!

497
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,310
Not leaving ’til i’m paid!

498
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,380
( Shinobu gasps )

499
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,810
Kira: Rent?

500
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,750
Shinobu: You heard the man.
Go and get the money

501
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,480
from the safe
before he kicks us out.

502
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,790
Kira: Right. The safe.

503
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,350
Shinobu: Get a move on!
What are you waiting for?

504
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,790
You have the combination!

505
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,760
( Kira gasping )

506
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,590
( Shinobu gasps )

507
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,730
What are you doing?!
Get back up here!

508
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,570
Kira: Thank you
for taking the time

509
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,500
to drop by this morning,
but I appear

510
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,670
to be running a bit short
on cash at the moment.

511
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,900
I’m sure you understand.

512
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,510
Landlord: Huh?

513
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,910
All that hair gel must be
seeping into your noggin!

514
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,680
I should have known
you young deadbeats

515
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,750
wouldn’t be able to afford
my gorgeous home!

516
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,580
that’s what I get for
doing business with schmucks!

517
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,920
Learn to live
within your means!

518
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,420
Shinobu: You’ll get your money--

519
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,660
kira: No, I think
you misunderstood me earlier.

520
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,520
I said I was short on cash,

521
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,430
but I meant that I only had
a little over 500,000.

522
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,830
- Landlord: Ah!
- ( Shinobu gasps )

523
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,000
Kira: I’ll only be able
to pay for this month,

524
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,070
last month, and for the next
couple of months in advance.

525
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,700
Will that suffice for now?

526
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,110
Landlord: Yes,
that’ll do nicely.

527
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,910
thanks so much.
Have a good one. ( Chuckles )

528
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Until next time.

529
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,580
( Door closes )

530
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,050
Shinobu: Wh-what was that?

531
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,880
I don’t know how,

532
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,390
but you must
have stolen that money.

533
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,450
there’s no point
trying to say that you didn’t.

534
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,960
you stole it from
the landlord’s bag, didn’t you?

535
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,690
if anyone else
was in this situation,

536
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,930
they’d be horrified that their
partner could do such a thing,

537
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,770
but his gusto,

538
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,970
the way he stole the money
and lied about it so easily...

539
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,440
I’ve been with him
for so many years,

540
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,870
but he’s never made me
feel like this before.

541
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,440
It’s exhilarating.

542
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,450
It’s like i’m falling in love
with him for the first time.
