176
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,730
1988 was the beginning of the end.

177
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,970
I was seven that year,

178
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,900
and my brother okuyasu was just four.

179
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,900
We were living in Tokyo during this time.

180
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,770
It was the middle of the bubble economy,

181
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,240
and spirits were high.

182
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,740
Well, the spirits of everyone except my father.

183
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,350
Mom fell sick and died,

184
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,580
and dad’s business went under.

185
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,250
he was buried under a mountain of debt.

186
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,060
( Slap echoes )

187
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,290
He’d often beat us for no reason.

188
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,660
He was the walking definition of a loser.

189
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,230
That’s when everything changed.

190
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,870
Out of the blue,

191
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,540
a seemingly endless supply of cash starting rolling in.

192
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,910
And on top of that,

193
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,040
there were jewels and precious metals,

194
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,080
but dad didn’t have a job to speak of.

195
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,710
After some research,

196
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,180
I found out the truth.

197
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,220
My father had made a dark deal.

198
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,750
he sold his own soul to a man by the name of dio.

199
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,020
He became dio’s lackey for monetary gain.

200
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,590
( Koichi gasps )

201
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,690
Keicho: Based on what I found out,

202
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,330
dio’s goal was to scour the globe

203
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,660
in search of potential stand users,

204
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,200
and somehow he discovered

205
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,040
my dad had the capacity to manifest a stand.

206
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,070
However, to this day,

207
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,270
i have no idea what the nature of his stand is.

208
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,310
And then things changed again.

209
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,810
It’s been ten years, but I remember it like yesterday.

210
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,650
It was 2:00 in the afternoon.

211
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,650
i’d just come home from a long day at school.

212
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,060

Did that bastard hit you again?

215
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,030
What’s wrong with him?

216
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,800
Okuyasu: No. He didn’t.

217
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,060
Keicho: Huh?

218
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,100
( Mr. Nijimura groaning )

219
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,900
Dio. Dio is dead.

( Groaning )

221
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,870
That must be the reason.

222
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Keicho: Dad?

keicho: Dad? I’ll call an ambulance.

226
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,050
mr. Nijimura: It’s no use. I’m not sick.

227
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,050
The flesh bud is ravaging my body!

228
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,120
- This is the end! - Keicho: Dad!

229
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,190
after a year, he didn’t know who we were.

230
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,160
The man had forgotten all about his own children

231
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,230
and had become a muttering glob of flesh.

232
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,700
( Mr. Nijimura moans )

233
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,070
Keicho: Dio used to implant his own cells

234
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,270
into the minds of those he distrusted

235
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,180
so he could manipulate his victims

236
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,080
in whatever way he saw fit.

237
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,750
And as you can guess,

238
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,080
he implanted one of those things into dad.

239
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,950
- ( Both gasp ) - ( Mr. Nijimura groans )

240
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,120
Keicho: For ten years, I threw myself into research.

241
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,720
I studied stands. I learned about jotaro.

242
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,930
in my studies, I learned of enyaba the hag

243
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,060
and obtained possession of the bow and arrow.

244
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,970
But in the process, I slowly resigned myself to the fact

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,840
that dad would never recover from the curse that plagued him.

246
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,840
My father had already become one with the immortal cells of dio.

247
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,080
Now he spends his days doing nothing but this.

248
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,780
It’s infuriating to watch.

249
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,720
Every moment of every day, for the past ten years,

250
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,250
he’s scratched around that stupid box of rubbish.

251
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,860
If I confiscate it, he wails and groans for days on end.

252
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,390
I’m sick of dealing with it.

253

isn’t the father I used to know.

and is living the life he created.

But i’m not totally without a heart.

You don’t know how it feels.

and finally free him from this suffering.

277
