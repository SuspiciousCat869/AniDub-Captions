like the energy

flowing into me right now!

Judging from his sloppy work,

209
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,020
that must’ve been the first time
he’s used his stand.

210
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,930
However, that doesn’t mean
he won’t master it given time.

211
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,090
Eh? Heh.

212
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,970
"I want to beat the crap
out of Rohan in roshambo," huh?

213
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,930
"Roshambo isn’t
a game of chance.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,670
"It’s a psychological
game of will.

"If I beat Rohan at roshambo,
it means i’ve outwilled him.

I knew it!

224

This kid is well on the road
to becoming a stand user.

225
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,970
The arrow must have
just pierced his soul.

226

my own,

"but I must play five games.

winning two games
only gives me partial energy."

Ken: So this power’s
called a stand.

234
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,690
That’s pretty awesome.

235
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,160
thought you dodged
a bullet there, didn’t you?

236
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,900
Well, think again,
’cause i’ve already

237
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,830
got a third
of your so-called stand.

241
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,010
and 1/3 of its incredible power
is under my control!

242
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,480
That means you can’t poke around
in my head anymore.

two more times,

like that was pretty ballsy.

of your own medicine.

in another game of roshambo.

win back my stand’s right arm.

to the plight you’re in?

If you lose just one more time,
you’re finished.

258

Surely, by now, you’ve realized
you’re all out of chances.

259
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,020
since I know
you’re a stand user,

260
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,820
i’ll show you no mercy.

I retrieve my right arm,

262
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,130

out of commission.

263

Admit defeat.

264
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,660
Ken: Wait. Are you
trying to psyche me out?

265
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,070
Rohan: All right,
let’s get this started.

Ken: I’m not ready
to play just yet.

267
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,700
I won the last match
using paper,

268
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,240
so I guess it’s only natural

269
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,640
to wanna go with rock
or scissors this time,

270
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,680
but it’d be kinda stupid to go
with the obvious, just ’cause--

271
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,680
and it’s pretty clear
to anyone with eyes

you’re not the naïve type,
Rohan-sensei,

273
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,720
so maybe going with paper
would be the best way to go.

274
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,920
I mean, what could
it hurt, right?

275
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,620
Okay, i’ve made up my mind!

276

and it cost me both times.

318
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,240
It’s obvious now that rock
is my unlucky play. Am I wrong?

319
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,180
- ( Ken grunts )
- Rohan: It goes without saying

320
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,710
i’d be adverse to using rock
again when it’s been so unkind,

321
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,220
and since I won’t be going
with rock this time,

322
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,190
you won’t be able to use paper.

323
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,790
Using it would be the same

324
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,820
as admitting
i’m not on a losing streak,

325
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,660
despite what you said
a while back.

326
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,060
ken: Hah!
You’re still gonna lose!

327
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,960
All right! Let’s do this!

328
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,870

332
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,770
Rohan: All that bluffing,
and he still used paper.

333
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,140
What mental fortitude!

334
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,310
Ken: There’s no way
i’m gonna lose to him.

335
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,680
I still have the upper hand
in this match!

336
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,850
I’ll use paper
four times in a row!

337
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,120
This game’s in the bag!

338
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,980
Rohan: Time to go back to rock.

339
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,120
I’ll make misfortune
work in my favor.

340
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,650
Ken: Here we go!

341
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,930
( Rohan groans )
Wh-what’s wrong with my knees?

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,330
Ken: Huh? He’s never
moved like that before.

343
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,170
the only move Rohan
hasn’t used yet is scissors.

344
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,910
Crap! Going with paper
four times in a row is risky!

345
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,570
What?! No way!

346
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,680

wasn’t unlucky after all.

Hey, mister!
Can I talk to you?!

So, Rohan-sensei, those two
are probably users, too, right?

357

Let’s test my luck.
If it all runs out,

358
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,770
those two will head over here
and rescue you,

359

but if luck is on my side,

360

the last thing on their minds.

The real challenge...

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,550
Ken: Huh? Eh?!

478
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,560
♪

479
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,090
What?! But you’re
gonna get run over, too!

480
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,760
Rohan: Think so?

481
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,560
Yoshihiro: Where the hell
did this damn wind come from?!

482
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,600
Driver: Eh? Have mercy!

483
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,600
What’s this picture?!

484
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,000
I can’t see!

485
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,270
My view is blocked!

486
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,880
( Ken panting )

487
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,850
What? It went around us.

488
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,950
You could have been killed,
too, if it hadn’t swerved,

489
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,820
but you--

490
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,890
was it luck?

491
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,690
Rohan: Perhaps, but I must say

492
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,960
you’ve become
quite an interesting person.

493
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,000
I won’t finish you off.

494
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,230
However, you must never use
your stand for evil.

495
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,970
Yoshihiro: It’s just my luck

496
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,270
that I would hit
that truck! Damn!

497
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,740
( Ken sighs ) He beat me.

498
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,980
I’ve completely lost to him.

499
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,680
Joseph: Rohan, wait up!

500
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,250
- Ken: Huh?
- Rohan: Hmm?

501
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,150
Joseph: Hey, you haven’t seen
the baby anywhere, have you?

502
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,250
Josuke: Yeah, the kid has
suddenly gone missing!

503
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,920
( Rohan gasps )

504
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,760
Joseph: What if she’s turned
fully invisible again?

505
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,120
Rohan: Damn it, that’s right.

506
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,330
- Ken: Huh?
- Rohan: She’s gone.

507
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,160
Josuke: Hey, where are you?

508
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,600
Rohan: I’ll just pretend
like nothing happened.

509
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,800
Uh, hey, where’d you go? Baby?
