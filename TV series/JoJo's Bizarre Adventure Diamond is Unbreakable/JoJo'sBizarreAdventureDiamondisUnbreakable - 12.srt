00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,640
Jotaro: There it is.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,380
The old man’s ship
is right on schedule.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,150
He’s just about 20 minutes away.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,480
Koichi: So, as far as you know,

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,490
mr. Joestar’s
the only passenger on board?

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,320
jotaro: He is.
The rest of the crew members

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,490
are from
the speedwagon foundation.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,260
Even so, i’m sure chili pepper
will try to pass over the water

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,460
and sneak
onto the old man’s ship,

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,300
despite the fact
that he’s confined

11
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,300
to areas with electricity.

12
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,300
If he gets to Joseph first,

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,270
he’ll kill him
without a second thought,

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,470
and everything
we’ve gone through

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,340
will have been for nothing.

16
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,410
Okuyasu: Hey, jotaro,

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,610
we checked the boat over,

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,810
and it’s good to go!

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,480
Josuke: We also
checked the battery.

20
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,310
There’s no sign of him in here.

21
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,850
We’re ready to set out
whenever you give the word.

22
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,650
Jotaro: About that,
only okuyasu and I

23
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,520
are heading over
to meet with the old man.

24
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,520
- Koichi: Huh?
- Okuyasu: Eh?

25
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,360
Jotaro: I want you to stay here

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,290
and hold down the fort
with koichi.

27
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,490
Koichi: Stay here? But you’ll
need backup, won’t you?

28
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,700
Josuke: Yeah, he’s right!

29
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,500
Jotaro: Josuke,
chili pepper’s user

30
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,200
is hiding
somewhere in this harbor,

31
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,500
watching our every move.
understand?

32
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,700
( Both gasp )

33
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,540
jotaro:
He’s laying low right now

34
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,140
and waiting for us
to do something

35
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,210
that’ll give away
the ship’s position...

36
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,650
And my gut’s telling me a boat
won’t be his hiding place.

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,750
All he needs to make it over
to the old man is a battery

38
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,150
and something faster
than a speedboat.

39
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,920
once he puts
those two things together,

40
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,720
he’ll use it
to send chili pepper

41
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,460
flying to the old man’s ship.

42
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,790
Koichi: Wait a second!

43
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,660
are you thinking
he’s gonna take to the sky?

44
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,830
jotaro: Yeah.
To be perfectly frank,

45
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,500
he’s probably making off

46
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,670
with a remote-controlled plane
as we speak.

47
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,300
Koichi: That thought
hadn’t even occurred to me!

48
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,840
But it’s possible.
Once they pick up speed,

49
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,310
model airplanes can fly
over 100 kilometers per hour,

50
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,310
faster than the motorboat’s
top speed!

51
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,580
And because chili pepper’ll
be in control of it,

52
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,610
he can fly the plane
as far and as high

53
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,680
as the battery will take him!

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,420
he doesn’t need
a remote-control’s signal!

55
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,590
Jotaro: Listen, josuke,
if you spot anything

56
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,190
flying around here, I want you
to search for the user.

57
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,530
Koichi’s reverb has

for a trap

317
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,220
doesn’t even register
as a threat.

318
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,390
So let me show you
some real power.

319
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,460
- Dumb-ass!
- ( Koichi gasps )

320
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,190
( Akira laughs )

321
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,890
You’ve lost this battle, josuke!

322
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,860

Josuke: Just great.

324
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
you really are
as stupid as you look.

325
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,100
Having your stand
break through the tire

326
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,340
was the dumbest thing
you could have done.

327
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,570
- Chili pepper: Huh? ( Yells )
- Akira: Huh?!

328
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,880
Chili pepper: I forgot
about the air in the tire!

329
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,450
Koichi: The pressure release
launched him like a rocket!

330
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,620
Chili pepper: No, not the ocean!

331
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,850
Anything but the ocean!

332
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,590
Koichi: Oh, yeah, that’s right.

333
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,990
Salt water conducts electricity,
and in the ocean,

334
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,260
the electricity that powers him
will scatter in every direction.

335
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,400
chili pepper:
I’m sorry I tried to kill you!

336
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,070
Please, just get me
out of here!

337
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,630
josuke: Didn’t you
say something about getting rid

338
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,970
of your juvenile self
a while back?

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,370
Sorry. That’s impossible
for a lowlife like you.

340
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,840
( Chili pepper grunting )

341
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,420
I’m...dissolving.

342
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,980
Koichi: His stand’s
been completely diffused,

343
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,390
which means that Akira is...

344
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,350

347

it wasn’t easy,

348

chili pepper’s user.

We can breathe easier now.

Okuyasu: So this old geezer
is josuke’s dad, huh?

351
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,450
He’s kinda buff,
but at the same time,

352
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,490

one foot in the grave.

Okuyasu: Huh?

Joseph: If it wouldn’t
be too much trouble,

376
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,710
would you mind
answering a question?

377
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,640
has josuke
ever mentioned me to you,

378

the man who went 16 years

379
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,080
without knowing he had a son
out there who needed him?

380
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,490
has he said
anything about me at all?

381
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,620
Okuyasu: Hmm. I hate to say it,

382
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,490
but, no, he hasn’t
said much about you.

383

They’re finally here!

Look, josuke. Do you see ’em?

388

Josuke: Yeah. Cool, I guess.

and leave us in peace.

didn’t kill him.

to think of him as my dad?

I hate him or anything,

about my mom’s well-being, too.

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,620
One misstep, and you’ll
be going for an unwanted swim.

473
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,920
Joseph: Right. Sorry.

474
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,630
if I had my cane,
I could manage by myself,

475
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,600
but it broke a few moments ago.

476
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,630
It was the strangest thing.

477
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,470
Josuke: Then, I don’t
have much of a choice.

478
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,400
Here. You can hold on to me.

479
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,410
( Josuke gasping )

480
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,610

okuyasu: Huh?
Hey, I just had a great idea.

483
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,490
Josuke should have his
shining diamond fix the cane.

484
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,830
Koichi: Do you even
hear yourself, okuyasu?

485
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,930
Sometimes it’s like
you don’t have a brain.

486
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,600
Okuyasu: It is? But why?

487
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,600
Koichi: Come on.
Isn’t it obvious?

488
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,710
just this once,
it’s better to leave it broken.

489
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,910
Okuyasu: But why?

490
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,480
Seriously.

491
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,710
Jotaro: Now, if we can retrieve
the bow and arrow,

492
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,350
it’ll all be over,

493
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,990
