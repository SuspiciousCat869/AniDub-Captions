Man: What do you know?
They’ve arrived at last.

159
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,020
I wonder what I did to finally
catch their curious eyes?

160
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,050
come on over.
It’s been quite a while

161
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,420
since i’ve indulged
in a little chitchat.

162
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,090
Okuyasu: Check it out.
Looks like that tower dude

163
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,160
might have noticed
that we noticed him.

164
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,460
You wanna get closer?

165
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,960
josuke: Oh, yeah,
but we have to play it safe.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,470
we still don’t know
if that user is on our side

167
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,370
or if he’s angling
to take us out.

168
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,970
( Koichi panting )

169
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,410
( Gasps ) Huh?

170
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Is there something
I can do for you?

171
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,680
Sorry to be rude,
but i’m kinda in--

172
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,450
( gasps )

173
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
( Both gasp )

174
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,060
Okuyasu: This thing
looks a lot bigger

175
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,460
once you get up close to it.

176
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,160
Man: If you fellas
know what’s good for you,

177
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,030
you’ll stop right there
and won’t get any closer!

178
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,340
didn’t you two
hear what I said? Get back!

179
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,170
I just answered
the call of nature,

180
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,710
and, trust me, you don’t wanna
be there to get the message.

181
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,040
Both: Huh?

182
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,240
Josuke: I’m really
not following.

183
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,580
Okuyasu: What the hell?!

184
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,210
- This is disgusting!
- ( Both yell )

185
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,180
Man: Don’t say
I didn’t warn you.

186
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,020
i needed
to fertilize the garden.

187
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,420
Josuke: Guh! That’s so gross!

188
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,220
Man: Watch your mouth!
That’s impolite!

189
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,360
I designed this nifty
contraption so it would

190
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,560
distribute the fertilizer
to all the plants below!

191
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,430
I’m all about that zero-waste
lifestyle, you know.

192
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,700
on the right
are asiatic dayflowers,

193
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,170
mountain asparagus,
and watercress.

194
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,240
They’re all completely edible!

195
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,240
and with all
of these plants around,

196
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,240
catching nibbling rabbits
is a cinch,

197
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,040
so i’ve got the best
of both worlds, baby!

198
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,310
Josuke: No way! So you’re really
living up there all alone?

199
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,120
Doesn’t this tower belong
to some electric company?

200
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,650
Man: What are you talking about?

201
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,520
I paid for this house with
my own money. It’s all mine.

202
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,490
I bought this abandoned tower
for 100,000 yen

203
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,290
and transformed it into
my self-sufficient dream house.

204
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,460
Okuyasu: You bought it?

205

Josuke: For 100,000 yen?

206
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,630
Man: Yes, that’s right.
it was a steal.

207
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,170
Since I support myself,

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
i’m not stuck working
for some lame company.

209
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,210
It’s a pretty sweet life,
if you think about it.

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,570
I don’t have to leave the house,

211
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,580
and I get all the exercise
I could ever need. Heh.

212
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,610
I mean, do you see this view?
It’s spectacular.

josuke: Wait!
Run that by me again.

214

You don’t even have to leave?

215
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,550
Just how long have you
been living up there, anyway?

For now, at least,

our best option is heading back

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,870
and now that you’re here,
i can take off.

315
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,740
I’ve been trapped by superfly

316
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,380
for the entirety
of my stay here.

317
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,440
Well, take care of her for me.

318
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,180
- I’ve got a life to enjoy.
- ( Josuke growls )

319
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,550
okuyasu: So the sly
son of a bitch is in cahoots

320
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,820
with that grandpa ghost dude
from the picture.

321
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,620
Mikitaka: Mr. Okuyasu,
is there any way

322
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,590
I could possibly be
of assistance to you?

323
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,890
Okuyasu: You’ll just get hurt,
so stay out of it.

324
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,260
Your assistance
is no longer needed.

325
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,930
Now, if you could
change your body

326
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,800
into some sticks of dynamite
instead of dice or binoculars,

327
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,770
we might have
something to work with.

328
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,830
mikitaka: Oh,
that would be impossible.

329
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,740
I can’t change into any object
stronger than myself,

330
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,610
so explosives and
large mechanisms are off limits.

331
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Perhaps there’s another way
I can be of use.

332
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,880
Okuyasu: Oh, shut up!
I already told you

333
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,910
there’s not a damn thing
you can do.

334
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,920
get out of here,
and let us do what we do best.

335
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,850
that asshole thinks i’m
just gonna let him trap his prey

336
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,720
and make some super-cool escape.

337
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,920
But he’s about to find out

338
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,290
he messed
with the wrong stand users.

339
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,690
josuke: Hey.
You gonna go for it, okuyasu?

340
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,300
Okuyasu: I’m ready to go
when you are, buddy.

341
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,800
This rusty tower
has got nothing on us.

342
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,700
Let’s bring it down, josuke!

343
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,440
Josuke: Heh. Right!

344
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,710
busting outta here
is gonna be a snap and a half.

345
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,540
( All yell )

346
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,510
Toyohiro: Whoa there!
What are you doing?

347
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,950
Damn these dicks!

348
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,920
How the hell did
they get so strong?!

349
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,990
Okuyasu: This thing’s
pretty frickin’ solid,

350
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,390
but if we keep pounding it
like we have been,

351
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,760
it’ll snap in two
and fall over in no time.

352
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,590
See for yourself!
You’re about to come

353
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,430
crashing down
to good old terra firma!

354
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,800
Toyohiro: You dumbass! Do you
think you two can scare me?

355
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,640
I had a feeling you’d go
straight to using your fists.

356
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,040
looks like
you haven’t noticed yet.

357
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,940
This tower has absorbed
the power of your attacks

358
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,540
and has redistributed the force
over its entire structure.

359
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,380
okuyasu: Huh? What’s
this jackass babbling about?

360
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,880
Hang tight! You’ll be
out of this metal deathtrap

361
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
before you know it!
here we go!

362
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,550
Josuke: Hold it, okuyasu.
listen for a sec.

363
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,850
Okuyasu: Huh?

364
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,320
( Tower vibrating )

365
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,690
josuke: I’m getting
a real bad feeling about this.

366
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,760
that sound.
What the hell is he planning?

367
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,460
Toyohiro: What you’re
hearing is the sound

368
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,370
of the energy
left over from your punches

369
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
reverberating
throughout the whole tower.

370
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,670
Josuke: What?

371
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,870
Toyohiro: Mind if I ask
you boys a question?

372
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,010
Have either of you ever heard
of the law of conservation?

373
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,780
Once energy has been collected,

374
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,510
it’ll eventually be released
for use in a different form,

375
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,680
and I wonder
where it’s gonna go now.

376
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,350
Josuke: Oh, shit.

377
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,790
- Okuyasu, get down!
- Okuyasu: Huh?

378
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,690
Josuke: What?!

379
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,790
Whuhh!

380
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,530
Toyohiro: Punch the tower
as much as you’d like.

381
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,600
All the energy you two idiots
are putting out

382
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,100
is just going
to go around and around

383
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,340
and come right back
to bite you in the ass.

384
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,440
so go ahead!
You’re only hurting yourselves!

385
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,580
Why not save the money
in hospital bills

386
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,450
and accept
that you’re outmatched?

387
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,350
It doesn’t matter
how strong you are.

388
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,350
Nothing you do will be able
to destroy this tower!

389
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,350
( Okuyasu gasping )

390
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,750
Josuke: Okuyasu!

391
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,960
okuyasu:
I’m kinda worried, josuke.

392
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,960
I wasn’t quick enough
to dodge it.

393
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,360
One of those attacks
left a hole in my side.

394
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,730
Toyohiro: Guess I should have
warned you about that, huh?

395
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,530
I can see your thoughts racing.

396
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,900
you think if you
can manage to defeat me,

397
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,870
the user,
you’ll have a way out,

398
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,940
but that’s merely a pipe dream.

399
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,040
Remember, this stand exists
independently of me.

400
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,910
Even if I were to just
drop dead, that would never

401
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,380
stop this tower from ensnaring
victims until the end of time.

402
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,480
That’s superfly’s
special ability.

403
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,650
( Okuyasu grunting )

404
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,890
Josuke, i--

405
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,490
josuke: Until the end of time?

406
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,790
( Toyohiro grunts )

407
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,160
Don’t look so serious, josuke.

408
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,530
All you have to do is find
someone else to take your place.

409
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,800
It’s not rocket science.

410
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,030
One person goes in,
and one comes out.

411
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,900
It’s a simple exchange.

412
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,700
Trap some poor fool,
and get yourself out.

413
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,010
it’s kinda like
that card game, old maid.

414
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,140
It’s a lot like human society.

415
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,580
Just hand over the old maid
to some other fool

416
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,050
and get the hell out of dodge.

417
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,550
Don’t you agree?

418
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,620
Mikitaka: I do, wholeheartedly.

419
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,020
Pulling someone else in
will certainly help josuke.

420
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,520
Toyohiro: Hmm? ( Gasps )

421
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,020
- Okuyasu: How’d he...
- ( Josuke gasps )

422
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,660
mikitaka: And I think
you’re the perfect candidate.

423
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,700
Time to go back to the tower.
You’re grounded.

424
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,130
( Toyohiro yells )

425
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,500
Okuyasu: Eh? Holy...

426
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,100
Josuke: Mikitaka, you sly dog!

427
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,870
Toyohiro: What the hell
is going on here?!

428
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,510
Where did you come from,
and how are you a power line?

429
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,670
What sort of power is this?!

430
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,610
Mikitaka: How very kind
of you to ask.

431
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,580
I possess these powers
due to my being an alien.

432
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,180
- ( Toyohiro gasps )
- Okuyasu: Yeah!

433
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,180
You’ve got him now!

434
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,980
Way to be useful, alien dude!

435
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,550
Mikitaka: Move quickly now.

436
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,820
Please exit the confines
of the tower, Mr. Josuke.

437
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,160
Toyohiro: Damn you.

438
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,630
okuyasu: Thanks!
You frickin’ rock, mikitaka!

439
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,730
You heard him, josuke!
Get out of there!

440
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,530
Leave the tower
before it’s too late!

441
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,860
Josuke: Yeah! On my way!

442
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,030
♪

443
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,910
Sweet! I made it out!

444
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,010
Toyohiro: You bastard!
What even are you?!

445
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,910
the guy in the photo
told me about josuke’s allies,

446
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,510
but he never mentioned
a freak show like you!

447
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,750
Mikitaka: Being an alien,
I have no knowledge

448
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,080
of this so-called old maid game,
but I don’t like the way

449
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,920
you tricked josuke and tried
to trap him here forever.

450
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,660
it’s an awful lot
like an adult beating a child

451
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,790
at a new year’s card game
by cheating.

452
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,100
That is why I brought you back.
You don’t deserve to be free.

453
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,700
You’re never leaving
this tower.

454
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,070
( Toyohiro gasps )

455
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
( Chuckles )

456
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,840
Mikitaka: Hmm?

457
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,840
Toyohiro: Here’s the thing.

458
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,570
i’ve developed
these really thick calluses

459
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,940
from swinging around
up here all this time.

460
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,510
they’re so thick,
I can hide things in them.

461
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,080
Now die, dickhead!

462
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,580
Mikitaka: You seem to assume

463
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,250
what’s in your hand
is a part of me,

464
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,220
but I am afraid
that is a misconception.

465
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,790
What you’re holding isn’t me,

466
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,060
but the power line

toyohiro:
After years of waiting,

473
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,610
you finally stepped
into my tower’s realm.

474
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,280
Do you really think
i’d let you walk away?

475
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,710
You’re looking at a man
who’s spent every moment

476

of every day thinking about
escaping this godforsaken tower!

Toyohiro: Have you already
forgotten my warning?

479
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,760
this tower will return
any attack back to the attacker.

480
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,030
That wire is also
a part of this tower.

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,030
I purposely severed the line

482
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,830
so that the opening
would face you.

the place where I meet my end?

Get your ass out of there!
I can heal the wound,

486
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,810
but you have to leave the tower!

487
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,710

escaping a little bit tougher,

I must admit, but all of
that ugliness is behind us now.

i would wager
prying those suckers out

will sting just a touch,
