1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,640
Tomoko: For the love of--josuke!

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,310
Are you still playing that game?

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,180
- ( Video game playing )
- If you don’t turn it off

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,350
right this second,
i’m gonna scream!

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,520
jotaro:
Five more minutes, please?!

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,850
Just five more minutes!
come on, mom.

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,250
Just this once!
I can’t stop now!

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,490
I’m about to get
to the best part!

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,430
Quitting guarantees i’ll live
the pathetic life of a scrub

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,760
who doesn’t follow through
on his promises!

11
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,090
Tomoko: Have it your way.

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,500
the longer
you play your little game,

13
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,500
the harder these kicks
are gonna get!

14
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,370
- josuke: ...I don’t.
- Tomoko: How long do you think

15
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,340
- you can hold out?
- ( Josuke wails )

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,140
I-it’s over.

17
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,410
Shit.

18
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,440
Tomoko: Put it away,
and start your homework.

19
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,850
Oh, and would it kill you
to take off your uniform?

20
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,810
It is nighttime, you know.

21
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,690
( Jotaro sighs )

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,360
woman: Sorry.
I can’t see you anymore.

23
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,330
- jotaro: Huh?
- Man: But why, sachiko?

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,830
have the flames
of our love burned out?

25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,260
Jotaro: What’s going on?

26
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,760
I’m pretty sure
that I turned it off.

27
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,870
Ah, come on.

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,270
Shut off, will you?

29
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,240
chili pepper:
It would seem jotaro kujo

30
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,240
has refused to leave town,
and after I went out of my way

31
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,510
to give him
an explicit warning.

32
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,580
There has to be a reason,
right, josuke higashikata?

33
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,320
Josuke: I know you.

34
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,850
You’re chili pepper!

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,860
♪

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,280
( Gasps )
What are you doing here?

37
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,290
Chili pepper: You’re not
the brightest bulb, are you?

38
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,860
Clearly it escaped your notice

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,530
that i’ve been popping in and
out of here for a while now.

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,260
Josuke: What?!

41
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,760
This asshole’s been keeping tabs
on me the entire time?

42
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,760
( Chili pepper laughs )
One of my other hot spots

43
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,800
is the house
belonging to okuyasu,

44
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,140
the brother of that fool
i knocked off.

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,140
I’m also well aware of that
schoolgirl, yukako yamagishi,

46
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,210
and koichi hirose’s reverb,

47
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,410
and I know toshikazu hazamada

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,150
and tamami kobayashi
are in the hospital.

49
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,480
Josuke: Something about this
isn’t making sense.

50
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,750
From everything i’ve seen,

51
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,520
you’re a conniving,
birdbrained coward.

52
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,560
What reason could you possibly
have for turning up at my house

53
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,520
ready to take me on
fair and square?

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,330
Surely you’re not moronic enough

55
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,330
to believe
that anything you could do

56
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,430
would actually be enough
to mess me up?

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,100
Chili pepper: Me, mess you up?

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,100
No, nothing so foul
for this birdie.

59
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,500
Your death will be a humane one.

60
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,200
( Josuke scoffs )
So you’re a coward

61
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,510
and a comedian
with a crappy sense of humor.

62
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,610
You’re two for two, birdbrain.

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,810
( Chili pepper laughs )

64
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,780
Full disclosure before we begin.

65
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,350
I’ve already told jotaro

66
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,720
his star platinum
poses a great threat to me.

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,520
his vigilance
is annoyingly steadfast,

68
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,560
and his stand’s time-stopping
ability is formidable,

69
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,560
so the only course of action
left to me

70
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,590
is to completely decimate
that interloper

71
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,760
in a head-to-head battle
for supremacy.

72
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,800
But before I fight jotaro,
I want to test my abilities

73
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,470
against you,
josuke higashikata.

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,640
Why don’t you come
a little bit closer?

75
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,840
i won’t bite.
All i’m asking you to do

76
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,310
is unleash an attack
as swift and precise

77
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,080
as one of star platinum’s.
It’s as simple as that!

78
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,650
and if you’re
all the way back there,

79
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,680
i’m worried your punches
won’t be quite up to snuff.

80
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,550
Josuke: Is that mockery
i’m detecting in your voice?

81
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,590
chili pepper:
No, not in the slightest.

82
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,860
I just have every confidence

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,120
in the capabilities
of you and your stand,

84
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,590
so why don’t you come closer?

85
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,630
I want you to give me
your best shot,

86
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,630
so put your back into it, boy.

87
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,600
Here. Come on. Lay one on me.

88
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,740
Make sure to get nice and close.

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,270
( Groans )

90
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,110
Incredible! So fast!
how in the--

91
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,870
josuke: I’m tired
of your incessant squawking!

92
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,880
( Shining diamond yelling )

93
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,450
Chili pepper: He’s faster
than I ever imagined.

94
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,750
- ( Groans )
- Josuke: If you keep it up,

95
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,720
i’ll just have
to debeak you myself!

96
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,450
( Chili pepper wails )

97
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,160
Josuke: And by the way,
jotaro’s star platinum’s

98
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,160
got nothin’ on me.
Don’t ever forget that.

99
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,760
chili pepper: Damn it.
My arrogance got the best of me,

100
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,430
and I underestimated
his abilities.

101
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,670
( Shining diamond yelling )

102
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,300
Eh? What?

103
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,470
- ( Chili pepper yells )
- ( Josuke groans )

104
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,340
( Yells )

105
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,340
- ( Chili pepper laughs )
- tomoko: Josuke,

106
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,340
what the hell
is going on in there?

107
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,310
Josuke: That blow, it was like
being on the receiving end

108
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,750
of a supercharged
jet-engine blast.

109
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,550
He might actually be stronger
than Mr. Jotaro.

110
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,490
chili pepper:
Very impressive, josuke.

111
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,490
I wasn’t expecting
your shining diamond

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,590
to be so robust.
It would appear

113
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,560
that i’m not the only one of us
who’s matured.

114
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,460
Clearly, my time
hasn’t yet arrived.

115
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,300
Until chili pepper is stronger,

116
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,670
vanquishing jotaro
shall remain a far-off fantasy.

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,440
( Jotaro sighs ) All he needs
is a source of electricity

118
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,410
to pop out and pulverize us.

119
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,480
what’s worse is he
can control his stand from afar.

120
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,420
Tomoko: Josuke, why did it sound

121
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,720
like 50 tornadoes
flew through here?

122
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,360
josuke: Don’t know.
Maybe you’re hearing things.

123
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,590
( Okuyasu groans ) Damn it!

124
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,200
I just got bit by another bug.

125
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,760
You know, it’s days like today

126
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,270
i wish I was one
of those fancy bug zappers.

127
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,630
( Koichi gasps ) It’s josuke!

128
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Josuke: Hey, guys.
I’m sorry for the wait.

129
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,310
Okuyasu: What the heck
is this all about, josuke?

130
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,740
i mean,
why’d you wanna meet us

131
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,780
all the way out here
in the boondocks?

132
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,410
Wouldn’t tonio’s or that café

133
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,310
have been a much better place
to sit down and talk?

134
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,180
Josuke: I wasn’t the one
who called you guys out here.

135
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,450
It was actually jotaro.

136
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,720
Koichi: Mr. Jotaro?
Wonder what he wants.

137
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,160
Josuke: I’m guessing
it’s about chili pepper.

138
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,860
koichi: What?!
When you say, "chili pepper,"

139
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,590
you don’t mean that horrible
stand, chili pepper, do you?

140
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,100
( Branch cracks )

141
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,700
( Okuyasu panting )

142
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,300
- ( Koichi gasps )
- Okuyasu: So he’s finally back.

143
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,640
- Josuke: Yeah.

144
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,210
In fact, he paid me a visit
at home last night.

145
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,710
Okuyasu: You prick!
Why didn’t you tell me

146
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,440
as soon as it happened?!

147
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,580
Koichi: Okuyasu, he turns into
a completely different person

148
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,810
any time he hears

149
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,720
even the slightest mention
of chili pepper.

150
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,150
But how can you blame him

151
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,190
when he lost his brother
to that stand?

152
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,090
Jotaro: I told josuke
not to say anything.

153
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,390
Discussing this downtown
wasn’t an option.

154
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,830
We’d be surrounded
by electricity.

155
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,360
Koichi: Mr. Jotaro!

156
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,060
Jotaro: I didn’t wanna risk
being spied on,

157
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,330
- so I had us meet here.
- ( Okuyasu growls )

158
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,640
josuke: Okuyasu,
just so you know, chili pepper

159
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,070
grates the ever-lovin’ shit
out of me, too.

160
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,370
That slithery bastard

161
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,810
thinks he can do
whatever he damn well pleases.

162
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,180
He spies on people, eavesdrops,
swipes anything he wants.

163
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,550
( Okuyasu gasps )

164
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,580
Koichi: Wait a minute.
So that’s why I woke up

165
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,750
to my homework being gone
from my desk the other day!

166
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,420
It makes total sense to me now!

167
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,290
And here I thought
my mom threw it away

168
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,520
- when she took out the trash--
- josuke: Do you really think

169
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,660
now’s the time
to worry about that, koichi?!

170
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,660
Look, this is the bottom line.

171
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,360
The only reason chili pepper
hasn’t raised even more hell

172
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,800
is ’cause we’re around,
but don’t let that fool you.

173
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,800
He’s a lot stronger
than he lets on.

174
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,200
He can drag anyone he wants
into the phone lines

175
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,170
as easy as making a prank call.

176
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,480
there’s no doubt
he has the bow and arrow.

177
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,180
Right now, we need to focus
on who he’s shot with it.

178
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,650
i know firsthand
how much stronger he’s gotten.

179
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,650
We have to find
chili pepper’s user

180
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,650
as soon as humanly possible.

181
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,490
Koichi: But how do we do that?

182
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,060
Josuke: Well, we’re here
to figure it out together,

183
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,390
right, Mr. Jotaro?

184
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,260
Jotaro: No, not really,

185
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,400
but we’ve found someone
to do just that,

186
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,760
and the three of you
will be pleased to know

187
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,400
our guest of honor is arriving
at the port of morioh

188
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,140
- at noon today.
- Koichi: Huh?

189
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,440
okuyasu:
Just who is this someone?

190
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,440
Josuke: Hold on!
Is he a stand user?

191
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,840
Jotaro: He is. The name
of his stand is hermit purple,

192
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,310
but he’s gotten way too old to
risk going out into the field.

193
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,450
Fighting as a whole
is out of the question.

194
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,180
josuke: What?
Just how old is this guy?

195
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,350
I mean, you have met him before,
haven’t you?

196
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,720
jotaro: Yeah.
I know him quite well, actually.

197
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,560
he used to be
pretty studly back in the day,

198
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,290
but you wouldn’t know it
looking at him now.

199
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,300
he’s 80--
no, make that 79 years old.

200
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,370
josuke: 79?!
The guy’s practically a fossil!

201
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,570
Jotaro: His legs definitely
aren’t what they used to be,

202
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,240
so he uses a cane,
and two years ago,

203
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,040
he had gallstones removed,
not to mention his cataracts.

204
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,640
All his teeth are fake now,

205
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,410
so he grumbles about missing
his t-bone steaks.

206
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,620
Oh, and he’s going senile, too.

207
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,120
Josuke: Give it a rest.
Next you’re gonna tell me

208
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,690
he likes to talk
to mailboxes. Come on.

209
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,220
You have gotta be
yanking our chains.

210
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,360
Jotaro: The real reason
I had you guys come here

211
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,330
was so that you
could protect the old man.

212
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,660
if chili pepper
gets wind of his arrival,

213
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,600
you can bet he’ll stop
at nothing to take him down.

214
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,300
The thing he dreads most

215
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,070
is one of us discovering
the true identity of his user.

216
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,240
( Josuke sighs )
But that doesn’t explain

217
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,380
how the old-timer
is gonna help us.

218
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,710
Jotaro: I was against it, too,

219
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,350
but as soon as he heard
about the bow and arrow,

220
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,420
he headed to Japan
despite my objections.

221
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,750
Koichi: "To Japan"?

222
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,250
So this person isn’t Japanese,
Mr. Jotaro?

223
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,420
- Jotaro: Correct.
- ( Koichi gasps )

224
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,560
Josuke, this is life-changing!

225
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,620
Josuke: Huh? What is?
What do you mean?

226
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,360
Koichi: Think about it.

227
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,160
He’s a 79-year-old stand user
who isn’t from Japan!

228
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,660
( Josuke gasps ) Hey!

229
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,330
- You can’t mean--
- ( Motorcycle starts )

230
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,770
- Okuyasu: Eh?
- ( Both gasp )

231
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,640
chili pepper:
That’s what I needed to hear.

232
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,340
Okuyasu: Watch out!
It’s chili pepper!

233
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,710
jotaro: Blast it!
How’d he find us way out here?

234
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,380
( Engine revving )

235
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,250
( Chili pepper laughs )

236
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,090
( Koichi gasps ) But how?!

237
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,390
There aren’t any power lines
in this area!

238
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,360
jotaro: He used
the motorcycle battery.

239
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,330
He must have hidden inside it
and come here with okuyasu.

240
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,900
Okuyasu: He hijacked my bike?!

241
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,260
Josuke: And he heard everything!

242
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,430
chili pepper:
So the port of morioh at noon,

243
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,140
that’s where i’ll find
the old fogey of a stand user

244
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,670
who could locate me, eh?

245
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,810
The moment that codger
pulls into port,

246
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,880
i’ll rip him up and continue
my reign of debauchery!

247
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,340
jotaro: Damn it,
he knows about the old man!

248
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,080
in other words,
he knows about josuke’s father.

249
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,320
( All gasp )

250
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,920
At the speed he’s going,
chili pepper’ll

251
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,260
get to the old man
before we can get him to safety.

252
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,960
Koichi: Quick, josuke!
use your stand

253
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,860
to Chuck a rock or something
at that bike and take it down!

254
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,960
Okuyasu: Don’t even
think about it.

255
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,930
That piece of shit is mine.

256
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,200
i’m gonna crush that
murdering jailbird into dust

257
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,940
if it’s the last thing I do!

258
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,240
Koichi: He cut
through space itself!

259
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,080
( Chili pepper gasps ) Damn,
it’s keicho’s little brother!

260
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,480
Okuyasu: What’s the rush?
We have unfinished business.

261
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,980
It’s time for you to disappear!

262
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,390
Huh?

263
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,890
chili pepper:
Well done, boy. Well done.

264
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,920
Teleporting yourself
to the motorcycle

265
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,890
was exceptional,
to say the least,

266
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,390
but you wasted your time.

267
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,830
That adorable scratching motion
you do with the hand

268
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,330
is hardly a match
for chili pepper’s

269
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,330
extraordinary speed,
so as usual,

270
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,740
i’m afraid your efforts
have been all for naught.

271
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,840
Face facts, kid. You’re slow.

272
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,440
okuyasu:
Take another look, dickhead.

273
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,140
When I said i’d make
somethin’ disappear,

274
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,240
I meant the motorcycle.

275
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,410
chili pepper:
He destroyed the front wheel!

276
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,720
( Panting )

277
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,130
Okuyasu: It’s safe to say
you won’t be escaping now.

278
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,430
Josuke: That’s using your head,
okuyasu! Way to go!

279
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,070
Luckily for us, chili pepper
won’t be able to move

280
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,270
very far away
from the motorcycle battery.

281
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,840
And check it out.

282
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,840
The nearest power line
is at least 100 meters away.

283
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,240
We’ve got you cornered
like a rat in a trap.

284
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,710
Koichi: That was a close one.

285
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,280
Jotaro: Hey, stay focused.

286
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,010
He isn’t captured yet.

287
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,750
Don’t forget he can still use
the bike’s battery.

288
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,250
He’ll do whatever it takes to
kill okuyasu and fly the Coop.

289
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,790
( Okuyasu growls )

290
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,990
Jotaro: Let’s head over.

291
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,120
Both: Right!

292
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,030
Chili pepper:
Color me surprised.

293
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,730
I didn’t think you’d go to all
this trouble to avenge keicho.

294
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,230
Okuyasu: I didn’t.
I knew who my bro was.

295
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,070
the other shoe
was gonna drop eventually.

296
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,910
someone was bound
to snuff him out over something.

297
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,780
That’s the thing about crime.

298
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,210
No matter how far
you try to run from it,

299
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,020
it always has a way of
catching up to you in the end.

300
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,350
That’s painfully clear,
even to a sap like me.

301
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,260
( Chili pepper growls )

302
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
okuyasu: So now
for the business at hand.

303
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,990
Tell me who your user is
and where he lives.

304
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,830
do that,
and i’ll spare your life,

305
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,200
which is more
than you deserve.

306
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,300
( Chili pepper grunts )
interesting.

307
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,930
If I tell you,
you’ll spare me, huh?

308
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,040
You’re surprisingly composed.

309
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,400
I was positive your bowels

310
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,040
would be burning
with vengeful fury by now!

311
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,880
( Okuyasu growls ) To be honest,
i’m secretly hoping

312
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,280
you won’t give me
the info on your user!

313
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,150
I’m itching to scrape you away,

314
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,880
you glow-in-the-dark shit-head,
so give me a reason!

315
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,690
chili pepper:
There’s the real you!

316
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,720
Thinking you can kill me--
( Laughs )

317
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,990
With that sluggish right hand?

318
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,990
- ( Okuyasu sputters )
- ( Chili pepper laughs )

319
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,930
i don’t know
if I should laugh or yawn,

320
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,300
but either way, you won’t be
putting out my lights today!

321
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,400
Okuyasu: You bastard!

322
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,200
I’ll end you!

323
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,840
chili pepper:
And i’ll make sure you realize

324
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,200
how pathetic your stand is

325
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,170
when compared to the marvel
that is chili pepper!

326
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,710
( Okuyasu gagging )

327
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,180
Chili pepper: Now do you finally
understand how slow you are?

328
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,790
- Josuke: Okuyasu!
- Koichi: Okuyasu!

329
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,060
Chili pepper: Not good!
Here comes jotaro.

330
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,790
I can’t stick around
much longer.

331
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,790
Huh?

332
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,930
How’d he get behind me?

333
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,800
Okuyasu: You’re right
about me being slow,

334
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,430
and I may have missed the Mark,
but I swiped away space,

335
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,230
which gives me
the ability to teleport!

336
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,270
Did you forget about that?!

337
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,380
How do you like that,
you beak-nosed freak?!

338
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,080
( Chili pepper groans )

339
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,760
Okuyasu: I might be wrong,

340
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,930
but it seems like
you’re not as fast as before.

341
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,960
Do you think someone as slow as
you can slip by my next attack?

342
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,330
Koichi: Look, you guys!

343
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
chili pepper’s
electric charge is fading!

344
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,670
He’s getting weaker
and weaker by the second!

345
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,270
His stand must be
running out of power!

346
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,810
josuke: Well,
would you look at that?

347
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,870
He actually did it!

348
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,810
Jotaro: Okuyasu,
leave him alive!

349
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,310
We’ll handle him
once we get over there!

350
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,950
You’ve already won! Now
our primary focus needs to be

351
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,110
getting him to tell us
where the bow and arrow are.

352
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,920
( Chili pepper gasping )
You’re right about one thing.

353
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,820
My energy is fading.

354
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,720
Your stand may be
as slow as molasses,

355
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,090
but the ferocity of its attack
is downright bone-chilling.

356
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,030
That being said...

357
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,430
Don’t you want to finish off
your brother’s killer for good?

358
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,700
Try using your head
for a moment.

359
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,040
How can you be certain

360
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,840
i’m not simply pretending
to be frail, okuyasu?

361
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,640
- okuyasu: What?!
- Chili pepper: Who’s to say

362
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,010
i’m not luring jotaro in close
so I can cleave off his head?

363
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,710
Okuyasu: Quit spoutin’ bullshit!

364
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,110
Chili pepper: Fine by me.

365
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,650
So what’ll it be?

366
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,180
Will you do away with me now

367
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,820
or wait for me
to get the drop on jotaro?

368
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,760
Okuyasu: You bastard.

369
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,990
( Gasps ) Hold on a minute.

370
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,990
If you were really
up to something shady,

371
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,700
why would you tell me
your plan?

372
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,830
Had he just kept his beak shut,

373
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,400
he could have easily
played us all.

374
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,100
He would have been
in the perfect position

375
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,100
to take me and jotaro out,

376
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,800
and if that’s the case,

377
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,310
since he basically told me
nothing’s wrong with him,

378
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,080
the chances of him attacking me
are practically zero.

379
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,910
At least, I think they are.

380
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,020
Are you trying to say you
want me to kill you after all?

381
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,090
Chili pepper: I’ll let you
come to your own conclusions.

382
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,090
Okuyasu: This is so confusing!

383
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,790
Is he on his last legs,

384
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,360
or is he lying through his beak,
waiting to attack?

385
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,960
Which one is it?!

386
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,100
( Chili pepper panting )

387
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,200
what’s your answer?
Are you gonna do it or not?

388
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,630
Okuyasu: If this asshole
isn’t really injured,

389
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,800
I have to kill him
right here and now.

390
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,410
But is that the right move?

391
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,410
he could
have something up his sleeve.

392
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,080
( Growls )

393
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,710
Shit! Should I?

394
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,120
jotaro: Okuyasu.
I better get over there.

395
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,220
( Chili pepper chuckles )
last chance.

396
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,150
Make up your mind, okuyasu.

397
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,820
( Chuckling )

398
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,190
( Okuyasu groans )

399
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,890
( Growls )

400
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,730
The hell with it!

401
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,770
i’m putting an end to
this nightmare once and for all!

402
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,770
- It’s time to die!
- Jotaro: Okuyasu!

403
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,170
Okuyasu: Don’t even think
about trying to stop me, jotaro!

404
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,370
He killed my bro! That means he
has to pay the ultimate price!

405
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,340
That’s the only truth
that matters right now,

406
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,080
and my heart has shown me
what I need to do!

407
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,050
Now eat shit, and die,
you glorified night light!

408
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,850
( Chili pepper screams )

409
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,690
Josuke: Well, that’s just great.

410
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,830
Finding the bow and arrow’s

411
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,860
gonna be
a real pain in the ass now!

412
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,400
At least he settled things
with that freak.

413
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,000
jotaro: Hang on.
Something doesn’t feel right.

414
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,770
We need to be careful.

415
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,170
My gut’s telling me chili pepper
is still a threat.

416
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,310
( Okuyasu gasps )

417
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,310
Underground electrical cables?

418
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,810
That bastard!

419
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,150
He faked all that
so i’d expose them!

420
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,350
( Chili pepper laughs )
not quite.

421
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,320
I really was fading.

422
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,390
That motorcycle battery
only holds 12 volts.

423
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,730
a few moments longer,
and I would have been done for.

424
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,030
Okuyasu: You lousy...

425
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,330
( Groaning )

426
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,200
Chili pepper: I must
thank you for reviving me!

427
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,970
( All gasping )

428
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,270
chili pepper:
Poor, simple-minded okuyasu!

429
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,170
If only you’d been a good boy

430
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,710
and controlled yourself
as jotaro instructed,

431
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,980
I would have faded away
with the battery.

432
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,340
I know the location

433
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,210
of every electrical line
running through this town.

434
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,180
my original plan was
to escape into those cables,

435
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,920
but they were too far away
from the motorcycle,

436
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,790
and in the state I was in,

437
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,320
digging them up
was out of the question.

438
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,830
Okuyasu: Why won’t you die?!

439
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,960
- He’s faster than before!
- Chili pepper: Hah!

440
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,130
With this much electricity
at my disposal,

441
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,900
I have more than enough power

442
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,700
to challenge
your lackluster right hand!

443
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,070
( Okuyasu yells )

444
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,080
( Screaming )

445
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,780
Koichi: Okuyasu!

446
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,430
Chili pepper: I seem to remember
your brother keicho

447
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,860
saying something about you
never failing to hold him back.

448
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,170
Ah, how right he was!

449
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,970
Your soul is underdeveloped.

450
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,440
( Laughs ) Revenge was never
going to be within your reach,

451
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,970
you cocksure ignoramus!

452
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,140
So long, jotaro and josuke.
I’m taking off,

453
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,110
but not before I find
that old coot, Joseph joestar,

454
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,310
and see to it
that he shares the same fate

455
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,280
as the lamentable
nijimura brothers!

456
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,020
To the Victor go the spoils!

457
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,820
Koichi: Okuyasu, no!

458
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,220
( Okuyasu screams )

459
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,990
( Koichi whimpering )

460
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,730
He pulled him into the cables.

461
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,870
Okuyasu! Okuyasu!

462
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,230
Jotaro: Good grief.

463
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,970
To think we were that close,
and he still got away.

464
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,410
josuke: That stand
was absolutely terrifying.

465
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,880
how do you even
begin to fight a remote stand

466
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,110
- with boundless power...
- koichi: What?!

467
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,380
what the hell
are you guys talking about?!

468
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,820
okuyasu was--
he was murdered in cold blood,

469
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,920
and you’re rambling
about how strong the enemy was?!

470
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,890
Jotaro: Oh, yeah. You’re right.

471
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,760
We should check up on okuyasu.

472
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,090
Josuke: Leave it to me.

473
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,090
Jotaro: There’s one consolation
in all this.

474
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,330
He must’ve had a guardian angel
lookin’ out for him.

475
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,700
Josuke: Weird as it sounds,

476
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,960
his right arm
getting chopped off

477
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,330
was the best thing
that could have happened.

478
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,700
Koichi: Huh?

479
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,740
Josuke: Let’s go,
shining diamond!

480
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,340
You don’t have to worry,

481
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,170
so dry those tears, koichi.

482
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,080
Once I fix his arm,
his body’ll come back.

483
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,850
( Okuyasu screams )

484
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,210
Chili pepper: What the hell?!

485
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,220
Koichi: All right!

486
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,820
I thought we’d lost you
for good, okuyasu!

487
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,460
( Okuyasu panting ) Shit.

488
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,460
I-I was totally outclassed
by that bastard.

489
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,100
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

490
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,200
Koichi: It’s not about revenge,

491
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,240
and we can’t focus on setbacks.

492
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,810
joseph joestar,
he’s the priority here.

493
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,010
He needs us. I know it’s tough,

494
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,940
but that’s how we’re
gonna beat chili pepper

495
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,040
and get true justice.

496
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,050
You have to do this
for our town,

497
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,450
and if that isn’t enough,

498
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,490
then do it for all the people
you care about.

499
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,390
Josuke: I might be
stating the obvious,

500
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,790
but this isn’t good. Guess I
was taking this too lightly.

501
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,060
Jotaro: Yeah. We have
to reach the old man’s boat

502
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,700
before chili pepper.
Let’s head to the port.

503
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,100
Koichi: How can you be so
nonchalant at a time like this?!

504
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,970
look at okuyasu!
He’s still in shock over here!

505
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,040
Josuke: We can get to the port
faster this way.

506
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,170
Jotaro: Sounds good.

507
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,210
Koichi: Would you guys
wait for us?!

508
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,040
okuyasu:
There’s no way around it.

509
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,340
bro, in order
to beat chili pepper,

510
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,150
I have to surpass you.

511
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,750
Sailor: Mr. Joestar,
we’ll be arriving

512
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,890
at the port of morioh
any moment now.

513
