1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,680
- Man: Koichi.
- Koichi: Huh?

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,750
Eh? Huh?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,780
Man: I’m over here, koichi.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,320
( Koichi yelps )
R-Rohan kishibe!

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,190
Rohan: Now, now, you don’t
have to be so defensive.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,860
My days of causing you harm
are long past.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,100
besides, after reading
your history with heaven’s door,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,530
I found myself filled with
a deep sense of respect for you.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,600
I’d go so far as to say
we’re two peas in a pod.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,140
Wouldn’t you agree? ( Chuckles )

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,710
( Koichi whimpers, chuckles )

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,870
Rohan: Now then, i’d like
to ask you a question if I may.

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,780
You see, I used to call
this area around here my home

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,510
until I was four or so.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,280
I’ve spent the day trying
to find my old residence.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,820
Nostalgia must have
gotten the better of me.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,220
Recalling one’s childhood

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,350
is central
to a manga artist’s work.

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,360
However, those memories
belong to a four-year-old,

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,530
- so they’re a little bit foggy.
- Koichi: Oh.

21
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,660
Rohan: That’s why
I need your help.

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,700
my question
concerns this town map.

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,330
There’s something odd about it.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,730
look. This is
the soba shop arisugawa,

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,410
kisara drugstore,
and the owson convenience store.

26
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,270
They’re situated right to left.

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,580
Koichi: Huh?

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,280
Rohan: Now take a look
at the shops themselves.

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,610
From the right,
you can see arisugawa,

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,080
kisara drugstore, and then...

31
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,550
- ( Koichi gasps )
- Rohan: You have owson

32
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,820
on the far left. See?

33
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,620
Koichi: Huh? That’s weird.

34
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,690
The map doesn’t show a road
between owson and the drugstore.

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,830
What sloppy work.

36
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,690
Rohan: Koichi,
would you tag along?

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,830
I would be forever in your debt
if you’d be my guide for a bit.

38
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,830
Koichi: Huh? Well, i’d like to,
but the thing is...

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,110
Rohan: That’s the response you
give after I ask so politely?

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,610
Fine. Have it your way.

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,440
I didn’t realize
showing me around

42
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,510
for a few meters
would be such a burden.

43
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,450
koichi: He sure
is self-centered. ( Sighs )

44
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,580
I can only spare five minutes.
Okay, sensei?

45
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,830
Rohan: Strange, isn’t it?
I’m checking my official

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,130
shoin press
ultra-detailed map of morioh,

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,500
and it makes no mention
of this street existing.

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,830
Koichi: On the bright side,
since your map had an error,

49
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,800
you might get a gift certificate
at the bookstore.

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,710
( Groans )

51
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
Rohan: Blast it.

52
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,780
This map is absolutely useless.

53
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,580
Take a look, koichi.

54
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,720
It doesn’t show the yonemori,
honma, or onadera residence.

55
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,390
There are mistakes everywhere.

56
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,690
The bookstore’s going to owe me

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
more than two or three
gift certificates.

58
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,460
Koichi: Rohan-sensei, this place
looks like it’s been abandoned.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,770
What a weird area.

60
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,600
The few houses
that are around here

61
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,870
- look completely unoccupied.
- Rohan: And look.

62
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,210
Even the vending machines
are out of order. Hmm?

63
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,480
Koichi: What the--
it’s the mailbox.

64
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,380
We made our first turn
at this corner

65
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,850
when we came down the alleyway.

66
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,520
This is too weird.

67
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,490
Somehow we’ve managed to end up
right back where we started.

68
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,660
Rohan: But we turned right,
left, then right.

69
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,230
( Swallows )

70
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,430
keep your guard up.
There could be an enemy nearby

71
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,300
manipulating things
with their stand.

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
( Koichi gasps ) You think?

73
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,730
Rohan: If you would,

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,100
have reverb fly overhead
and search the area.

75
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,730
( Koichi gasps )
Yeah, of course.

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,840
from up there,
it can see where we need to go.

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,570
Reverb act one.

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,180
( Reverb gasps )

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,450
Rohan: What’s the matter?

80
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,610
Koichi: There was
something up there.

81
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,580
I don’t know what, but something
just grazed reverb.

82
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,250
Rohan: Are you sure?
I didn’t see anything.

83
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
Koichi: I know something
came into contact with reverb.

84
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,790
Girl: ’scuse me.
Are you two lost?

85
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,830
( Koichi gasps )

86
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,830
Girl: I would be happy
to be your guide.

87
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,470
Rohan: A girl.

88
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,800
Koichi: She must be
the enemy stand user.

89
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,810
- Rohan: Heaven’s door!
- ( Girl gasps )

90
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,880
Rohan: And with the flick
of a finger, victory is mine.

91
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,050
We should be safe now.

92
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,450
I’ve written commands
in her pages,

93
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,350
so she won’t be able to harm us.

94
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,390
Koichi: Sensei,
that was amazing.

95
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,660
It’s like you launched
your drawing into midair.

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,490
I’ve made quite a lot
of progress with my stand.

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,330
That said, it still doesn’t work
on haters like josuke,

98
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,800
who wouldn’t know art
if it kicked him in groin.

99
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,670
she and I are
on the same wavelength.

100
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,310
oh, dear. She’s just
an ordinary girl, not an enemy.

101
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,540
koichi: Huh?
So she’s not out to get us?

102
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,180
Rohan: That’s right.

103
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,610
You can’t conceal anything
from heaven’s door.

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,080
Her name is reimi sugimoto,
age 16.

105
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,350
her address
is 312 kotodai, morioh.

106
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,720
That’s not far from here.

107
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,120
She has no boyfriend,
and her measurements

108
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,660
are 82, 57,
and 84 centimeters.

109
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,560
There’s a mole
by her left nipple,

110
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,330
and her first period came
at age 11 in September.

111
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,830
The first time she kissed a boy,

112
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,500
he rammed his tongue
down her throat.

113
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,500
Koichi: That’s just
about enough, Rohan!

114
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,540
If this girl’s not a stand user,
then I refuse to allow you

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
to read anything else
about her life!

116
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,610
Rohan: All right, all right.
I get it.

117
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,610
take it easy.
"I will forget everything

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,780
that has just happened." There.

119
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,450
Reimi: I’d be happy
to guide you.

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,180
Really, this place
trips a lot of people up.

121
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,290
Several of these alleys
look the same.

122
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,820
Rohan: Please point us
in the right direction,

123
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,260
and we’ll be on our way.

124
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,420
Reimi: Absolutely not.

125
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,830
A simple explanation
won’t cut it.

126
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,260
I’m your guide, so follow me.

127
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,560
- Rohan: Hmm.
- Koichi: Huh?

128
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,470
- Reimi: Want one?
- Both: Mm-mmm.

129
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,730
Reimi: If you’re sure.

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,370
but you still
have to hold on to the end.

131
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,540
Rohan: Hmm?

132
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,240
Reimi: Uh-oh. Better be careful.

133
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,280
Some girl is gonna dump you.

134
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,450
Rohan: Really?
Where’s your proof?

135
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,810
Reimi: Pocky fortunetelling.

136
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,520
The break tells me
all about you.

137
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,520
You’re majorly self-centered,

138
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,590
and you have a habit of pushing
people’s buttons, don’t you?

139
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,520
that’s why
you’re going to get dumped.

140
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,190
Rohan: Get a load
of this, koichi.

141
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,230
now we know
she’s off her rocker.

142
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,130
She actually thinks
i’m self-centered.

143
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,760
You’re about to find out
two can play at this game.

144
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,200
Light pink nail Polish
means you’re afraid of love.

145
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,530
That’s very telling.

146
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,640
you often let love
slip through your fingers.

147
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,540
( Reimi gasps )

148
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,210
No way.

149
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,480
Rohan: I use psychological
prodding over fortunetelling.

150
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,740
But enough about your love life.

151
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,210
something else
is weighing on your mind.

152
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,220
♪

153
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,360
Hmm?

154
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,460
Reimi: Have you heard
the story about this house?

155
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,800
It’s said it was the scene
of a murder 15 years ago.

156
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,230
Koichi: Did she say a murder?

157
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,500
Rohan: Yes, she did.

158
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,140
Reimi: No one lives
in the house now.

159
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,370
It’s empty. Here’s why.

160
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,780
This story was told to me
by the old lady next door.

161
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,080
it happened
in the dead of night,

162
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,120
while the young girl was
sleeping soundly in her bedroom.

163
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,590
she awoke
to a strange dripping sound

164
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,260
that seemed to be emanating
from her parents’s room,

165
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,720
but she couldn’t be sure.

166
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,720
( Koichi swallows )

167
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,590
Reimi: The sound puzzled her.

168
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,160
"Daddy," "mommy,"
she called out,

169
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,200
but she never heard a reply.

170
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,370
however, the girl
wasn’t particularly scared,

171
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,300
because she was accompanied
by her trusty dog.

172
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,440
Rohan: Her dog?

173
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,410
reimi: Yes.
He was a big guard dog.

174
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,310
In the darkness, she’d offer
her hand to him under the bed,

175
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,410
and he’d always respond
with a whimper and a lick.

176
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,780
arnold was
her constant reassurance,

177
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,720
but the dripping
that had stolen the girl

178
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,390
from her peaceful slumber
continued for several minutes.

179
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,820
Finally, she’d had enough.

180
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,630
her curiosity
drove her to investigate.

181
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,560
Koichi: What happened next?
( Gulps )

182
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,070
Reimi: She found Arnold
with his throat slashed,

183
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,370
hanging from the coat rack
like an old pelt.

184
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,670
The dripping sound
was coming from him,

185
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,210
the sound
of his spilling blood.

186
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,510
( Both gasp )

187
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,210
Reimi: Suddenly,
she heard a voice

188
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,580
coming from under her bed.

189
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,780
"Your hand is so sweet
and tender, sweetheart.

190
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,320
"Whimper, whimper.

191
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,320
I’ve already murdered
your mommy and daddy."

192
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,320
And then he attacked the girl,

193
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,090
- killing her where she stood!
- ( Koichi screams )

194

Tell me that story was just
your way of joking around!

195

( Reimi laughs )
Sounded pretty real, didn’t it?

they’re called stands?

stopped pleading with people

to listen,
to let me share my story.

the murderer,

a look at his face,

his knife
found its way into my back.

264

it was late and dark,
and I was doing my best to flee.

all this to us?

asking you to catch him.

i just need you
to tell someone who will.

I think it’s best
we remain levelheaded.

280

It’s an absolute tragedy.

281

I’m sorry your life
was stolen from you.

but that still
doesn’t explain things.

We find the murderer
so you can get closure?

284
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,580
That all seems rather pointless,
doesn’t it?

285

You’d be better off
letting go of this world.

Surely moving on
to the next world

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,210
one I know all too well.

313
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,610
Morioh has always been my home,

314
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,950
and for 15 years, it’s stood
in the shadow of murder.

315
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,550
It’s terrifying,

316
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,050
and on a personal level,
it’s utterly humiliating.

317
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,520
When they finally detain
that wild animal,

318
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,220
my cherished morioh
will have a new reputation.

319
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,230
All of Japan will know it
as the home of a monster.

320
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,060
But none of that
changes the fact

321
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,530
that we have to stop him
as fast as possible.

322
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,730
He’s preying on someone
as we speak,

323
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,170
and there’s nothing
at all I can do.

324
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,770
Whose life will be ripped away
from them next?

325
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,910
You still have blood
pumping through your veins.

326
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,110
If you won’t take back
morioh’s peace and dignity,

327
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,950
then tell me who will, and i’ll
ask for their help instead!

328
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,050
( Both gasp )

329
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,050
Reimi: I really hope you’ve
taken what i’ve said to heart.

330
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,060
I’ve nothing more to say.

331
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,960
( Koichi shudders )

332
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,960
Well, I heard you
loud and clear,

333
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,930
and i’m shocked
no one knows about this.

334
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,200
There has to be something
we can do here.

335
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,800
( Rohan chuckles )
How altruistic, koichi.

336
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,070
This smells like trouble.

337
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,250
Although, this vicious killer

338
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,550
could be a good source
of inspiration.

339
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,590
It all seems like it’d make
for some interesting manga.

- ( Koichi gasps )
- ( Reimi gasps )

Rohan: Can we get out
if we go this way?

342
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,490
Koichi: Don’t buy
the good-guy act.

343
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,260
It’s obvious that he
has ulterior motives.

344
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,860
And when it comes
to trustworthiness,

345
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,230
the guy’s shady at best.

346
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,600
( Rohan sighs )
Did you hear a word I just said?

347
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,070
Reimi: Then we’re agreed.

348
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,000
i’ll show you
how to get to the exit.

349
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,740
Koichi: Huh? The exit?
Where do we find it?!

350
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,110
Reimi: If you go
past the mailbox,

351
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,510
you’ll find it on the left.

352
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,250
- koichi: Yeah!
- Reimi: Hey, slow down!

353
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,950
trust me.
You don’t want to rush it.

354
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,250
There’s a rule
to making it through.

355
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,950
( Both stammer )

356
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,250
Rohan: There’s a rule?

357
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,220
Reimi: Yes. Once you
make it past the mailbox,

358
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,560
you’ll see the exit
about 20 meters away.

359
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,760
No matter what happens
around that corner,

360
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,100
I need you both to promise me
you’ll never look behind you.

361
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,730
Rohan: Why not?
What would be there?

362
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,970
Reimi: That’s just the rule
for passing to the next world.

363
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,640
Even Arnold understands
something as simple as that.

364
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,870
koichi: Okay.
If a dog can handle it,

365
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,480
I guess there’s no reason
I wouldn’t be able to.

366
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,850
Rohan: And if we do look back,
what happens then?

367
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,780
Reimi: Well, putting it
in layman’s terms,

368
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,250
your souls would be dragged
into the next world.

369
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,850
Put bluntly, you would die.

( Both gasp )

Reimi: But don’t worry.
It’ll be a piece of cake.

372

When we passed the mailbox,

There will always be something

I know it seems scary
and overwhelming,

but as long as you
don’t look back,

it can’t do anything
to cause you harm.

Where does she get off
calling me "little Rohan"?

What an audacious ghost girl.

But, still, reimi sugimoto,

she has an unyielding spirit,

and that’s something
to be respected.

your house was close to theirs.

your parents
left home for the evening.

business that needed attention.

Your parents and the sugimotos
were very close friends,

463

so they left you with them

matters elsewhere.
