his ass handed to him,

that hazamada guy still said
he didn’t know anything

about that sparky s.O.B.
Who killed my bro?

4

Josuke: Yeah.
Apparently he’s only

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,900
ever talked to him
over the phone.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,230
Okuyasu: You did torture
that twat-waffle

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,100
before he told you this, right?

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,640
He could have been lying to you!

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,770
Josuke: Look, I really believe

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,740
hazamada was
telling me the truth.

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,770
If he knew the user’s identity,
he would’ve been killed by now.

Oh, yeah, I guess you’re right.

Josuke: Exactly. And hazamada’s
still breathing, isn’t he?

15
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,520
For now,
that’s all the proof we need

16

that he’s telling the truth.

17
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,890
Now then, hazamada did
tell us about one thing.

Hazamada: Don’t ask me
to tell you why this is,

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,050
so she leaves me alone.

316
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,880
Josuke: I’d think twice
about that, koichi.

317
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,650
If you try being
that blunt with her,

318
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,320
it’ll only fan
the demented flames

319
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,220
of her passion even more.

320
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,720

i’m right. Now listen up.

324
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,330
Yukako is insane,
but convincing her

325
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,740
to stop using her hair
for evil is low priority.

326
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,340
We have far more pressing
concerns at the moment.

327
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,240
Figuring out a way
to not provoke her comes first.

328
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,010
Koichi: But how do we do that?

329
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,840
Josuke: The truth is
it doesn’t matter

330
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,380
how infatuated she is with you.

331
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,310
If she comes
to her own conclusion

332
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,980
that you’re the most pathetic,
disgusting schmuck around,

333
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,820
then we get to go on living
happily ever after, right?

334

( Koichi sighs )

335
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,020
Josuke: So all you’ve
gotta do on your end

336
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,430
is act like a total jackass
whenever you’re in front of her.

337
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,730
Okuyasu: Oh, now I get
where you’re going with this.

Well, thank you.

a compliment coming from you?

341

Koichi: Jeez, Louise,
what could I do

342
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,940
to make yukako think
i’m totally unappealing?

343
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,870
Josuke: Well,
from what i’ve been told,

344
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,780
mama’s boys and gross guys

345
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,710
are usually
major turnoffs for ladies.

346

( Koichi gasps )
There has to be another way!

347
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,110
If she thinks i’m a mama’s boy,

348
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,080
she’ll hate my mom
and go after her, too!

349
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Okuyasu: Then we’ll
have to go with option b!

350
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,090

who doesn’t take baths.

or change your underwear.

Okuyasu: Raising some lice
or spiders in your hair

354
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,390
might be a good idea.

355
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,430
Josuke: Wearing sweaty socks
is pretty gross.

is to become a nobody,

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,470
Koichi: Wait! Hold on a minute!

472
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,000
Yukako: You’ll do what I say!

473
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,700
And as long
as you’re living in this house,

474
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,070
your life
must constantly revolve

475
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,070
around your betterment! Agreed?

476
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,070
( Koichi gasps )

477
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,070
( Yukako chuckles )

478
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,540
On to the question.

479
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,280
In prince’s lyrics, he uses
the words "funky music,"

480
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,380
and I want the best
Japanese translation.

481
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,380
A, nekkyo no ongaku.

482
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,790
B, genshi no ongaku

483
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,060
c, gensou no ongaku.

484
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,690
Koichi: If I don’t
answer her question,

485
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,730
she’ll get hysterical, but I
don’t have a flipping clue!

486
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,630
I have a hunch it’s a,

487
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,730
but it could easily
be b or c as well.

488
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,740
Screw it! I can do this.

489
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,640
Eh, my guess is...

490
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,770
B.

491
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,810
( Yukako laughs )

492
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,810
( Koichi gasps )

493
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,750
Yukako: Ahh! You got it right!

494
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,580
Congratulations! You won a pair
of freshly hard-boiled eggs!

495
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,350
I’ll peel them for you.
With a pinch of salt, right?

496
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,720
( Koichi sighs )

497
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,720
Yukako: Just so you know,
if you had chosen a,

498
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,390
you would have
had to eat this eraser.

499
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,760
( Koichi yelps )

500
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,090
Yukako: Box c would have
been a bar of soap.

501
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,530
Koichi: Wh-what the hell?!

502
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,170
Yukako: The next item
on the menu

503
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,170
is bacon and eggs.
Best of luck.

504
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,170
Your question, which of these
characters express contrast?

505
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,240
Would it be taisho a,

506
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,780
perhaps taisho b,

507
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,510
or maybe taisho c?

508
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,610
Koichi: She’s not
messing around here.

509
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,280
If I choose the wrong box,

510
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,480
she’ll force me
to eat its contents for sure.

511
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,320
I know you’re stalling for time.

512
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,390
Hurry, or your food
will get cold.

513
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,190
Koichi: Uh, well, maybe it’s...

514
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,600
What do I do now?
She’s playing hardball.

515
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,630
( Yukako grunts )

516
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,700
( Sighs )

517
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,510
( Koichi gasps ) Is it c?

518
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,840
Yukako: Tell me, koichi.

519
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Were you watching my expressions
to decide which box to pick?

520
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,110
( Koichi gasps )

521
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,810
I never thought i’d say this,

522
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,720
but your reputation
for being a conniving,

523
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,220
shoplifting cheater is true!

524
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,720
For your penalty,
you shall consume

525
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,460
the contents of boxes a and b!

526
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,420
A is english vocab corn flakes.

527
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,490
B is asparagus,

528
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,230
a la english dictionary.

529
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,630
You’re gonna learn
with every bite you take!

530
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,230
- ( Koichi whimpers )
- Yukako: Here!

531
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,730
Now open up that mouth,

532
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,740
’cause here comes the knowledge.

533
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,640
What’s wrong?

534
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,810
Eat your food, damn it!

535
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,440
( Koichi whimpering )

536
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,340
I’ve had about enough of this!

537
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,580
You expect me to sit back
and take this crap?

538
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,150
Well, I can’t!
I’m getting the hell outta here!

539
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,920
- ( Yukako grunts )
- ( Koichi yelps )

540
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,250
Yaah! Now what’s happening?!

541
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,890
What’s pulling my scalp?!

542
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,860
It feels like somebody’s hair!

543
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,860
Wait! Does this belong to...

544
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,800
Yukako: Indeed. I implanted
a few hundred strands

545
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,700
of my own hair
into your scalp.

546
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,600
( Koichi groans )

547
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,800
Yukako: I’m well aware
that you’ll probably hate me

548
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,600
for going to these
extreme measures, koichi.

549
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,940
Koichi: Huh?

550
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,270
Yukako: But by the time
you leave this house,

551
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,580
you’ll look in the mirror

552
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,450
and see a brand-new man
staring back at you.

553
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,580
I’m certain
you’ll thank me after that,

554
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,880
and you’ll realize you need
a woman like me in your life.

555
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,890
It’s safe to say
you won’t be able to live

556
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,190
without Yukako Yamagishi.

557
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,890
( Koichi gasps )

558
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,730
Yukako: Oh,
you might as well know,

559
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,330
until you finish every
last morsel on your plates,

560
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,500
I won’t be giving you
any more food.

561
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,900
There’s one more thing.

562
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,230
A famous c.E.O. Vacations here,

563
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,370
but no one will be visiting
until summer.

564
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,810
( Koichi gasps ) Until summer?!

565
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,810
Yukako: Although, it doesn’t
really matter who drops by,

566
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,710
because in the very end,
love is an invincible power.

567
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,750
♪

568
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,520
( Koichi screams )

569
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:32,600
S-somebody help me!
