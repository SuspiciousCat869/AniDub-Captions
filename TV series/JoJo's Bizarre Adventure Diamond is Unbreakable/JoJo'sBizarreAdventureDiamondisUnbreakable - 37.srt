1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,340
Kira: And, lo and behold,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,640
it was the right choice.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,380
had I not spilled
that fateful cup of coffee,

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,580
where would I be?

5
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,950
Hayato: No way.
It’s not possible!

6
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,650
It was supposed to work out!

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,920
Kira: Brat.

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,920
So you poked your nose around

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,660
and found feral cat, huh?!

10
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,090
( Hayato whimpering )

11
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,700
Kira: Oh, why bother?

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,530
as long as I keep
bites the dust activated,

13
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,870
it’ll function to keep my secret
and protect you at all cost.

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,600
( Hayato gasping )

15
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,710
Crap. I blew it.

16
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,880
And the others don’t have long
before they get blown up.

17
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,480
Kira: You tried to end me
once and for all

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,450
with one of stray cat’s
compressed air projectiles.

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,390
Hayato, there’s no way
your little pea brain

20
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,720
could have come up
with such a clever idea

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,520
unless you’d already
experienced this morning

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,530
at least three or four times.

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,460
The fact that you’ve lived
through this morning

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,700
that many times...

25
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,030
Is a surefire sign
that bites the dust

26
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,170
is destined
to eradicate not just Rohan,

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,540
but at least
one of his companions as well,

28
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,810
so your loose lips
won’t only sink Rohan,

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,480
but whichever one of his friends
you ran your mouth to.

30
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,750
( Chuckles )

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,020
Did the would-be detectives
gang up on you?

32
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,820
Who have you murdered
this time? Well?

33
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,190
was it a runt
by the name of koichi?

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,620
Or maybe it was jotaro kujo?

35
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,860
Knowing that he’s dead

36
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,160
would make this
a red-letter day indeed.

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,760
( Hayato gasps )
It’s all over.

38
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,530
Kira: It’d be far too risky
for me to allow you

39
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,970
to relive any more
of this morning. (Chuckles)

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,040
That would expose me
to an attack.

41
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,770
So, once the others die,

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,440
i’ll temporarily disengage
bites the dust.

43
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,410
( Hayato gasps )

44
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,820
( Kira laughing )

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,820
Bites the dust is all-powerful!

46
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,190
It took a while,

47
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,190
but luck is finally
on yoshikage kira’s side!

48

- ( Laughs )
- ( Hayato gasps )

49
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,130
Wait a second.

50
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,700
That name, Kira,
is that your real...

51
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,970
Kira: Huh? Whoopsie.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
did I just reveal
my true name to you by mistake?

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,100
( Chuckles ) Indeed,

54
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,570
i’m none other
than yoshikage Kira.

55
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,110
( Chuckles )

56
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,810
You can shout it to the heavens
if it suits your fancy.

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,050
by the way,
do you have the time?

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,210
Hayato: You’re dead wrong.

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,550
i haven’t
mentioned you to anyone!

60
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,120
I never opened
my mouth to anyone,

61
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,020
because I knew exactly what
would happen to them if I did!

62

- ( Kira grunts )
- Hayato: So instead,

63
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,030
I decided to make a call.

64
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,560
i remembered he said he
overslept and was running late,

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,630
so I found his number
and woke him up.

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,830
- ( Phone line ringing )
- I didn’t break any rules.

You’re the one who revealed
his own secret identity.

71
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,210
I was just stalling
for a bit of extra time,

dispiriting lows,

I was content to live
as carefree as a Daisy.

More than anything,
I sought to live

a quiet life
of peace and tranquility.

141

Josuke: You’ve finally
shown yourself.

142
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,630
That’ll make it real easy to
knock that peace and tranquility

00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,130
right off your new face!

from rohan’s picture!

end up meeting the guy here?

we didn’t run into him
by chance, okuyasu.

148

I haven’t figured out all of it,

149

but given that he
revealed his real name

150

to hayato kawajiri,
I get the feeling

we showed up
just in the Nick of time.

get all high and mighty,

155

I should tell you
I wasn’t running away,

despite appearances.

157
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,900
I can obliterate any one of you

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,490
for you to try blowing me up!

320
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,300
Doing that wouldn’t end well
for you, now, would it?!

321
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,560
( Kira grumbles )

322
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,030
Josuke: All right, hang on.

323
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,070
I’ll have you healed
before you know it.

324
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,270
( Kira chuckles )

325
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,470
( Hayato gasps )
You can’t touch him!

326
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,840
Trust me on this!
If I know Kira,

327
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,010
he’s already
transformed okuyasu!

328
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
He’s a bomb!

329
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,280
( Josuke gasps )

330
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,280
( Kira grumbles )

331
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,880
Damn that little whelp.

332
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,050
Josuke: He what? No!

333
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,020
I never saw deadly queen
lay even a finger on okuyasu.

334
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,360
What makes you think

335
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,130
he was able to pull that off?

336
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,290
You’re not a stand user,
so how would you know?!

337
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,630
hayato: I just do!
I’ve lived in the same house

338
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,630
as that psycho
until this morning!

339
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,330
His face tells me everything.

340
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,570
His stand touched him
before we could notice!

341
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,410
Josuke, please,
you gotta trust me!

342
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,510
Okuyasu’s a bomb now!

343
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,510
Josuke: Yoshikage Kira!

344
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,050
kira: Easy.
Give me a moment to think.

345
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,650
Well, now, let’s see.

346
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,350
You stormed at me
out of the blue,

347
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,520
so I can’t really say
whether I touched him or not.

348
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,620
Actually, the whole incident
was such a blur.

349
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,590
perhaps I should
press the switch and find out.

350
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,090
( Josuke gasping )

351
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,000
No, please don’t!
I’m begging you!

352
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,400
just hurry up,
and shoot your next air missile!

353
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,270
Point the damn thing at me,
and shoot! Come on! Do it!

354
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,670
kira: Really, now.
There’s no need to be hasty

355
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,040
and end the fun so quickly,
is there?

356
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,510
Josuke higashikata,

357
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,980
I think i’ll observe you
a little while longer

358
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,280
and then decide
if I should obliterate you.

359
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,580
( Josuke growls )

360
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,680
kira: Besides,
you honestly have no real proof

361
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,990
I turned okuyasu
into a bomb at all.

362
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,490
It might be possible to heal him
with shining diamond.

363
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,420
I could be overstepping here,
but at this point

364
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,490
it would appear you have
only one course of action

365
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,460
if you want to save okuyasu.

366
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,070
You must heal him
by way of touching him.

367
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,470
( Josuke shuddering )

368
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,240
Kira: I don’t envy
the position you’re in.

369
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,140
If he is a human bomb,

370
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,610
touching him with
shining diamond may kill you,

371
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,940
but okuyasu
would be spared the fate

372
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,180
of exploding into oblivion.

373
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,180
If you heal your dear friend’s
critical injuries,

374
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,190
at least your sacrifice
won’t have been in vain.

375
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,720
hayato: No!
Don’t touch him, josuke!

376
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,520
kira: I’ll wait
until you’ve made your decision.

377
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,330
do you save
your best friend’s life,

378
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,530
or do you just attack me
and let him die?

379
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,630
( Josuke shuddering )

380
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,200
Kira: Wow. I’m content to wait
until you make a decision,

381
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,100
but it seems you’re averse
to touching your friend,

382
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,340
even when it means
keeping him alive.

383
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,670
( Josuke shuddering )

384
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,440
Hayato: I have proof
touching him is deadly!

385
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,250
I know for a fact that kira’s

386
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,550
only able to control
one bomb at a time.

387
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,320
once he’s activated
one of his freaky bomb things,

388
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,720
it’s impossible for him
to fire off the next one

389
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,490
until the first
has been detonated!

390
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,190
think about it!
He only used one at a time!

391
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,060
Why wouldn’t he launch
a bunch at once?

392
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,760
He’s made okuyasu into a bomb,
so he can’t shoot now!

393
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,030
josuke: Are you
trying to make a point?

394
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,740
Hayato: The point is there’s
still a way to save okuyasu,

395
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,240
but someone needs to touch him.

396
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,540
- ( Kira grumbles )
- ( Hayato sighs )

397
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,080
kira: Hmm?
Deadly queen, bomb switch on!

398
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,150
Hayato: And that someone
has gotta be me!

399
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,650
- ( Switch clicks )
- ( All gasp )

400
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,520
Josuke: Hayato, you--

401
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,260
now I get it! Shining diamond!

402
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,230
( Shining diamond yelling )

403
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,470
Josuke: You’re one
crazy-ass s.O.B., hayato!

404
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,600
It took some major balls
to set off the bomb like that.

405
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,740
you sure
you’re a grade schooler,

406
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,670
’cause that was badass!

407
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,510
Hayato: Yeah, well, I couldn’t
just stand around doing nothing,

408
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,050
and I knew
you had the power to heal me.

409
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,680
i refuse to let
any more innocent people die!

410
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,120
Besides, if you’re gone,

411
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,790
he’ll off me
in the blink of an eye,

412
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,720
and he’ll be free to do
whatever he wants.

413
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,290
It’s just a matter of time
before he kills my mom,

414
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,490
and then he’ll go after
more people in this town!

415
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,590
Kira: But, first, you die,

416
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,800
though your power
is certainly an issue.

417
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,360
To think your stand

418
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,100
can reverse my destructive acts
in mere seconds.

419
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,640
I’d almost forgotten how much

420
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,340
that annoying healing ability
of yours vexes me utterly.

421
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,810
Deadly queen!

422
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,310
Hayato: Josuke,
he’s gonna shoot!

423
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,280
( Josuke gasps )

424
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,650
Kira: It’ll detonate on impact,

425
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,190
so you’ll have
no opportunity to guard.

426
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,690
then again,
you could sidestep the explosive

427
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,660
if you happen to see it,
so i’ve launched one

428
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,230
so small it’s
almost impossible to detect.

429
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,830
With okuyasu on your back and
those painful shrapnel wounds,

430
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,300
can you really dodge
a projectile?

431
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,500
Hayato: Just get the hell
out of there, josuke!

432
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,440
If the explosion so much
as brushes against you,

433
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,440
you’ll be a dead man!

434
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,670
Josuke: I healed you.

435
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,680
Why haven’t you woken up yet?

436
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,680
Open those beady eyes! Okuyasu!

437
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,450
Hayato: The bomb’s on its way!
Move it!

438
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,250
Kira: Only eight more meters
until impact.

439
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,890
josuke: All right,
enough goofing around, buddy,

440
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,690
it’s time to wake up now!
You’re as good as new, okuyasu!

441
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,690
Hayato: Josuke, please!

442
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,360
Kira: Seven meters to go.

443
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,590
josuke:
Don’t you leave me, dick!

444
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,690
Open your damn eyes! Hey!

445
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,700
Come on, man. Quit napping,
and open your freakin’ eyes!

446
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,830
Hey! If you wake up,
we can knock the shit

447
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,700
out of this asshole,
just like we always do!

448
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,810
Hayato: Josuke, go!

449
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,470
Kira: Like Joe Montana

450
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,180
throwing the touchdown pass
of a winning game,

451
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,510
i’ll detonate the sucker
in the perfect position

452
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,650
and go home victorious.

453
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,720
Four meters until impact.

454
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,720
Hayato: Go! Right now!

455
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,590
You’ve gotta run for it,
or it’s gonna hit you dead-on!

456
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,920
I’m so sorry about okuyasu,
but he’s already--

457
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,520
josuke: No! Don’t say it!

458
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,160
The only one of us who needs
to run here is you, kid!

459
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,830
Kira: Two meters ’til showtime.

460
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,430
With a three-meter radius,

461
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,730
they’re sure to die
in the explosion.

462
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,470
♪

463
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,900
hayato: I can see it!
It’s two meters in front of you,

464
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,470
and it’s closing in fast!

465
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,440
You’ve gotta run now!
Listen to me, josuke!

466
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,480
Okuyasu’s gone! He’s dead!
Accept it already!

467
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,450
Josuke: He’s nowhere
near dead, damn it!

468
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,910
He’s back in top form,

469
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,820
and he’ll open his eyes
any minute now!

470
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,820
Kira: Yes. Just one more meter,

471
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,690
and then pop goes the riffraff.

472
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,590
Hayato: Josuke!

473
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,590
( Josuke yells )

474
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,560
Shining diamond: Dora!

475
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,470
Hayato: Holy heck! It was
ruptured by a blade of blood!

476
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,200
did josuke somehow
take his blood and propel it

477
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,840
with so much force
that it cut like a knife?

478
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,340
Oh, yeah. It’s just like
that time in the attic!

479
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,940
The air shackles deflated

480
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,480
when I punctured them
with the compass needle!

481
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,750
kira: He used
the blood from his wound

482
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,350
like a water jet cutter. Hmph.

483
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,520
And he severed the bullet
clean through.

484
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,890
nice try,
but it didn’t do you any good.

485
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,260
Hayato: You gotta move!
They didn’t deflate!

486
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,400
Kira: This improvised
air bullet explosive

487
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,670
is stabilized by deadly queen,

488
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,530
so it won’t deflate.

489
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,300
You can split it, smash it,
or dice it to pieces,

490
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,640
but i’m pleased to say the bomb
will never lose its power.

491
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,810
and now back to our
regularly scheduled explosion.

492
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,380
( Hayato screams )

493
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,350
Kira: Touchdown.

494
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,520
Hayato: The heck’s goin’ on?

495
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,420
He’s floating?

496
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,750
- Kira: Explode.
- ( Switch clicks )

497
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,420
Hayato: No, this isn’t floating.

498
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,260
Whoa! Ahh!

499
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,230
Josuke: Hmm?

500
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,300
Hayato: Eh?

501
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,930
Josuke: Shining diamond
won’t allow me to heal myself,

502
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,740
which, to be frank,
would come in handy right now.

503
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,670
But when it comes
to pieces of road,

504
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,640
like the ones that got lodged
in me from the first blast,

505
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,880
that’s a whole different story!

506
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,780
hayato: Whoa.
What a super neat idea,

507
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,280
using the road to pull you up!

508
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,620
Josuke: I’m out of options.
We don’t live here,

509
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,290
but it’ll work
as our safe house for now.

510
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,860
Hayato: Uh, please,
you have to leave okuyasu!

511
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,830
If you keep carrying him around,
you’re gonna get killed!

512
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,990
He’ll find a way to corner you,
and that’ll be it!

513
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,330
Josuke: I asked you
to keep quiet, so drop it!

514
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,470
Okuyasu and I have a connection.

515
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,040
He’s my friend.
I won’t abandon him.

516
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,640
Hayato: No, that’s not
what i’m trying to say!

517
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,840
By the time you healed okuyasu,
he was already DEA--

518
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,310
josuke: Enough!

519
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,080
Enough. Not another word.
i mean it.

520
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,750
Hayato: You gotta focus
your energy on beating Kira!

521
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,780
( Gasps )

522
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,580
( Thumping )

523
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,790
Kira: How irksome.

524
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,320
That blasted ability to correct,

525
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,990
without it,
my bomb would be unstoppable.

526
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,060
I see now that the greatest
obstacle standing in the way

527
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,000
of my attaining peace
and tranquility isn’t jotaro.

528
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,900
It’s him...

529
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,670
