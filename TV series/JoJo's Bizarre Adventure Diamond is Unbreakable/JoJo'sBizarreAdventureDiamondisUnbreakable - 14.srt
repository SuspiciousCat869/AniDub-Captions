an invisible baby yesterday,

with anything else.

he lives alone.

Hazamada: Uh, Mr. Rohan?

162
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,630
Rohan: I see.

163
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,770
Hello, araneus ventricosus.

164
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,940
It inhabits homes and
rural areas across Japan.

165
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,940
It’s an orb-weaving spider,

166
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,410
and a number of them
weave webs day and night. Huh.

167
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,080
By the way, you two, do you know

168
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,910
what it takes to create
captivating stories for manga?

169
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,910
Both: Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

170
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,650
Rohan: Reality.

171
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,150
Reality is the driving force

172
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,650
that makes a drawing
come totally alive.

173
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,960
it’s entertainment
on the highest possible level.

174
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,060
People assume manga is born
of imagination and fantasy,

175
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,430
but they couldn’t be more wrong.

176
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,830
A great manga is one
that captures things

177
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,870
experienced, seen, and felt
by flesh-and-blood beings.

178

- ( Hazamada gasps )
- Koichi: Huh?

179
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,540
rohan: Take this
exquisite spider, for example,

180
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,470
something a typical city-dweller
would kill in disgust.

181
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,510
The way the legs
connect to the body

182
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,480
and the positions
of its many eyes,

183
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,980
even subtle differences
between the male and female--

184
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,550
a manga artist must understand

185
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,680
each of these elements
to draw a spider.

186
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,050
It’s said a spider’s silk
solidifies when exposed to air,

187
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,960
but have you ever given
any thought to its spinnerets?

188
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,730
- ( Both yelp )
- Rohan: And then there’s

189
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,200
the intricate arrangement
of its internal organs.

190
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,160
How does a spider squirm,

191
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
especially when it’s
been sliced open

192
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,500
and awaiting certain death?

193
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,770
To depict reality in detail,
one must know such things.

194
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Koichi: That’s barbaric!

195
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,180
rohan: Silence!
How dare an amateur like you

196
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,480
give Rohan kishibe
his opinion?!

197
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,850
Koichi: No, I wasn’t
voicing my opinion at all!

198
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,950
- i’m sorry.
- ( Hazamada gasps )

199
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,780
Rohan: Now it’s time
for a taste.

200
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,460
( Koichi gasps )
Holy shit.

201
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,960
The stereotype is true.

202
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,190
manga artists
really are total weirdoes.

203
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,900
Rohan: An excellent
expression of agony.

204
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,900
Your vomiting reflex is so raw,
I simply must sketch it!

205
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,870
Hazamada: Really?

206
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,240
( Gags )

207
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,010
rohan: And now
you’re just pretending.

208
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,080
Eh, let’s forget
about the sketch.

209
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,680
It won’t be of any use.

210
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,720
Hazamada: Oh. I’m sorry.

211
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,820
You wanted autographs.

212
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,820
I’ll see if I can find a pen
in the kitchen.

213
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,490
I’ll bring some tea out as well.

214
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,820
Hazamada: You don’t
have to do that.

215
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,560
( Gasps )

216
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,660
Rohan is great. What a process.

217
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,000
Now I know what makes
"pink dark boy" so amazing.

218
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,670
His need to know every single
detail is on another level.

219
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,970
- Koichi: Um, hazamada...
- hazamada: Eh?

220
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,140

and all, but, well, uh,

221
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,940
don’t you think it’s about time
for us to get going?

222
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,910
Hazamada: Say what?
You wanna go home now?

223
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,880
But why? Aren’t you having fun?

224
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,220
Koichi: I can’t really say why
i’m so nervous all of a sudden.

225
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,520
i just have
a bad feeling about this.

226
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,190
My gut has been known to be
wrong on rare occasions,

227
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,960
but right now it’s telling me

228
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,260
that there’s something
really dangerous about Rohan.

229
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,230
Hazamada: Dangerous?
What do you mean by that?

230
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,970
You think he’s a stand user?

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,230
koichi: No, no,
it’s nothing like that.

232
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,970
It’s just a weird feeling.

233
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hazamada: Rohan is what
those hippie artist-types

234
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,740
would call avant-garde,
but that doesn’t mean you should

235
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,910
immediately jump to conclusions
about him being a stand user.

236
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,950
Koichi: I already told you
I don’t think he is one.

237
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,150
I just have a bad feeling,
is all.

238
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,050
Hazamada: Okay, okay,
let’s say Mr. Rohan

239
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,650
actually is a stand user.

240
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,820
That’d be amazing for us,
don’t you think?

241
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,290
How awesome would it be

242
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,060
to have something in common
with a famous manga artist?

243
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,530
But I feel you, so let’s leave.

244
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,230
If something about him’s
giving you the willies,

245
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,060
then let’s go. Come on.

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,980
rohan: I believe
you read my manga as well.

314
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,720
( Hazamada gasps )

315
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,620
( Gasps ) It’s happening to me!

316
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,530
rohan: My ability
won’t physically harm you,

317
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,990
so there’s no need to worry.

318
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,860
Koichi: What the hell do you
even want from us, anyway?!

319
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,700
rohan: In manga,
the creator’s sense of reality

320
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,540
is critical, remember?
We went over that.

321
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,770
So now I will read
all about your lives

322
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,070
and experiences thus far,
and these pages

323
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,780
will fill my consciousness
with realistic ideas.

324
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,940
More effective
than an interview.

325
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,050
you will tell me
everything you’ve lived through

326
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,720
with 100% accuracy,

327
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,650
as if I had been there
to experience it myself.

328
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,920
Koichi hirose. Born march 28th,
1984, at 6:27 A.M.

329
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,630
you were delivered
at red cross hospital in s city.

330
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,430
A preemie, at 2,325 grams,

331
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,600
you spent a week
in an Incubator.

332
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,700
a family of four and
an older sister named Ayana.

333
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,810
Yes, I see. In grade school
and middle school

334
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,040
you led
a relatively ordinary life.

335
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,210
You also happen to be
a remarkably genuine soul,

336
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,150
an admirable quality.

337
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,480
- ( Gasps )
- ( Koichi gasps )

338
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,920
Rohan: What is this?

339
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,650
So then, you’re hiding
a secret ability, are you?

340
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,450
Reverb, huh?!

341
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,060
And it seems that there are
other individuals in the world

342
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,860
with these
fantastical abilities!

343
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,860
- You have powers, too?
- ( Hazamada whimpering )

344
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,560
( Rohan groans )

345
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,200
Stand users, huh? Astounding!

346
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,840
Everything in here
dated after April, 1999,

347
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,470
is just extraordinary,

348
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,040
an explosion
of wondrous experiences!

349
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,140
josuke higashikata,
jotaro kujo, yukako yamagishi,

350
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,180
okuyasu nijimura,
tamami kobayashi.

351
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,180
Oh, it’s unbelievable,
incredible,

352
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,980
and utterly captivating.

353
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,850
In these pages, koichi hirose,
i’ve just uncovered

354
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,960
the mother lode
of manga material.

355
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,660
shining diamond,
star platinum, the hand,

356
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,970
love deluxe,
et cetera, et cetera!

357
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,970
( Koichi yelps )
What are you talking about?

358
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,700
What the heck are you
planning to do to us now?!

359
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,810
Rohan: You mean
it isn’t obvious yet?

360
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,540
I’m going to use your memories
to write my manga!

361
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,540
Koichi: Reverb!

362
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,610
( Rohan sighs )

363
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,480
Koichi: I’m only gonna
ask you nicely once

364
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,780
to stop attacking us
with your stand!

365
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,920
If you persist--

366
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,020
( Rohan chuckles )
What will you do?

367
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,160
Strike me with reverb act two’s
sound attack? Just try it.

368
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,020
( Koichi gasps )
Don’t test me.

369
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,560
If you don’t release me
from your stand right now,

370
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,900
I won’t hold back!
This is your last chance!

371
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,130
Rohan: Yes, I know.
There’s actually a section

372
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,230
devoted to that
written on page 11.

373
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,240
you’ve always been
far more timid than most others,

374
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,910
and many tend
to blatantly disrespect you,

375
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,770
but when push comes to shove,

376
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,010
you find the courage
to conquer your fears.

377
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,850
Remarkable. I like you already.

378
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,250
And as for my readers,

379
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,980
they’ll feel the same
once they get to know you.

380
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,520
Koichi: I’m not bluffing,
you hear me?!

381
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,990
I’ll attack if I have to!

382
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,590
Rohan: You really don’t know
when to shut up, do you?

383
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,790
Try it, if you dare!

384
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,030
Koichi: Reverb act two, go!

385
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,130
♪

386
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,900
I don’t get it!
How’d my attack miss?!

387
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,900
Hazamada: You honestly missed
at that range?

388
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,840
I thought you let it
go wide on purpose!

389
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,610
Hate to break it to you,
but your aim is shit.

390
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,710
( Koichi growls )
I won’t miss this time!

391
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,920
Hazamada: Where are
you attacking?!

392
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,180
That wasn’t even close!

393
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,020
rohan:
Unfortunately for you, koichi,

394
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,890
I took the Liberty of placing
a little safety lock on reverb.

395
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,590
You can attack me
to your heart’s content,

396
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,690
but you’re no longer able
to land a blow.

397
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,230
Hazamada: Safety lock?

398
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,330
( Koichi groans )

399
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,340
rohan: Take a look.
It’s in the margin on page 11.

400
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,610
i added that new rule as
a little bit of a safety measure

401
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,770
just in case
you used your stand.

402
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,740
( Koichi whimpering )

403
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,180
Do you see?

404
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,350
This is the awesome power
of heaven’s door.

405
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,660
Through it, I can
use words and pictures

406
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,930
to read people’s experiences
or create brand-new memories.

407
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,360
It doesn’t matter what sort of
tricks you have up your sleeve.

408
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,060
you’ll never
be able to do me harm

409
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,600
as long as I have this power.

410
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,530
Koichi: Shit!
What do I do now?!

411
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,070
( Rohan laughs )

412
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,570
Chin up, koichi,

413
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,580
that’s all the tampering
i intend to do.

414
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,680
if I meddled
with your pages any further,

415
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,850
your precious life
would lose all authenticity,

416
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,250
and you’d no longer be
of any benefit to my work.

417
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,920
All right, now let’s have a look
at your pages, hazamada.

418
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,260
Hazamada: You’re a genius
in every sense of the word, sir!

419
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,990
I respect you so much!

420
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,730
Rohan: I suppose
we’ll see about that.

421
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,030
Now then, you sometimes
find a sense of comfort

422
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,130
in picking on creatures
weaker than you,

423
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,970
like helpless kittens
and small birds.

424
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,170
You want to have
your way with junko,

425
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,370
a junior from class e,

426
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,240
but are too cowardly
to act on it.

427
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,140
Your testicles
often grow sweaty,

428
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,010
and when you adjust them
during class,

429
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,310
nothing thrills you more

430
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,050
than the thought
that someone might see you.

431
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
You’re a disgusting troll.

432
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,990
Including someone like you
in my manga

433
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,650
would drive readers away.

434
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,290
- ( Hazamada whimpers )
- Rohan: You’re useless.

435
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,030
( Hazamada wails )

436
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,030
What am I gonna do now?!

437
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
I’m hopeless!

438
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,260
- Koichi: Why?
- Rohan: Hmm?

439
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,970
Koichi: Why are you doing this?!

440
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,700
You don’t need any of my
experiences to create stories.

441
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,300
you’re a spectacular
manga artist all on your own!

442
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,640
Every reader in the world
knows that!

443
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,070
Also, you’re only
20 years old

444
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,740
and live in this amazing house!

445
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,110
Think of how blessed you are

446
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,650
compared with most people
your age!

447
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,780
So why do you need my memories

448
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,980
- when you’re already great?!
- ( Rohan growling )

449
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,190
How stupid can you be?!

450
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,050
Do you think that I,
Rohan kishibe,

451
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,290
draw manga to gather money
and admiration?!

452
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,690
I draw manga so that people
around the world will read it.

453
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,200
My only objective is for people
to read my work.

454
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,370
i know it’s
a single, simple reason.

455
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,430
Even so, it’s all I care about.

456
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,070
People want honesty
when they read my work,

457
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,940
so I search for inspirational
realism every day.

458
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,940
And truth be told,
I absolutely love

459
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,940
the feeling
of finishing a manuscript.

460
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,380
Everyone feels good

461
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,410
after finishing a project
they’ve worked hard on,

462
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,720
but that gratification
is fleeting and immaterial.

463
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,850
After the initial rush
of euphoria is gone,

464
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,990
I begin to think no one will
read the manga I slaved over,

465
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,060
and my deep-seated insecurities
begin to flare up.

466
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,230
"What if all my readers
