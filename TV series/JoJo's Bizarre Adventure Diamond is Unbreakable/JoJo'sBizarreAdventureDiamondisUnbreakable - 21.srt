I drink a warm glass of milk.

470
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,630
it’s always coupled
with 20 minutes of stretching

471
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,530
to decompress
from the long workday.

472
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,900
sweet dreams are
the usual result of this.

473
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,300
Shigechi: Eh...

474
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,930
Kira: I then awake as refreshed

475
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,800
and recharged
as a newborn child,

476
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,800
ready to take on
the day’s challenges.

477
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,870
And after my last checkup, I was
given a clean bill of health.

478
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,980
shigechi: Hey,
what’s the big idea, creeper?

479
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,840
Why are telling me this crap?

480
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,610
Kira: For as long
as I can remember,

481
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,980
i’ve done everything in my power
to live a productive life

482
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,720
that allows me to pursue
a lasting, inner peace.

483
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,490
This may be a foreign concept,

484
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,560
but I choose not to concern
myself with winning or losing,

485
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,960
life’s troubles, or enemies
who bring sleepless nights.

486
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,530
That is how I cope

487
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,760
with this backwards life
we find ourselves living.

488
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,670
It’s what brings me happiness

489
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,730
in a world fraught
with hardship and misery.

490
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,340
Of course, if I were
ever to engage in combat,

491
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,870
I would win the battle
without question.

492
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,840
( Shigechi gasping )

493
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,950
Kira: In other words, shigechi,
you are an irksome troublemaker

494
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,890
who stands to hinder my sleep.

495
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,620
You, boy, are the enemy.

496
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,630
( Shigechi gasps ) That’s...

497
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,030
Kira: Deadly queen.

498
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,900
I named it myself,

499
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,530
and truth be told,
i’m quite proud of the moniker.

500
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,540
But before you have the chance
to utter a word of this

501
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,610
to another soul,
I shall eradicate you.

502
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,740
I’ll sleep soundly tonight.

503
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,540
I can already feel it.
