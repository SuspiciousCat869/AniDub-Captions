00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,150
The stand just laughed, josuke!

162
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,150
Did you hear that?!

163
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,480
It’s right there!

164
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,980
You can see it in the sand!

165
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,950
josuke: Yeah,
there’s no way in hell

166
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,790
i’m letting him meet mom now,

167
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,960
not when he’s seeing
and hearing things.

168
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,630
Joseph: If it weren’t for
all this dag-blasted concrete,

169
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,730
i could find it.
Where’d it go? It vanished!

170
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,160
Why did you disappear?!

171
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,600
Come back!

172
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,500
( Josuke gasps ) Great.

173
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,940
this old man
is nothing but trouble.

174
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,510
( Dog growling )

175
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,470
Joseph: Eh?

176
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,580
- ( Gasps )
- ( Dog snarls )

177
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,810
Joseph: Hermit purple!

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,020
( Josuke gasps )

179
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,690
Joseph: Ohh!

180
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,920
- ( Child crying )
- Josuke: Huh?!

181
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,220
( Dog barking )

182
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,520
Joseph: Beat it, mutt.

183
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,030
Go on. Shoo, shoo! Get!

184
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Josuke: Hey, uh, am I crazy,
or is that crying?

185
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,800
- ( Crying continues )
- Joseph: Over here, josuke.

186
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,870
Josuke: Hmm?

187
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,970
Joseph: It’s just a baby.

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,910
I’m holding a tiny,
naked baby in my hands.

189
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,870
I know it sounds strange,
but it’s invisible.

190
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,180
Josuke: What?!

191
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,140
( Crying continues )

192
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,850
( Josuke stammering )

193
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,020
It’s hard to believe,
but you’re right.

194
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,950
I can feel its soft skin.

195
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,220
How’s this even possible?

196
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,690
A bona fide invisible baby!

197
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,030
Joseph: From what I can tell,

198
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,230
it can’t be any older
than six months.

199
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,000
Josuke: I wanna know
how it turned invisible

200
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,570
in the first place,
and how’d it get out here?

201
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,270
i’m guessing
it’s the work of a stand,

202
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,270
but why on earth
would an enemy stand user

203
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,740
turn a baby invisible?

204
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,880
And where the hell
is this kid’s mother?

205
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,610
Nothing about this
makes any sense.

206
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,680
Joseph: Huh.

207
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,620
Hey, josuke, call me crazy,

208
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,750
but I think the baby
is the stand user.

209
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,050
- Josuke: What?
- Joseph: Yeah,

210
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,250
it just isn’t aware
of its abilities yet.

211
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,120
Whenever it was separated
from its mother,

212
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,160
the poor little thing
must have turned invisible

213
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,230
- based on pure instinct.
- josuke: Huh?

214
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,160
Joseph: Duress in adults
can trigger ulcers,

215
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,300
hair loss,
and premature graying,

216
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,970
but in the case of this baby,
it’s activated its stand powers.

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,610
If we can find its mother,

218
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
I think we might be able
to solve this.

219
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,040
( Baby crying )

220
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,680
Josuke: Aw, freakin’ great.

221
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,710
Well, don’t just stand there.
Make it stop crying.

222
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,080
Joseph: I, uh, don’t exactly
know how to do that.

223
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,220
I have a little bit
of experience with this,

224
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,290
but that was a long time ago.

225
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,690
There, there.
Coochie-coochie coo.

226
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
Ahh! So that’s where it is.

227
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,960
Josuke: Eh?! Well,
is it a boy or a girl?

228
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,330
Joseph: Yep, this hand
has never let me down.

229
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,730
( Josuke gasps )

230
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,930
Joseph: Hmm.

231
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,870
I’m pleased to say
it’s a girl.

232
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,240
Josuke: Oh, I get it.

233
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,100
That’s why you had
to use your hand, right?

234
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,340
How else could you tell?

235
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,170
( Both yelling )

236
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,710
( Joseph yelps )

237
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,380
Josuke: There something else
I should know about?

238
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,280
Joseph: Josuke...

239
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,050
Do you have any tissues?

240
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,120
Josuke: Eh? ( Sniffs )

241
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,080
Ugh!

242
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,890
Th-that nauseating smell,

243
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,020
why the hell
is it coming from your hand?

244
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,390
Are you saying she--

245
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,960
Joseph: Yeah. I had no idea
she’d even done it

246
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,700
until I got
a noseful of nasty,

247
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,000
and I just finished scratching
my beard with this hand.

248
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,870
( Baby babbles )

249
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,110
man: Here.
I’m returning your manuscript.

250
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,980
I’m looking forward
to the revisions

251
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,980
on the second draft.
Do your best.

252
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,150
Josuke: We’re stuck
with her for now,

253
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,120
so it looks like we’ll need
to pick up formula and diapers,

254
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,220
and since we don’t want her
going au naturel,

255
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,720
she needs some clothes.

256
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,720
♪

257
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,030
I’m counting on you,
mr. Joestar.

258
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,300
Joseph: What? You want me
to buy everything?

259
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,260
Josuke: Yeah.
I can’t go in there.

260
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,930
you have any idea
how that would look to people?

261
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,670
somebody could walk by
and catch me buying baby stuff.

262
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,370
People would start to talk.

263
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,370
They’d see me as some
stupid 16-year-old bad boy

264
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,340
who knocked up some poor chick.

265
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,310
Joseph: Okay, I see your point,

266
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,280
but I only have American
traveler’s checks at the moment.

267
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,720
( Josuke groans )
I guess I have no choice.

268
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,290
Put whatever you buy
on my card.

269
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,020
Joseph: Sorry.

270
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,990
josuke: Stay away
from all the expensive stuff!

271
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,220
I’ve worked my ass off

272
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
to build up
that little nest egg. Got it?

273
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,700
joseph:
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

274
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,630
shopkeeper:
Welcome, my good sir.

275
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,300
is there something
I can assist you with today?

276
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,140
Joseph: Possibly. Do you have
disposable diapers here?

277
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,040
shopkeeper:
You bet your bonnet we do.

278
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,310
Is this your first time?

279
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,640
Joseph: Hmm? Well, yeah,
i suppose it is.

280
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,810
Shopkeeper: These diapers
are a cinch to change,

281
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,680
even for customers able to live
at home without assistance.

282
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,150
You’ll rest well with these.

283
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,050
( Joseph stammers )

284
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,790
No. Uh, the diapers
aren’t for me.

285
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,290
They’re for a baby
i’m looking after.

286
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,860
Shopkeeper: Goodness!
I’m sorry. How rude of me.

287
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,930
Of course they’re for a baby.

288
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,860
- ( Laughs )
- ( Joseph sighs )

289
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,400
Shopkeeper: First off, would you
like traditional diapers

290
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,170
or maybe training pants?

291
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,240
Joseph: Hmm? Beg your pardon?

292
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,970
Shopkeeper: As you can see,
although traditional diapers

293
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,310
require a cover,
they’re far more economical

294
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,380
and less wasteful
than training pants.

295
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,180
joseph:
Well, i’m not really sure.

296
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,980
Can I just have this one
right here?

297
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,780
shopkeeper:
And what size would you like?

298
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,380
Joseph: What do you mean?

299
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,250
shopkeeper:
How old is the baby, sir?

300
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,020
Depending on your child’s
unique shape,

301
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,030
we have preemies, small, medium,
large, and extra large.

302
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,860
And not to worry, we have
diapers for boys and girls.

303
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,360
You can’t go wrong.

304
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,930
Joseph: In my day, picking
these out was a lot easier.

305
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,100
Joseph: Let’s see.
I know that she’s a girl,

306
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,170
and when I held her,
she was about this big,

307
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,270
give or take an inch.

308
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,810
Shopkeeper: When you held her?

309
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,270
I’m afraid I don’t follow you.

310
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,080
And I don’t want to run the risk

311
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,380
of you returning
ill-fitting soiled diapers.

312
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,750
I’m sure you can understand
the problem with that.

313
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,020
joseph: Yeah,
I completely understand.

314
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,190
Guess i’ll grab
every size you have.

315
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,420
In addition to that,
I need baby wipes,

316
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,060
instant formula,
and baby bottles.

317
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,520
Shopkeeper: Well, then,
you are in luck.

318
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,130
We carry both glass
and plastic baby bottles.

319
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,830
Glass bottles tend to be
scratch- and odor-resistant,

320
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,800
but can be heavy
for a baby’s arms to hold.

321
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,200
Plastic bottles may be light,

322
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,370
but they have
a tendency to trap odors.

323
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,070
Which of the two
would you like today?

324
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,170
Joseph: Uh, let’s see.

325
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,280
I guess i’ll take the one with--

326
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,410
shopkeeper: We also carry

327
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,950
an assortment
of shapes and designs.

328
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,250
We have rocket ships,
racing cars, and--

329
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,080
ooh, the baby could
hold this one by itself.

330
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,050
and when you
turn this one upside down,

331
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,520
the doll does
a delightful little dance.

332
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,890
It’s so adorable.

333
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,390
joseph:
Uh, I really don’t know,

334
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,090
so would you mind picking out
a few and calling it a day?

335
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,800
Shopkeeper: But you
haven’t seen our nipples.

336
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,460
The rubber ones
are soft and supple,

337
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,100
but they lack durability.

338
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,870
Silicone nipples are resilient,

339
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,270
but they tend to be so stiff.

340
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,110
This is our "choopa trainer."

341
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,840
There’s a diaphragm valve
in the nipple,

342
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,380
and when its coupled
with the baby’s

343
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,940
own suckling pressure,
it regulates the flow of milk

344
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,110
so the little one
gets the right amount.

345
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,520
this is the nuk,
a brand made in Germany.

346
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,180
It’s compressed into an oval

347
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,890
so the nipple can mimic
the mother’s natural shape.

348
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,890
And just as if the mother was
nursing the old-fashioned way,

349
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,390
the milk won’t flow
without the baby’s jaw movement.

350
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,190
joseph:
Oh, uh, i’m sure they’ll do.

351
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,000
I trust your judgment
on this stuff.

352
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,030
I’ll take them all.

353
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,000
We also carry nipple openings

354
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,230
in the circular, y-,
and cross-shaped varieties.

355
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,240
( Joseph grumbles )

356
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,170
Just give me everything.
And while you’re at it,

357
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,810
I need some baby clothes
and socks, too.

358
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,550
Oh, before I forget,
i’ll be paying by card.

359
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,350
shopkeeper:
Thank you very much, sir.

360
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,050
( Cash register rings )

361
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,090
Joseph: 136,000?

362
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
Now, what would the exchange
rate be in American dollars?

363
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,060
if i’m not mistaken,
you move the decimal point--

364
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,260
or rather,
100 yen is about 80 cents.

365
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,170
well, in any case,
it’s all for a good cause,

366
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,270
and it’s just
a bunch of baby stuff.

367
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,500
Really, how expensive

368
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,470
could a couple
of rug-rat essentials be?

369
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,910
Josuke: What is the holdup?

370
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,380
He’s taking forever.

371
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,880
We don’t have all day.

372
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,410
- Girl: By the way...
- Girl #2: Huh?

373
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,580
Girl #1: What happened with
the girl who got proposed to?

374
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,120
Does no reply mean
she’s not interested

375
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,390
or mulling things over?

376
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,020
Girl #2: I’d say the second one.

377
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,890
( Joseph gasps ) I can’t
take much more of this.

378
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,160
If someone from class sees me
here, it’s not gonna end well.

379
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,230
Joseph: Sorry to keep you
waiting, josuke.

380
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,960
- Here. Thanks for the loan.
- Josuke: Yeah, great.

381
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,970
Now let’s get going
while the getting’s good.

382
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,370
( Baby cooing )

383
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,010
josuke: Now we don’t
have to worry about losing her,

384
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,080
but there’s still a problem.
Without a face,

385
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,910
she’s gonna freak out everyone
she comes in contact with.

386
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,910
Joseph: I’m way ahead
of you, josuke.

387
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,620
I picked out some makeup
while I was at that store.

388
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,590
first she needs a dab
of foundation there and there.

389
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,620
Ugh!

390
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,190
( Baby cooing )

391
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,630
Josuke: Well, what do you know?

392
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,060
She’s actually pretty cute
when you can see her.

393
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,030
Joseph: Yeah, you’re right,
a vision of beauty.

394
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,270
Joseph: Good idea. This just
made finding her mother

395
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,440
a hell of a lot easier.

396
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,400
We might actually pull this off.

397
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,140
Consider me impressed.

398
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,640
Nice one, Mr. Joestar.

399
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,480
Joseph: I’m glad
I could help out.

400
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,610
Now then, it’s time we put on
the little lady’s lipstick.

401
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,450
a few strokes
for her brows and lashes,

402
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,950
a little here, and...

403
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,950
( Baby cooing )

404
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,720
Josuke: Why am I not surprised?

405
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,590
Toss a bit of flattery his way,

406
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,390
and the old man’s
walking on air.

407
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,990
Joseph: With your new makeover,

408
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,490
we can walk around without
attracting any attention.

409
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,900
And since we can’t
exactly powder your eyes,

410
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,170
sunglasses should do the trick.

411
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,600
( Baby cooing )

412
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,000
Joseph: Now she’s even cuter.
( Laughs )

413
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,300
josuke:
Here’s some milk for her.

414
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,280
Joseph: Hmm. Do you think I went
too light on the foundation?

415
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,510
It doesn’t seem
to be sticking to her.

416
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,550
Josuke: Huh? ( Gasps )

417
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,380
( Baby laughs )

418
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,650
Josuke: No, that’s not it.

419
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,390
Joseph: What the hell?
She’s fading out!

420
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,590
( Josuke gasps )

421
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,720
Joseph: She’s gone!

422
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,720
And my hands went with her!

423
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,190
Josuke: This is horrible!

424
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,130
she can make
other things invisible!

425
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,500
That means no solid object
is safe from her.

426
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,730
Joseph: Eh? What now?

427
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,600
Josuke: Mr. Joestar,
drop the baby!

428
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,130
Let go of it, damn it!

429
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,140
Hurry, before she
turns the rest of you.

430
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,970
( Baby crying )

431
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,710
Joseph: What? I let go,
but they’re still invisible.

432
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,480
Josuke: I think
she’s powering up.

433
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,980
( Baby crying )

434
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,380
( Both gasp )

435
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,360
( Thump )

436
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,120
Joseph: Uh...

437
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,060
Josuke: What are we
supposed to do?

438
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,030
anything that gets
within a 30-centimeter radius

439
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,030
of the baby is gonna be
turned completely invisible.

440
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,700
none of this
is making any sense.

441
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,440
She can’t be trying to protect
herself with her stand.

442
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,440
No one could take care of her
if she did.

443
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,240
something else
must be going on here.

444
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,240
Joseph: It seems like the effect
is triggered by anxiety.

445
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,750
- josuke: Eh?
- Joseph: Stress is the culprit.

446
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,650
Clearly, she doesn’t
like to be handled

447
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,050
by people she doesn’t know.

448
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,650
Josuke: And if she
powers up any more,

449
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,790
then no one
will be able to get near her.

450
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,560
We’ll end up invisible, too.

451
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,090
( Man humming a tune )

452
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,290
hmm?! Whoa,
what a weird heap of junk.

453
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,160
Someone better pick that up.

454
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,160
Oh, well, not my problem.

455
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,270
Someone else can do it.

456
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,500
Joseph: Yah! Look out.

457
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,200
( Clatter )

458
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,370
Josuke: Huh?

459
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,470
( Joseph groans )

460
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,640
Josuke: Hey, what happened?

461
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,610
joseph:
Somebody flicked a cigarette--

462
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
oh, you can’t see it.

463
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,780
( Both gasp )

464
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,420
Josuke: What the hell
are you doing, Mr. Joestar?!

465
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,720
Joseph: Huh?

466
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,390
josuke: Either get
with the program, old man,

467
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,690
or get out of the way!

468
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,190
Joseph: Oh, I didn’t know.

469
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,490
Sorry for the trouble.

470
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,400
( Baby wailing )

471
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,130
( Josuke gasps )

472
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,430
The stroller outright vanished,

473
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,340
and it took the ground with it.

474
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,140
He was right, it is stress.

475
