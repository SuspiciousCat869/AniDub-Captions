319
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,380
( Yells )

320
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,080
( Shining diamond yells )

321
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,720
( Josuke grunting )

322
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,390
Bastard!

323
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,290
I won’t let you stop me
when i’m so close.

324
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,060
I swear i’m gonna kick
your ass into oblivion,

325
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,490
even if it kills me!

326
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,060
( Groans )

327
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,270
Women: Hmm?

328
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,670
Josuke: There you are.

329
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,270
I hope you’re ready, asshole,

330
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,170
’cause when I make it
to that bed,

331
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,040
i’m gonna beat you
within an inch of your...

332
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,450
Woman: Who the hell does
this douche bag think he is?

333
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,320
Woman #2: How dare you
waltz into this room
without permission?!

334
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,120
Woman #3: This is
yu’s room, idiot!

335
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,050
Yuya: Leave that loser alone.

336
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,220
Women: Huh?

337
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,160
Yuya: You don’t
look so hot, pal.

338
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,620
I thought it had been a while

339
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,260
since that first guy
in the tunnel

340
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,490
gave me his nutrients,

341
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,030
but now I know
what was holding up my meal.

342
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,530
- ( Josuke panting )
- Yuya: So you’re the second sap

343
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,040
i’ve been chasing around, huh?

344
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,070
Making it this far
is commendable.

345
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,370
I’m kinda shocked, actually.

346
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,340
Woman #2: Wait a minute. You
know who this guy is, yu-baby?

347
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,580
- Yuya: Huh?
- ( Josuke groans )

348
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,180
( Panting )

349
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,580
yuya: Not at all.
I’ve never seen the guy before.

350
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,190
Couldn’t care less who he is.

351
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,390
( Josuke groans )

352
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,690
Yuya: Nice goin’, highway go go.

353
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,290
that’s just
what the doctor ordered.

354
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,030
Now if I can just get ahold

355
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
of a few more suckers
like this dude,

356
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,000
i’ll be able to make
a full recovery in no time.

357
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,270
Woman #1: Get up!

358
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,600
Woman #2: Didn’t you
hear her, buster?

359
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,140
Get your ass up,
and get out of here!

360
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,010
Yuya: The question is, did you
hear me?! Leave him alone!

361
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,280
Stop wasting your time
with that guy,

362
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,010
and give me some
of that sweet, sweet lovin’.

363
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,620
You didn’t forget about
li’l old hurt me, did you?

364
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,490
i need to take
the piss of a lifetime,

365
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,020
and i’m not sure how
much longer I can hold it in.

366
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,520
Woman #3: Ooh! Looks like it’s
time for me to get to work!

367
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,260
Woman #2: What do you
think you’re doing?

368
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,630
We all agreed to take turns!
It’s my turn to do it!

369
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,630
Woman #1: Hey, I haven’t
gotten to do it yet!

370
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
Yuya: It doesn’t matter
who does it, ladies.

371
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,170
Just bring out that piss bottle,
and give me a hand.

372
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,000
- Woman #2: Okay!
- ( Woman #1 groans )

373
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,140
Then i’ll be over here.

374
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,140
Woman #3: Eh?

375
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,370
- Yuya: Hey, akemi.
- Akemi: Hmm?

376
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,180
Yuya: The peach you’re holding
has gone bad,

377
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,050
so use another one, ’kay, babe?

378
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,250
Akemi: Sure, but how did
you know it was rotten?

379
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,050
Yuya: What do you mean? I can
smell that thing over here.

380
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,550
Any idiot could tell
it was rotten.

381
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,450
Akemi: You smelled it
from there?

382
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,620
Yuya: You know,
you have a point.

383
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,420
My sense of smell must
have gotten better lately.

384
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,260
Akemi: Hey, you’re right.

385
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,260
- It’s rotten.
- ( Yuya chuckles )

386
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,260
( Sniffs )

387
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,300
If my nose is correct,

388
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,570
one of you beauties
is on your period.

389
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
I’m right, aren’t I? Who is it?

390
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,670
- Woman #2: Um...
- ( Yuya laughs )

391
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,980
- So it’s you, yoshie!
- ( Yoshie squeals )

392
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,740
yuya: I hit the nail
on the head. And what’s this?

393
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,180
someone in here
is getting really pissed off.

394
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,480
( Sniffs ) When agitated,
the body produces adrenaline,

395
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,750
and one of you girls

396
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,190
has discharged
quite the pungent secretion.

397
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,660
Are you the grumpy gertrude,
reiko, dear?

398
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,530
Reiko: No, it’s not me.
I’m as happy as a clam, baby.

399
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,260
Yoshie: We’re all just happy

400
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,530
that you’re feeling like
your old self again, snuggums!

401
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,930
Akemi: Yeah, we’ve all been
waiting for this moment.

402
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
we couldn’t be mad
if we wanted to right now.

403
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,470
Yuya: Now, now, honeys,
tell the truth. ( Sniffs )

404
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,610
Somebody in this room
is downright furious.

405
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,210
I can smell it
loud and clear!

406
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,210
( Women gasp )

407
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,010
Yuya: You better not be fibbing.

408
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,610
One of you is about to pop,
so tell me who it is.

409
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,610
Josuke: It’s me.

410
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,420
Yuya: Eh? Huh?

411
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,220
Josuke: That full-bodied odor
you’re whiffing

412
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,620
is courtesy
of yours truly, you dick!

413
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,220
Yuya: That’s bullshit!

414
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,390
your body should be
a nutritional wasteland by now!

415
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,290
How in the hell
are you standing?

416
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,430
Josuke: It’s simple.

417
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,460
( Yuya gasps )

418
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,730
You were suckin’ down my I.V.
Like a malnourished vampire!

419
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,040
Josuke: Calm down.
It was just a taste.

420
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,470
Even so, it was enough
to perk me up a bit.

421
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,470
( Groaning )

422
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,710
Rohan...

423
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,650
You’re holding him
captive in the tunnel,

424
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,480
but that’s about to end.

425
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,980
( Yuya laughs )
You imbecilic numb-nut!

426
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,350
it’s like
you’ve totally forgotten

427
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,250
that highway go go
has your scent!

428
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,120
Shining diamond: Dora!

429
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,120
( Yuya screams )

430
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,560
Women: Yu, baby!

431
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,360
Josuke: I don’t wanna hear
a peep out of you three!

432
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,960
You can call me
josuke higashikata,

433
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,500
and my stand is known
as shining diamond.

434
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,570
i’m limited
to close-range attacks,

435
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,670
but I can assure you
my punching speed

436
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,040
is a lot faster than 60 k.M.H.

437
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,710
I’ve never measured,
but if i’m close enough,

438
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,940
i’m sure I can get
to about 300 k.M.H.

439
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,450
Yuya: You just
stay away from me!

440
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,050
I know by now you’ve heard

441
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,080
that my back
has been broken to pieces!

442
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,950
My arms and legs
are fractured, too!

443
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,290
I can’t even roll over
to scratch my ass!

444
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,690
Are you really gonna slap around

445
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,990
a feeble, bedridden
hospital patient?

446
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,230
- ( Josuke growls )
- ( Yuya chuckles )

447
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,090
All right, I admit it.
i was a jerk.

448
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,600
but if you let me go,
i’ll free the guy in the tunnel.

449
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,430
I think he’s still alive,

450
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,430
though it certainly wouldn’t
hurt to give him some nutrients.

451
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
- So do we have a deal or what?
- ( Josuke growls )

452
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,300
Yuya: Oh, come on, man.

453
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,470
You wouldn’t beat up
a poor invalid, would you?

454
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,410
I know you’re not that cowardly!

455
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,010
If you did, you couldn’t
call yourself a man!

456
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,950
women: Yeah!
So back off, you coward!

457
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,110
josuke: Damn.
Guess you got a point.

458
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,050
Beating the shit out
of an injured victim

459
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,920
would leave a real bad taste
in my mouth,

460
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,290
and it definitely
wouldn’t be manly.

461
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,560
It’s not right, you know?

462
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,090
Yuya: That’s what i’m saying!

463
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,630
Kicking the ass
of a tool like me

464
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,360
will haunt
your conscience forever.

465
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,630
Josuke: To prevent
that nightmare,

466
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,070
i’ve taken the Liberty
of fixing you up.

467
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,930
Yuya: Hmm? ( Gasps )

468
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,370
Josuke: Well, look at that.
You can move.

469
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,140
congrats.
You’re completely healed.

470
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,610
Yuya: Yeah. I’m totally fine.

Josuke: Yup, and since you’ve
gotten a clean bill of health

472
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,680
from shining diamond,

473
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,550
when I pound your ass
into the ground,

474
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,090
I can avoid looking
like a coward, right?

475
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,250
Yuya: Huh? ( Gasps )

476
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,690
( Screams )

477
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,230
( Shining diamond yelling )

478
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,300
Narrator: Yuya fungami’s
hospital stay, extended.

479
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,660
"If you so much as think

480
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,070
"about healing yourself
with highway go go,

481
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,430
i’ll just rearrange
your face all over again,"

482
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,100

( Sighs )

486
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,180
Man, I feel so invigorated.

487
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,680
I feel like it’s the early hours
of new year’s day

488
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,620
and I just put on a fresh pair
of my favorite underwear.

489
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,360
Women: Yu, baby!

490
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,260
narrator: However,
being nursed back to health

491
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,630
by adoring fangirls
isn’t too shabby either.

492
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,200
As for Rohan...

493
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,030
( Rohan groans )

494
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,700
Oh, it’s you. Guess you won.

495
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,340
Josuke: So, uh,
look, Rohan-sensei.

496
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,110
here’s the thing.
I know we’re not friends, but--

497
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,640
Rohan: Why the hell
did you heal me?

498
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,050
Josuke: Eh? Huh?

499
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,650
Rohan: You’re such a moron.

500
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,320
I would have preferred
wasting away

501
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,350
than have the likes
of you save my life.

502
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,550
- ( Josuke growls )
- Rohan: I told you to run away,

503
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,620
but, as always, you had to step
right into the enemy’s trap.

504
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,660
How do you function?

505
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,260
Josuke: Wha--

506
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,030
Rohan: By the way,
you and I are even now.

507
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,430
Narrator: And just when it
seemed Rohan had come around...
