172

controlled from a distance,

173
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,970
it only wields a fraction
of its full power.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,140

of its explosions.

176
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,910
Its owner has to be nearby
fueling it with energy.

There’s no other explanation.

178

at most 15--
no, based on what we’ve seen,

179

Koichi: What do you mean, "and"?

182
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,790
It’s ten meters, and reverb
has a range of 50 meters!

183
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,220
I can find that prick!

Koichi, just leave it be.
you have one job,

186
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,800
and it’s to focus on protecting
yourself with reverb.

190

are too simple

195
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,250

enough of them to know?

We’re going up against

198
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,560
an incredibly powerful
long-range stand.

199

how much i’ve matured.

and finish him off by myself.

( Gasps ) What’s going on?

208
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,890
He’s too far away.

209
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,590
That’s much farther
than 50 meters.

210
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,160
He’s still going!

211
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,590
Now he’s outside reverb’s range.

212
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,060
Does that mean the killer
really has the ability

213
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,100
to control such a powerful stand
from afar? Impossible.

218
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,280

For some reason, the bomb stand

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,690
is drawn to whichever object
it senses is hottest.

220
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,660
That would explain the range
and why it’s still so powerful.

221
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,590
Use reverb to protect yourself.

at that distance.

Wow, act three,

479
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,850
what’s this new ability?
it’s amazing.

480
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,920
Reverb: Three freeze.

481
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,850
"three" and "free."
It works because they rhyme.

482
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,820
Koichi: Yeah, that’s nice, but
it doesn’t answer my question.

483
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,360
i wanna know why
the bomb stand’s barely moving.

484
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,030
Don’t leave me hanging.

485
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,890
Reverb: Well, I did
just tell you they rhyme,

486
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,060
master koichi.
Need I say any more?

487
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,130
Kira: I have no idea how
those meddlesome twits did it,

488
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,370
but somehow they were able
to weigh down heart attack.

489
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,840
Shit, how did it come to this?

490
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,480
I have to go back to that shop
and fetch heart attack myself.
