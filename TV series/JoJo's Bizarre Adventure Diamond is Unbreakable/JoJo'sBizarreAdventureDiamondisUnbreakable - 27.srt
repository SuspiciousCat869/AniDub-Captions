00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,300
I must have fallen unconscious
shortly thereafter.

163
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,900
It’s past 8:00.
Given that fact,

164
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,800
I estimate i’ve been unconscious
for nearly 13 earth hours.

165
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,740
( Both laughing )

166
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,440
Okuyasu: That’s a good one, man!

167
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,780
You really had us going there!

168
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,580
Josuke: I gotta hand it to you.

169
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,250
That’s one of the best jokes
i’ve heard in a long time!

170
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,880
If this whole alien thing
doesn’t work out,

171
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,790
you could totally
become a comedian!

172
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,790
You’re hilarious!

173
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,590
You made your own crop circle

174
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,290
and waited in a bunch of weeds
for someone to come by?

175
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,390
Talk about committing to a bit!
Bravo, sir! Bravo!

176
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,960
Okuyasu: Oh, god, my stomach!
I can’t breathe!

177
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,870
- huh?
- Josuke: Huh?

178
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,400
( Both laughing )

179
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,870
josuke:
It’s freakin’ ridiculous!

180
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,310
( Laughs )

181
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,410
so what school
do you go to, Mr. Alien?

182
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
Okuyasu: You’re just
our kind of guy, my man!

183
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,510
Boy: What school?

184
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,280
My home planet was
in the magellanic clouds,

185
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,220
but it was recently destroyed.

186
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,920
I’ve journeyed to earth
to survey its livability.

187
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,620
Moreover, I seek to assess
the amiability of its people.

188
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,430
( Okuyasu chuckles )

189
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,660
Josuke: Piece of advice,

190
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,500
you should quit
while you’re ahead.

191
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,370
You totally nailed the prank.
Just ride the wave.

192
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,830
And here. Have a tissue.

193
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,670
Boy: Hmm.

194
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,380
many thanks.
That was quite palatable.

195
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,680
( Both stammer )

196
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,210
Okuyasu: Hey, look at the time.

197
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,780
We don’t wanna
be late for school!

198
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,380
Josuke: Oh, yeah, you’re right.

199
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,890
Let’s head out.

200
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,750
Okuyasu: Did you see the way

201
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,290
the guy
scarfed down that tissue?

202
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,690
Josuke: Even comedians
know when to quit.

203
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,630
okuyasu: Aw, no!
The ice cream store’s closed!

204
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,270
But this is the only thing that
makes Monday mornings bearable!

205
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,230
Josuke: There’s nothing
we can do about it now,

206
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,500
so let’s just go.

207
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,370
Boy: Would you two care
for some ice cream?

208
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,970
- Both: Huh?
- Boy: Well?

209
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,440
Would you like the cream?

210
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,840
Okuyasu: Obviously,
but the place is closed.

211
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,940
We’re shit outta luck.

212
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,850
Boy: That is no reason
to give up.

213
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,320
I just so happen
to have two here.

214
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,790
it’s a quid pro quo
for the tissues you gave me.

215
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,950
- ( Josuke gasps )
- ( Okuyasu gasps )

216
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,260
Boy: Earth seems
quite livable indeed.

217
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,860
That, it does.

218
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,490
Okuyasu: What? ( Groans )

219
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,530
why do you have
ice cream cones in your bag?

220
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,760
And how are they cold?!

221
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,930
Boy: Are the ice of creams
unsatisfactory?

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,300
Okuyasu: That’s not the point
right now, alien boy!

223
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,870
Who the hell are you, for real?!

224
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,470
Boy: Bizarre. If I recall,
I already told you.

225
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,540
Ah! You want me
to introduce myself.

226
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,280
How could I forget?

227
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,480
You may hereafter address me
as nu mikitakazo nshi.

228
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,620
I’ve lived 216 cycles.

229
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,690
I am the sole pilot
of a spaceship,

230
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,650
and I also rather enjoy
owning house pets.

231
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,890
- ( Josuke gasps )
- Okuyasu: Huh?

232
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,390
Mikitaka: This is
the house mouse

233
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,390
that spends its days in my bag.

234
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,890
He particularly likes it
when I brush his back.

235
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
okuyasu:
This freak’s a stand user.

236
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,700
no doubt about it.
Let’s send him to the hospital.

237
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,530
josuke:
Use your brain, okuyasu.

238
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,900
Do you really think a stand user
would make up a story

239
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,610
about being
from the magellanic clouds?

240
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,910
Okuyasu: Well, if you’re
so smart, what the hell is he?

241
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,340
Mikitaka: There, there.
it’s all right.

242
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,440
Josuke: I don’t have
the foggiest idea,

243
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,250
but it’s time to find out.

244
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,750
Don’t eat that ice cream.

245
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,820
( Okuyasu gasps )

246
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,520
Hmm.

247
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,990
You’re 216 years old?

248
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,850
- Mikitaka: Yes.
- Okuyasu: Hmm.

249
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,460
Mikitaka: Hmm.

250
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,760
Okuyasu: And you’re some kind
of spaceship pilot?

251
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,900
( Mikitaka winces )

252
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,000
okuyasu: Yo,
why are you copying me?

253
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,500
- mikitaka: Huh?
- Josuke: Let’s focus here.

254
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,570
So, friend, what’s the deal?

255
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,040
Are you telling us
you’re an alien?

256
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,310
Mikitaka: An alien.

257
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,880
An alien, yes.

258
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,380
I should have informed you
when we met.

259
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,980
I am indeed an alien.

260
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,520
Okuyasu: You know,
you’re a loony mother--

261
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,880
josuke: You said you had a ship.

262
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,520
If it’s a genuine flying saucer,

263
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,690
it should be
no problem to call it over.

264
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,290
You can do that, right?

265
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
Mikitaka: Of course,
but it’s currently

266
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,730
at an altitude
of 1,500,000 kilometers,

267
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,700
so it’d take
approximately three days,

268
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,460
so you’ll have to wait
for a while.

269
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,800
Josuke: Let me guess.
You call it with that watch?

270
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,000
Mikitaka: Impressive
deductive reasoning.

271
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,800
However, this must stay
between we three.

272
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,970
You mustn’t share
my secret with anyone.

273
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,410
okuyasu: I thought
that stunt with the crop circle

274
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,940
was an innocent prank,
but he’s off his rocker.

275
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,350
Maybe I should knock
this nose-ringed psycho

276
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,820
back to the mother ship.

277
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Josuke: You always let
your fists do the talking.

278
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,690
Let’s dig a little deeper
before we get violent.

279
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,290
So you’re an alien, huh?

280
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,490
Does that mean you’re hiding
some kinda ray gun

281
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,290
or antigravity device in there?

282
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,990
Mikitaka: I have
both of those things,

283
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,900
but I did not journey to earth
to engage in conflict,

284
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,900
so I have stored them
on my ship.

285
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,000
Okuyasu: Aw, come on,
Mr. Alien man.

286
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,570
Why don’t you show us
something cool already?

287
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,040
Even your blood is boring.

288
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,540
What alien doesn’t come
with green blood?

289
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,580
josuke: Good point.
Alien blood’s always green.

290
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,710
Everyone knows that.

291
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,010
Mikitaka: I see.

292
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,010
Are you accusing me of lying?

293
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,650
Josuke: Hey, take it easy, man.

294
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,420
okuyasu: Yeah,
we’re calling you out, asshole!

295
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,290
I can deal with a prank
here and there,

296
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,550
but i’ll be damned

297
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,490
before I waste my time
with a freak like you!

298
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,490
Josuke: I thought we were
gonna do things my way!

299
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,860
Okuyasu: Shut up! It’s always
better to say it like it is!

300
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,500
- ( Sirens blaring )
- ( Bell ringing )

301
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,670
Okuyasu: Oh, man.
Did a fire break out?

302
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,300
- ( Mikitaka screams )
- ( Both gasp )

303
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,800
( Mikitaka gagging, screaming )

304
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,910
- okuyasu: Huh?
- Josuke: Wh-what’s happening?!

305
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,520
Mikitaka: This sound,
I can’t stand this sound!

306
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,420
You have to find a way
to stop this sound!

307
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,890
Such a horrible sensation!

308
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,420
i’m allergic
to this wretched noise!

309
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,430
Make it stop!

310
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,430
( Screams )

311
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,400
Okuyasu: That’s enough!
This guy’s not right!

312
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,760
We should get as far away
from him as we possibly can!

313
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,730
Josuke: Yeah,
but he’s suffering.

314
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,470
we can’t just up and
abandon him in this condition.

315
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,940
okuyasu:
He said it was allergies.

316
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,010
Just leave him alone.

317
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,610
I’m outta here, josuke.

318
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,510
Josuke: Hey! Come back!

319
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,010
Damn, he can be such a dick.

320
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,950
( Mikitaka shuddering )

321
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,650
josuke: Hey,
you doin’ okay over here?

322
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,450
Mikitaka: Please, take me away.

323
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,760
take me away
from this horrid sound.

324
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,430
( Screams )

325
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,890
Josuke: What the hell?!

326
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,730
Mikitaka: Take me away!

327
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,870
Josuke: Whoa, you were
telling the truth.

328
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,500
Mikitaka: Indeed, I was.

329
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,470
I have the ability to transmute
my form into anything.

330
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,010
Hurry! Let us take
our leave, I beg you!

331
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,880
This sound is going
to split my head in two!

332
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,780
I’ll turn into sneakers,

333
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,910
so, please,
put them on, and save me!

334
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,320
In return for your help,
i’ll do anything you ask!

335
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,720
( Josuke gasps )

336
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,790
Hey, are you a stand user?!

337
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,290
Whoa! ( Screams )

338
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,490
Whoa. This is some crazy speed!

339
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,300
Mikitaka: That’s because
of your assistance.

340
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,930
My speed and jumping abilities

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,030
have been doubled
due to our combined power.

342
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,840
Josuke: An alien, just my luck.

343
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,270
Josuke: Whoa!

344
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,440
What the hell
is going on here?!

345
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,180
Hmm?

346
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,220
Hey...

347
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,590
You really can’t see this?

348
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,620
Mikitaka: Huh?

349
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,190
Josuke: He can’t see it.

350
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,730
He’s not a stand user.

351
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,330
Then where did
his powers come from?

352
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,760
What the hell are you?!

353
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,530
Mikitaka: You are
a stubborn one.

354
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,700
as i’ve been trying
to tell you, I am an alien.

355
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,600
josuke: Fine.
Just give me a second.

356
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,170
Look, no offense,

357
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
but it’s hard to wrap
my head around all this.

358
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,510
Mikitaka: Anyway, I truly
appreciate your saving me.

359
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,280
Sirens are mundane here,

360
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,250
but the people on my planet
abhor the sound.

361
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,180
The wavelength
is very upsetting.

362
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,120
I’d like to repay that kindness.

363
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,190
It’s the least I can do
for one so brave.

364
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,220
Shall I turn
into a fan for you?

365
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,790
Or perhaps a back scratcher

366
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,560
to grab those
hard-to-reach places.

367
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,430
( Josuke gasps )
I didn’t get you out of there

368
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,430
’cause I wanted
something in return.

369
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,170
♪

370
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,570
But if you’ll
really do anything,

371
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,570
well, who am I to turn you down?

372
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,770
Mikitaka: What is it
you request of me?

373
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,510
Josuke: First off, can you
really turn into anything,

374
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,040
like big or small
or even multiples?

375
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,680
mikitaka: Yes. I can
transform into nearly anything.

376
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,020
however,
becoming complex machinery

377
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,250
or powerful objects
is unfeasible.

378
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,790
Josuke: I read you
loud and clear,

379
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,320
and I can tell that we’re
gonna be the best of friends.

380
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,320
So you wanna thank me, right?

381
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,460
- mikitaka: Yes.
- Josuke: Well, you’re in luck,

382
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,160
’cause I just cooked up
a brilliant idea, friend.

383
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,730
trust me.
It’s a win-win for everyone.

384
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,570
- Mikitaka: Win-win?
- Josuke: Right!

385
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,540
See, a few weeks ago,
I won quite a bit

386
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,570
of spending money
in the local lottery.

387
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,310
My mom found out about it,

388
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,580
made a big stink,
and froze my account.

389
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,080
Once that woman makes up
her mind about something,

390
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,250
your fate is sealed.

391
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,780
Being flat broke
during the summer

392
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,480
is the worst, let me tell you.

393
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,190
( Sighs )

394
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,820
That’s why...

395
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,390
I need you to turn into these!

396
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,560
Can you?

397
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,090
mikitaka:
What are they, exactly?

398
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,030
Josuke: A pair of dice,
obviously,

399
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,760
and i’m gonna make
some cash with them.

400
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,570
After that, i’ll split
the winnings with you,

401
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,130
thus creating a win-win.

402
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,740
mikitaka: So how do
the dice function? Explain.

403
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,270
Josuke: Wait. You really
don’t know what dice are?

404
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,270
Mikitaka: I don’t. My apologies.

405
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,380
Josuke: There’s nothing
to apologize for.

406
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,510
It’s super easy to learn.
I’ll show you the ropes.

407
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,450
Anyone who likes playing games
goes nuts over these things.

408
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,320
They’ve got six sides and are
made from a hard material.

409
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,520
The red dot represents
the number one,

410
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,230
and the other faces have
different numbers up to six.

411
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,360
mikitaka: I see.
It’s starting to make sense.

412
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,030
The five dots represent
the number five, correct?

413
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,330
josuke:
That’s right, Mr. Alien!

414
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,730
Mikitaka: And three dots
represent a three.

415
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,530
josuke: Yep!
Now try turning into one.

416
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,170
Mikitaka: I’m at your service.

417
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,340
Simple.

418
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,210
Josuke: It’s close,

419
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,740
but you’re a little too big
to pass for a real die.

420
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,480
This is more like it.

421
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,380
You’ve also got an extra five.

422
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,150
Each face has a different number
from one to six.

423
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,980
The numbers on one side and its
opposite should equal seven.

424
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,590
Mikitaka: Oh, my apologies.

425
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,160
( Josuke gasps )

426
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,760
Mikitaka: Is this better?

427
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,060
Josuke: Huh?

428
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,260
( Mikitaka laughs )
That tickles!

429
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,730
josuke: Hey,
knock off the laughing.

430
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,430
and dice
aren’t supposed to talk.

431
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,430
Mikitaka: Huh?

432
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,000
Josuke: Oh, come on.

433
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,370
Mikitaka: I’ll try harder.

434
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,740
Josuke: I’m a little nervous
about this, but...

435
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,540
( Swallows )
You look good.

436
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,540
Make that great!

437
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,240
We can pull this off!

438
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,050
I’m getting all fired up!

439
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,550
Hope you’re ready to lose
some cashola, Rohan kishibe!

440
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,550
Mikitaka: Can’t breathe.

441
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,550
Rohan: Wow, what a surprise.

442
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,390
Now, why would josuke
higashikata be visiting me?

443
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,790
This is certainly
out of the ordinary.

444
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,030
Did you uncover
any more dirt on Kira?

445
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,760
josuke: Nope,
nothing since the last time

446
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,730
we checked in with you.
so, uh, yeah,

447
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,240
are you all done with
your manga work for the day?

448
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,340
I was wondering if you’d
let me take a peek

449
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,640
- at the next volume early.
- Rohan: Hmm?

450
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,240
What kind of nonsense
are you scheming?

451
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,310
Spit it out. Come on.

452
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,280
Josuke: Eh, I should’ve figured.

453
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,280
Can’t get anything
past you, Rohan-sensei.

454
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,420
’kay, you got me.
I have an ulterior motive.

455
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,520
( Gasps )

456
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,260
I’m begging you, sensei!

457
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,520
Please play cee-lo with me!

458
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,330
Rohan: That’s it? Cee-lo?

459
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,130
Josuke: I’m gonna be
completely honest.

460
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,130
Summer’s finally here, and i’m
totally strapped for cash.

461
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,270
Well, I do have 30,000 on hand.

462
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,340
This is all the money i’ve got
to my name, but it won’t do.

463
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,710
Nowadays, 30,000 yen
won’t get you more

464
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,640
than a couple visits
to the amusement park

465
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,140
and some snacks,

466
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,350
so I either make some dough
or go flat broke.

467
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,250
Taking risks and thrill seeking,

468
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,450
it’s the very foundation
of being young!

469
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,250
That’s what I think, at least.

470
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,150
You agree, don’t you?!

471
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,560
( Rohan sighs )

472
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,590
Let me be frank.

473
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,730
i’ve despised you
from the moment I met you.

474
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,430
There’s absolutely no reason

475
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,160
for me to waste my precious time
playing cee-lo with you.

476
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,200
Josuke: I guess you’re right.

477
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,440
I mean, you’re not
exactly hurting for cash.

478
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,240
i don’t know
what I was thinking.

479
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,240
Why would you want
to play a game with me?

480
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,710
Rohan: Even so, count me in.

481
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,740
josuke: Huh?!
Seriously, you’ll do it?

482
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,750
Rohan: I don’t dislike games.
In fact, i’m intrigued.

483
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,550
Come around back
whenever you’re ready.

484
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,580
Josuke: We’re gonna have
a great time, Rohan-sensei.

485
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,120
( Chuckles )

486
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,260
Rohan: Do these rules
work for you?

487
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,460
Josuke: Yeah, looks good.

488
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,290
Rohan: Each chip
is worth 1,000 yen,

489
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,460
and you must roll three dice
into the bowl.

490
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,400
If one falls out, you lose.

491
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,270
- Josuke: Got it.
- Rohan: All right.

492
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,270
I’ll place the rules here
so they’re in plain view.

493
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,770
Josuke: Okay, let’s get
this party started!

494
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,170
- Rohan: No, wait.
- Josuke: Eh?

495
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,140
Rohan: We won’t
be using those dice.

496
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,180
Josuke: Huh?!

497
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,640
Rohan: We’ll use these.

498
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,410
they’re a set
I found in the house.

499
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,780
♪

500
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,350
Josuke: Oh, really?
That’s interesting.

501
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,680
Is there some reason that you
don’t wanna use my dice?

502
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,350
Rohan: Not really.
I feel inclined to play

503
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,660
with my own is all.
Just a whim.

504
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,360
When I mentioned
I was intrigued,

505
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,690
it wasn’t by the prospect
of playing cee-lo.

506
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,830
No, no, josuke, I was intrigued

507
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,570
by the prospect
of swiping 30,000 yen from you.

508
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,740
Now, when you lose against me,
I expect you to pay in full.

509
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,070
i don’t care how much
we’ve been through. Understand?

510
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,210
( Josuke sighs )

511
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,210
( Chuckles )

512
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Perfect! The dice he found
are actually the alien!

513
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,320
I managed to sneak them
into his house

514
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,150
when he wasn’t
paying attention.

515
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,790
I’m such a bad boy.
It won’t be a ton,

516
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,060
but you’re about to fund
my summer vacay, Rohan-sensei.

517
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,330
Rohan: Now then, shall we
determine who gets to go first?

518
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,330
Four.

519
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,130
Josuke: Yes!

520
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,070
Rohan: Looks like
you’re up first.

521
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,100
Roll the dice.

522
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,440
- Mikitaka: Ow!
- Rohan: Hmm?

523
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,410
Josuke: Uh, ow, ow, ow!

524
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,410
I banged my hand
into the table.

525
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,510
( Laughs )

526
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,610
( Mikitaka sighs )

527
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,510
Place your bet,
and roll the dice.

528
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,750
josuke: Yeah, right.
Uh, guess i’ll start things off

529
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,320
by betting 2,000 yen,
so i’ll throw down two chips.

530
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,120
Rohan: All right, so will I.

531
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,420
Josuke: If I roll a one,
a two, and a three,

532
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,790
i’ll have to pay double,

533
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,660
so I need to avoid
those numbers at all costs.

534
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,400
One, and two, and three!

535
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,030
Keep those rolls
away from me! Eh?

536
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,030
( Rohan groans )

537
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,240
the first roll
calls for a light touch,

538
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,740
sorta like a practice toss.

539
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,410
Here we go. Gently.

540
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,650
Okay! Lookin’ good!

541
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,750
- ( Gasps )
- Rohan: What?

542
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,580
Josuke: I-it’s an omen.

543
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,050
Rohan: Huh?

544
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,390
Narrator: Triple sixes,
a.K.A. "An omen."

545
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,190
Josuke wins five times
what he wagered.

546
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,290
Josuke: Hey! Don’t start
that way, dumb-ass!

547
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,560
- Rohan: Eh?!
- Josuke: What I meant to say

548
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,130
was, "I can’t believe
I had such dumb luck!"

549
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,660
a triple six
and five times the winnings,

550
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,130
how’s that even happen?

551
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,630
To the untrained eye,
it almost looks

552
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,400
like i’m cheating,
even though i’m not!

553
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,070
- ( Rohan growls )
- ( Josuke laughs )

554
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,410
Rohan: Somehow,
you already managed

555
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,310
to win 10,000 yen from me.

556
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,510
josuke: Yeah,
it’s the craziest thing...

557
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,680
Rohan: At any rate,
let’s continue.

558
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,780
If i’m not mistaken, i’m next.

559
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,820
i want to get back
what i’ve lost, so I think...

560
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,150
I’ll wager ten chips.

561
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,750
Josuke: You sure about this?

562
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,120
Rohan: And here we go.

563
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,690
( Both gasp )

564
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,260
Narrator: A one,
a two, and a three.

565
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,670
Rohan must pay double
the amount of his wager.

566
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,030
Josuke: He’s taking
the hustle way too far.

567
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,540
It’s getting obvious.

568
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,070
Does this alien know the meaning
of the word "restraint"?

569
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,540
( Rohan groans )

570
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,040
Josuke: Shit biscuits.

571
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:35,030
If this keeps up,
he’ll bust us for sure.
