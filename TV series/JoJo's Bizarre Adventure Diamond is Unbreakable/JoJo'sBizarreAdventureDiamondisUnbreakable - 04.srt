00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,770
Koichi: Uh, five.

166
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,210
I remember my neck being slammed hard between the gates.

167
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,110
After that, I was--

168
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,410
w-where the heck are we?

169
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,450
Josuke: Sorry to have to tell you this, koichi,

170
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
but things haven’t gotten any better

171
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,920
while you were napping.

172
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,480
All I wanna do right now

173
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,050
is walk down those stairs and leave this place behind.

174
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,890
but something tells me okuyasu’s bro

175
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,330
won’t exactly comply with that.

176
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,390
- ( Rattling ) - ( Gasps )

177
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,000
Koichi: Huh?

178
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,400
( Rattling )

179
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,970
Josuke: There’s no mistaking it.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,370
Something’s lurking up there, but it’s staying out of sight.

181
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,780
what the-- something ran across that beam.

182
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,880
Koichi: Josuke, what’s going on here?

183
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,050
josuke: Koichi, I know you just woke up

184
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,950
and none of this makes sense, but for now

185
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,250
I need you to keep quiet and stay close to me.

186
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,890
It was a hell of a lot creepier when I couldn’t see it.

187
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,460
Getting a look at it is actually a relief.

188
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,160
Looks like we’ve got a pesky runt on our hands.

189
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,100
As soon as that little shit shows himself,

190
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,270
i’ll blast him to kingdom come with shining diamond.

191
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,340
Then we’ll get the hell outta here as fast as we can.

192
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,540
There you are!

193
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,780
What?! There’s a ton of those things,

194
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,310
and they’re all in some kind of uniform.

195
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,480
- ( Winces ) - Koichi: What the--

196
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,960
josuke: Looks like we’re being ambushed

197
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,890
by a bunch of toy paratroopers.

198
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,960
this is the power of okuyasu’s brother’s stand?

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,060
( Winces ) Damn it!

200
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,530
Son of a--

201
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,930
( shining diamond growls )

202
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,500
Dora! Dora!

203
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,840
( Soldiers shouting )

204
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,440
Josuke: I got a few, but taking out two or three of ’em

205
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,140
isn’t gonna be enough.

206
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,610
They leave tiny wounds,

207
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,610
but the damage definitely packs a wallop.

208
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,080
If we don’t play this smart,

209
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,420
we’re gonna be in major trouble.

210
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,020
Keicho: Since my idiotic little brother

211
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,090
decided to meddle with my trap and save that brat,

212
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,320
my plan has gone off the rails somewhat.

213
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
But in the grand scheme, it’s of little consequence.

214
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,200
You’ll never escape this house

215
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,330
or the domination

216
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,470
of my perfectly synchronized stand,

217
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,430
worse company!

218
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,080
Josuke: So his stand is called worse company.

219
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,780
( Koichi gasping )

220
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,520
Hey, josuke, w-what’s going on?

221
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,320
Josuke: Ask me later. I know it’s crazy,

222
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,690
but I need you to stay back.

223
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,420
They’re up to something!

224
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,690
Soldier: All units, halt!

225
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,430
Ready! Aim!

226
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,490
Fire!

227
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,030
Left face!

228
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,070
Fire!

229
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,410
Josuke: Head on, these little bastards

230
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,980
have the firepower to blow us to smithereens.

231
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,380
( Gasps )

232
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,380
Luckily, we’ve got windows.

233
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,950
i know we’re on the second floor,

234
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,550
but we’ve gotta break those windows

235
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
and jump to safety.

236
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,820
( Engines whirring )

237
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,850
So much for that idea.

238
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,930
That’s just great.

239
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
They’ve even got helicopters?

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,930
But how’s his stand taking the form

241
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,570
of U.S. army apache choppers?

242
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,000
Koichi: Watch your back! They’ve got a tank!

243
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,710
Shining diamond: Dora!

244
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,880
Josuke: You’re right. Those are definitely tanks.

245
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,620
Koichi, carefu--

246
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,390
wait! Do you wanna run that by me one more time?

247
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,060
Can you actually see the enemy,

248
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,100
the soldiers, tanks, helicopters, all of ’em?

249
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,860
Koichi: Mm-hmm.

250
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,600
I don’t understand what’s going on,

251
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,200
but I can see them.

252
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,800
Josuke: The arrow. Since it didn’t kill you,

253
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,070
it must have given you a stand.

254
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,880
keicho: Oh? So the shrimp has one as well.

255
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,150
Keicho: He’s finally got the power to use a stand.

256
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,520
This certainly is a surprise.

257
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,620
Josuke: It’s the man of the hour, okuyasu’s bro.

258
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,450
This is a pretty ballsy move,

259
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,060
showing off your stand like that!

260
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,620
( Shining diamond yells )

261
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,100
Keicho: You can think of my stand, worse company,

262
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,930
as a cast-iron defense.

263
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,930
It renders all attacks and intruders

264
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,500
incapable of penetrating its protective shield.

265
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,470
I know you’re itching to put me out of commission,

266
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,970
( Chuckles ) But sadly, it’s a pipe dream

267
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,940
that will never come to fruition,

268
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,610
as your shining diamond’s attacks

269
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,780
will never get anywhere close to me!

270
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,910
( Josuke sighs )

271
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,950
keicho: Hmm. Feast your eyes on this!

272
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,620
The perfect symmetry of my army’s formation

273
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,620
is simply stunning, isn’t it?

274
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,060
Soldier: All units, maintain battle formation!

275
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,260
At ease!

276
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,500
Keicho: There’s just nothing quite like

277
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,570
having everything beautifully in place,

278
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,900
though you did destroy

279
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,540
a few of my foot soldiers with your attack,

280
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,970
so my troop’s formation is irritatingly asymmetrical now.

281
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,580
Josuke: Hah! Well you did say you were meticulous,

282
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,980
but did you really need to come out of your hiding spot

283
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,580
to tell us all that?

284
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,080
Keicho: Now, what on earth would give you that idea?

285
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,150
I came out here to observe the little troublemaker.

286
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,750
Koichi: You mean me?

287
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,890
Keicho: Indeed, I do.

288
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,190
if I recall, koichi was your name.

289
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,960
Ironic that you appear to have the innate ability

290
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,530
to utilize a stand.

291
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,230
Manifest your stand right now,

292
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,530
and show me the extent of its power.

293
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,770
if today’s my lucky day, you may just possess the ability

294
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,040
i’ve spent so long trying to uncover.

295
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,040
( Josuke gasps )

296
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,670
Keicho: Show me your power,

297
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,210
and i’ll allow you to live.

298
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,210
( Koichi gasps ) But I don’t know--

299
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,210
josuke: And what ability would that be?

300
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,710
It’s about time you told us what your endgame is.

301
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,180
Keicho: I’ll be asking the questions around here!

302
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,290
Do I make myself clear, josuke?!

303
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,620
Keep in mind I still have you in my crosshairs.

304
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,790
You should be thanking me

305
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,620
for letting you live as long as I have.

306
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,730
Josuke: That’s just great.

307
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Keicho: Let’s go! Get a move on!

308
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,800
Manifest your stand!

309
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,000
Koichi: What’s a stand?

310
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,070
Sorry. I have no clue what you mean!

311
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,270
keicho: Huh? It’s your first time?

312
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,840
Well, i’ll be! Very well.

313
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,240
Josuke, be a sport, and show him how to manifest his stand.

314
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,310
- josuke: What? - Keicho: The striking range

315
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,750
of your shining diamond is only a measly one meter.

316
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,120
It’s a long shot, but if this wimp’s stand

317
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,780
can compensate for the weakness of yours,

318
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,560
you might have a real chance at escaping my company.

319
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,690
- ( Laughs ) - Josuke: Good point.

320
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,260
A stand that could kick your ass

321
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,230
would be an awesome addition to the party.

322
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,930
( Koichi shuddering )

323
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,270
Josuke: Okay, materializing your stand is easy, koichi.

324
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,670
Ramp up the urge to protect yourself,

325
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,640
or maybe think about pummeling this guy

326
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,140
- until he’s black and blue. - Koichi: Huh?

327
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,970
Josuke: The rest boils down to instinct.

328
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,280
( Koichi gasping )

329
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,750
Josuke: A stand unique to your spiritual energy

330
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,880
- should reveal itself. - Koichi: Hold on! Say what?!

331
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,220
you can’t just spring that on me

332
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,920
and expect me to know what to do!

333
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,090
Keicho: You don’t know what to do?

334
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,150
Then please allow me to help you out.

335
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,920
Here’s some inspiration!

336
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,060
( Koichi wails )

337
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,860
Keicho: Do it, green beret!

338
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,960
( Koichi screaming )

339
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,240
( Screaming continues )

340
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,910
- Josuke: What?! - Keicho: That’s it.

341
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,980
( Koichi panting )

342
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,790
( Keicho gasps )

343
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,190
Josuke: Hey, koichi, you have to try moving it.

344
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,760
Koichi: What are you talking about?

345
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,760
Josuke: The stand! Now open your eyes!

346
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,660
Koichi: What stand? ( Gasps )

347
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,300
Are you saying I made this thing?!

348
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,130
josuke: Yeah, i’ll congratulate you later.

349
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,040
First we need to find out what this egg-shaped thing can do.

350
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,370
Koichi: What it can do? I don’t know what the heck

351
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,840
you think is supposed to happen,

352
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,370
but I don’t have any energy left!

353
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,070
That was the best I could do!

354
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,880
Josuke: You’re kidding. that’s it?!

355
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,010
- ( Shell cracks ) - ( Keicho grunts )

356
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,380
This stand...

357
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,850
enough! I’ve seen everything that I need to!

358
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,290
all units, get in battle formation!

359
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,890
Koichi, withdraw your stand,

360
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,360
if they destroy this egg, you’ll die, too!

361
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,330
Koichi: What do you mean?! I don’t know how to do that!

362
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,070
Keicho: Light ’em up, men!

363
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,000

Koichi: J-josuke!

366
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,980
keicho: Excellent. Those two have been separated.

367
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,720
The crack in that egg, the brat doesn’t realize it,

368
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,820
but he might have something there.

369
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,860
So the only man dying today is josuke.

370
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,030
Josuke: Word to the wise, sergeant bro,

371
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,370
if you’re trying to bring the roof of this dump

372
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,940
down on our heads in a fiery inferno,

373
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,140
then do it, and stop playing around!

374
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,770

♪

376
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,320
Josuke: This is great. Yeah, i’m in the mood for a brawl.

377
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,090
Keicho: Josuke higashikata,

378
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,790
is it true that you strongly disapprove

379
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,430
of disparaging remarks related to your hair?

380
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,130
Josuke: Why don’t you find out for yourself?

381
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,930
Go on. I dare you.

382
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,870
Keicho: Thanks, but I don’t think that’ll be necessary.

383
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,210
Instead, i’ll blow your head right off

384
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,110
from underneath that prized hair of yours.

385
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,310
Consider yourself forewarned.

386
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,080
But first, worse company will fire bullets into your legs.

387
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,250
That’ll keep you from running away.

388
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,920
Next, we’ll focus on taking out your arms.

389
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,460
Once that’s done, you’ll have no means of defending yourself,

390
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,990
giving me carte blanche

391
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,860
to blow your brains and hair into oblivion!

392
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,130
Josuke: Well, that sounds like a bulletproof plan,

393
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,860
if I ever heard one,

394
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,840
if you overlook the fact that it’s completely impossible!

395
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,770
Keicho: I’ve already told you how meticulous I am.

396
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,280
When I declare something, I stick to it, thus the warning.

397
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,110
Koichi: He’s wide open.

398
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,150
All I have to do is make that stand thing appear again.

399
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,150
It’s only an egg, but if I can somehow

400
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,120
hurl it at him and make a direct hit,

401
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,120
I might be able to beat him.

402
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,960
all right, koichi. Time to rise to the occasion.

403
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,530
I’m gonna beat him!

404
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,430
Keicho: Remember the only reason

405
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,000
i’m still letting you draw breath

406
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,470
is because your stand intrigues me.

407
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,370
Josuke: Bastard!

408
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,840

Josuke: Hey, sergeant bro, have you ever heard the story

413
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,250
where Moses parts the waters of the red sea

414
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,550
right down the middle?

415
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,460
Because that’s what i’m about to do

416
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,860
to your pathetic army.

417
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,520
Then i’m gonna beat you down!

418
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,830
Keicho: My plan is proceeding exactly as I forewarned,

419
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,600
but you’re too big of a fool to see it, josuke higashikata!

now, apaches, release your firepower, and disable him!

( Keicho chuckles )

428
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,290
First the legs, then the arms,

429
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,630
exactly as I predicted.

430
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,230
Hellfire is going to rain down on you

with a flurry of bullets!

432
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,430

433
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,070
or will worse company tear you apart?

434
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,040
Let’s find out as it fires every missile, shell, and round!

435
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,140
You lose, josuke higashikata!

and what exactly do you think you’re doing?

440
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,630
could it be you’re accepting your fate?

( Laughs )

442
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,260

Hmph. Well, no can do.

444
