- Remember last week’s topic? - Koichi: Wow!

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,160
Just look at those spokes sparkle and spin!

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,100
i can’t believe I got this mountain bike

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,400
as a graduation gift.

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,770
Getting new stuff is always such a blast.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,530
And with a bike this amazing,

13
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,540
i’ll never ride the school bus again!

( Groans ) That hurt.

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,390
Huh? What happened?

20
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,160
And what’s that bag doing there?

21
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,490
( Cat meowing )

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,430
No, it can’t be.

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,730
You mean that bag had a...

24
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,310
( Yells ) Oh, my god! I ran over a cat!

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,810
But how?! I didn’t even see it lying there!

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,740
There was no way I could have dodged the poor thing in time!

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,580
- Man: Exactly right! - Koichi: Huh?

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,050
man: That was just a bit of bad luck.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,380
it’s not like you meant to run it over.

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,050
Nah, if you want my take on the matter,

31
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,820
the real scoundrel here is the ass-wipe

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,590
who left that poor kitten in a bag to die.

33
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,090
Pretty rotten, if you ask me.

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,560
( Koichi gasps ) We’ve gotta do something.

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,260
Man: What’d be the point?

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,770
You don’t hear the little fur ball meowing, do you?

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,170
It’s dead.

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,340
So what’s your name, kid?

39
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,810
I’m tamami kobayashi, and I just happen to have graduated

40
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,240
from the same school you’re attending. Huh?

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,710
Nice bike you got there.

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,320
So are you a freshman?

43
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,420
Koichi: Yes, I am. My name is koichi hirose.

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,420
Tamami: Ah, high school.

45
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,820
Boy, that sure takes me back. Good times.

46
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,760
At any rate, have a seat over here, Mr. Hirose.

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,700
Koichi: Uh, b-but I...

48
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,700
( Shudders )

49
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,170
Tamami: Come on, kid.

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,300
Quit that punk-ass quivering, and sit down.

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,310
Now that you’re nice and comfy, I have a proposition for you.

52
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,880
I’ll lay that pussycat to rest,

53
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,310
and you grease my palm with some cash. Sound fair?

54
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,550
Hey! There something wrong with your ears?!

55
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,290
Koichi: What are you talking about?

56
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,820
Tamami: Try to keep up. This is serious business.

57
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,420
I know you’re innocent and all,

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,460
but you’re not planning to pull a hit and run

59
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,390
with my precious cat, are you?

60
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,860
( Koichi gasps ) You’re saying that cat belonged to you?

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,600
Tamami: That’s exactly what i’m saying.

62
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,270
Koichi: Then, aren’t you the one who stuffed the kitten

63
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,270
inside a bag and left it in the street?

64
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,240
tamami: Let’s not get bogged down in details.

65
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,670
I’m asking if you think

66
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,540
you’re gonna walk away from this scot-free.

67
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,210
After all, the killer here...

68
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,410
Is you, short stuff.

69
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,250
♪

70
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,410
Tamami: I bet you’re feeling pretty guilty right now,

71
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,910
but the good news is paying a little fee

72
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,420
could just free yourself of that oppressive feeling of guilt.

73
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,350
so why don’t we begin the healing

74
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,220
by emptying out your wallet?

75
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,920
- ( Koichi gasps ) - Tamami: Well?

76
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,330
( Koichi gasps ) What is this thing?!

77
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,860
it looks like some kind of freaky padlock,

78
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,770
and it’s really heavy!

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,770
Tamami: Huh? You’re saying you can actually see it?

80
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,700
Hah! What do you know!

81
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,810
That’ll make things go by a whole lot faster.

82
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,380
Koichi: Wait. You mean this thing is a stand?

83
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,610
Why is a psycho’s stand growing out of my body?!

84
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,950
Okuyasu: Huh?

85
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,550
hey, josuke, you seeing what i’m seeing?

86
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,320
It looks like koichi’s down there.

87
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,990
josuke: Yeah, that’s koichi all right.

88
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,590
No doubt about it. No matter where he goes,

89
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,230
he always seems to end up with the wrong crowd.

90
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,360
( Okuyasu chuckles ) I’m sure he can handle himself.

91
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,370
Tamami: Four months ago, i crossed paths

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,900
with a guy by the name of keicho nijimura,

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,570
and he gave me a pretty handy special ability.

94
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,640
I hadn’t a clue what was happening, but it felt great,

95
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,410
and I figured if I put my new powers to good use,

96
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,010
i’d never have to worry about a thing

97
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,680
for the rest of my life.

98
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,820
All right, cough it up already.

99
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,590
Being cheap means the lock stays right where it is,

100
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,420
and you wouldn’t want that, would you?

101
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,020
koichi: I can’t help you, really.

102
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,420
I’m flat broke.

103
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,860
Tamami: Ah.

104
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,860
then explain why you just looked away.

105
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,800
Koichi: I didn’t. I mean...

106
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,830
Yaah! It got heavier!

107
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,640
Oh, no, i’m gonna...

108
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,640
( Grunts )

109
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,410
Tamami: Tsk, tsk, tsk.

110
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,010
Didn’t anybody ever teach you that it’s bad to lie?

111
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,610
Admit it or not, you know in your heart that i’m right,

112
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,350
and the guiltier you feel,

113
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,880
the bigger and heavier that lock will grow.

114
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,850
The lock’s size is proportional to the weight of your guilt,

115
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,850
and the two are inexorably linked.

116
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,760
you can knock me out or run a thousand miles away,

117
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,830
but you’re never getting rid of that thing.

118
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,930
So why don’t you be a good boy

119
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,660
and give me your wallet? how ’bout it?

120
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,000
Didn’t you say something about being flat broke, kiddo?

121
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,470
This looks like 7,000 yen to me.

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,070
Koichi: No, you can’t! That’s the money I was going to use

123
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,370
to buy new sneakers for gym class today!

124
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,680
Tamami: What? Sneakers?

125
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,480
You can go barefoot!

126
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,920
Josuke: Hey, man. What’s going on?

127
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,080
- Tamami: Huh? - ( Koichi gasps )

128
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,950
J-josuke and okuyasu, you’re here!

129
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,520
Josuke: Looks like a grown man’s mugging a high school kid.

130
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,430
Why don’t you get a job and earn your own money?

131
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,730
Tamami: Oh, butt out! It’s none of your business, so run along.

132
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,500
josuke: Sorry. That’s not gonna happen,

133
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,470
not when there’s a stinkin’ shit bag

134
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,640
and his dirty little stand in front of me.

135
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,970
I think it’s time to take out the trash.

136
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,410
Tamami: Hey, now!

137
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,010
Okuyasu: Damn thing won’t come off.

138
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,440
What kind of stand is this?

139
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,410
Tamami: Hold on a sec. You guys can see it, too?

140
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,380
How many of you freak shows are there?

141
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,680
Josuke: You took the words right out of my mouth,

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,950
but the answer to that question can wait.

143
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,920
’til then, i’d appreciate it if you’d remove that lock.

144
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,690
( Tamami growls ) Hey, you assholes,

145
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,630
don’t you underestimate me!

146
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,530
Watch yourselves, ’cause i’m not fooling around here.

147
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,130
It’s essential that criminals pay for their crimes

148
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,070
in order to keep society from crumbling around us.

149
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,710
If he’s not gonna pay,

150
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,580
does that mean one of you will cover what he owes me?

151
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,380
If so, i’ll let you go. ( Laughs )

152
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,980
Money’s money, after all.

153
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,850
Okuyasu: Oh, so you just wanna get your hands on our money.

154
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,020
I’d like to see you try.

155
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,620
Koichi: Keep your guard up!

156
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,820
This loser already swiped 7,000 yen from me!

157
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,690
Tamami: That’s because you lied straight to my face,

158
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,060
- you dolt! - ( Koichi groans )

159
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,630
Tamami: You really think that poor kitty’s life

160
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,130

- ( Laughs ) - ( Koichi shudders )

319
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,520
Girl: Koichi, is something wrong?

320
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,920
( Koichi shrieks ) Sis!

321
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,050
- Ahh! He got you, too?! - ( Tamami laughs )

322
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,160
That’s right, "ko." When your lovely sister brought me tea,

323
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,560
I got her to spill some on my hand.

324
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,000
I wailed to make her think she burned me,

325
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,400
and you should have seen how apologetic she was.

326
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,940
( Laughs ) So sweet and seductive.

327
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,000
and she’s a junior at an all-girls school. Yummy.

328
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,910
Fully grown and ripe for the picking.

329
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,610
( Laughs ) Ya-ya-yahoo!

330
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,210
- ( Laughs ) - ( Koichi growls )

331
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,950
Tamami: Huh? What the...

332
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,250
Koichi: Bastard.

333
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,360
mark my words. I’ll make you pay for this.

334
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,160
Tamami: Wait. What’s going on?

335
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,630
What’s that funny-looking egg thing supposed to be?

336
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,300
♪

337
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,870
tamami: Wait! What the hell is that?!

338
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,010
Koichi: Okay, you two, you need to leave the room right now!

339
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
Ms. Hirose: What’s going on, ko?

340
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,480
Koichi: I’ve got this, but you have to be quiet.

341
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,920
Tamami: I-I don’t know what that thing is,

342
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,450
but get it away from me!

343
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,990
You may have gotten your mom and sister out of the room,

344
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,520
but they’re still my hostages, and as long as they are,

345
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,390
you have to do what I say, so call off your beast!

346
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,430
( Koichi growls )

347
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,660
( Tamami wails )

348
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,430
Koichi: Hate to break it to you, buddy,

349
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,430
but you’re not getting anywhere near my mother or sister!

350
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,270
tamami: Fine. Do your worst then, koichi.

351
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,600
You think you’re a badass...

352
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,470
Koichi: After you take the locks off my family!

353
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,110
tamami: You’re a smart boy, koichi.

354
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,980
think about what it would do to your mother

355
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,980
if she saw you beating the shit out of me!

356
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,080
Her guilt would be all-consuming and swallow her up!

357
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,280
Koichi: I told you to remove the locks now!

358
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,120
Tamami: Who do you think you’re talkin’ to,

359
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,990
you sawed-off little dickhead?! I’m tamami kobayashi!

360
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,490
I’m not takin’ off the locks until i’m good and ready!

361
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,230
( Wails )

362
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,390
Huh?

363
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,060
that punch, it didn’t hurt at all.

364
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
( Koichi gasps )

365
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,340
hey, now. What the hell was that?

366
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,510
your friend’s bark is a lot worse than his bite.

367
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,440
What kind of stand is that, anyway?

368
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,210
As far as I can see,

369
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,950
it’s just a poser without any speed or power.

370
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,050
How dare you scare me over nothing?! Screw you!

371
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,650
It’s time I taught you a lesson.

372
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,220
a stand can have all the potential in the world,

373
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,720
but it means nothing without mental fortitude.

374
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,430
The hard truth is your feeble spirit

375
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,960
is weakening your stand!

376
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,500
but that just makes my payback so much sweeter!

377
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,170
koichi: T-there’s something weird on his cheek.

378
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,030
"Ba" and "gi"?

379
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,100
they’re like comic book sound effects.

380

00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,740
Tamami: What is this?

383
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,650
w-where the hell is this ringing coming from?

384
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,720
It’s like the sound I heard when he hit me before! Gaah!

385
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,180
Wait? What?

386
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,650
Why is there writing on my arm?!

387
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,420
Damn it. It’s stuck! It won’t come off!

388

No! This can’t be happening!

392
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,570
It’s like the blasted sound is coming from inside my body!

393
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,240
How can your stand have this kind of power?!

394
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,410
you little shit! Stop this damn noise right now!

395

- ( Booming ) - ( Screaming )

397
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,450
Koichi: So that’s it. My stand has the ability

398
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,090
to fill the body with sound and turn it into a weapon.

399
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,790
Oh, now that I think about it,

400
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,430
we studied a famous matsuo basho poem just like this in school,

401
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,260
something about the trill of the locust

402
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,400
permeating through stone.

403
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,070
( Drop echoes )

404
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Tamami: Damn! How’d I let this thumb sucker get me?!

405
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,100
Koichi: All you have to do is take the locks

406
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,110
off my mom and sister, and the noise will stop!

407
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,080
you can try resisting if you want to, but who knows

408
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,380
what effect the strain will end up having on your body?!

409
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,780
( Tamami growls ) Knock off the ringing!

410
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,450
- ( Crackling ) - ( Yelling )

411
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,820
Koichi: Stop trying to be a tough guy,

412
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,250
and take the locks off my family!

413
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,820
Tamami: Damn you! A pitiful bug like you

414
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,290
has no right to act so high and mighty!

415
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,560
( Groans ) The reason i’m such a boss-ass con man

416
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,570
is because I don’t cave in to upstart pissants!

417
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,830
I’m tamami, and the "tama" stands for "balls,"

418
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,370
so you’re about to see how big mine are!

419
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,270
( Koichi gasps )

420
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,670
( Growls )

421
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,410
I’m not scared of that knife or your tiny balls!

422
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,080
Tamami: Keep underestimating me.

423
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,680
I’ll show you a whole new world of horror and pain.

424
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,620
Here comes the agony of the padlock!

425
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,220
( Groans )

426
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,220
Koichi: What?!

427
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,620
( Tamami screams )

428
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,390
Oh, my god, no!

429
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,490
Not only is the cut shallow, but the pain and panic is fake.

430
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,190
- toss. - Koichi: "Toss"?

431
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,300
Ms. Hirose: Who’s screaming?

432
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,400
Sister: What’s going on in here?

433
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,600
( Both gasp )

434
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,700
Sister: Ko?!

435
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,540
Koichi: No! You’ve got it wrong!

436
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,700
( Both scream )

437
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,310
koichi: Shit! The locks got bigger!

438
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,240
Tamami: Yes! ( Laughs )

439
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,810
( Ms. Hirose gasps ) Ko!

440
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,880
why, son? How could you do this?

441
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,350
Where did I go wrong?

442
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,350
Koichi: Don’t believe it. please, mom!

443
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,480
You have to know I didn’t do this.

444
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,250
Sis!

445
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,620
Tamami: I’m the winner.

446
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,290
Told you you couldn’t beat me.

447
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,720
Now, hurry up, and get rid of this racket, koichi,

448
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,630
or your mom’s gonna die.

449
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,130
Don’t just stand there! Do you want the guilt

450
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,430
to crush your mom into a pancake?!

451
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,800
although, when a person is wracked with this much guilt,

452
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,340
death seems like a sweet release.

453
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,480
Ms. Hirose: That’s it. I can’t take it.

454
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,880
- it’s over. - Koichi: Mom, don’t!

455
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,210
Ms. Hirose: No more! I can’t live like this!

456
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,150
tamami: Your turn to stop being a tough guy!

457
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,780
Nix the sound, or you’re gonna watch your mom

458
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,250
paint the room with her blood!

459
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,420
Koichi: Actually, I don’t think I will.

460
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,660
Here’s a better idea. I’ll make it worse!

461
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,690
Believe me!

462
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,690
Believe me!

463
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,600
( Reverb yells )

464
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,730

465
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,370
( Ms. Hirose gasps )

466
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
Koichi: Mom, i’m telling the truth. Believe me.

467
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,240
- ( Ms. Hirose gasping ) - ( Koichi echoing ) Believe!

468
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,570
Please, mom.

469
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,680
( Echoing ) Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe...

470
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,850
Tamami: She’s too far gone. She’ll never believe you.

471
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,220
- ( Ms. Hirose gasps ) - Koichi: Come on.

472
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,650
Ms. Hirose: Koichi. If his own mother

473
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
won’t believe him, then who will?

474
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,260
I have to have faith in my darling boy.

475
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,290
He’s always been such a perfect angel.

476
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,760
He’d never hurt a soul,

477
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,200
and I know in my heart he’d never steal.

478
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,500
Koichi: Yes!

479
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,400
Tamami: This isn’t good.

480
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,840
- ( Ms. Hirose gasps ) - koichi: Mom!

481
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,410
Tamami: It’s not possible.

482
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,910
Parents never trust their brats!

483
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,210
At least, mine never trusted me, so what makes him special?

484
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,610
- ( Koichi growling ) - Tamami: Shit!

485
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,480
( Gasps )

486
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,890
( Wails )

487
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,620
I was only joking! Please, ko!

488
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,930
Surely you wouldn’t kill a guy over a joke, would you?!

489
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,530
Koichi: Take the lock off my sister, too.

490
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,500
Tamami: I’ve already taken care of it.

491
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,330
I could never do anything to harm such a picturesque face.

492
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,470
And so you know, I was only kidding about taking your house.

493
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,010
I even gave you back all of your yen.

494
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,340
See? Joke!

495
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,980
Please have mercy on me!

496
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,510
I’ll do anything, master koichi!

497
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,650
koichi: Really? You’ll do anything I want?

498
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,520
Tamami: Yes! Just name it! I’ll be your personal underling!

499
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,590
Koichi: All right, works for me.

500
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,020
Your first duty is to bring me 500 grand by tomorrow.

501
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,030
( Tamami gasps )

502
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,430
( Koichi chuckles )

503
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,760
Take it easy.

504
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,260
Can’t you recognize a joke when you hear one?

505
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,700
( Laughs )

506
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,540
Tamami: That didn’t sound like a joke to me.

507
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,640
( Sobs )

508
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,770
( Reverb shrieks )

509
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,780
Josuke: Uh, hey, okuyasu,

510
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,310
is it just me, or is that guy really creepy?

511
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,880
tamami: Master, allow me to carry your bag.

512
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,390
Koichi: Are you sure you wanna do that?

513
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,320
Tamami: Oh, of course I do. ( Laughs )

514
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,960
master koichi, you’re a true man among men.

515
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,990
Koichi: Aw, shucks. You don’t have to butter me up...

516
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,990
Josuke: I swear it’s like we’re in the twilight zone.

517
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,600
Okuyasu: I don’t know what that means,

518
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,400
but my brain hurts just watching all this weirdness.
