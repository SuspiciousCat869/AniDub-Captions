His eyes have only
been temporarily withered.

144
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,950
He had
50,000-year-old mineral water

145
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,420
made from melted snow

146
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,760
procured from mount Kilimanjaro
in Africa.

147
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,660
It flushes the eye’s interior
of harmful contaminants

148
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,430
and is an effective treatment
in cases of sleep deprivation.

149

The reason you didn’t cry
after drinking the water

150
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,870
is because you obtained

151
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,340
an adequate amount
of sleep last night.

152

I’m not sleepy anymore!

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,580
To be perfectly honest with you,
I feel spectacular,

You can’t be serious.

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,920
Are you telling me there’s
nothing wrong with your eyes?

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,590
Okuyasu: Exactly.
When you drink water this good,

160
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,690
it’s only natural
for the tears to flow.

161
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,420
Trust me, josuke. It’s nothing
to be worried about.

162
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,360
I cried way more than this
when I watched "champ" on video.

163
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,630
Thanks for caring,
but I feel like a billion yen.

164
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,430
Josuke: Is that a fact?

165
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,600
Okuyasu:
You bet your ass, it is.

166
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,600
Tonio: Here’s your cappuccino.

167
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,840
Josuke: Oh, thanks.

168
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,640
Tonio: So shall we continue
with the next course?

169
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,680
( Okuyasu sighs ) Wow.

170
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,640
Looks scrumdiddly-yumcious.

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,410
Tonio: For our antipasto,

172
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,050
i’ve prepared insalata caprese
with mozzarella.

173
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,550
Okuyasu: ’scuse me,
but what’s mozzaza?

174
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,490
Tonio: Goodness, you’ve never
heard of mozzarella before?

175
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,560
It’s a soft, low-fat cheese
that’s quite tasty.

176
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,960
It is a national favorite
in Italy.

177
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,860
The first people to use tomatoes

178
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,360
as a culinary ingredient
were the Italians.

179
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,630
The Italian people
lead the entire world

180
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,670
when it comes
to tomato-based cuisine.

181
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,000
I’m not bragging.
It’s the honest truth.

182
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
We take pride in our work.

183
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,680
Now, I hope you enjoy
your meal, sir.

184
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,380
Okuyasu: Trust me. I will!

185
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,650
Tonio: Hmm.

186
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,020
( Okuyasu murmuring )

187
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,490
( Swallows )

188
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,560
Well, this dish is pretty good.

189
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,990
I’ll give you that.

190
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,830
I dare say this is very good.

191
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,030
But, even so, the cheese itself

192
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,930
doesn’t leave
much of an impression,

193
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,540
which is a shame
after all the hype.

194
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,140
Tonio: No, no. It’s not meant
to be eaten by itself.

195
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,870
You have to add tomato to it.

196
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,880
Okuyasu: Say what?
Adding a tomato sounds weird.

197
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,650
Well, all right,
but here in Japan,

198
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,080
we have sensitive palates.

199
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,150
This is gonna
have to be mind-blowing

200
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,020
to pass the tasty test.

201
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,860
Oh, my god!

202
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,190
- Josuke: Huh?
- ( Tonio chuckles )

203
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,130
Okuyasu: It’s incredible
how the tomatoey nectar

204
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,430
gently caresses
the fresh, delicate cheese!

205
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,060
What a great combination.

206
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,070
The cheese and tomato
enrich each other!

207
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,440
It’s a perfect symphony,
I tell you,

208
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,170
a Harmony
of tantalizing flavors,

209
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,570
a dynamic duo the likes
of Simon and Garfunkel

210
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,540
or even Abbot and costello.

211
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,140
It’s like the writer-illustrator
team asao takamori

212
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,210
and tetsuya chiba
from the comic "ashita no Joe"!

213
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,580
Tonio: Grazie!
Nothing makes me happier

214
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,850
than knowing
you enjoyed my cooking.

215
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,550
Josuke: Hey, ol’ buddy, ol’ pal,

216
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,660
do you think you could share
some of that with your bestie?

217
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,060
Okuyasu: Not on your life.

218
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,930
You can order
your own isasalad canichi.

219
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,030
You’re not gettin’ any of mine,
you got that?

220
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,800
Even if you
were starving to death,

221
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,470
I still wouldn’t give you
a piece of this yummy goodness.

222
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,200
Josuke: Ahh...

223
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,470
Okuyasu: Ahh...

224
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,440
Mmm. ( Chuckling )

225
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,210
So good!

226
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,540
Everything i’ve been through
has been worth it

227
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,180
to get me to this moment!

228
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,620
Josuke: Dick! I knew you
were a stingy son of a bitch,

229
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,620
but this takes it
to a new level!

230
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,650
All right, fine. I will have
the same thing he’s having.

231
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,220
Tonio: Ho capito.

232
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,920
That said...

233
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,990
The only one getting his
stiff shoulder corrected today

234
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,530
will be the gentleman
sitting to your left.

235
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,530
Josuke: Huh?

236
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,730
Okuyasu: Huh? Stiff shoulder?

237
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,570
But, you know,
I am starting to get

238
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,500
a little bit hot
under the collar,

239
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,940
and, for some reason,
i’m all sweaty.

240
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,010
Tonio: Signore...

241
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,610
Might I humbly suggest
you remove your jacket?

242
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,650
Okuyasu: What the hell?

243
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,620
Why am I so itchy
all of a sudden?!

244
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,620
( Wails )

245
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,520
What’s going on?

246
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,030
What’s all this flaky stuff
sticking to my fingers?!

247
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,600
Tonio: Semplice. It’s dead skin.

248
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,200
Okuyasu: Dead skin?!

249
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,170
Tonio: This is proof
that we’ve greatly improved

250
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,940
your metabolic function
and circulation.

251
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,100
The calcium, vitamins,
and minerals of the antipasto

252
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,710
have stimulated your thyroid

253
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,140
and its metabolic
hormone secretion.

254
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,540
Okuyasu: God damn it...

255
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,240
Tonio: The harmful cells
are being expelled

256
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,310
as dead skin, which is
why you’ve been overcome

257
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,810
with an itching sensation.

258
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,680
Tonio: Molto bene, signore.

259
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,080
Keep scratching like that,

260
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,020
because at the rate
you’re going,

261
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,160
the dead skin’ll be gone
in no time.

262
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,890
( Okuyasu whimpering )

263
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,230
( Screams )

264
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,730
Josuke: Okuyasu! Come on, man.
You have to cut it out!

265
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,730
This dead skin’s
the size of a softball!

266
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,170
You’re digging
into your shoulder’s muscle now!

267
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,170
Okuyasu: N-no!

268
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,910
You’re wrong, josuke!

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,770
I’m so limber!

270
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,740
My shoulder
is crazy flexible now.

271
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,250
It’s so springy and light,
it’s almost like i’m floating.

272
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,020
( Sighs ) Check it out.

273
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,690
My shoulders have never
been supple enough

274
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,350
to bend around like this.

275
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,220
It’s almost like
I don’t have any bones at all.

276
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,630
( Laughs ) The stiffness I had
is good and gone!

277
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,290
Tonio: Hmm.

278
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,700
( Ball thumps )

279
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,600
If you’ll excuse me,

280
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,170
i’ll be heading
back to the kitchen.

281
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,670
That pasta isn’t going
to get up and serve itself

282
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,300
while we stand here and chat.

283
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,610
( Okuyasu sighs )

284
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,640
He’s amazing!

285
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,080
Actually, he’s incredible.

286
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,210
We should come here
to eat more often!

287
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,280
( Josuke thinking )
I don’t think so.

288
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,950
This is getting way too freaky.

289
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,290
There is something seriously
weird about this guy’s cooking.

290
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,190
With the next dish?

291
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,190
This is the primo piatto.

292
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,370
Today is pasta,
spaghetti alla puttanesca.

293
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,100
Narrator:
Known as "whore’s pasta,"

294
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,540
this dish supposedly
originated with prostitutes,

295
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,840
who favored
its easy preparation.

296
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,870
While cheese
is not usually added

297
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,440
to pasta prepared with garlic,

298
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,510
this dish is
a notable exception.

299
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,020
Okuyasu:
This spaghetti, am I crazy,

300
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,550
or does it
have chili flakes in it?

301
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,120
Tonio: An astute observation.

302
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,920
The special sauce
used in spaghetti puttanesca

303
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,560
is one of the oldest recipes
found in Italian cuisine.

304
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,390
And not to brag,
but my hometown, napoli,

305
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,100
is considered its birthplace,
so of course I give it

306
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,570
the highest possible
recommendation.

307
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,000
Okuyasu: Aw, you should
have said that earlier.

308
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,370
I can’t eat anything spicy.

309
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,010
The only kind
of curry rice I can handle

310
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,180
is that mild Vermont curry
that has apples and honey in it.

311
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,480
Oh, and don’t get me started
on wasabi with Sushi.

312
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,150
Ehh...

313
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,880
Agh! I can’t do it!
It’s too spicy!

314
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,880
It’s like eating fire!

315
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,890
Josuke: There’s

00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,950
I’m putting an end to this!

475
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,750
( Josuke gasps ) Oh, no.

476
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,050
Tonio:
Wash your disgusting hands

477
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,960
with soap this instant!

478
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,220
- Josuke: Eh?
- Tonio: Honestly,

479
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,330
entering a kitchen without
permission is inexcusable!

480
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,800
Ascolti.
Cleanliness in the kitchen

481
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,700
is priority one, amico mio!

482
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,630
Josuke: Wait. Wash my hands?

483
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,900
You aren’t trying to kill me?

484
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,800
Okuyasu: Hey, josuke,

485
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,310
it’s like my insides
have been rejuvenated.

486
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,240
Not only that,
i’m completely full

487
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,210
- and feel as fit as a fiddle.
- Josuke: Huh?!

488
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,010
Okuyasu: And best of all,
my diarrhea tummy’s all better!

489
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,580
Josuke: What?!

490
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,750
( Tonio chuckles )

491
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,920
Oh, my,
that’s wonderful to hear!

492
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,320
I love knowing that my cooking

493
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,020
brought happiness and health
to a customer.

494
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,990
Believe me when I tell you

495
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,160
there’s no greater sense of joy
and accomplishment for me

496
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,830
than nurturing a hungry soul.

497
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,860
- ( Dog barking )
- Okuyasu: Huh?

498
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,030
Josuke: Eh? The puppy.

499
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,230
Tonio: With such
unconventional flavors,

500
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,930
I wanted him
to taste-test it.

501
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,200
Our furry friend here

502
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,300
was having a bit
of a digestive problem, too.

503
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,240
Josuke: So you mean
you just wanted okuyasu

504
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,180
to eat a good meal?
You don’t have ulterior motives?

505
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,010
Tonio: Hmm? What else
could a chef want from a patron

506
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,810
but for them to enjoy the food?

507
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,920
The thought gets me out of bed
in the morning.

508
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,750
It’s everything
I could ever hope for.

509
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,750
Josuke: And to be clear,
you’re a stand user.

510
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,150
( Tonio gasps )

511
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,920
Josuke: We have them, too.

512
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,160
( Okuyasu chuckles )

513
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,660
Tonio: Oh!
I can’t believe my eyes!

514
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,630
( Stands gasp )

515
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,000
Tonio: Where to start?

516
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,060
A while back,
I was traveling the world

517
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,630
in search
of the perfect cuisine

518
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,030
when, out of the blue,

519
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,100
I discovered I had
these fantastical powers.

520
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,640
Never in my wildest dreams
would I have thought

521
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,710
i’d meet others
similar to myself.

522
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,780
Even so, that’s no excuse!

523
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,940
You have to possess
common sense!

524
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,880
You touched my kitchen without
washing your filthy hands!

525
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,350
If I was cross with you earlier,
it’s because i’m aware

526
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,950
that a kitchen’s worst enemy
is germs!

527
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,990
Josuke: What? Uh, oh, i’m sorry!

528
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,890
That didn’t even cross my mind.

529
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,330
Tonio: I hope you’re ready
to put in some work.

530
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,800
Now, shall we continue
the cooking?

531
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,200
Okuyasu: Dessert is pudding?

532
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,040
Hah! I’m too manly
for this stuff.

533
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,670
Well, i’ll eat it, but it
doesn’t mean i’m gonna like it.

534
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,780
Oh, my god!

535
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,340
You really are a genius!

536
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,080
You are amazing,
a brilliant artist.

537
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,250
Josuke: Yeah, yeah,
yuck it up, okuyasu.

538
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,390
Tonio: It sounds as though
he’s enjoying dessert.

539
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,890
- ( Dog barks )
- Hmm?

540
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,320
This kitchen isn’t
going to scrub itself!

541
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Josuke: Aw, man,
this is the worst.

542
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,100
Okuyasu:
My athlete’s foot is gone!

543
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,930
Tonio: I shall await
your return, my new friends.

544
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,000
Molte grazie.
