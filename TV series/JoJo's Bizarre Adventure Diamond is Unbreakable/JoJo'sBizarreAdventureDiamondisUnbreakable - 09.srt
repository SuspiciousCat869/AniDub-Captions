for himself!

478
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,740
Man: Well,
i’ll be a sea gull’s beak.

479
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,180
Did you see that?

480
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,650
Man #2: No, grandpa.

481
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,980
You’re not allowed
to have a drink. ( Hiccups )

482
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,520
- ( Bell rings )
- Narrator: Cape boing.

483
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,450
After apparently witnessing
a young woman jump to her death,

484
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,590
only to bounce off the rocks
below with a gentle boing,

485
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,090
a pair of fisherman
created an urban legend

486
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,230
and a new appellation.

487
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,100
Teacher: Hirose, I can tell

488
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,630
you really gave it your all
this time.

489
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,670
You get scores like that
when you study.

490
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,240
Koichi: Aw, man.

491
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,480

how I should feel about this.
