00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,910
You’re a true warrior,

164
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,980
and you’ll fight the good fight
to the bitter end.

165
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,050
I know better than to get close
to you, josuke higashikata.

166
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,280
Hayato: J-josuke!

167
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,790
( Josuke groans )

168
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,890
Hayato: Whoa, he’s still alive.

169
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,790
Kira: Hmph. A direct hit,
yet he remains fully intact.

170
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,060
There’s a slight lag when I
manually detonate the bomb,

171
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,830
but its potential
to cause damage is unparalleled.

172
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,370
my next attack
is going to seal the deal.

173
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,870
( Hayato groans ) Please!

174
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,540
I need you to get up now!

175
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,010
we have to find
somewhere safe to hide.

176
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,110
( Josuke groans )
We’re going the wrong direction.

177
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,410
I have to go back.

178
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,650
Hayato: Huh?

179
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,650
We’re going the wrong way.
Turn back!

180
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,550
I have to bash his brains in.

181
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,060
Bring me to that bastard,
yoshikage Kira.

182
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,860
My shining diamond can heal,
but its power won’t work on me.

183
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,170
That said, all the blood I lost
earlier has dried and hardened.

184
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,900
It’s matter like any other.

185
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,640
it’s just
not a part of me anymore.

186
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,440
I can grab a whole bunch of it

187
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,840
and stick it
to whatever I want.

188
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,380
In fact, I trapped some
inside a chunk of glass.

189
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,050
The rain stopped, so that
bloodstain on his jacket

190
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,880
should be good and dry by now.

191
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,790
Behold my wondrous creation!

192
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,820
it’s my own
homemade homing missile.

193

195
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,300

That was the piece of glass

196
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,940
I flicked away earlier.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,970
The blood on my jacket.
( Groans )

198
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,280
the damn glass
was pulled to the blood,

199
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,940
turning into a jagged bullet.

200
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,750
Hayato: Whoa! You got him good!

201
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,420
Your projectile lodged itself
right in his back!

202
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,920
( Josuke gasps )

203
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,720

( Kira groans )

205
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,360
his shining diamond is
really starting to irritate me.

206
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,000
that damn stand
is completely unpredictable.

207
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,630
Even so, after my attack,

208
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,970
josuke’s in much worse shape
than me.

209
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,040
One more shot!
Just one more shot,

210
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,310
and yoshikage Kira
will bask in victory!

211
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,340
( Stray cat hisses )

212
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,850
( Hayato screams )
Josuke, it’s here!

213
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,380
And, man, i’ve never
seen him make one this big!

214
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,250
I guess he’s
not messing around.

215
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,720
This has gotta be
his last-ditch attack.

216
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,230
Well, two can play at that game.
Here we go!

217
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,430
Hayato: What are you doing?

218
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,400
The same attack isn’t
gonna work on Kira twice!

219
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,730
You know that! He’ll deflect it!

220
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,830
Josuke: Maybe he will,

221
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,800
but we’ll never know
until we try, right?

222
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,440
By the way, hayato,
i’m sorry to bother you,

223
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,980
but I put that lighter
I was using back in my pocket.

224
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,010
Grab it for me.

225
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,380
I’d do it myself,

226
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,480
but this piece of wood
stuck in my side

227
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,020
is kind of getting in my way.

228
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,920
Hayato: You don’t need
to make smoke anymore!

229
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,690
You can already see
the air bullet, right?!

230
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,420
Josuke: You’ve got it all wrong.

231
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,890
I’m not using the lighter
to see the bullets.

232
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,660
It’s for something else
entirely. Trust me here.

233
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,660
Hayato: Huh?

234
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,630
Josuke: Time’s come.

235
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,740
I have to find out
how he knows where I am.

236
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Stay very still, hayato.

237
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,510
Hayato: Um, josuke?
What the heck are you--

238
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,910
josuke: Hold it
right there, hayato.

239
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,140
( Hayato moaning )

240
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,750
Josuke: I’m starting
to get the feeling

241
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,550
he’s not observing us
with his eyes.

242
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,220
He may be listening
to our every move.

243
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,420
Hayato: Huh?

244
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,650
Josuke: Kira was clutching
a cell phone.

245
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
Simple coincidence? Yeah, right.

246
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,330
So who was on the other end
of that call?

247
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,560
His boss from the office? Nah.

248
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,100
There’s only one person
in the world

249
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,230
Kira would call
at a time like this.

250
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,970
( Yoshihiro groans )

251
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,500
( Both yell )

252

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,310
( Hayato gasping )

254
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,610
Josuke: I’d almost forgotten

255
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,880
about you floating around,
you crusty old man.

256
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,320
Yoshikage kira’s
one and only savior,

257
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,320
his pathetic father.

258
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,790
Hayato: Wow, I had no idea he’d
snuck his way into my pocket.

259
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,860
so that’s it!
Now we have our answer.

260
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,900
( Gasps ) Oh, no!

261
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,030
It’s the air bullet!

262
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,400
it passed
right through the window!

263
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,030

i see josuke.

267
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,310

three meters forward.

Hayato: It completely
bypassed him!

271
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,620
Josuke: Keep going.
Now the fool’s moving

272
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,090
to the right and up,
three meters.

Did that vaporize josuke?

Is he dead?!

286
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,860

( Kira gasps )

288

Josuke: Now he’s floating
in the great beyond.

289
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
But he was already a ghost,

290
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,130

like you shipped him off

like a flower
in a tranquil field.

was never part of the plan.

can’t get any worse,
