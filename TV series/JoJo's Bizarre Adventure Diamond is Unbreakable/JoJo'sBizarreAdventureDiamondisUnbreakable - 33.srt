and behave yourself, understand?

478
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,820
( Terunosuke moans )

479
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,820
I-i’m a book.

480
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,020
Narrator: The young misterioso,
terunosuke miyamoto,

481
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,120
human book
and out of commission.

482
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,130
josuke never
bothered reading it,

483
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,330
but instead donated it
to the morioh library.

484
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,260
Mention misterioso
to any librarian,

485
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,130
and they’ll let you read it,
but borrowing it is forbidden.

486
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,370
Don’t be surprised
if you hear a faint voice

487
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,970
while perusing its pages.

488
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,340
josuke: Well,
that’s taken care of.

489
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,480
so why do I feel
like i’ve spoken too soon?

490
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,550
Koichi: At the very least,
this means we’ve gotten

491
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,550
one step closer
to capturing yoshikage Kira.

492
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,190
Josuke: Maybe, but we still
don’t have a single clue.

493
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,220
Yoshihiro: Damn it all!

494
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,490
They’re resilient
little crotch crawlers!

495
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,460
( Telephone line ringing )

496
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,000
Cheap trap: Calling your friends
for help isn’t going to work.

497
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,000
You have some photos
to burn now, yes?

498
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,340
( Telephone rings )

499
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,440
- Koichi: Huh?
- ( Ring )

500
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,340
jotaro: All right.
I’m heading out for a bit.

501
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,880
joseph: Hmm?
Where are you running off to?

502
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,450
jotaro: To go and find
our leads as soon as possible.

503
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,320
I’ll investigate where each
missing person was last seen.

504
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,990
No one can escape

505
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,560
from their innate personality
for very long.

506
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,590
He’ll make his move soon.

507
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,070
Hayato: I’ll catch him.

508
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,670
i’ll find proof
that he’s not my real dad.

509
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,540
I will.
