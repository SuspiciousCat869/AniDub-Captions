00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,500
Here.

161
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,560
this should get
you two beggars off my back.

162
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,900
It’s not like you did anything
to deserve this money.

163
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,140
Think of this handout
as a pity payment

164

neighborhood shige--

You jerk-off! Give it here!

168
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,780
You promised us
half the winnings,

169
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,520
so half is
what we’re gonna get!

170

You got off easy today,
greedy bastard!

Josuke: You always go straight
to using your fists.

173
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,090
You gotta control yourself.

174
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,760
Okuyasu: Talkin’ wasn’t
gonna work on him,

175
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,190
so I thought some manhandling
would do the trick!

too bad, are you?

I want to apologize for okuyasu.

179
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,130
He never should have hit you,
but this just proves it.

180
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,170
Our partnership
isn’t working out,

181
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,640
so I think we’ll hold on
to the promissory note.

182
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,810
That’ll be the best move
for everyone involved.

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,810
We’ll cash it in three days,
as planned.

184
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,710
After that’s done, we’ll split
the money the way we said,

185
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,010
and you’ll get half.

186

I am so over that asshole.

188

you stop to think about it,

191
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,990
we were the ones trying
to exploit him for pocket money.

192
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,560
We should consider
what that says about us.

193

- Okuyasu: You moron!
- Joseph: Huh?

194
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,570
Okuyasu: That’s not how I see
this situation at all.

195
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,500
the only reason
he got his filthy mitts

196
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,710
on the five million
was ’cause we helped him.

197
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,680
Without us, he’d be lucky
to even get a few thousand,

198
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,480
but instead he gets to
walk away with 2.5 million yen!

neither of you
is getting a single yen

209

210

of harvest’s amazing ability.

and your puny stands

compared to my harvest.

Want me to prove it to you?

215
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,090
We can go at it right now.
What do you say? ( Growls )

For the money!

to kill you,

225

sic your stand on us, already!

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,650
( Shigechi whimpers )

314
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,050
Okuyasu: You’ve done a real good
job of gettin’ on my bad side,

315
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,880
but i’m still willing
to forgive you.

316
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,150
first I wanna rearrange
that ugly mug of yours, though.

317
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,760
josuke: Come on.
Hand over that I.O.U., shigechi.

318
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,360
It’s over.

319
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,860
Shigechi: I told you two fools

320
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,160
if you chased me,

321
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,330
then i’d kill you.

322
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,330
Josuke: Eh?

323
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,830
( Shigechi chuckles )

324
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,770
Josuke: Wh-what’s going on?

325
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
My hands are...

326
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,170
( Sighs )

327
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,040
( Groans ) I can’t get up.

328
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,010
( Gags ) What’s wrong?

329
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,110
Okuyasu! He’s up to something!

330
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,120
You can’t let your guard down!

331
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,750
- ( Okuyasu groaning )
- Josuke: You, too?!

332
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,720
What’s he doing?!

333
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,290
shigechi: You mean
you haven’t figured it out yet?

334
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,860
The two of you are sloppy drunk,
courtesy of this little number!

335
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,290
( Josuke gasps )
Is that alcohol?!

336
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,860
Shigechi: My harvest
can get its hands

337
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,970
on anything
I order it to snatch,

338
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,030
so I had it grab some booze

339
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,370
when we ran
past the liquor store,

340
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,010
and when you
weren’t paying attention,

341
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,770
i injected the hooch
into your stupid, lying bodies.

342
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,440
Well, to be more specific,

343
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,310
I made it squirt
right into your veins.

344
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,310
Josuke: Wait! You what?! Uhh.

345
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,920
( Both gasp )

346
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,920
- Okuyasu: Aw, get off!
- ( Josuke grunting )

347
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,390
Shigechi: When alcohol
goes directly into the veins,

348
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,760
you don’t need that much until
you’re shitfaced and flailing.

349
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,330
Josuke: I knew alcohol could be
used as a makeshift anesthetic,

350
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,390
but I never thought a kid
would figure that out,

351
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,800
let alone use it
to whammy me like this!

352
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,800
Looks like he’s not
a total idiot after all.

353
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,900
No, it must be
his instinct again.

354
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,440
( Okuyasu groans )
He’s dead meat.

355
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,310
I might be a little tipsy,
but there’s no way

356
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,210
that’s gonna stop
me from ending you!

357
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,910
( Gasps )

358
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,850
- ( Screams ) My frickin’ eye!
- Josuke: No!

359
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,290
okuyasu: What are you
waitin’ for, josuke?! Fix it!

360
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,390
josuke: Shit!
Hang in there! I’m on it!

361
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,520
Shigechi: If i’m remembering
everything correctly,

362
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,530
you two dick-wads
called me a whole bunch

363
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,000
of shitty names earlier,
didn’t you?

364
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,830
I’m gonna show you what happens

365
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,770
when you try to pull the wool
over my eyes

366
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,300
and treat me like a dumb kid.

367
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,300
( Josuke groans ) Damn you.

368
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
You’re standing there
all high and mighty

369
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,110
when you breaking your promise
is what started this!

370
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,210
I’ve had about all I can take!

371
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,910
Keep this up, and you’re
not gonna like what comes next.

372
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,480
( Shigechi scoffs )
I think you’ve done

373
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,180
more than enough talkin’
for one life, jerk-suke,

374
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,550
and since your stand’s weak,

375
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,790
your bite can’t even
back up your puny bark.

376
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,190
actually,
both of your stands are shit,

377
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,230
so save the demands until you’re
half as strong as harvest.

378
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,990
’til then, take it in the eye!

379
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,800
Okuyasu: Quick, josuke!
close your eye!

380
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,830
- ( Josuke screams )
- Okuyasu: You okay?

381
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,530
Shigechi: Damn! So close.

382
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,470
there’s no point
in closing your eyes, f.Y.I.

383
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,370
Harvest can grab anything,
no matter the obstacle.

384
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,880
Shut those peepers
as tight as you want.

385
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,280
It’ll just tear off
your eyelids

386
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,280
and gouge out the eye.

387
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,980
Okuyasu: We get the point,
shigechi. Stop it!

388
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,420
Just forgive us already.

389
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,490
it’s not like
we wanted this to happen.

390
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,290
Shigechi: Huh?
Was that an apology?

391
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,490
Josuke: Damn it, kid!

392
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,830
i have had it
with your shitty attitude!

393
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,560
Shigechi: Hear that, okuyasu?
Josuke seems to be

394
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,500
on a completely different page
from you.

395
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,300
Okuyasu: Don’t worry about him!
He’ll come around! ( Pants )

396
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,030
But how about we give you this?

397
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,440
( Shigechi gasps )

398
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,540
Okuyasu: It’s the 10,000 yen
you gave me,

399
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,040
plus everything else
I have on me right now.

400
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,880
Take it as our penance for all
the trouble we’ve caused.

401
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,310
please, shigechi, i’m
begging you not to off josuke!

402
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,880
If he gets taken out,
who’ll fix my eye?

403
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,250
( Josuke gasps ) Okuyasu.

404
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,850
Shigechi: Huh? Oh, yeah.

405
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,920
i almost forgot
I gave you that little handout.

406
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,520
I felt so bad for you beta boys,

407
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,360
i decided
the only right thing to do

408
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,360
was bless you
with over 10,000 yen.

409
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,360
okuyasu: Here!
The money’s all yours.

410
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,030
Just have mercy on us,
o strong one!

411
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,370
- ( Shigechi chuckles )
- ( Josuke gasps )

412
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,600
( Okuyasu grunting )

413
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,010
Josuke: Way to use your brain.

414
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,470
You’re trying to lure him in

415
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,410
like catching a raccoon
with a bit of bait!

416
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,910
Once he closes the distance,
bam, you’ll let him have it.

417
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,080
Well, i’ve got your back, buddy.

418
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,620
Go for it, man.
Work your magic.

419
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,420
Shigechi: That’s a good boy.

420
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,050
I don’t know where this newfound
obedience is coming from,

421
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,290
but i’m glad
you know the pecking order.

422
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,030
( Giggling )

423
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,400
Eh? Something wonky’s going on.

424
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,100
Hey, now, okuyasu,

425
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,570
it feels like you’re trying
to lure me in with cash

426
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,340
so you can
attack me with your stand.

427
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,410
But you wouldn’t do that,
would you, old pal?

428
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,910
Ahh! So you were
trying to trick me!

429
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,680
Did you think i’d honestly fall

430
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,650
for a harebrained scheme
as lame as that one?

431
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,420
you must think
i’m some kind of idiot.

432
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,520
Well, no pity for you.

433
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,120
Okuyasu: It’s not like
we needed it anyway.

434
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,590
Time’s run out for you,
little man.

435
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,630
i guess you were
too busy flapping your gums

436
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,530
like a dumb-ass
to realize that you walked

437
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,060
right into the hand’s
striking range!

438
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,630
I’ll claw away the air
and make it teleport,

439
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,170
forcing the ticket out
of your hands and back to us.

440
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,140
Josuke: This ticket is ours.

441
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,040
Shigechi: It belongs with you?

442
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,140
do you know
who you’re talking to?

443
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,210
( Chuckles ) Idiots.
You wasted your time,

444
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,710
’cause i’m about
to take it back.

445
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,950
Josuke: Incredible. You’re
even dumber than I thought.

446
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,380
Your chance of winning
just expired,

447
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,720
and you never saw it coming.

448
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,320
Shigechi: My money!

449
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,360
what do you think
you’re doing to that ticket?!

450
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,690
It’s worth five million yen,

451
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,590
and you’re ripping it up
like it’s trash!

452
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,730
Why would you do that?!
I don’t get you in the least!

453
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
What was the point in going
through all this hoopla

454
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,670
if you were just going
to rip it up when you

455
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,570
- finally got your way?!
- Josuke: Because of you.

456
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,970
I needed a surefire way to stop
you from attacking us again.

457
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,440
Since you can’t
restore the ticket

458
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,480
without my shining diamond,
giving up is your best bet.

459
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,050
the fight’s over.
Accept it, and stand down.

460
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,050
Shigechi: Oh, I get it now.
That’s what you’re doing.

461
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,980
Josuke: And off they go!

462
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,050
your victory’s
blowing away in the wind.

463
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,390
Shigechi: I take it all back!
I don’t get any of this!

464
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,120
Why would you throw away
five million yen?!

465
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,330
Have you lost your mind?!

466
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,730
Harvest, bring back
every last piece! Go!

467
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,730
♪

468
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,270
josuke: Holy shit,
you really don’t get it, do you?

469
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,270
Sending harvest on a fetch quest

470
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,770
was the final nail
in your coffin.

471
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,440
okuyasu:
Your last line of defense

472
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,740
is running through the city
looking for paper scraps,

473
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,580
so who’s gonna protect you
from these drunks, huh?

474
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,020
Shigechi: I think I get it now.

475
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,520
( Okuyasu panting )

476
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,260
( Chuckles ) We did it.

477
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,320
Josuke: Since I caught you
lying down on the job,

478
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,390
why don’t we try and
get in a bit of study time?

479
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,360
The scraps of paper
floating around town

480
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,230
are picked up by your harvest,
but after that,

481
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,500
who has the power
to put them back together? Hmm?

482
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,240
I need an answer.

483
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,310
Who can put the scraps back
together with shining diamond?

484
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,810
Shigechi: Y-you, josuke.

485
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,380
Josuke: "Josuke"?!

486
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,050
sounds to me like
you’re forgetting something!

487
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,610
Shigechi: Yes, Mr. Josuke, sir.

488
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,820
Josuke: Ah, now that’s
what I like to hear.

489
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,480
And i’m sure you know the name

490
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,220
of the person who recovered
that I.O.U. From you.

491
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,420
Well? Say his name, half pint.

492
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,660
Shigechi: It’s okuyasu...

493
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,190
- ( Okuyasu growls )
- Shigechi: The great!

494
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,230
josuke: Good.
That’s our special man.

495
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,500
So what do you say we change
subjects and do a little math?

496
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,470
How do we split five million
between three people?

497
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,070
And remember, everyone has to be
happy when all is said is done.

498
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,670
Shigechi: Well,
i’m fine with half.

499
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,580
josuke: Half, huh?!
Did I or did I not just tell you

500
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,140
there are three of us
to consider?

501
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,650
How are each of us
supposed to get

502
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,180
half of the winnings, shigechi?

503
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,380
Good thing we’re studying,

504
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,480
because your math
needs some work, dude!

505
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
( Shigechi stammering )

506
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,650
Both: Anyone home?!

507
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,760
Shigechi: Uh...

508
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,090
i guess i’ll
be okay with a third.

509
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,690
Huh?

510
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,430
Now that I think about it,

511
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,130
without your help, i’d still
be collecting old stamps.

512
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,370
Both: Hmm?

513
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,340
Shigechi: I was acting
like a spoiled brat.

514
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,810
We all found that lottery ticket
by working as a team.

515
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,280
If we hadn’t banded together,
we never would’ve pulled it off.

516
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,710
Wow, it’s starting
to make sense.

517
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,150
my greed kept me
from seeing the big picture.

518
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,820
Let’s split everything
fair and square

519
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,790
so we all get what we want.

520
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,750
( Both chuckle )

521
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,120
- Josuke: There we go!
- ( Okuyasu laughs )

522
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,630
Shigechi: I’ve never seen
so much money before!

523
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,860
Okuyasu: It’s five million yen!

524
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,400
Banker: If you’re
interested in a home

525
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,860
for your newly acquired wealth,

526
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,400
your funds would be very secure
at budogaoka bank.

527
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,630
Josuke: You bet
we’re interested!

528
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,330
Okuyasu: We finally did it!

529
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,900
It’s like i’m dreaming!

530
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,270
Shigechi: I have a question.
Didn’t we agree

531
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,610
to split the winnings
between the three of us?

532
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,240
- josuke: Huh?
- Shigechi: Hear me out.

533
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,540
In the interest of maintaining

534
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,250
a fair and just agreement
between us partners,

535
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,250
wouldn’t it be best to include
our stands in this deal?

536
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,650
I mean, fair is fair, after all.

537
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,860
And since harvest is made up
of about 500 mini-stands,

538
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,460
we should split the pot
500 to one to one.

539
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,400
- That’s not an issue, is it?
- ( Both growl )

540
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,730
Josuke: You’re unbelievable!

541
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,470
okuyasu: I thought
you’d learned your lesson,

542
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,730
but you just don’t know
when to stop haggling, do you?!

543
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,270
Shigechi: I was
only messing around!

544
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,200
A third is fine!

545
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,510
Narrator: For some,
that’s far too much money

546
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,540
for high schoolers to have,
but c’est la vie.
