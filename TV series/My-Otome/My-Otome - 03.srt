Are you seriously
thinking of fighting Nina?

164
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,458
[ARIKA]
Of course I am!

165
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,666
[SERGEY]
You're being foolish.

166
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,083
Nina's very strong.

167
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,750
And since it's your
first time with a Robe,

168
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,833
you have no chance of winning.

169
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,583
I already made up my mind!

170
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,500
I'll become an Otome!

171
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,583
Being an Otome's my dream!

172
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,458
Hmph. Dream, huh?

173
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,208
Tell me, do you really
know what's involved?

174
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,375
Do you have any idea what it
takes to become an Otome?

175
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,875
Besides, even if
you somehow win,

176
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,458
you'll be crushing
the dreams of Nina,

177
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:14,291
who has endured strenuous
training to enter the academy.

178
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,041
Is your dream really
worth that much to you?

179
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,041
Grandma always told me,

180
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,708
"It's important to have a
dream, no matter what.

181
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,041
And once you have a dream,
never give it up."

182
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,708
Back then, I didn't
understand what she meant.

183
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,250
But you know?

184
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,375
I came here and saw the Meister
Otome's battle, and I knew!

185
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,375
"This is it! Yeah!"

186
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,333
I finally found my dream.

187
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,458
So I'll keep chasing
after it, no matter what.

188
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,666
[SERGEY]
I understand.

189
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,083
I won't say another word.

00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,958
Keep chasing after your dream.

191

Well, duh!

By the way.

That song...

195
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,875
[ARIKA] Oh, my grandmother
sang it to me all the time.

196
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,416
She told me it was
a really old lullaby.

197
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,833
[SERGEY]
Do you know all the words?

198
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,041
Just the one part.

199
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,750
Grandma told me
my mother also

200
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,875
used to sing it
to me a lot.

201
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,625
[SERGEY] Then let me
fill you in on something...

202
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,625
What's that?

203
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,291
Do you know the
rest of the words?

204
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,625
Nope.

205
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,458
It's just that your singing
is a little off key.

206
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,166
You'd be wise not to
sing in front of people.

207
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,541
I should--Ugh!

208

[ARIKA]

209

[SERGEY] It's very unlikely,
but just in case,

But we're not allowed.

00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:32,958
No way.

You have a TV in your dorm.

But it's too crowded in there.

00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,375
Do your best, Nina!

322
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,833
Both of you, listen.

323
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,000
Show me your best
performance and dance power!

324
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,041
Begin!

325
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,041
[ARIKA yelps]

326
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:28,958
[ARIKA]
Whoa...

327
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,833
[ARIKA screams]

328
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,708
[ARIKA screams]

329
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,458
[CROWD chattering]

330
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,833
Nina's incredible.

331
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,458
But so is Arika.

332
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,125
Shizuru! Shizuru?

333
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,541
[SHIZURU]
That's far enough.

334
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,416
Would you be one of
those poor people

335
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,166
who follow the Black Letter?

336
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,208
Are you dancing to their tune?

337
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:21,250
[RAD] Do not associate me
with those Schwartz fools.

338
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,708
[SHIZURU] Well, then,
who am I addressing?

339
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,041
[RAD] A messenger
from the Black Valley.

340
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,333
My goodness.

341
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,916
Such disgraceful rudeness
in front of a lady.

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,250
Since you don't have an
appreciation for elegance,

343
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,708
I'll have to teach you. 

344
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,791
Materialize!

345
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,958
[RAD] Huh! The Bewitching
Smile Amethyst, is it?

346
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,458
You will be a worthy opponent!

347
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,166
[ARIKA yells]

348
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,250
Arika's doing quite well.

349
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,166
I suppose so, for a rookie.

350
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,208
[ARIKA yells]

351
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,500
[ARIKA screams]

352
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,375
[NINA] There's a chance
you might be the successor

353
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,291
to the Blue Sky Sapphire.

354
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,125
And if that's really true...

355
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,208
--[NATSUKI] No!
--[SERGEY] Not that!

356
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,291
I can't afford to lose to you!

357
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,125
[MASHIRO gasps]

358
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,208
[ERSTIN, IRINA gasp]

359
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,583
Grandma told me...

360
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,708
"If you give up, it's over."

361
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,458
And so...

362
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,166
[LILIE]
Does she still plan to fight?

363
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,541
[MIYA]
Maybe that girl is strong...

364
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,625
Well...

365
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,916
This is the place where
all my dreams are.

366
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,250
That's why...

367
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,916
...I can't let myself lose!

368
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,958
[NINA]
Huh?

369
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,541
[RAD]
You're good.

370
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,875
How about this?!

371
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:03,958
[ALL gasp]

372
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,041
Queen Mashiro!

373
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,583
Quick! Nina!
Come protect His Highness!

374
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,416
[CROWD screaming]

375
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
E-Everyone! Run! Go!

376
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,333
[ARIKA]
I have to save them!

377
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,458
I have to!

378
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,166
[NATSUKI] Episode 4 is next.
I got a bad feeling about it.

379
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,416
[ARIKA]
Why's that?

380
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
[SHIZURU] Because when
Natsuki was a student,

381
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,500
her underwear--

382
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,750
[NATSUKI]
Gah! Shut up, Shizuru!

383
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,250
[SHIZURU] Don't worry,
if something happens,

384
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,708
I'll cover it with my hands.

385
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,291
[NATSUKI]
That would also be a problem!

386
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,125
[ARIKA] Isn't anyone gonna talk
about what I'm going through?
