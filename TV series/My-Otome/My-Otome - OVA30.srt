1
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,708
[NATSUKI] A weapon that's
designed to destroy planets?

2
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,250
Yes.

3
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,375
Meister Nao Zhang forwarded
the data from the ruins to us

4
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,666
along with her request
to materialize.

5
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,500
From that, we were
able to identify it

6
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,666
as an ancient weapon
called Yuna.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,625
[GAL] It's been programmed
to gain power over time

8
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,291
and become
exponentially stronger.

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,666
At the same time,
it deploys Sub-Unit Monsters

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,250
known as Childs
in order to attack.

11
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,833
[IRINA]
After a while,

12
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:52,000
it evolves into the strongest
being on the planet and then...

13
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,250
...it destroys everything.

14
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,708
[roars]

15
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,375
Do you know why it woke up now?

16
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,708
This is only a guess,

17
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,291
but I believe that due to
its incredible strength,

18
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,083
its creator was
unable to control it

19
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,791
and shot it into space.

20
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,083
At this rate, the world will...

21
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,833
[NAGI] It'll be the end...
of everything.

22
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,500
How could this happen, Nina?

23
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,000
I only need Father!
I don't need anyone else!

24
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:43,916
[screams]

25
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,791
[MIKOTO] The cat food looks
delicious too, Big Brother.

26
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,125
[gasps]

27
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,000
I tried making it using
ingredients I could get

28
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,500
from the sea around us.

29
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,875
Would you mind giving it a try?

30
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,625
You're pretty creative
considering our situation.

31
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,333
[RIBBON] We could add these to
the Cat God Ramen Noodles menu!

32
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,833
Oh, hey there!

33
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,166
Good morning, Nina!
I thought you'd never get up!

34
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,875
Queen Mashiro?

35
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,958
[CAPTAIN A] This is Vergilius
of Remus. We're moving out!

36
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,000
[CAPTAIN B] Wait a minute,
we were gonna move out first!

37
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,750
[CAPTAIN A]
Don't talk back to us, Romulus!

38
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,875
[CONTROLLER A]
Everyone, please!

39
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,500
You must wait for
your turn to depart!

40
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,875
[LAULA]
We can't sit here waiting!

41
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,916
[CARLA]
That's right!

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,458
[NATSUKI]
We'll be returning to Wind.

43
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,458
What are you planning
to do, Arika?

44
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,875
I'm gonna continue searching
for Mashiro and the others

45
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,208
for as long as I can.

46
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,166
Right now, I can't use
my Otome powers anyway.

47
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,708
Understood.

48
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,375
Garderobe will handle matters
within the city. All right?

49
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,041
Thank you very much,
Headmistress.

50
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,083
[GAL]
Hey, Arika!

51
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,458
[ARIKA]
Gal!

52
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:33,000
[GAL] Good news from our leader!
Come on, let's ride!

53
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,541
[NAGI]
All right then.

54
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,541
[chuckles]

55
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,875
Hey, you guards!
Bring me a phone!

56
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,291
I need to talk with
the Headmistress

57
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,416
of Garderobe right away!

58
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,125
[MIDORI] A legend from long ago
has led me to this point.

59
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,375
The Black Valley is on the
other side of that storm.

60
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,375
We can't pass even
with Gakutenou.

61
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,291
It almost feels like
a fading dream.

62
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,958
[ARIKA]
Leader!

63
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,083
[MIDORI]
Hm?

64
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,666
[ARIKA]
Leader!

65
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,875
Is it true?

66
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,041
I heard that you got
a message from Mashiro!

67
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,708
I did. This is the letter.

68
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,166
"I am trapped on an island
surrounded by a giant storm.

69
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,666
You must hurry and come get me."

70
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,416
Mashiro...

71
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,041
[MAI]
Hmm... So that's what happened.

72
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,500
[NINA]
Yes.

73
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:30,500
Oh, um, excuse me. I didn't
mean to eat everything...

74
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,083
You must've been
really starving, huh?

75
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,541
By the way, Nina, did Arika...
did she say anything to you?

76
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,666
I'm sorry to
disappoint you, but...

77
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,666
...I'm afraid I didn't get
the chance to see Arika.

78
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,958
[MASHIRO]
Oh.

79
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,166
Just what does Arika think
she's doing, anyway?

80
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,833
She doesn't understand
my hardships.

81
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,000
It's like she's not maturing

82
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,666
except for in the
size of her breasts.

83
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,708
Aw, Mashiro,
you're really lonely

84
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,291
without Arika here, aren't you?

85
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:55,958
[RIBBON]
Right!

86
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,541
Uh! That's not true!

87
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,291
Now that I come to
think of it, Nina,

88
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,291
You should've been my Otome
right from the start!

89
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,208
No... I don't think so.

90
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,958
[MASHIRO gasps]

91
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,416
[MASHIRO] Never mind,
I'm going for a walk.

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,916
[MAI, RIBBON laugh]

93
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,541
Arika, we're heading back
to protect the village.

94
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,791
Will you be able to keep
going on your own?

95
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,208
Don't worry, I'll be fine!

96
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,833
Thank you so much for your help!

97
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,250
[GAL] Arika, you've got
a good game face on.

98
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,166
Now go get 'em!

99
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,166
Thank you, Professor Gal!

100
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,208
[ARIKA]
I'm on my way, Mashiro.

101
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,666
[ARIKA]
Ugh. But how?

102
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,541
I mean, I don't even know
if I can swim very far...

103
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,750
[bell chiming]

104
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,875
[ARIKA]
Huh?

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,083
What is that?

106
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,791
[gasps]

107
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,750
Ah!

108
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,875
[RIBBON]
Bam, bam!

109
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,416
May I have some, please?

110
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,958
[NINA] Black Valley really
is a mysterious place.

111
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,666
[RIBBON] The Cat Goddess
showed me how to do that.

112
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,791
[RIBBON]
Miss Nina?

113
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,625
Does Queen Mashiro not
like Miss Arika anymore?

114
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,250
[NINA]
Huh?

115
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,041
Of course not. Not a chance.

116
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,166
Despite what it might look like,
those two get along really well.

117
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,708
[RIBBON]
Really?!

118
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,375
[NINA] Yes. That's why they
end up fighting all the time.

119
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,125
They're more like
childhood friends

120
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,791
than a queen and her Otome.

121
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,250
[RIBBON]
Ohh.

122
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,375
But I really envy Otomes.

123
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:36,000
All of them are beautiful
and strong! They're so cool!

124
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,000
It's not really what you think.

125
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:43,958
Obtaining that sort of power can
actually be a frightening thing.

126
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,583
If you take one wrong step,

127
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,416
you might end up
making a major mistake

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,916
that can never be fixed again.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,208
[RIBBON] Oh, I get it!
So it's the same as this, then?

130
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,541
But that's--!

131
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,708
You have one too?

132
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,625
[rumbling]

133
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,041
[gasps]

134
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,000
What's going on?!

135
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,333
[RIBBON whimpers]

136
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,958
[RIBBON]
The mountain!

137
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,958
[MAI]
Hm?

138
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,708
The mountain's crying?

139
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,041
Huh?

140
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,916
It's coming...

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,458
The dragon that broke through
from the other world...

142
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,708
This is bad! Where are
Mashiro and Nina?

143
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,708
[NATSUKI] Give me a status
report on all nations!

144
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,333
[IRINA] Delta Otome Unit
in Aries: Standing by.

145
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,458
Meister Laula and Meister Carla
are standing by in Lutesia

146
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,458
at the border between
Romulus and Remus.

147
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,958
Meister Anh in Annam:
Standing by.

148
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,291
Florince and Cardair are both
ready to attack as well.

149
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,250
[NATSUKI] And the countries
without Meisters?

150
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,750
[IRINA]
Meister Sara in Windbloom

151
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,625
and Meister Mahya in Artai
have both moved into position

152
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,750
for the attack.

153
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,791
The Surrogate System
is also ready.

154
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,041
We can take action at any time.

155
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,625
[NATSUKI]
All right.

156
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,583
There is a high probability
that the Childs will hatch

157
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,291
if we attack.

158
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,625
[YUKINO]
That's true.

159
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,041
But even if we wait,
they will eventually hatch.

160
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,333
We should take the initiative.

161
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,416
That's the consensus from
the representatives.

162
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,416
Yes, very well.

163
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,833
May the Predecessor's
grace be upon us.

164
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,291
Give word to begin the attack.

165
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,416
Certify Sara and
Mahya's contracts.

166
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,291
Yes, ma'am. Activating
the Surrogate System.

167
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,166
I need your
authorization, Mikoto!

168
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,375
Materialize!

169
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,083
Evacuate to the mountain!

170
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,625
But Her Majesty is
still out there!

171
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,041
I know that!

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,166
[IRINA]
It doesn't look like we're able

173
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,791
to inflict any kind of
critical damage on them.

174
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,541
I just hope that we can defeat
them before they hatch.

175
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,250
Annoying sprouts, aren't they?

176
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,958
[GAL]
Sorry I'm late!

177
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,458
What is that?

178
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,250
It's the Predecessor Fumi?!

179
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,958
[YOHKO] Strong certification
wave confirmed!

180
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,250
[IRINA]
Lady Fumi is reacting!

181
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,583
[GAL]
Our server is being hacked!

182
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,458
Link confirmed between
Lady Fumi and the Childs!

183
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,750
It's constantly supplying them

184
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,541
with high level
materializing energy!

185
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,333
So that's it. That's
how it's doing this!

186
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,083
Professor! Sever the
connection immediately!

187
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,416
[GAL]
I can't do it!

188
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,250
The administrator's taken
control of the network!

189
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,250
[YOHKO]
Look!

190
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,708
The Childs in each
of the countries

191
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,958
all of them have
begun to hatch!

192
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,541
No! Mai!

193
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,833
[MASHIRO screams]

194
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,208
[screams]

195
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,000
Arika!

196
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,250
[ARIKA]
Mashiro!

197
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,416
Hang on, Mashiro!

198
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,875
Arika!

199
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,666
I'm almost there!

200
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,375
Mashiro, the authorization!

201
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,708
I know!

202
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,500
The power of the Blue
Sky hasn't returned!

203
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,666
[CARLA yells]

204
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,166
Damn it! It's like there's
no end to this fight!

205
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,958
[IRINA] It's just like
what happened in Aries!

206
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,791
The Childs are
restoring themselves.

207
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,541
Damn it! There's gotta be
a way to stop them, but what?

208
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,875
Ugh! What is it?

209
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,666
You bastard.

210
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,916
What did you say?

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,416
I said there's a way
to stop those Childs.

212
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,166
You're in a bit
of trouble, right?

213
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,333
And I have an idea
how to save you.

214
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,458
Do you want to hear it?

215
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,958
But of course under
one condition.

216
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,416
[growls]

217
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,750
[NATSUKI]
Just hurry up and tell me!

218
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,291
[ARIKA]
No!

219
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,250
[screams]

220
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,708
[RIBBON]
I'm scared!

221
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:20,333
[MIKOTO meowing]

222
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,958
[RIBBON]
Your Majesty!

223
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,583
[NINA]
Wait! Where are you going?

224
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,583
[RIBBON]
I'm gonna fight too!

225
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,416
No, you mustn't!

226
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,291
[RIBBON] But I have to!
It's the only thing I can do!

227
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,333
I like Queen Mashiro
and Miss Arika a lot!

228
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,833
And I also like Miss Nina,

229
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,541
and Meister Mai,
and the Cat Goddess,

230
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,666
and the cat,
and the dolphin too!

231
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,000
That's why I wanna protect them!

232
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,750
Because all of them
are my friends!

233
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,791
[gasps]

234
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,375
[RIBBON]
Miss Nina?

235
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,791
You can put that thing away.
I am going to fight instead.

236
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,208
[RIBBON]
Huh?

237
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,208
[RIBBON]
Ah! Then Miss Nina, you're a--!

238
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,708
I will never make the
same mistake again.

239
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,125
I'm going to give you a future.

240
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,458
Let's go!

241
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,916
A contract? You and me?

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,875
It's the Neptune Emerald.

243
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,166
Please make me your Otome,
even if it is just this once.

244
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,458
But...

245
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,500
[NINA] I've regretted
the mistakes I made.

246
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,458
And I became afraid of
the power of the Otome.

247
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,333
No, actually, the idea
of power itself.

248
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,083
But I want to
protect my friends.

249
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,625
So please...

250
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,500
You mean you're willing
to trust me as your master?

251
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,583
I am.

252
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,041
You were the one who
was able to stop

253
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,083
both Grand Duke Nagi and myself.

254
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,791
I trust you and Arika.

255
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,333
I know we all think the same.

256
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,291
I understand.

257
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:18,291
Nina Wang. Hear me, my Otome
of the Neptune Emerald.

258
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,708
In my name, I hereby
release your powers!

259
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,541
Stay here and be a
good girl, all right?

260
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,375
Just leave the fighting
to us Otomes.

261
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,791
Materialize!

262
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,500
[RIBBON]
Wow! So cool!

263
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,208
I'm counting on you, Nina!

264
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,375
[yells]

265
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,083
Wait, but that's--!

266
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,041
It's Nina...

267
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,958
[NINA] Your defense is
full of holes as always.

268
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,333
I can't bear to watch it,
so I may as well help you out.

269
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,375
It's really you?

270
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,375
[ARIKA]
Nina!

271
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,666
Arika!

272
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,583
Mashiro!

273
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,708
[MASHIRO]
Arika!

274
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,416
What happened to the
Blue Sky's power?

275
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
[ARIKA]
It's gone...

276
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,208
Arika, I want you to slap me.

277
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,333
[ARIKA]
Huh?

278
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay, but only if you
do the same to me too!

279
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,916
Hit me again the next time
I make a mistake like that.

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,458
Yeah, same goes for me too.

281
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't hold back, okay?

282
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,166
You betcha!

283
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,166
[RIBBON]
Good luck!

284
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,708
Yep! You can just
leave it to me!

285
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,375
Let's do it, Arika!

286
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,875
Give my Otome the
power of the Blue Sky!

287
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,458
[RIBBON]
Power!

288
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,916
Blue Sky!

289
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,333
[IRINA] We've found the
coordinates of Cat God Mountain!

290
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,583
We're detecting
high-level materialization

291
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,750
from Gems and Yuna!

292
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,375
What's that?

293
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,958
Confirming it now.

294
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,750
The Fire Stirring Ruby, Meister
Mai, is in combat with a Child.

295
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,875
I also detect Arika,
the Blue Sky Sapphire Zwei.

296
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,000
And the other is...

297
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,833
It's the lost Gem!
The Neptune Emerald.

298
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,250
[NATSUKI]
A lost Gem? Who's the Otome?

299
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,625
It-It's Nina!

300
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,708
Nina?

301
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,791
[gasps]

302
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,416
[NATSUKI]
Nina Wang?

303
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,916
[yells]

304
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,708
Got her!

305
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,208
No way!

306
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,458
[NINA growls]

307
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,000
[NATSUKI] Arika, Nina,
Mai, can you hear me?

308
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,541
Natsuki?

309
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,416
[NATSUKI] We've been able to
pick up on your signal again.

310
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,458
Listen, we're about to
commence a new operation

311
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,875
in order to counterattack.

312
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,958
I want everyone to
listen in on this.

313
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,250
The Childs and Yuna are able
to resurrect themselves

314
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,958
because they've absorbed
the Predecessor.

315
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,208
In a moment, we'll be using

316
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,875
the last core cylinder
of the Surrogate System

317
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,291
in order to sever
the connection.

318
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,125
However, we only
have 120 seconds.

319
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,375
All the Childs and Yuna
need to be defeated

320
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,750
within that timeframe.

321
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,791
Can you do it?

322
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,708
No, you have to do it.

323
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,708
It's the only hope of
protecting this planet

324
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,875
and the world's future.

325
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,958
I never knew you were this big
of a gambler, Headmistress.

326
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,875
Now, about releasing me
from this place... Uh?

327
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:15,541
Hello?

328
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,041
Hey, wait a minute!

329
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,791
Let's do this. Activate
the Surrogate System.

330
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,416
Connect it to the
Valkyrie Circuit!

331
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,166
[GAL]
Starting contact!

332
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,208
[IRINA] Activating certification
jamming system.

333
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,833
Begin countdown.

334
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,416
Run now!

335
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,458
[screams]

336
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,541
[RIBBON]
Your Majesty!

337
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,250
No! Mashiro!

338
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,791
Arika!

339
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,833
Now what are we gonna do?

340
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:20,958
[MASHIRO] Don't worry about me!
Do what you have to do, Arika!

341
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:23,916
[ARIKA gasps]

342
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,833
Mashiro!

343
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,000
[MASHIRO]
You and I aren't the same,

344
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,125
but that's exactly why
we can come together

345
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,541
when it really counts.

346
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,750
And when that happens,

347
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,000
we have to keep going
without hesitation!

348
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,125
Right, Arika?

349
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,541
You're my Otome!

350
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,916
Of course, Master.

351
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
You can't be thinking
of attacking!

352
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,833
[ARIKA]
Come on, let's do it, Nina!

353
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,708
If anyone can do it,
we certainly can!

354
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,583
You and Mashiro... it's like
you were made for each other.

355
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,708
A queen and her Otome.

356
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,041
[IRINA]
Ten more seconds!

357
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,000
[yells]

358
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,708
Arika...

359
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,625
Damn you!

360
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:22,833
[MAI]
Huh?

361
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,208
System down!

362
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,708
What about Yuna?
Has it been defeated?

363
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,166
Yes, it has!

364
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,375
And all the Childs around
the world are vanishing too!

365
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,416
[GAL]
Looks like it's all clear.

366
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,166
[banging]

367
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,166
You did well to get
through this crisis.

368
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,500
Though it took a little while.

369
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,291
[WOMAN A] The number you have
dialed is no longer in service.

370
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,708
[gasps]

371
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,458
Aw, you can't do
this to me, Natsuki!

372
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,375
[RIBBON]
Meister Mai!

373
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,250
[RIBBON]
Welcome back!

374
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,333
Thanks for all your
hard work, everyone!

375
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,250
I've got a gift for you.

376
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,833
[RIBBON]
It's a new cat!

377
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,958
It took me quite a lot of
effort to catch him, you know.

378
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,791
[MIKOTO]
He's called Kagutsuchi.

379
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,291
Oh, you're awake at last!

380
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,916
Mai... I'm really hungry.

381
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,416
Honestly...

382
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,625
By the way, where's Mashiro?

383
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,375
I think...

384
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,750
[MASHIRO]
Look at that view...

385
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:23,083
All the stars...
and the sun is rising!

386
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,750
[ARIKA]
This is our world!

387
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,958
It's the planet that we've all
worked so hard to protect.

388
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,833
Look! We can see
it now, Mashiro!

389
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,916
Down there! It's Windbloom!

390
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,291
[MASHIRO] It looks so small,
but... it's so beautiful...

391
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,541
I wanted to bring you up here

392
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,333
so you could see
it for yourself!

393
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,583
So you've been seeing
the world we live in

394
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,958
from a place like this?

395
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,500
[ARIKA]
Yup!

396
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,666
Well it's no wonder you never
care about the small stuff.

397
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,250
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?

398
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,583
Arika,I wanna go
see even more!

399
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:55,833
More of this planet. More of
this world we all live in!

400
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,375
So, let's have a race
toward that sun!

401
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,541
Yes, Master!

402
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,458
I'm gonna be an Otome!

403
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,583
You can bet on that!
