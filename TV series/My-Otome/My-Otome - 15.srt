1
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,333
For 15 years, I knew
the whole truth,

2
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:27,458
but up until now, I was too
frightened to say anything.

3
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,375
I convinced myself that
if that fake Princess

4
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,208
could govern the country well,

5
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,500
then that would be
an acceptable fate.

6
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,208
There would be no
need to disrupt things.

7
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:41,791
But now, my time in this
world is growing short,

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,625
and I felt I could no
longer hide the truth.

9
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,208
I had to tell someone...

10
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,375
The girl who holds
the Blue Sky Sapphire

11
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,500
is the true Queen of Windbloom.

12
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,375
What a terrible joke this is.

13
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,708
Now then, time to get
the party started!

14
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:10,041
Don't forget to take pictures.
We'll make a fortune.

15
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,458
I guess you could say

16
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:15,166
that we're having an early
Otome Graduation Ceremony.

Can we give these guys
the 'ole water punishment?

Well, his isn't the first
crime for any of them.

46

Why don't we give them

I even allowed you to
take on room duty for me.

Oh, really?

you were maki-maki'ing

00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,583
what were you doing
in that place?

who I met during exams

wanted to discuss
something with me.

with those guys?

it just feels so wonderful...

All this technology
is like magic.

119
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,166
Well, from what I hear,

120
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,958
when our ancestory were
living on planet Earth,

121
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,375
they had even more
scientific advancements.

122
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,000
Even more?

123
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,250
I can't even imagine
such a thing.

124
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,791
But people in those times
must've been really happy

125
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,833
and lived great lives, right?!

126
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,041
You think so?

127
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,000
Well... I wonder.

Huh?

129
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,833
Uh, but there are some
things that I know.

130
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,666
That's the lighthouse
star, right?

131
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,125
Grandma told me that
it's from the time

132
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:34,916
of Grandma's Grandma's

become the eternal sign,

Do you know it?

138
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,958
It's a part of a long poem
that's said to have come

139
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,791
from the first people
that arrived here.

140

Mh-hm.

142
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,666
But... it sounds wonderful.

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,166
The Blue Sky Sapphire...

You know about it?

146
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,541
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm.

147
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,833
The woman who held it was able

148
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,291
to accomplish her
dreams and find love.

149
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,291
[SERGEY]
Love, you say?

00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,541

151
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,708
Huh?

152
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,250
I just--

157

We were wondering when
you were gonna get back.

What are we waiting for?

00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,250
The morning cleaning
is about to begin!

165
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,916
Let's be the first ones
out there! Let's go!

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,958
[NINA sighs]

167
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,416
Before you start
saying, "let's go,"

168
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,708
how about telling us
where you were last night?

169
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,541
[knocking]

170
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,416
[NINA]
Huh?

171
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,833
Come in.

172
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,416
Good morning!

173
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,833
Oh, I see you've finally made it
back from your night out, Arika.

174
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,666
Huh?

175
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,708
[ERSTIN]
Hm?

176
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,083
[NINA]
Huh?

177
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,666
Arika.

178
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,875
[ARIKA]
Huh?

179
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,375
Oh! Good morning to
you, Big Sister Chie!

180
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,458
[CHIE]
Hmm.

181
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,750
I have something to tell you.

182
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,000
Would you come with
me for a minute?

183
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,208
[ARIKA]
What?!

184
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,791
[CHIE]
She's confessed to everything.

185
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,333
That incident with your uniform

186
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,291
just after you entered
the Academy,

187
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,875
the problems you encountered
during the survival exam,

188
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,541
and now this latest incident.

189
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,666
Uh! What a total surprise!

190
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,041
So that's what was
really going on?!

191
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,375
But I thought her
uniform wasn't stolen.

192
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,583
[CHIE]
Apparently not.

193
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,333
You see, after
the survival test,

194
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,000
we found evidence
that your equipment

195
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,708
had been tampered with.

196
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,583
But at the time,
we had no evidence,

197
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,208
and we couldn't
make any accusations

198
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,125
until we had all the facts.

199
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,000
Please accept my
apologies for that.

200
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,875
Was Miya really the only girl
behind all of these events?

201
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,375
[CHIE]
Well, that's what she claims.

202
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,166
All of these incidents are
very sinister and cruel.

203
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,958
If you come forward as witnesses
to testify against her,

204
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,000
she can be dealt with properly
by the disciplinary committee.

205
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,500
So, what do you say?

206
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,166
I, uh, don't think I could.

207
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,666
How about you, Arika?

208
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,708
Huh?! What?! Who, me?!
Oh my gosh, no way!

209
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,083
I couldn't do such a thing!

210
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,291
I'm not really bothered
by it, honestly!

211
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,875
But wow. How could
Miya do such things?

212
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,125
I don't think anyone
would've guessed that!

213
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,041
What a total surprise!

214
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,375
What more can I say?

215
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,500
Arika?

216
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,333
[ARIKA laughing]

217
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,375
[NAO]
Huh?

218
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,791
Oh, come now.
Stop being so nice.

219
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,708
Don't you realize the chance
you've been given?

220
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,208
If you really are serious
about becoming an Otome,

221
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,875
you had better take
every opportunity

222
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,291
to get rid of your rivals.

223
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,083
You need all the
help you can get.

224
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,083
[ARIKA]
I said it's all right!

225
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,333
[BOTH gasp]

226
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,583
[NAO]
Uh?

227
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,541
What the...?

228
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,708
[door opens]

229
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,375
[MARIA]
What's all this noise about?

230
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,541
[ARIKA]
Huh?

231
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,291
Miss Maria. And Headmistress.

232
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,875
There is no longer any need

233
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,708
to discuss the issue
regarding Miya Clochette.

234
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,416
She has just withdrawn
herself from the Academy.

235
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,875
[ALL gasp]

236
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,833
We also received an official
notice from her guardian.

237
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,416
The letter mentions how
she had difficulty

238
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,375
in making it into
a higher ranking,

239
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,083
as well as the unstable
situation in her country.

240
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,125
Those are the reasons
why she's leaving.

241
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,958
Excuse me, I'd like
to see her off.

242
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,875
Would that be okay?

243
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,041
[MARIA]
Hm.

244
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,083
She has already left.

245
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,708
This whole thing leaves
a bad taste in my mouth.

246
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,291
[ERSTIN]
Mh-hm.

247
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,625
Look, Arika, I know that
this is gonna bother you,

248
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,125
but you shouldn't worry
too much about--

249
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:40,666
[bang]

250
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,833
[BOTH]
Huh?

251
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,166
[ERSTIN]
Arika, are you okay?

252
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,750
About what?

253
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,416
[NINA sighs]

254
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,833
Well, I'm glad to see
you're more immune

255
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,833
to these things than I expected.

256
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,791
Anyway, I have to get going.

257
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,333
I made a promise to
meet with my father.

258
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,458
Sergey...

259
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,791
[NINA]
Is something wrong?

260
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,791
[ARIKA]
Huh?

261
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,458
Oh, no. Nothing.

262
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,708
Go and have a great time!

263
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,000
[NINA]
Uh...

264
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,166
[ERSTIN] Hey, Arika?
Can I ask you something?

265
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,125
How did things go last night
with you and Major Wang?

266
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,541
Oh, sorry, I have to go now too!

267
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,666
To study... or, I mean, uh...

268
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,500
Anyway, I'm in a hurry!
Sorry, see you later!

269
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,708
Huh? Arika!

270
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,708
[sighs]

271
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,416
[AOI]
Arika?

272
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,666
Uh. Hello, Miss Aoi.

273
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,708
Hi there. Say, could
we talk for a minute?

274
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,125
[MIKOTO meows]

275
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,375
[knocking]

276
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,791
If it's a meeting, cancel it.

277
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,208
If it's a meal, I'm not hungry.

278
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,791
If it's a guest, send them away!

279
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,625
[door opens]

280
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,625
[ARIKA]
It's me, Mashiro!

281
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,041
Huh?

282
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,416
[ARIKA] I heard you locked
yourself up in this room.

283
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,541
What's wrong?

284
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,541
[MASHIRO]
It's none of your business!

285
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,583
Aw, you're being so mean.

286
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,916
I don't know if you remember,

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,625
but you and I still
have a contract.

288
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,000
[MASHIRO growls]

289
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,750
Shut up! You know that
contract was just for show!

290
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,208
I bet you thought...

291
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,208
I bet you thought the
same as everyone else.

292
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,375
That I'm not fit to be
this country's Queen!

293
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,125
[ARIKA]
So that's what happened.

294
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,500
[MASHIRO]
I'd been working so hard

295
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,291
and then that scoundrel
ruins everything.

296
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,750
I showed him a little kindness,
and how did he thank me?

297
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,041
By mocking me!

298
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,250
[ARIKA]
Huh?

299
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,083
Um... could it be that
you have feelings...

300
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,041
...for Prince Takumi no Kami?

301
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,583
Uh! What?

302
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,833
There's no way I could fall
in love with a guy like that!

303
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,916
It was just a temporary feeling.

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,750
But you just said it yourself.

305
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,333
[MASHIRO growls]

306
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,166
Listen, any more of that from
you and you're asking for it!

307
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,375
Besides, how would you know
anything about what goes on

308
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,166
between a guy and a
girl in the first place?

309
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,666
[chuckles nervously]

310
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,666
You know, you're right.
I don't know anything.

311
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,833
About love, or stuff like that.

312

Arika?

313
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,500
[ARIKA chuckles]

314
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,583
Huh?

315
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,375
Uh? What the--?
That's really strange.

316
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,333
What's wrong... with me?

317
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,750
Don't tell me that you...
have someone too?

318
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,125
Is it true?

319
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,333
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm.

320
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,458
Well, you are easy.

321
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,625
Huh?

322
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,666
You said yourself that
becoming an Otome

323
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,375
was the dream that
you finally found,

324
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,333
so I tested you to see
how difficult it would be

325
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,875
to distract you from it.

326
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,958
And you want to become a pure,
proper, and pretty Otome?

327
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,000
Huh! What a joke.
Not even close!

328
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,000
This is what always bothers me
about little girls like you.

329
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,041
You don't even put up a fight.

330
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,500
[SERGEY]
Playtime's over.

331
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,541
It's time you go home.

332
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,250
Oh, yeah. About Lena.

333
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,500
You were saying that she found

334
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,708
both her dreams and
her love, right?

335
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,625
Well you've got that part wrong.

336
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,750
She chose love and
gave birth to a child,

337
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,708
and therefore gave up
being an Otome.

338
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,166
Because of that, she was
unable to fight the rebels.

339
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,083
She failed to protect the King,
the Queen, and even herself,

340
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,458
and in the end, they all
died because of her.

341
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,250
I hate you!

342
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,916
Why? Why did I fall for him?

343
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,875
Y-You idiot!

344
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,458
Why are you crying?

345
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,375
I've been holding
it in for so long,

346
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:06,250
but if I see you cry like
this, I don't think I can...

347
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,375
[MASHIRO crying]

348
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,708
Mashiro... you too?

349
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,750
[MASHIRO]
Arika... you... stupid...

350
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:19,791
[ARIKA, MASHIRO crying]

351
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,750
[sighs]

352
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,250
Thank you, Chie.
It's just like you said.

353
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,041
[NINA]
He left on sudden notice? I see.

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,708
[NAGI]
"At last, we get the opportunity

355
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,500
to put our plan into action.

356
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:54,083
So I want you to find the true
Princess as soon as possible."

357
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,333
Your Highness...

358
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,291
[NAGI] If our dreams
are to be fulfilled,

359
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:03,208
it is crucial that we have the
real Princess in our hands.

360
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,625
[NAGI] I don't really
care how you do it,

361
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:15,208
but once you find her,
be sure to make her our pawn.

362
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,125
Why, you could always
just seduce her.

363
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,750
You're good at
that sort of thing.

364
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,833
But why... do I...?

365
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,291
It can't be.

366
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,541
She's the same age as Nina.

367
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,833
And besides, she's not even--

368
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,500
She's not even Lena's daughter.

369
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,541
But still...

370
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,125
[MASHIRO]
Here it is!

371
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,583
[ARIKA]
What's this?

372
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,708
It's a picture of what my
new castle will look like

373
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,875
when they're done building.

374
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,250
Looks kinda weird.

375
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,833
I think it's really inspiring.

376
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,291
Especially this big
sunflower on top!

377
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,541
[ARIKA]
Uhh...

378
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,041
Oh honestly, you have
no sense of beauty.

379
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,208
[ARIKA] Well, I do think
it suits you, Mashiro.

380
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,583
I wanna turn over a new leaf,
and be reborn like this castle.

381
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,250
Me too. Let's do our best then!

382
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:07,958
[MASHIRO]
Uh-huh.

383
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,333
Let's make it a race.

384
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,333
We'll see if I become
a Meister first,

385
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,166
or you become a Queen first!

386
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,125
How about it?

387
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,208
I already am a Queen!

388
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,541
Uhh...

389
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,500
Then how about... a Queen
who will bring happiness

390
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,500
to everyone in her country?

391
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,791
[MASHIRO]
Uh...

392
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,333
Good idea!

393
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,291
Okay! The race is on!

394
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,500
[BOTH chuckle]

395
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,916
[MARIA] We will now begin
the first round of battles

396
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,333
to determine the representatives

397
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:38,375
for the commemorative
graduation dance-battle.

398
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,875
There will be two
representatives.

399
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,375
Those who are chosen will be
unconditionally promoted

400
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,541
to Pearl status.

401
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,375
Give it your best.

402
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,708
[MASHIRO]
Arika!

403
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,833
Don't you dare lose, okay?

404
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,125
[TOMOE] It's a parting gift.
Please accept it.

405
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,208
We are all going to miss you.

406
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,250
But just so you know...

407
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,791
...I will never forget
about you, dear Miya.

408
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,125
Now, begin!

409
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,583
[MASHIRO] Arika, who was
your special someone?

410
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,333
[ARIKA]
Don't tell anyone...

411
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,458
[MASHIRO] An older man who
serves royalty and knows me?

412
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:07,291
I know! Wow, you sure
have bad taste!

413
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,083
[ARIKA gasps]

414
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,208
[MASHIRO]
Sakomizu?!

415
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,208
[ARIKA]
What?! It's not him!
