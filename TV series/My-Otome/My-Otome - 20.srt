Who would've expected this?

For Cardair to actually
bow their heads to us...

16
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,000

That just shows how dangerous

the international

Listen, Fiar.

00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,916
Now that that little Artai brat
has taken control of Garderobe,

we can no longer afford
to sit back and do nothing.

29
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,916
The people of the Black Valley
possess technology

that will be invaluable
to Cardair's prosperity.

It's your job to retrieve it.

May I say one thing, sir?

Go ahead. What is it?

Those people are known
to be very unforgiving.

35
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:37,291
If we were to attack them,
they could retaliate against us,

36
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,750
and then we'd be at war.

Heh. You're not afraid, are you?

They're nothing more
than a bunch of refugees.

Oh, really?

53
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,833
Since when did the Headmistress
become the type of person

54
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,333
to have newly
appointed colleagues

55
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,916
take the blame for her mistakes?

Yeah, you've gotta
take responsibility

for your own actions.

After all, you're the grown-up.

Never mind that,
it's not important.

There's something else
we should be discussing.

You don't hafta remind
me about all that.

Madam President.

65
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,833
As one of the Five Pillars,
the Ice Silver Crystal,

66
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,166
and with my authority as
Headmistress of Garderobe,

67
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,166
I hereby officially
request assistance

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,708
from the Republic of Aries.

69
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,333
I'm sorry, Headmistress.

70
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,833
But I'm afraid that
our conference

71
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,375
is still in a deadlock
regarding this incident.

72
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,958
As part of our position,

73
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,333
we're placing a high priority
on gathering information first.

74
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,041
[NATSUKI]
But there's nothing to debate!

75
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,041
Garderobe has been
unjustly taken over!

76
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,500
It's all written down there.

77
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,958
[HARUKA]
I know that.

78
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,458
If I could, I would fly over
there as fast as possible.

79
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,041
Then I'd find that
little runt Nagi

80
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,541
and beat him into a pulp!

81
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,791
A pulp, huh?

82
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,208
However, if Aries does
anything reckless now,

83
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,083
we may end up
actually encouraging

84
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,250
the other nations to join Artai.

85
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,666
That would threaten
our security even more.

86
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,791
And if that happens...

is better to stay here.

[MIDORI] In order to create a
womb that gives birth to Gems,

149
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,083
it is necessary to use

Is it really necessary
to go that far?

322
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,291
Please, Leader! Tell me,
what are Otomes anyway?

323
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,458
[MIDORI]
Hm?

324
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,041
Up till now, I've always
thought of Otomes

325
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,041
as being on the side of justice.

326
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,666
But... after all
that's happened,

327
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,500
I've started to hate them.

328
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,791
But then, when my life and
Mashiro's were in danger,

329
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,166
I still went ahead
and became an Otome!

330
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,083
But the one who caused all
this... was an Otome too!

331
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:45,458
Then again, I was only able to
save Luo because I was an Otome!

332
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,625
An Otome represents power.
Nothing more, and nothing less.

333
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,250
That's... That's not
what I was asking about.

334
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,875
I just wanna know...
are we good, or bad?

335
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,083
Power itself is
neither good nor bad.

336
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,208
But without power, the only
possible outcome is death.

337
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,666
It's a necessity in order to
rule and live in this world.

338
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,708
That's why everyone
wants Otomes,

339
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,000
to possess this immense power
that technology created.

340
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,041
In order to survive...
In order to reach a goal...

341
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,500
In the end, isn't it
the same with you, Arika?

342
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,416
Open the door for us.

343
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,000
[door opens]

344
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,625
[TOMOE] Big Sister, I've come
to take you out of here.

345
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,625
You...

346
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,250
[TOMOE] Starting today,
these will be your chambers.

347
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,791
Don't worry.

348
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,375
I won't let anyone lay a finger
on you, Big Sister Shizuru.

349
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,833
If you don't mind, I would like
to ask you one question.

350
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,708
How is Headmistress Natsuki
doing? Did she escape?

351
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,333
[TOMOE] Unfortunately,
she's already been captured.

352
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,791
And now she's being held under
close guard at Fuka Palace.

353
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,375
Maybe I can do something.

354
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,750
I'll be leaving with Major Wang

355
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,125
for my first mission
as a Valkyrie.

356
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,458
If I'm successful...

357
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,125
...I... might be able to
request another reward.

358
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,708
Well then, I wish
you good luck,

359
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,166
and please work your hardest.

360
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,458
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

361
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,416
[rustling]

362
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,333
I never expected you of
all people to show up here.

363
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,125
[CHIE]
Do you have a problem with it?

364
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,666
No. It's reassuring to have you.

365
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,291
Chie Hallard.

366
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,208
[NINA]
This is...

367
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,666
[NAGI]
It's called the Harmonium.

368
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,541
It's the culmination of science
from the previous era.

369
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,083
To fulfill my dreams-- Heh.

370
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,333
To fulfill Sergey's
dreams and mine,

371
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,958
we need the power of this thing.

372
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,833
Father's dreams
can be... fulfilled?

373
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,416
That's right.

374
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,833
Don't you think this
world is all mixed up?

375
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,291
All the science of the Earth Era
is sealed up by Garderobe.

376
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,583
And people known as
Otome maintain a peace

377
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,208
that's really only superficial.

378
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,000
I want to end that. All of it.

379
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,458
And once that's done,

380
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,625
we can finally return humanity
to a more glorious era.

381
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,750
It feels so...

382
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,208
It feels so nostalgic.

383
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,666
But that isn't possible...

384
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,750
[NINA gasps]

385
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,458
What is this...?

386
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,375
[VOICE]
You people!

387
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,791
Are you the ones who are
seeking this Harmonium's power?

388
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,291
[NAGI] My dream is to return
humanity to a more glorious era.

389
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,541
[MASHIRO]
You really believe that?

390
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,291
[NAGI] Yeah, we can have
a lot more fun that way!

391
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,833
[MASHIRO] Are you listening
to this guy, Nina?

392
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,208
[NINA] I shouldn't have made
a contract in such haste.

393
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,416
I finally understand
Arika's pain.

394
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,291
[MASHIRO]
Hey! What do you mean by that?
