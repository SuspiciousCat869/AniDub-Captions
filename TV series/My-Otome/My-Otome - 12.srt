How much longer must I wait

00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,041
before I can see Her
Majesty the Queen?

5
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,541
I'm sorry, but, uh, the
Queen isn't quite ready yet.

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,083
Please wait just
a little longer.

Oh, what're we gonna do now?!

00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,500
The Prince was looking at me
with those scary eyes...

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,083
It freaked me out!

[NINA]
We're very sorry!

12
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,000
We were delayed on the way.

13
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,041
Is Queen Mashiro inside already?

14
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,000
To tell you the truth...

15
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,500
What?! Mashiro has disappeared?!

[SAKOMIZU]
Shh!

17
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,333
If they find out,
we're in trouble.

18
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,458
The people of Zipang are
very serious about protocol.

19
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,416
A delegation came three days
ago to prepare for this visit.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,833
According to them,

21
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,708
anyone who causes embarrassment
to a leader has to...

22
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,041
...slit his own stomach!

23
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,125
Ha! Like that'd ever happen!

24
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,500
If someone did do that,
wouldn't they be dead?

25
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,541
That's the whole point.

26
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,083
They repent by
killing themselves.

27
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,458
Are you serious?

28
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,833
It'll happen to us if
things keep going this way.

You're hopeless.

33
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,500
We're gonna have to
fix this. Any ideas?

34
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,666
[gasps] I know!

35
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,666
Someone could replace her.

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,666
Maybe not...

37
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,625
Stop giving silly suggestions!

38
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,083
We could never find anyone
as stuck up as-- Uh.

[NAGI] I'm sorry for teasing
you so many times.

I just... wanted to
get your attention.

and thank you for your patience.

May I present the Queen
of Windbloom Kingdom,

Your Majesty.

I must thank you sincerely for
your kind and gracious welcome,

78

especially given the
suddenness of our visit.

Oh, uh... Yes, make yourself
comfortable, please.

they greet people here.

It is an honor to meet you,

I am the Otome for
Queen Mashiro.

My name is Arika Yumemiya.

[ARIKA yelps]

93
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,541
A true Otome. I have
heard of them before.

94
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,125
So you attend Garderobe Academy?

95
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,416
That's correct.
I'm still a student there.

96
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,250
I am very glad to hear that.

97
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,000
One of the main
purposes of this visit

98
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,458
is to observe the
academy for ourselves.

99

It's an honor to have the Queen
and her Otome as our guides.

Looks like things have
become very interesting.

101

I'm sorry you had to make
a trip all the way out here.

102

Don't be sorry.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,500
It was a special
request from you.

104
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,291
And you know I'm
always happy to help.

105
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,166
Come on, you know very
well that talk like that

106
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,416
should stay inside
the school, Chie.

107

[CHIE]
Hm?

Sorry.

I just arrived from
another country,

111
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,583
so all I know is that
this is Wind City.

Wind City?! That's impossible!

113

stinky places like-- Uh?

Don't make such a gloomy face.

116

I've gotten to know the people.

117

Everybody's really nice here.

Aren't you gonna eat anything?
It's really good.

You can have it.

[MIMI] How can you
waste food like that?

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,541
Hey, you. Haven't I seen
you before somewhere?

124
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,750
[MASHIRO]
You must be mistaken!

125
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,125
I just arrived here
from another country.

126
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,375
Another country? So you too?

127
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,875
I... I'm visiting from Artai!

128
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, that's right.

129
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,625
I haven't even asked
for your name yet.

130
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,833
My name is... Well,
my name... is Akira!

131
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,333
Akira Okuzaki.

132
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,333
How 'bout yours?

133
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,500
How about mine?

134
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm Artai's--
I mean, my name is...

135
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,833
That's right! My name
is Nina! Nina Wang.

136
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,916
[MIMI]
Huh...

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,833
[MASHIRO]
Well, I have to get going.

138
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,833
Good day to you!

139
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,000
So how do I get up
there from down here?

140

[PEOPLE cheering]

141
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,833
[ARIKA] Pretending to be
Mashiro is impossible!

142
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,291
Well, it's too late now.

143
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,750
[ARIKA]
And why did you hafta tell them

144
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,125
that your name was Arika?

145
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,708
Because even if
it is only an act,

146
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,791
I would never want Nina Wang
to be Queen Mashiro's Otome.

147
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,666
[sighs]

148
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,083
Besides, it wasn't a
complete lie, was it?

149
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,541
Considering the fact
you've already made

150
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,375
a contract with Queen Mashiro...

151
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,333
What?! How did you
know about that?!

152
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,416
I wonder...

153
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,750
Nina, please!
Don't tell anybody else!

154
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,333
I made a promise with
Mashiro to keep it secret!

155
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,791
All right.

156
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,750
But in return, you have to
promise to forget everything

157
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,708
that happened earlier today.

158
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,875
[ARIKA]
Hm?

159
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,500
[ARIKA]
Hm-hm, mh-hm.

160
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,916
So since we've agreed on that,

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,333
for this day only, I shall
serve as your Otome.

162
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,833
Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

163
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,083
Honestly, though,

164
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,000
this must be the most
messed up birthday ever.

165
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,416
[ARIKA]
You got that right.

166
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,000
[NINA]
Huh? Uh!

167
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,791
[AKIRA] Are you sure you're
gonna be okay by yourself?

168
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,375
Don't worry about me.

169
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,416
I know my way around here like
it's my own personal backyard.

170
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,458
But you said you just arrived
from another nation...

171
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,916
Actually, I lied.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,625
[AKIRA]
Huh?

173
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,125
For your kindness,

174
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,666
I shall make an exception and
tell you my real identity.

175
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,958
Over here!

176
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,916
[AKIRA]
Hey!

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,416
Just take a look
at that portrait!

178
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,750
Surprised, right? Yes,
I am none other than...

179
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,041
What portrait?

180
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,625
[MASHIRO]
Hm? Uh!

181
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,125
[SAKOMIZU panting]

182
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,625
What? Why'd they do that?

183
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,833
Today is supposed
to be my birthday!

184
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,791
Really, it's your
birthday today?

185
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,625
Yes, it is. And that's why...

186
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,916
[AKIRA]
Uh.

187
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,416
Wait right here for me!

188
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,958
They still haven't found him?

189
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,416
[IORI]
No, unfortunately.

190
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,708
Ugh. He snuckk off with
the first delegation.

191
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,125
Doesn't he know his
medication will run out soon?

192
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,958
He has to be so
nice to everyone.

193
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,625
He's probably gotten
himself mixed up

194
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,458
with some strange people.

195
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,541
I'm worried about his health.
Please, find him quickly.

196
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,333
Yes.

197
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,458
[AKIRA]
Here!

198
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,583
You're giving... this to me?

199
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,666
Happy birthday to you, Nina.

200
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,458
You have a lotta
nerve, you know,

201
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,625
giving me just this single
flower and calling it a present.

202
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,333
Sorry.

203
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,583
I know it's not much,

204
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,541
but I used up the last
of my money buying it.

205
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,416
And yet you still
bought this for me?

206
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,750
Yep.

207
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,666
That's insane! How can you
be so nice to people?!

208
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,500
[AKIRA]
Uh.

209
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,416
[chuckles]

210
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,625
Oh, sorry! I was just
remembering something.

211
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,791
I was always scolded about
being too nice to others,

212
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,791
but isn't that a good thing?

213
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,375
After all, it's a lot better

214
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,666
to spend a special occasion
with someone, right?

215
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,875
Well, I should
probably get going.

216
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,583
Hey, wait a minute!

217
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,833
Well, uh...

218
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,708
It seems you're adamant
about this sorta thing,

219
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,833
so I guess you could
take me home...

220
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,166
I wouldn't... mind.

221
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,916
[MASHIRO gasps]

222
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,916
[YUKARIKO]
Now, does everyone understand?

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,875
The situation is just
as I explained to you.

224
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,125
Let's make sure to
greet him properly!

225
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,625
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am.

226
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,750
[NATSUKI] Thank you for
visiting us, Your Highness.

227
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,458
I am Natsuki Kruger,
the headmistress of the school.

228
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,000
Welcome, Prince.

229
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,750
It is our honor to offer you
a guided tour of the academy.

230
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,875
Thank you, I'm grateful.

231
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:25,916
[TAKUMI]
Hm?

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,125
Is something wrong?

233
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,541
Walkin' up these steps
can be exhaustin'.

234

Please come this way.

235
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,208
[TAKUMI]
Thank you.

236
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,041
What're you doing here?

237
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,583
I'm simply doing my job.

238
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,375
I'm here as Artai's
representative

239
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,583
to meet the Prince of Zipang.

240
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,666
But I didn't expect
to see you as Queen.

241
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,291
Would you be quiet?

242
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,625
I know you're gonna tell me this
dress doesn't look good on me.

243
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,750
No, actually, it suits you well.

244
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,291
In fact, that dress
makes you look prettier.

245

[ARIKA grunts]

246
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,625
By the way, I heard from Nina

247
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,416
that today's your birthday,
Antsy, so happy birthday.

248
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,833
Coming from you, that doesn't
make me happy one bit.

00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,208
[MASHIRO sighs]

250
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,166
[MASHIRO] I had almost forgotten
how wonderful it is to have fun

251
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,958
and not care about
others watching.

252
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,166
[AKIRA]
You're right.

253
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,500
I haven't had this much
fun in a long time.

254
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,000
Do you remember before
when you said

255
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,291
you came from another country?

256
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,666
Well, that's not good.
I don't have any more left.

257
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,500
Do you have some sort
of health problem?

258
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,666
[AKIRA]
Heh. I'm fine.

259
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, Akira, why did you
come to Wind City?

260
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,000
To tell the truth...

261
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,208
I came here to find
someone important to me.

262
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,708
Even though I already know
she's not in this city anymore,

263
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,708
I just wanna know
what she saw here,

264
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,166
what she did and how
she felt back then.

265
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,000
That's why I came here.

266
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,041
Who was... this person?

267
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,333
The person who scolded me
and said I was too nice.

268
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,583
My sister.

269

Huh?

272
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,208
[NAO]
He seems pretty naïve.

273
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,583
I bet it would be easy
to play tricks on him.

274
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,333
Hey, with your skills, Nao,

275
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,708
you wouldn't need tricks to get
him to pick you as his Otome.

276
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,208
You've gotta be kidding me.

Staying pure forever and
protecting some country

278
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,166
with my life?

279
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,458
Not my thing.

280
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,208
I just wanna find myself
a young rich guy

281
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,625
so I can relax and
do whatever I want.

282
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,333
If you ask me, that's
the ideal life plan.

Oh yeah, speaking of which,

284
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,166

would be the perfect candidate.

too carried away.

about that Prince...

314
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,000
[AKIRA] Honestly, where
did the Prince go?

315
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,291
Not only has he gotten
us all worried,

316
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,666
but his vanishing act
has forced me

317
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,458
to take on this
troublesome role.

318
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,583
I think I can understand
how the Prince feels,

319
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,916
but that's no excuse.

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,250
I know, he's always been
very close to his sister.

321
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,750
And because of that,
I always have to-- Hm?

322
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,458
[chuckles]

323
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,333
Why are you laughing, Iori?

324
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,666
No reason.

325
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,000
I will go and meet with
our people outside.

326
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,375
Meanwhile, I suggest you
relax and get cleaned up.

327
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,916
[sighs]

328
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,708
What a pain!

329
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,583
[sighs]

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
[SHIZURU] So you are a girl,
just like I thought.

331
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,333
Who's there?!

332
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,208
You might be able
to fool others,

333
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,416
but I'm afraid you
can't fool my eyes.

334
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,833
[AKIRA]
Let go of me!

335
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,208
[SHIZURU]
No, I won't.

336
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,833
Not before I hear from you

337
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,208
why you're impersonatin'
His Holiness, Prince Takumi.

338
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,375
[ARIKA]
Excuse me?

339
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,958
I've come to invite you
to dinner, Prince.

340
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,625
[ARIKA]
Huh?!

341
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,708
[SHIZURU]
Huh?

342
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,541
[coughing]

343
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,000
Miss Shizuru? Huh?

344
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,875
We're going to give chase.

345
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,291
That's not the real Prince
Takumi. It's an imposter.

346
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,208
[SHIZURU, ARIKA]
Materialize!

347
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,333
They discovered me.

348
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,750
I have new information.

349
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,708
The Prince was seen in the
company of a strange girl.

350
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,291
I won't let you get away.

351
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,250
Run, Akira!
I'll handle things here!

352
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,375
[AKIRA]
Thanks!

353
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,250
I think we should
head home now.

354
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,708
Just a bit longer!

355
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,916
Can't we go somewhere
else for a little while?

356
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,041
Sorry, but I imagine
everyone's looking for me.

357
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,416
Besides, I'm happy with
everything that I've seen

358
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,750
in this country and this city.

359
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,416
Oh, is that so?

360
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,041
What do you think?
It's a great country, right?

361
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,958
Yes, Nina, it certainly is.

362
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,375
[MASHIRO]
Uh.

363
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,458
Actually... to tell the truth,
Akira, my real name is--

364
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,291
[TAKUMI]
But...

365
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,791
...I can't ignore the fact

366
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,041
that the Queen's having these
big birthday celebrations,

367
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,916
and having her castle rebuilt

368
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,416
when she should
really be dealing

369
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,708
with a lot more
important issues.

370
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:33,375
I mean, for example, think about
the place where you woke up.

371
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,291
Think about the lives
of the poor people there.

372
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,916
But isn't that their own
fault for not working?

373
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,791
They wanna work,
but there aren't any jobs.

374
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,958
They don't know where they're
gonna get their bread tomorrow,

375
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,375
so some of the children
just steal it.

376
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,458
If they don't have bread...

377
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,333
...well then, they can
always eat candy!

378
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,125
I can see that
you're very fortunate.

379
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,500
You don't understand.
You don't understand anything!

380
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,708
Yes, I do.

381
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,750
Actually, it is my
responsibility to do so.

382
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,291
What're you saying?

383
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,708
[TAKUMI groaning]

384
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,791
Found you!

385
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,083
[gasps] Are you an Otome?

386
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,833
Don't group me with those fools!

387
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,958
I am--

388
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,916
[gasps] The Prince!

389
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,666
What are you doing
to the Prince?!

390
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,750
[MASHIRO]
Huh?

391
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,125
Nina!

392
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:33,916
[ARIKA]
Mashiro!

393
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,750
You're late!

394
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,083
Hey! Back off!
Back off, I say!

395
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,125
Do you know who this is?

396
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,625
This is the oldest son
of the Shogun of Zipang!

397
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,583
His Holiness, Prince Takumi
Tokiha no Kami Tadayori!

398
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,916
Please forgive us.

399
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:57,083
He's the Divine
Prince... Takumi?

400
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,541
Takumi! Are you feeling ill?

401
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,375
Where's your medicine?
Are you all out of pills?

402
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,500
[BOTH]
Uh...

403
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,625
[MASHIRO]
Uh.

404
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,041
[AKIRA]
Hang in there!

405
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,416
[TAKUMI]
Thank you... Akira...

406
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,208
You stupid fool! You had
me so worried, Takumi!

407
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,500
[TAKUMI]
Akira... I'm sorry...

408
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,083
[AKIRA]
Idiot! You idiot!

409
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,458
But those two are both
boys... aren't they, guys?

410
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,083
That's also a form of love.

411
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,458
We have been very worried

412
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,791
because the Prince has a
congenital stomach disease.

413
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,750
What... is going on?

414
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,083
What is going on?!

415
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,958
[TAKUMI] The Otomes are even
greater than the stories say.

416
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,500
[NATSUKI] Thank you for the
compliment. I am honored.

417
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,083
[TAKUMI]
However, I have some concerns.

418
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,750
[NATSUKI]
Concerns?

419
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,208
Even though it guarantees
safety and peace,

420
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,750
I do not like the idea of
burdening teenage girls

421
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,083
with the fate of a nation

422
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,083
and the tremendous
technology of the past.

423
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,375
But it's because of
the existence of the Otomes

424
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,791
that peace is maintained.

425
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,166
That is a fact.

426
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,458
Maybe, but because such
great power exists,

427
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,458
everybody wants an Otome.

428
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,041
And the Otomes are the ones
who end up suffering.

429
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,916
That's something that
cannot be helped.

430
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,333
But it's why we have a strict
selection process.

431
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,875
And the Fire Stirring Ruby?

432
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,208
How would you explain
her circumstances?

433
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,375
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

434
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,083
She was torn between
her love and her dreams.

435
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,791
Everyone thought of her as
a strong person, and she was.

436
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:38,791
But still...

437
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,958
[NATSUKI]
Your Holiness.

438
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,833
Hey, so what is this
Fire Stirring Ruby?

439
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,375
--[ARIKA yelps]
--[NINA] Shh!

440
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,333
I'm not here to find an Otome,

441
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,583
and I did not come to have
an arranged marriage either.

442
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,666
For the time being,

443
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,791
Zipang's position is
we will not intervene

444
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,708
in any matters concerning
the western nations.

445
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,166
I've come here
to tell you that.

446
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,541
Does that mean other nations
have sent envoys to you?

447
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,916
[TAKUMI]
I should not have to disclose

448
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,208
which nations they were,

449
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,208
but there were many,
just so you know.

450
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,500
I understand.

451
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,708
I'm very sorry,
Headmistress Natsuki.

452
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,166
[NATSUKI]
It's all right.

453
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,541
[TAKUMI] I can see that
you're very fortunate.

454
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,958
[MASHIRO singing]

455
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,583
[NATSUKI]
I have been told

456
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,250
that Queen Mashiro
isn't feeling very well,

457
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,958
so I'm afraid she will not
be here to see you off.

458
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,416
[TAKUMI]
I see.

459
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,958
I feel terrible for some of
the things I said to her.

460
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,708
Please tell her
I had a good time,

461
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,375
and I hope she becomes
a wonderful Queen.

462
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,291
I will.

463
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,541
I, uh... Your Holiness...
are you Mai's...?

464
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,083
[TAKUMI]
Hm.

465
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,708
[horn blares]

466
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:17,416
Goodbye, everybody!
Hope to see you again soon!

467
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,375
She may be right.

468
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,416
Someday, I may end up
coming here again.

469
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,375
[TAKUMI] Thank goodness!
At last, we got to appear too!

470
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,083
[AKIRA] I'm not satisfied!
Why do I have to serve you?

471
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,583
[TAKUMI]
What's wrong with that?

472
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,541
The important thing is, no
matter what, I'm always yours.

473
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,708
[AKIRA]
Uh! You idiot!

474
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,541
[AKANE] Still lovey-dovey
as always, huh?

475
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,125
[TAKUMI]
Who are you to talk, Akane?

476
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,208
[AKANE]
Huh?
