1
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,083
So in the end, the
Harmonium had been moved

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,916
into the basement
of Fuka Castle.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,125
It's hard to believe.

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,000
For centuries people
have searched for it,

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,958
but no one was able to
determine where it was.

6
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:32,833
And now that girl happens
to find it so easily...

7
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,083
She just might be...

8
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,000
[SHIZURU]
I wonder what really happened.

9
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,750
Do you think the two of them
have made a contract?

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,458
[NATSUKI]
Probably.

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,625
They seem to think they're doing

12
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,083
a sufficient job of
hiding it from us.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,875
[SHIZURU] Should we make
them cancel the contract?

14
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:56,125
I'd rather let events
unfold on their own.

15
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,958
It's a long shot,
but it is possible

16
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,458
that this could be a
critical turning point.

17
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,833
You're just gonna
leave it to chance?

18
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:06,000
This may turn out to be
what fate's decided.

19
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,291
If that's the way
you feel, Natsuki,

20
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,625
I won't argue with you.

21
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,958
In the meantime, I'll see
if I can persuade her

22
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,125
to tell me what happened
below the castle.

23
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,500
Thank you.

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,166
Anyway, now that the Harmonium's
been heard once again,

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,000
we've bigger problems
to deal with.

26
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,416
I have a feeling that
even as we speak

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,625
people everywhere are being
informed of the news.

28
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:42,125
Now, everything has
been set in motion.

29
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,000
[ARIKA panting]

30
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,875
[ARIKA groans]

31
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,416
This punishment
duty is too harsh!

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,583
Just because I skipped some of
the dance-battle lessons...

33
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,791
Well, I can't help that!

34
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,875
It's not my fault I can't
take this thing off.

35
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,458
[sighs]

36
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,000
[IRINA] Who told you that
you could take a break?!

37
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:42,750
[yelps]

38
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,041
[IRINA]
Arika Yumemiya!

39
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,791
[ARIKA]
I'm very sorry! I was just...

40
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,041
Huh?

41
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,458
[ARIKA]
Oh! Yummy!

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,041
Delicious! Thank you
so much, Ersty!

43
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,791
My stomach was really growling!

44
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,416
it must be tough
cleaning so big a place.

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,291
[IRINA] Well, guess
that can't be helped.

46
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,458
This is the burial ground for
the first Meister Otome, Fumi.

47
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,250
Hey, I've heard about her!

48
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,916
She had something
to do with some war?

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,333
The War of the Twelve Kings?

50
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,833
Right! And she's the
one who ended the war.

51
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,166
Mashiro told me!

52
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,250
[ERSTIN chuckles]

53
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,833
You and Queen
Mashiro really seem

54
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,666
to be getting along well, Arika!

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,166
[ARIKA]
No, it's not like that.

56
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,958
[NINA] A contract?!
Between Arika and Queen Mashiro?

57
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,250
[SERGEY]
It appears that way.

58
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,291
Probably with the
Blue Sky Sapphire.

59
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,541
[gasps]

60
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,041
You mean she was accepted
by the Meister Gem

61
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,875
and was able to use its power?

62
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,500
I'm so sorry, Nina- <i>chan</i> .

63
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,541
I hate to ask you to do these
kinds of things for me.

64
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,833
I understand, Father.

65
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,833
I'll try and get the
whole story out of her.

66
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,666
[ERSTIN] By the way,
how's your ear, Arika?

67
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,000
[ARIKA yelps]

68
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,541
I-It's all right. Uh, it's
just a little infection.

69
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,375
Arika.

70
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,958
Yeah, Nina?

71
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,333
It's nothing. Never mind.

72
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,458
Uh... well, okay then...

73
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,833
I'd better get back to work!
Thanks for lunch!

74
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,333
[IRINA]
Stop right there!

75
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,750
I've got a little
present to give you!

76
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,750
[ARIKA]
Oh, did you get me dessert?

77
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,875
Uh-uh-uh. I've got
something even better.

78
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,041
[ARIKA]
Huh?

79
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,708
[ARIKA] Ah! Wow!
Look at that! A machine!

80
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,625
Irina, you built this yourself?

81
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,958
Oh, this is nothing in
the scheme of things.

82
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,541
I mean, our ancestors
used the power of science

83
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,750
to travel through space
and come to this planet.

84
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,791
Does it move?

85
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,208
Of course it does!

86
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,666
I got some parts from junk
shops and antique stores,

87
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,916
and I swiped... I mean, borrowed
the rest from Miss Yohko.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,125
Behold the power of
Mister Cleaner One!

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,916
[groans]

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's amazing! It moved!

91
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,583
And now there's
smoke coming out!

92
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,791
What does it do next?
Tell me, tell me!

93
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,166
I guess the data
was insufficient.

94
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,625
[IRINA] Oh man, I wish
I could sneak a peek

95
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,666
at what's on the other
side of that door.

96
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,208
I was hoping to
present this machine

97
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,958
for the research portion
of our next interim exam.

98
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,000
There's an exam?

99
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,125
That's right. They start soon.

100
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,458
What? Really?

101
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,791
ctually, Arika, I haven't
seen you study much.

102
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,291
Are you gonna be okay?

103
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,416
If you come last in two
consecutive terms,

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,958
you'll be expelled.

105
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,250
[ARIKA gasps]

106
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,375
I'll be fine... No problem...

107
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:48,708
[ARIKA]
Ugh!

108
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,916
Nothing.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
I've been through every
one of these books,

110
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,833
and I still can't find anything
about how to cancel a contract.

111
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,166
[SHIZURU]
Are you doin' some research?

112
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,375
[ARIKA]
Miss Shizuru!

113
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,416
Well, um, that is, I'm...
studying for the final exams!

114
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,166
Well that's good to hear.

115
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,625
If you'd like, I can help
you with your studies.

116
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,875
Huh?

117
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,833
She's so lucky!

118
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,833
I can't believe she's
getting private tutoring

119
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,875
from Miss Shizuru!

120
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,500
I'm so jealous!

121
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,375
But really, it's not fair.

122
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,208
Arika always gets
all the attention.

123
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,291
[ARIKA]
Huh?

124
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,000
Did you hear that
noise the other day?

125
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,875
There was a terrific
sound like thunder

126
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,708
and it shook the entire city.

127
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,041
Well, I didn't notice anything.

128
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,041
And I didn't hear any
organ playing, either.

129
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,708
Is that so?

130
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,541
[ARIKA sighs]

131
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,041
That was a close call.

132
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,916
I almost slipped up and told
Miss Shizuru what happened.

133
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,916
But she's been so nice
to me... She's wonderful.

134
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,875
I wish I knew if my mother
was also wonderful like that.

135
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,583
Okay! I gotta give it my best!

136
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,416
[gasps]

137
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,666
[IRINA] Thank you!
I learned a lot from this.

138
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,666
But I guess it didn't help
that much in the end, did it?

139
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,125
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,041
Don't apologize. That's your
dad's most valuable book.

141
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,833
I'm just honored to
have the opportunity

142
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,500
to read such a rare book
about artificial intelligence.

143
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,958
Hey, where's Arika?

144
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,791
She's not back yet.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,291
[NINA]
Hm?

146
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,916
[ARIKA]
Ah, there it is!

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,416
Jeez, don't scare me like that!

148
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,583
You always like to appear out
of thin air, don't you, Miyu?

149
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,291
Forgive me, Arika.

150
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,875
[ARIKA]
It's been a long time!

151
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,250
How'd you find out that I've
been going to Garderobe Academy?

152
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,291
Because I know everything
about you, Arika.

153
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,833
And good evening
to you, Alyssa!

154
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,625
[MIYU] I see. So your
grandmother has...?

155
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,958
Yeah.

156
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,375
She died about six months
after your last visit.

157
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,000
Have you been enjoying
yourself at school?

158
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:15,625
Yeah!

159
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,875
It's kinda tough,

160
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,291
because there's a lot
of studying and work,

161
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,916
but becoming a great
Otome is my dream!

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,875
It's really hard though...

163
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,166
Oh, hey, Miyu,

164
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,291
you've been traveling
for a long time, right?

165
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,291
Yes.

166
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,875
Then I have to
ask you something.

167
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,250
Have you ever heard of a
way to cancel a contract

168
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,333
made with a Meister Gem?

169
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,041
This thing is, well...

170
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,208
[chirps]

171
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,833
Who goes there?

172
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,166
[MASHIRO yelping]

173
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,333
Hey, how rude!

174
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,166
Mashiro?

175
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,125
Arika! What are you doing?

176
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,125
Are you outta your mind?

177
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,625
You know who this girl is?

178
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,833
[ARIKA] Huh? Oh, yes!
This is Mashiro.

179
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,958
She's the Queen of Windbloom,
believe it or not!

180
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,708
What do you mean,
"believe it or not"?

181
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,583
Look, I thought we had
agreed that the incident

182
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,250
regarding the Gems
was our little secret!

183
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,583
But here you are,

184
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,791
blathering about it to some
suspicious vagabond!

185
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,958
Don't worry, the
secret's safe with Miyu.

186
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,625
She's not from the
school, and besides,

187
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,000
she knows all kinds
of interesting things!

188
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,208
Be quiet! Remember your place.

189
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,000
Huh?

190
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,000
I will not allow you
to insult Arika further.

191
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,458
[MASHIRO]
How dare you be disrespectful!

192
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,375
By the way, Mashiro,
what are you doing here?

193
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,291
I'm here because you
haven't come and told me

194
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,791
how to cancel
this contract!

195
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,125
Do you know how hard it is to
sneak out here to see you?

196
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,333
Hey!

197
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,583
Look, I'm doing my best
to figure out a way.

198
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,708
Is that Gem the
cause of the problem?

199
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,833
Yeah.

200
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,666
Is it all right if I
take a look at it?

201
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,125
[ARIKA]
Go ahead.

202
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:50,041
A real Meister Gem. This
is truly a great Gemstone.

203
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,208
[ARIKA]
Yeah, isn't it?

204
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,416
You should see what it can do!

205
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,541
Uh?

206
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,375
She took it off?!

207
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
H-How did you do that?!

208
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,541
I tried everything I
could to get it off.

209
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,916
Th-Then how about this one?

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,416
Can you take mine off too?

211
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,125
Give it a try, Miyu!

212
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,291
Of course, Arika.

213
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,291
Oh my gosh!

214
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,541
[ARIKA]
It came off!

215
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,916
[MASHIRO gasps]

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,041
That's great. That means...

217
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,291
...our contract is cancelled.

218
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,833
[MIYU]
I'm afraid that's not so.

219
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,416
I've heard that even if the
Gemstones are removed,

220
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,541
the contract etched
into them remains.

221
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,583
Aww...

222
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,250
Then, how do we
break the contract?

223
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,291
Come on! Help us out!

224
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,833
[MIYU]
I do not know.

225
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,083
Perhaps you should formally
ask the academy for assistance.

226
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,916
If I could, I would.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,208
We're trying to keep
this whole thing a secret.

228
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,000
In that case...

229
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,375
[IRINA] Sneak into
the forbidden library?!

230
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,791
Why are you in such a rush
to break the rules again?

231
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,125
That library has the
records of all Otomes

232
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,625
and information on the
school's history, right?

233
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,666
Well, I heard that it's like
a mountain of treasure in there,

234
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,625
with countless books on
this planet's history

235
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,458
and the lost
technology of Earth.

236
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,791
But if we get caught,
it's over. We're done for!

237
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,625
I don't care. I hafta
learn about the Otomes.

238
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,083
Arika, you said your mother was
also an Otome, isn't that right?

239
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,333
[ARIKA]
Uh-huh.

240
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,916
All right then,
I'm going to join you.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,708
[IRINA] I wasn't
expecting that from you.

242
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,041
[ARIKA]
Thank you, Nina!

243
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,833
Don't get the wrong idea.

244
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm not doing this for you.

245
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,000
I want to know myself.

246
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,208
If that's the case, I'll
just have to go along too!

247
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,791
You can count me in!

248
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,083
I guess I'll go too.

249
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,000
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm!

250
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,291
We'll all go!

251
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,583
Yeah, but how are we
supposed to get in there?

252
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,666
It's really difficult
to break into.

253
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,083
I have an idea how to get in.

254
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,083
It's kinda creepy in here.

255
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,875
[ARIKA] This place is the grave
of the very first Otome, right?

256
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,333
[ERSTIN]
I heard she rests in peace

257
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,583
somewhere deep underground.

258
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,041
Hey, Arika.

259
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,208
Will you take that
ridiculous thing off?

260
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,833
[ARIKA] But Grandma always said
that this is proper attire

261
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,416
for sneaking into places
you're not supposed to go.

262
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,541
Take it off.

263
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,708
[ARIKA whines]

264
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,041
So everyone's here now?

265
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,500
[NAGI]
Hey.

266
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,625
Would you be the one that
sent me that love letter?

267
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,541
I have to confess that
I was very surprised.

268
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,916
Huh, I thought it would
be a letter telling me

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
to use Slaves and fight.

270
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:56,958
In a way, that is very close to
what its actual contents are.

271
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:01,458
It is a pleasure to finally
meet you, Grand Duke Nagi.

272
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,000
[IRINA] But how were you
able to get your hands

273
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,250
on the key to the
forbidden library?

274
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,125
That's a trade secret.

275
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,375
Don't forget our deal.

276
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,166
You guys are going to
help me out with my work

277
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,708
once this is done.

278
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,708
If it's only work,
just leave it to me!

279
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,458
That includes you, Nina.

280
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,541
Y-Yes.

281
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,625
Well then, let's go.

282
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,708
[IRINA]
Is it open now?

283
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,875
The lock is open, but there
should be another step

284
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,958
to actually getting
the door open.

285
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,875
At least, there was
the last time I tried.

286
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,291
Then how about... a password?

287
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,208
Like "open sardine"!

288
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,458
[ARIKA chuckles]

289
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,458
Sardine?

290
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,791
[ALL gasp]

291
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,625
The door...

292
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,750
It really opened...

293
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,000
...with... "sardine"?

294
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,458
I will not tolerate
failure, Arika.

295
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,000
This is the library?

296
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,791
[ERSTIN] There certainly
are a lot of books.

297
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,875
This place is amazing.

298
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,541
[IRINA] What did you
do this time, Arika?

299
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,541
[ARIKA]
Don't ask me!

300
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,458
What is this?

301
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,208
This is absolutely incredible!

302
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,458
I'll bet this thing
is the databank.

303
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,875
It has information from
before the Immigration,

304
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,958
back when people would
travel in spaceships.

305
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,250
[ARIKA]
Databank?

306
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,875
[ERSTIN]
I've heard of them before.

307
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,750
They're supposed to be
like one giant library.

308
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,875
S-So what do we do with it?

309
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,791
To access something like this,

310
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,875
we would need some
sort of password,

311
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,208
or maybe another item
that can act as a key.

312
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,000
Wait, a key?

313
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,708
You're expecting too much of me.

314
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:03,833
[ARIKA sighs]

315
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,250
How come it disappeared?

316
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,875
[ERSTIN] Huh? There seems to be
something else back there.

317
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,958
What is this place?

318
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,083
Whatever they are, they all
have some kind of inscription.

319
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,291
Let's see...

320
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,416
The Flowing Garnet,
Meister Monica Julen,

321
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,666
devoted her life to Master Argos
the Twelfth of Cardair.

322
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,875
Year A.R. 264 to 281.

323
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,250
[ERSTIN, IRINA gasp]

324
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,958
Year 281... that was...

325
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,541
That was 50 years ago,

326
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,416
at the end of the
last major war,

327
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,458
the War of the Dragon King.

328
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,041
You mean, these things are...?

329
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,833
[MARIA]
They're tombstones.

330
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,083
This is the resting place of
your Otome predecessors.

331
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,541
[gasps]

332
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,208
This time, you girls have
truly stepped over the line.

333
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,791
These are sacred grounds.

334
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,541
No one is not allowed to
enter without permission.

335
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,916
No students,
not even royalty itself.

336
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,125
And all of these... are graves?

337
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,875
I deeply apologize for the
disgrace, Big Sister Monica.

338
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:35,291
[IRINA]
Um... was she someone you knew?

339
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,083
Yes.

340
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,333
When we were in school,

341
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,500
I was assigned to be her
helper underclassman,

342
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,000
and I performed
room duty for her.

343
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,000
She was extraordinary.

344
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,041
She served as a
member of the Trias.

345
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,750
She was elegant and pure.

346
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,458
But that was in a time when
the world was nowhere near

347
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,041
as peaceful and
stable as it is today.

348
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,958
Every country wanted power,

349
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,500
and there were many
international wars.

350
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:03,000
This finally culminated in
the War of the Dragon King.

351
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,916
[MARI] In the midst of
the never-ending battles,

352
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,916
the Otomes would find
themselves chosen as Meisters

353
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,500
and sent to the battlefield,
one by one,

354
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,833
even before their graduation.

355
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,291
Then through the contracts
with their masters,

356
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,208
they performed their
responsibilities and duties.

357
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,583
[ARIKA]
Duties?

358
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:29,250
[NINA] They fought, didn't they?
The Otome fought each other.

359
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,333
[gasps]

360
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,625
[MARIA]
That's correct.

361
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,541
And the person who defeated
Big Sister Monica

362
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,000
was the Number Two Pearl,
the second member of Trias,

363
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,375
and her dearest friend
at the academy.

364
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,041
Why'd that hafta happen?

365
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,375
They should've just refused
to fight each other!

366
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,041
Stop saying such
foolish nonsense, girl.

367
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,333
That was not even possible.

368
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,750
The fate of the war and
the lives of the rulers

369
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,708
rested in the hands
of the Otomes.

370
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,541
That's how the countries and all
of the citizens could survive.

371
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,208
Most importantly, as Otomes,

372
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,875
the girls had complete
trust, respect, and love

373
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,125
for their Masters.

374
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,375
These bonds were stronger
and more honorable

375
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,291
than their bonds of friendship,
and they acted accordingly.

376
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,291
Listen to me carefully.

377
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:17,333
Today, people see and honor
only the elegant side of Otomes,

378
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,416
as women who serve royalty.

379
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,791
But if things ever go wrong,

380
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,000
even best friends will
be forced to strike down

381
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:23,958
and kill each other.

382
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,291
That is the destiny of an Otome.

383
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,458
Are all of you truly
prepared to do that?

384
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,250
Yes, I'm prepared to do it.

385
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,875
No! I won't!

386
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:40,666
Then leave this school
immediately, Arika Yumemiya.

387
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,083
All we need to do is make
sure wars don't happen!

388
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:48,166
When I become a proper Otome,
I won't allow any wars!

389
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,166
How wonderful it would
be if that were possible.

390
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,958
Now, we've been here
too long already.

391
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,333
We shall apologize
to your Big Sisters

392
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:02,375
for disturbing their sleep,
and then make our way out.

393
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,625
Arika. That's disrespectful
to your Big Sisters.

394
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,916
Take that off!

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,791
Uh! No!

396
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,000
[gasps]

397
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,125
Arika!

398
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,541
It's gone!

399
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,083
A-A-Arika Yumemiya...

400
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,375
Ah... um... well... you see...

401
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,708
[chuckles nervously]

402
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,125
[IRINA]
I heard it's been four years

403
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,458
since anyone's had to clean
these walls as punishment.

404
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,625
But at least there's
a bright side, Arika.

405
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,333
You were able to get a new
Coral Gem in the end.

406
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,041
That's true.

407
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,541
But I still haven't been able
to cancel the contract yet.

408
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,083
[NAO]
Hey, guys?

409
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,625
Don't forget that you still need
to help me with my job too.

410
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,416
[ALL]
Right.

411
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,166
Hey, Arika!

412
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,416
[yelps]

413
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,875
You told them about
the Gemstones breaking!

414
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,708
Thanks to you, I got
in big trouble too!

415
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,291
I had no choice!

416
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,375
Besides, we had to do something
about the broken stones anyway.

417
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,416
You are really not
cut out to be an Otome!

418
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,750
Hurry up and get
expelled already! Ugh!

419
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,666
Ha! You wish!

420
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,833
If someone like her
were my Master,

421
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,333
my friends would be a lot
more important to me.

422
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,375
For sure.

423
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,708
And the fact is,

424
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,000
the world is a whole lot
better than it used to be.

425
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,666
It's not like a war's
gonna break out!

426
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,625
Huh?

427
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,958
Yeah. Right!

428
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,416
[NINA]
Hmm...

429
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,375
[RAD] I see. It's within
the borders of Aries.

430
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,083
And you want us to retrieve it.

431
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,958
[ARGOS]
Indeed. The time is ripe.

432
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,500
We have to start
moving right away.

433
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,041
[RAD]
What we find, we split evenly.

434
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,541
Those are the terms.

435
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:57,041
Ha. It appears you're as
greedy as the rumors say.

436
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,541
Very well,
I accept your terms.

437
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,166
[RAD]
Commander.

438
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,416
[MIDORI]
In that case,

439
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,833
we of the Aswad shall
take on your request,

440
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,666
Emperor Argos of Cardair.

441
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,041
You better watch what you say!

442
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,916
It's all right, Fia.

443
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,916
These people are reactionaries,

444
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,208
waiting for the chance to revert
back to the interplanetary era.

445
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,291
Am I right, Leader of Aswad?

446
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,833
Yes, you are.

447
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,916
We are the last descendants
of the Black Valley.

448
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,458
[ERSTIN] So, Nina, what
exactly are we doing

449
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,375
to help Big Sister Nao?

450
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,041
[NINA]
Well... about that...

451
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,000
[NAO] It's nothing, just a
little... physical service.

452
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,125
[ERSTIN]
Physical? That isn't right!

453
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,208
Oh, but if it was...

454
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,833
[NAO]
You know, I am constantly amazed

455
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,291
at your choice of friends.

456
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,291
[NINA chuckles]
