1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,291
[TECHNICIAN 25A] The Valkyrie
Core has been destroyed!

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,250
The Slaves under our control
have been destroyed!

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,000
The Valkyrie Unit has
stopped functioning!

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,500
Well, looks like it's game over
for us. Then let's finish it all

5
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,416
by turning this city
into a wasteland.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,916
You understand, right?
There's no turning back

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
for either of us after
everything that's happened.

8
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,125
[NINA]
Sergey...

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,833
You've been a kind man.
Too kind.

10
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,416
But right now I am thankful for
the kindness you showed me.

11
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,333
[NINA] You allowed me
to retain my powers.

12
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:59,250
So for your sake...
I will do this!

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,875
The Harmonium!

14
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,916
Nina...

15
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,583
Look, the sun!

16
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,875
It's being covered in darkness.

17
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,333
Let's go.

18
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,166
Materialize!

19
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,083
[SARA, SHIZURU, and NAO]
Materialize!

20
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,666
Get outta here. Nagi is serious
about demolishing the city.

21
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,708
No!

22
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,000
We're not leaving!

23
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,958
Both of us made a promise.
I'm going to create

24
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,291
a nation where everyone can
live in happiness and peace.

25
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:16,916
So I'm not gonna run away again.
My mind's made up.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,416
Mashiro, I'm gonna need you
to entrust your life to me.

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,750
I don't know how
I'm gonna do this.

28
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,083
But I have to at least try.

29
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,166
Somewhere, Nina is crying out!

30
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,041
[NINA]
Arika...

31
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,583
[MASHIRO] My life is
one with yours, Arika.

32
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,000
 You're my Otome.
Now let's do this!

33
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,500
[ARIKA]
Hm.

34
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,041
[ARIKA]
Huh?

35
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,208
[MASHIRO]
You guys...

36
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,041
Don't overdo it! Even though
you've gained the power

37
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,750
of the Sapphire, it's
impossible to do this alone!

38
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,708
Give us a chance
to help out, okay?

39
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,916
[MIKOTO]
Hm!

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,666
Jeez, how'd I get this
hard labor so soon?

41
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,333
Thank you!

42
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,916
[MIYU] She has earned the
true powers of the Sapphire,

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,833
and a Master who will
walk the path with her.

44
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:07,208
My Lady. The moment has come for
me to fulfill your last wish.

45
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,250
Now, Guiding Star, it's time!

46
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
Is that...? It can't be!

47
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,375
To think... that
legend was true.

48
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,708
[YUKARIKO]
Hm?

49
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,250
They say that when the
Guiding Star shines red...

50
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,875
All the Otomes will be released

51
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,958
from the shackles
of their contract.

52
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,625
[STUDENTS gasp, murmur]

53
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,125
[HARUKA]
What...?

54
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,583
All right! Miyu has
finally done it!

55
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,583
Yeah.

56
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,333
[HARUKA]
Huh? What?

57
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,791
[MIYU]
Hear me, Otomes.

58
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,083
Allow me to free you
from your burden of fate.

59
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,166
Huh? The Robe activated
without the contract!

60
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,791
[MIYU]
Choose for yourselves.

61
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,083
By your own will,
decide what you must do.

62
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,583
[YUKARIKO gasps]

63
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:17,666
No need to tell me. I made
my decision long ago! Let's go!

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,458
Unh?

65
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,625
[SHIHO]
We're on our way!

66
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,666
[HARUKA] Huh? Hey!
Wait for me, you guys!

67
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,083
Rosalie!

68
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,625
Well, Big Sister Natsuki,

69
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,333
we thought you could use a hand,
so... here we are!

70
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,000
Yah!

71
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,250
Hngh!

72
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,083
Huh! Your Majesty!

73
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,000
Please allow all of us Otomes
to serve under your command!

74
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,166
But why?

75
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,208
We were asked to
choose for ourselves.

76
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:52,166
And I believe there's a clear
choice of what we need to do!

77
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,250
[IRINA]
Hang on, we'll help too!

78
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,750
--[YAYOI] Me too!
--[LILIE] Yeah, and me!

79
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,333
Please, hurry!

80
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,625
We'll do our best to
keep this under control.

81
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,083
All of you...

82
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:12,291
Very well. I'll leave it
up to you, Otomes. Let's go!

83
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,333
Our mission is to take back the
castle and stop the Harmonium!

84
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,416
Jeez! I told you to wait for me!

85
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,666
So unfair. They're playing
against the rules, you know.

86
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,958
[TECHNICIAN 25A] There's
another fleet approaching

87
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,041
from north of the city!

88
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,166
What? It's Cardair!

89
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,708
Looks like I no longer
have a way out.

90
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,083
All right, then activate
all the original Slaves.

91
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,958
[SLAVE-MASTERS] Under the
contract of darkness,

92
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,416
I fulfill my oath to you.

93
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,333
God of the ancient light,
knowledge, and wisdom,

94
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,916
grant me a loyal servant.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,500
Don't worry, I'll handle these.

96
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,583
You and the others go
into the castle, Natsuki.

97
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,416
Thanks, Shizuru.
Good luck.

98
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,000
Like I always say, an Otome
needs strength, skill...

99
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,625
And guts, right?

100
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,166
Correct!

101
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,750
Now, let's settle this
competition once and for all.

102
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,083
We'll see which one of us can
defeat more of these guys!

103
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,000
You haven't changed one bit.

104
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,083
Yeah! Come on!

105
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,583
I'll turn you all
into demon fish fry!

106
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,166
I don't even know what
you're trying to say, Haruka...

107
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,875
Uh, Madam President?

108
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,333
It's nothing.

109
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,250
Right... Here, Major Hallard.

110
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,041
Thank you. I'll be
returning to the castle now.

111
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,541
Ha!

112
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,791
Arika! We're leaving
Nina up to you!

113
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,333
Right!

114
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,333
[SHIHO] Red maki-maki, blue
maki-maki, yellow maki-maki...

115
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,375
[SHIHO squeals]

116
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,250
[SHIHO laughs]

117
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,250
You're not even using
your Robe's powers.

118
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,666
Way to go, swirl-head.

119
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,541
Why don't you just
shut up, Juliet?!

120
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,416
Hehe... Huh?

121
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,041
[NAO and SHIHO]
Huh?

122
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,208
[SHIHO] Big Sister Mahya?!
Of the Five Pillars?!

123
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,125
[NAO] Akane?! Wait, how come
you're still an Otome?

124
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,166
[AKANE]
Hmph!

125
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,333
[NAO and SHIHO]
Uh?!

126
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,208
[AKANE] We were
always being chased.

127
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,000
And then, just when
our moment came...

128
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,416
Kazu was taken away to become
the next emperor of Cardair,

129
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,916
and I was captured
by Big Sister Mahya.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,708
[MAHYA]
You mean I arrested you.

131
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,166
At any rate, I agreed
to drop all charges as long

132
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,208
as she entered into a contract
with His Highness Kazuya.

133
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,291
I never willingly
agreed to this.

134
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,125
I'm not gonna let you do "that"!

135
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,458
And I'm not gonna
give up, either!

136
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,125
I'm staying outta this...

137
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:32,750
[MARIA]
Honestly...

138
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,291
[ALL]
Huh?

139
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,750
[MARIA] Even after all these
years, you still lack grace...

140
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,291
Headmistress.

141
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,833
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

142
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,791
[NATSUKI]
Don't tell me...

143
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,625
[NATSUKI]
Miss Maria?!

144
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,916
How pitiful. I made every effort
possible to age gracefully,

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,416
only to have to appear
in this form again?

146
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,125
[indistinct grunting, shouting]

147
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,375
[SAKOMIZU]
Go!

148
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,958
[CHIE]
Aoi!

149
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,500
[AOI]
Huh?

150
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,291
[CHIE]
Thank goodness...

151
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,916
[AOI]
Oh, Chie...

152
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,500
So they're even down here...

153
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,208
Listen, Arika. You must
go now. You must go

154
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,833
and release the young player,
Nina, from the Harmonium.

155
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,958
And be sure to hurry.
Playing that organ

156
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,916
for a long period of time
is very dangerous.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,708
[ARIKA]
Hm.

158
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,291

[TECHNICIAN 25A]
We're detecting a Robe

160
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,958
in the underground passage!
It's the Blue Sky Sapphire!

161
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,000
Nina...

162
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,541
Arika.

163
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,750
[NAGI]
Welcome.

164
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,583
Hi, Mashiro.

165
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,958
Nagi.

166
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,916
Nina, please!
Stop this already!

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,416
I can't. If I stop
the Harmonium...

168
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,458
[ARIKA gasps]

169
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,708
If I stop, Father will die.

170
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,958
Father was willing to do
anything to protect me,

171
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:15,291
even sacrifice his own life.
So that's why, this time...

172
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:20,625
I will risk everything and
everyone to protect my Father!

173
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,958
But... he might say...

174
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,458
No... I know...

175
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,750
I know exactly what
Sergey would say!

176
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,083
He'd say he'd rather die than
make you do all of this!

177
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,458
What do you know?!

178
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,500
The things between
Father and me...

179
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,666
How could you ever understand?!

180
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,333
[ARIKA yells]

181
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,875
Arika!

182
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,125
Arika...

183
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,666
[NAGI chuckles]

184
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,125
Over there.

185
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,625
[ARIKA] I can understand
a little bit...

186
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:13,666
Because, Nina...
I also... loved Sergey.

187
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,125
When I first realized
my true feelings,

188
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,375
I couldn't think about
anything or anyone else.

189
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,166
I didn't even think about
what you were feeling.

190
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,208
Then you should understand!
Even if I sacrifice everything,

191
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,416
even if it were in exchange
for the entire world...

192
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,208
I would still want only him!

193
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,791
[NINA yells]

194
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,541
Then... I have to stop you,
Nina, no matter what it takes!

195
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,666
Nina... Arika...

196
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,208
All we can do is watch
over them from afar.

197
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,916
Everything is in
their hands now.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,833
[NAGI] How ironic. In the end,
the future of the world

199
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,000
still depends on a
fight between Otomes.

200
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,916
Of course, I understand that
the contracts have been broken,

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,083
so all we can do
is watch and wait.

202
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,166
No. I'm not just
going to sit back

203
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,750
and let Arika fight on her own!
Stop the Harmonium, Nagi. Now.

204
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,541
Impossible. In case
you hadn't guessed,

205
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:28,583
that thing only listens to Nina.
She is the real princess.

206
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,916
I'm just trying to revert
this world back to the way

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,166
it originally was. This business
of sacrificing Otomes

208
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,708
and sealing up technology...
It's strange, don't you think?

209
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,166
But that's...

210
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,583
Don't worry about it. Sure,
it's true that this world

211
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,291
has been destroyed once
because of this thing...

212
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,708
[ARIKA yells]

213
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,791
[NINA yells]

214
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,750
But this time, I'll be
supervising it carefully.

215
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,583
That way, there'll be
no mistakes.

216
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,625
But that's no good! That's
not gonna change anything!

217
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,791
Then what do you suggest?
Keep things the same?

218
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,708
No! Technology will be
released gradually!

219
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,208
I'll make sure in the future
Otomes won't be necessary!

220
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,833
But I can do all those things by
myself! I don't need your help!

221
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,750
Yeah, right.
You could never manage that.

222
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,583
--[MASHIRO] Shut up...
--[NAGI] Huh?

223
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,375
Shut up! It can be done!
I believe in it!

224
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,958
[ARIKA and NINA grunt]

225
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,916
Why are you still
fighting? Tell me!

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,416
I made a promise!

227
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,166
We have to create a nation where
everyone can live happily!

228
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,666
That's nothing but
a farfetched dream!

229
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,500
It is a dream.
But it's because of that...

230
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,125
When I first came
to this city...

231
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,125
When I first met you, Nina,
and saw Miss Shizuru...

232
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,583
I thought, "I really
wanna become an Otome!"

233
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,583
And you know, I did
just that, and here I am.

234
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,791
But if I hadn't had that dream
of mine during that time,

235
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,083
I would never have been able
to become an Otome like this.

236
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:59,458
You have to believe in dreams
even if they're impossible.

237
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,666
Actually, you gotta try to
make your dreams come true,

238
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,250
or nothing will happen!

239
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,750
You think that way because
you've never been torn apart,

240
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,583
or made mistakes that
are too hard to bear.

241
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,333
That's not true, Nina! If you
make a mistake, just think hard

242
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,000
about how to fix it and start
again from the beginning!

243
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,625
Then just hold your head
up high and move forward!

244
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,791
But... it's too late!
For everything!

245
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,333

[NINA yells]

247
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,541
[NINA] Why?! Why do you
always keep on fighting?

248
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,041
Why do you never give up?

249
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,375
Well, because
I love you, Nina.

250
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,250
I love everybody on this planet.

251
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,375
That's why I can never
give up, no matter what.

252
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,541
I'm a fool who
doesn't know anything.

253
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,000
But I really want to learn
as much as I can about you.

254
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,416
So please, let's start from the
beginning again, as friends.

255
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,208
Okay, Nina?

256
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,666
[NINA] I should've talked more
openly about so many things...

257
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,416
With Erstin... and also...
with you, Arika.

258
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,333
It's not too late, y'know.
Let's start again, Nina.

259
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,250
Ari... ka...

260
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,541
[MASHIRO gasps]

261
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,041
[NINA screams]

262
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,375
[ARIKA]
No, Nina!

263
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,583
[MIKOTO] This is bad.
It's gone wild!

264
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,875
If this continues, it's gonna
be a repeat of the last time!

265
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,166
[NAGI] It's too late. The
Harmonium has been constantly

266
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,875
working to keep Sergey alive.
It's about to exceed its limits.

267
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,416
What did you say?!

268
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
The Harmonium's
powers and memories

269
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,916
are now flowing into Nina.

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,625
It won't be long before
there's nothing left of her.

271
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,625
[NINA screams]

272
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,625
[NAGI] It's sharing the
mistakes humanity has made

273
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,375
because of that thing.
Fear, hatred...

274
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,375
and most of all, despair.

275
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,791
It's like what
happened to the Gem

276
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,750
once known as the
Pure White Diamond.

277
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,208
This same despair
caused it to turn black.

278
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,625
Damn you...

279
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,291
[NAGI] I thought I could
wrap everything up before

280
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,666
it came to this. But it seems
my gamble didn't pay off.

281
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,583
Ah well, what can I say?

282
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,500
Why don't we all just
die together, then?

283
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,958
[ARIKA]
Nina! Ahh!

284
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:32,291
[NINA screams]

285
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:36,000
Arika! You have
to kill me! Please!

286
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,041
[ARIKA shudders]

287
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,541
[NINA]
You have to...

288
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,375
If you don't kill me now,
this world will be destroyed!

289
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,875
I can't!

290
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,250
Please, Arika...
I'm begging you...

291
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,791
If you think of me
as your friend...

292
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,416
[ARIKA screams]

293
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,750
[MASHIRO]
Stop her, Nagi! Ahh!

294
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,541
[NAGI] Nothing you do's
gonna change anything.

295
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,250
Quiet, you!

296
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,166
[MASHIRO cries]

297
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,125
I told you that it was useless.

298
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,208
Shut up! I'm not
about to give up.

299
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,875
[MASHIRO cries]

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,125
[MASHIRO] We are
never gonna give up.

301
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,958
Isn't that right, Arika?

302
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,250
Yes, Mashiro...
That's right.

Huh?

00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,833
Oh crap!

314
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,583
[NAGI]
Ah--!

315
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,541
Nagi Dai Artai. By the authority
of the emergency council,

316
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,416
I hereby place you under arrest!

317
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,208
[NAGI sighs] 

318
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,458
Hurry! Take him to
Garderobe right away!

319
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,000
[STUDENTS]
Yes!

320
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,125
[NATSUKI] All because of
something like this...

321
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,166
[MIKOTO] You do <i>not</i>
belong in this world.

322
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:10,166
[ARIKA grunts]

323
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,083
There, I finally
caught you, Nina...

324
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,708
Arika...

325
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,750
[NAGI chuckles]

326
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,125
[NAGI]
Eh?!

327
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,291
[MIKOTO]
Hmm...

328
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,833
[NAGI cries]

329
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,750
[MASHIRO] Today I
pledge to my citizens

330
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,666
that I will fulfill all
the promises I've made.

331
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,458
[applause]

332
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,500
All right! It's time
for the finishing touch!

333
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,833
Okay! Just leave it to me!

334
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,416
[ARIKA wails]

335
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,125
[murmurs]

336
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,541
You really haven't
changed at all, have you?

337
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,125
[ARIKA chuckles]

338
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:13,250
Sorry, my mistake! I'll get
it right this time. Here we go!

339
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,958
[murmurs]

340
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,416
The castle's done! Finally.

341
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,958
[MASHIRO]
Mm-hmm.

342
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:44,000
[MASHIRO] I know it might look
a little bare right now...

343
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,125
but this... is the
place I begin anew.

344
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,375
[MASHIRO] Yes, this is
just the beginning.

345
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,583
For me, and for all of us.

346
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,791
Isn't that right... Mimi?

347
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,625
So, let's get started, Arika!

348
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,166
[ARIKA]
Mm-hmm!

349
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,708
[ARIKA] My dreams
are all right here.

350
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,875
So keep watching me!

351
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:19,125
[ARIKA]
Ersty... Nina...

352
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,750
[SERGEY groans]

353
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,500
Who are... you?

354
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,708
My name's Nina.
Just plain "Nina."

355
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:56,166
Nina...

356
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,333
It's nice to meet you, Sergey.

357
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:02,291
[SERGEY] Sergey...
That's... my name?

358
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:06,583
[NINA] It's okay, we'll take
it slowly. There's no rush.

359
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:10,166
Another chance...
for both of us.
