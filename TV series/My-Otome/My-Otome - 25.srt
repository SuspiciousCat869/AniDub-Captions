[ADJUTANT 25A]
Continental Orb Topaz,

00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,041
Azurite of Intellectual Life,

3
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,750
and Thundering Garnet, please
proceed to the launch pad.

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,083
I'll leave you in
command of the ship.

5
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,125
[ADJUTANT 25A] Roger that,
Brigadier.

6
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,708
[HARUKA chuckles]

7
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,541
Get ready, girls. I'm here to
give you all a good spanking.

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,083
Right! Lift off!

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,000
[TECHNICIAN 25A] Otomes have
appeared on the enemy ship!

10
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,833
Look. All of our
enemies are coming.

11
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,916
They're coming to take
Sergey away from you.

12
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,000
Send out our Otomes
to engage them!

13
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,875
[SOLDIER 25A] All units retreat!
Prepare for an Otome battle!

14
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,416
It looks like Big Sister
Haruka has come at last.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,041
Hopefully they'll hold back,
but I doubt they will.

16
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,333
We can't help that.

17
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,666
We are not in a position
to choose our fate!

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,166
It's been that way ever
since we chose to be Otomes!

19
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,541
Hah. So it's starting.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,416
Listen to me, Carla.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,916
Our mission is only to lure
them out and keep them busy.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,958
So don't try to keep up
with the Brigadier.

23
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:29,958
[CARLA]
Right!

24
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,916
Okay, let's go! And launch!

25
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,708
Come on!

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,958

Haruka...

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
[TECHNICIAN 25A] It's the
main forces of the Alliance!

30
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:59,125
Yes, good.
This is what I call war!

31
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,416
If they decide to use the
Harmonium, then this war

32
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,291
will become a repeat of
the War of the Twelve Kings.

33
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,958
That's why we've launched
this preemptive attack.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,875
I've never seen you before!
Who the heck are you?

35
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,750
[CHIE] It's just me, Brigadier.

36
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,291
What? Major Hallard?

37
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,333
I can't go against
their control.

38
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,625
Please don't hate me for this!

[CHIE yells]

40
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,500
[YUKINO] According to the
information we've received,

41
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,791
they're not capable of
launching a pinpoint attack

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,083
at the present time.

43
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,375
Now that we're as close
as we can get...

44
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,875
We can only hope this works.

45
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,208
The rest is up to you,
Headmistress.

46
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,333
[GUARD 25A]
Has it started?

47
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,500
[NAO]
Hi there, boys!

48
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,041
[GUARD 25A]
Huh?

[guards gasp, yell]

50
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,750

Dammit! We need backup!

[GUARD 25A]
Huh? Ah!

53
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,583
[GUARD 25A]
Who the hell are you?

54
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,291
The one in charge
of this place.

55
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,625
I'll be taking
my school back now.

56
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,583
[NATSUKI] Listen up.
The enemy's Predecessor

57
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,583
is causing the jamming.
If we can destroy it

58
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,375
and revive Lady Fumi,
then victory is ours.

59
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,416
Our goal's the Mausoleum!

60
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,833
Stay away, old hag!

61
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,166
How rude of you.
Calling me an "old hag"...

62
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,083
[YUKARIKO] They should
have said "old woman."

63
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,666
[YUKARIKO gasps]
Oh! Uh... now, let's hurry!

64
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,916

Mm.

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,958
[NAO]
Huh? Behind you!

67
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,500
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

68
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,250
Really, Natsuki, how in
the world do you manage

69
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,708
without me around?

70
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,291
[NATSUKI]
Ah!

71
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,375
Shizuru!

72
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,916
I'm so sorry. You had
to suffer because of me.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,083
It's all right. It was
for your sake, Natsuki.

74
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,333
And besides, I did have
some fun while you were gone.

75
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,083
[NAO]
They're coming!

76
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,166
The insurgents have
entered Garderobe!

77
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,875
So that was their real
target all this time.

78
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,375
Then I would say it's about time
we move to the next step.

79
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,000
Send out the Slaves.

80
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,041
Yes.

[ARIKA yells]

[TECHNICIAN 25A]
Huh? Could it be?

101
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,625
Is that our holy land,
the Black Valley?

102
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,125
[NINA]
Arika...

103
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,875
What a surprise! Those two
really are such stubborn girls.

104
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,166
However, it still seems
that Arika hasn't been able

105
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,375
to bring out the true power
of the Blue Sky Sapphire.

106
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,041
Arika! Leave all these guys

107
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,416
for me and Mikoto to deal with!
You two head to the city!

108
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,958
Right!

109
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,291
[ARIKA] Mother. Please wait
for me just a little longer.

110
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,041
I'll be right there.

111
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,833
You have learned much,
but for you to release

112
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,916
the true powers
of that gemstone,

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,458
there is still one last barrier
left for you to overcome.

114
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:25,166
So go forth, Arika. Obtain
the power of the blue star.

115
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,541
And hold on to that one
remaining hope for beating

116
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,583
the "Ultimate Black Diamond"
and the Harmonium.

117
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,791
They've broken
the seal on the Mausoleum!

118

Father...

119
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,666
Oh really? Then prepare
the castle cannon.

120
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,041
Don't worry. The Forbidden
Library can withstand it.

121
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,583
Come on!

122
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,291
Please, I need just
a little more time!

00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,500
the Valkyries'
Predecessor is there...

128
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,041
Please make it!

Fire!!

[ANH] That's the
Headmistress's weapon.

00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,083
All right! That's the bacon
we've been waiting for!

Ha! C'mon, into the city!

134
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,333
You mean "beacon," Haruka.

135
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,583
So now the Five Pillars
and all of the students

136
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,125
should regain the
power of their Robes.

137
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,875
This is not good.
Hurry and reconnect!

138
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,916
We can't--the cable's broken!

charged and ready!

has finally made it back!

It's really you!

00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,208
A little late... aren't ya?

150

[NATSUKI] But... she
still hasn't unlocked

the full power
of the Sapphire...

[TOMOE] I commend you on your
bravery for coming here again,

156
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,500
but so far you've
shown no improvement.

 Big Sister Shizuru...

158
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,708
I knew it. It was
all a lie, wasn't it?

159
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,916
If you truly thought you
could earn someone's heart

afraid you're greatly mistaken.

You're so cruel.
But you know, Big Sister,

you and I are very much alike.

Because in the end,
no matter what you say to me,

I would do anything
to have you!!

how naïve you are!

I thought Natsuki destroyed
the Valkyrie's Predecessor!

This was definitely not
part of our plan! Honestly!

Aren't you just a little late,

You're right. I admit it.
I'm a queen who doesn't know

184

much about anything,
but there is one thing

185
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,666
that even I understand!
We cannot let Nagi

186
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,666
use such horrible power
and have his way with the world!

that through your heads yet?!

That's where you're mistaken!

You have to think for
yourselves! If you believe

192

you're just tools, then there
really is no use for Otomes!

quite vocal as of late.

all over again.

202
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,416
let's move on to the finale.

you know what kind of stress

that'll put on the system!

205
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,458
[NAGI] I don't mind.
After all, if we need

a new Predecessor,
pretty soon we'll have

All of the people whom
I loved and adored...

Every single one of them
has betrayed me.

Before I came
to this Academy,

241
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:49,208
I had everything I ever wished
for handed to me freely.

I'll just have to
make you all disappear.

along with the rest of them?

like that mean, anyway?

What's this? Only fighting
because of your Master?

251
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,583
That's awfully pathetic
for a Meister Otome.

252
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,791
[CHIE] He's using the attack
on Wind City as a disguise

253
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,583
for destroying all the Meisters.

254

That's the real objective
for this war, right?

255
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,291
That's right.
But I kept it a secret

256

Now, finally the Otomes

After all, the ones who
want to start a war the most

are none other than

00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,791
Let them do whatever they want.
We don't need to worry about it.

317
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,208
We still have our
last trump card.

318
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,750
[NINA gasps]

319
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:09,666
So we finally meet.
It's me, Arika.

320
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,166
Look... I'm here.

321
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,750
I've done it. I've become
an Otome like you.

322
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,125
Does it suit me?

323
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,750
Heh, I guess I'm
a bit embarrassed.

324
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,125
Weird, isn't it?

325
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,416
I always thought that
when we finally met...

326
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,958
I'd have so many more things
I wanted to tell you about.

327
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:39,541
Are you in pain? I'm sure
you are... being like this...

328
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:45,291
I won't cry anymore.
I already swore to that...

329
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,916
[MASHIRO] Arika!
As your Master, I order you!

330
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,750
Destroy this thing
once and for all!

331
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,583
Thank you for helping,
Mashiro. But it's all right.

332
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,500
I've thought this
through on my own.

333
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,333
And I've made my decision!

334
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,208
Oh, Mother... Thank you...

335
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,958
The connection
has been restored!

336
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,708
[MAI] Arika's done it,
hasn't she?

337
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,291
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

338
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,250
Jeez, what took you so long?

339
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,125
Sorry! I did my best
to get here sooner.

340
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,958
[MIYU] Miss Lena. At last,
you may rest in peace.

341
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,833
Arika! We're gonna
charge right in!

342
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,375
Mm. Hang on, Nina!
I'm coming!

343
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,666
[MIKOTO gasps]
It's coming!

344
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,208
It's the Harmonium!

345
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,833
Nina...

346
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,000
[ARIKA] I want to become an
Otome who can protect everyone.

347
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,125
[MASHIRO]
I want to create a country

348
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,833
where everyone can live happily.

349
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,750
[NINA] I only want my Father.
Nothing more.

350
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,000
[MASHIRO]
My wish...

351
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,375
[NINA]
My love...

352
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,791
[ARIKA]
My dream...

353
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,333
[ARIKA, NINA, and MASHIRO]
 ...is right here.
