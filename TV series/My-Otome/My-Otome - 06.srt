[yelling]

3
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,250
What are you so upset
about, Arika?

4
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,083
I'm trying to write
to my sponsor

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,916
but I don't know who it is.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,541
I mean, how do you think
I should address them?

7
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,416
[ERSTIN] The wording and
handwriting looks formal,

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,291
so I think the writer's a man.

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,791
Hey, what do you think, Nina?

10
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,250
Who knows.

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,625
You were asked to write your
sponsor every week, right?

12
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,500
So why don't you figure
it out yourself?

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:51,791
Meanie. Gee, Nina, why
are you always so cold?

14
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,333
[gasps]

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,375
Huh?

16
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,958
What? Stop staring!

17
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,750
[ARIKA]
Huh...

18
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,458
[NINA gasps]

19
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,583
Stop that!

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,958
[ARIKA]
Heh.

21
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,458
[laughs]

22
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,458
At last, I found
your weak point!

23
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,500
Take this!

24
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,291
Tickle, tickle, tickle...!

25
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,708
[NINA]
No! Stop!

--[laughing]
--[NINA screaming]

27
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,250
This is the first time I've
seen you get like this, Nina!

28
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,333
So cute!

29
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,333
No, stop! Please don't!

Why you!

00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,916
[ARIKA screams]

33
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,041
[NINA] That's for what
you did to me yesterday!

34
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,833
[ARIKA groans]

35
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:13,833
Don't ever try that again
unless you want another beating.

36
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,125
You made your point,

37
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,916
but do you think I'm
gonna let end like this?!

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,583
[ARIKA, NINA yell]

[BOTH gasp]

40
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,916
Stop this, both of you.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,125
A dance battle must be fought
with grace and charm.

42
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,250
Otomes must not be swayed
by their personal emotions!

43
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,291
[ARIKA]
Hmph.

44
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,833
[growls]

45
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,541
This could be a problem.

46
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,750
Wait, just a moment.

47
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,958
What do you wanna
see me about?

48
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,416
I don't think I've done
anything lately.

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,666
Actually, I have a small
favor to ask of you, Nao.

50
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,833
[NAO]
Hm?

51
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,750
[YUKARIKO]
You see...

52
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,166
[ARIKA, NINA]
What?!

53
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,583
[YAYOI]
Room duty?

54
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,125
Yep.

55
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,208
Miss Yukariko said that I'm
being appointed as Nao's helper,

56
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,833
just like Nina, and we both
have to handle room duty.

57
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,125
Wow!

58
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,041
Working for Big Sister Nao,
Pearl Number Four,

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,375
I think that's pretty cool!

60
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,458
So what kinds of things do
I have to do for room duty?

61
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's see.

62
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:21,333
Well, you have to clean her
room, and make lunch for her.

63
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,833
Basically, you hafta
do her daily chores.

64
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,333
In return, she'll do things

65
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,958
like be your sparring partner,
or help you study.

66
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,541
Yeah, but you have to follow any
order the Big Sister gives you.

67
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,458
Even if it's this, or that,

68
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,333
you're not allowed
to refuse her!

69
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,375
It sounds like a pain.

70
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,583
[TOMOE]
It's probably an attempt

71
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,500
to bring you and Nina
closer together.

72
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,625
[IRINA] Right, especially after
that big fight earlier today.

73
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,666
Well, I let things
get outta hand.

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,000
This all started when
I found Nina's weak point.

75
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,833
Weak point?
Now I'm interested!

76
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,625
You wanna know? Well...

77
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,000
[IRINA]
Hmm...

78
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,916
Really?

00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,791
Irina! No!

81
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,208
Wow! Sexy!

82
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,333
Isn't she?

83
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,750
[NINA]
Arika!

[SHIHO]
My goodness!

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,541
How surprising!

90
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,583
Who would've known Nina
could be so ticklish?

91
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,375
It was totally adorable!

92
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,791
Oh?

93
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,083
It makes me wonder if they
have any other weaknesses,

94
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,625
either Nina, or Arika.

95
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,166
Oh, Miya, do you know
if they have any?

96
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,916
[MIYA]
Huh?

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,708
I... Well, I...

98
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,625
I... don't know much about...
Nina... I'm afraid.

99
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,958
I know! Arika doesn't
know how to swim!

100
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,083
Really?!

101
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,500
Yeah!

102
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,416
We were talking about our
swimming classes tomorrow.

103
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,791
You've never swam before?

104
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,375
Nope! So I'm really
looking forward to it!

105
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,583
And that's what she said!

106
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,583
I see...

107
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,958
[SHIHO]
Seven maki-maki's for Nina Wang.

108

Three maki-maki's
for Arika Yumemiya.

[chuckles]

110
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,125
You defied me, a member of
the prosperous clan of Cardair,

111
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,291
so you must be punished
by the spinning maki-maki!

112
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,958
Red maki-maki, blue maki-maki,

00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,375
[ARIKA] We swim here?
It's a big bathtub!

121
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,375
Somethin' like that.
Are you sure you're ready?

122
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,708
Of course I am!

123
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,375
Or I would like to say that.

124
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,291
But a weird person's watching!

125
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,000
Who are you calling weird?

126
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,833
After hearing that
you can't swim,

127
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,833
I simply had to come and watch.

128
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,458
You're wrong! This is
just my first time!

129
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,250
So you can't swim then.

130
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,250
I can swim! I'm sure!

131
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,583
And what's with that weird
bathing suit you're wearing?

132
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,291
Ugh! You're calling
me weird again!

133
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,708
This swimsuit was passed down

134
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,916
through generations
of the royal family!

139
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,208
It's nice. They're almost
like old friends.

140
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,875
They're just noisy.

141
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,541
All right, everybody, line up.

142
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,166
Ah, Arika. As for you...

143
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,416
Yes?

144
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,416
[YUKARIKO]
Since it's your first time,

145
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
you'll begin by sinking
your face into the water

146
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,375
and opening your eyes.

147
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,041
No way!

148
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,583
Do the best that you can.

149
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll check on your
progress later.

150
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,541

washing my face!

153
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,208
It'll be easy!

154
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,416

I'll never get tired

of watching you make
a fool of yourself!

Yup.

That guy goes around scouting
young women of Artai,

looking for potential Otome
candidates to send here.

252
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,875
Our country is
very cold and poor,

253
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,958
and Grand Duke Nagi doesn't
even have an Otome yet.

They're probably
trying to strengthen

You can have all the soldiers,
tanks, and battleships you want,

00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,875
but they're no match against
even a single Meister.

260
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,250
The Otome's power is the
military power of the nation.

261
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,583
That's why Otomes are
so well respected.

So then why are you trying
to become an Otome?

265
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,708

She's also a simpleminded moron.

I bet she's feeling really
depressed right about now.

she embarrassed her father.

272
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,416
He might have taken
her under his wing

00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,125
However...

326
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,125
[IRINA]
"When it comes into contact

327
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,708
with strong salt concentration,

328
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,458
its body becomes cloudy,
making it easy to see."

329
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,958
Now I get it.

330
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,458
The Headmistress has given
her permission for this,

331
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,208
so I will allow you to proceed.

332
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,375
But if turns out to
be a waste of time,

333
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,875
there will be consequences.

334
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,500
[NINA]
I'm not worried.

335
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,750
[SHIHO]
This could be a problem.

336
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,750
[ARIKA sighs]

337
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,333
[ARIKA]
Well, that's all the salt!

338
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,333
[IRINA]
Yep, we brought it all.

339
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,250
[NINA]
It's too soon to take a break.

340
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:48,125
It's time to bring those
things to the light!

341
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,750
[ARIKA]
Take this!

342
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,250
[ERSTIN]
And that!

343
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,375
[IRINA laughing]

344
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,041
[ARIKA]
There!

345
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,500
[NINA]
C'mon, show yourselves!

346
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,250
I'm gonna catch you
all in a single net!

347
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,666
[ARIKA]
Hm?

348
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,250
There's nothing here.

349
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,125
[MARIA]
You, girls.

350
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,333
You've wasted all this food.

351
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,291
It's punishment duty
for you. Be prepared.

352
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,083
[ERSTIN, IRINA groan]

353
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,333
[ARIKA]
Hm.

354
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,458
[SHIHO]
Leave them to me, Miss Maria!

355
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,333
I will be sure to
supervise them properly.

356
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,125
Is that so?

357
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,125
Then I'll leave you
in charge of cleanup.

358
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,416
Leave the pool area
as soon as you're done.

359
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
There you have it!

360
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,375
You'd better hurry up
with the cleaning!

361
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,250
[IRINA] Oh boy, looks like
Nina's chance to redeem herself

362
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,291
has hit a dead end.

363
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,750
[ERSTIN]
Well, it can't be helped.

364
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,375
My hands are sticky!

365
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,125
[ERSTIN]
Huh?

366
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,041
[IRINA]
Sticky?

367
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,166
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm.

368
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:52,583
[IRINA groans]

369
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,625
It tastes sweet.

370
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,791
Huh?!

371
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,625
Arika! What did you
do this time?

372
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,291
[ERSTIN]
Sweet.

373
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,833
Ah!

374
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,375
No way!

375
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,750
I went and got all the bags
from the section marked "salt"!

376
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,708
But... it's definitely sugar.

377
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,500
Then...

378
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,583
Arika!

379
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,250
[ARIKA]
Wait a minute!

380
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,166
[SHIHO]
Hm?

381
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,000
[gasps]

382
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,208
"When given sugar,

383
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,375
these organisms will
merge with each other,

384
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:31,083
absorb the surrounding water,
and grow to enormous size"?!

385
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,208
[ALL scream]

386
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,041
[SHIHO screaming]

387
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,833
[ERSTIN]
Big Sister Shiho!

388
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,916
[yelps]

389
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,166
Erstin!

390
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,833
[whimpering]

391
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,291
Stop!

392
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,541
Go! Run and get one of the
teachers, Irina! Hurry! Now!

393
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,833
Got it!

394
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,625
[ARIKA]
Watch out!

395
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,666
What are you waiting
for?! Save me!

396
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,000
[ERSTIN screams]

397
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,208
What do we do, Nina?

398
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,208
If we could use our Robes,
we could take this thing down!

399
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:16,916
[SHIHO screams]

400
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,083
Oh no, Big Sister Shiho!

401
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,416
[ERSTIN gasps]

402
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,375
Arika, you run and distract it.

403
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,166
I'm gonna try this
one more time.

404
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,500
Gotcha!

405
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,791
Hey, I'm over here!

406
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,166
[NINA]
I did it!

407
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,833
Nina!

408
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,375
[NINA gasps]

00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:46,416
[NINA grunting]

410
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,708
Nina!

411
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,958
Nina!

[IRINA]
Arika!

00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,833
Hey. Look who that is!

416
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,458
[NAO]
Ugh. Jeez.

417
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,375
You went to all that trouble
just to save someone like her?

418
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,333
Ugh. You girls
really are fools.

419
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,625
[SHIHO grunting]

420
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,500
I can't get out of here!

421
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,916
[grunts]

422
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,750
[NAO] Hi! How's the
maki-maki going?

423
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,625
[NAO chuckles]

424
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,125
[NAO]
This suits you well.

425
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,250
A swirl-headed girl getting
trapped in a swirl herself.

426
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,791
Hurry up and save me, Juliet!

427
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:37,750
And what are you supposed to say
to someone when you ask a favor?

428
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,041
Would you help me, please?

429
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,833
[NAO]
Huh?

430
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,833
Please help me!

431
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,875
Guess I have to, then.

432
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,708
[screaming]

433
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,750
Big Sister Nao!

434
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,666
That was cool!

435
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,333
WEll, it seems that you
owe me again, Nina.

436
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,208
And you too, Arika.

437
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,166
[SHIHO]
Juliet!

438
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,666
[BOTH]
Hm?

439
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,250
How could you just
dump me here?!

440
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,458
You're a big liar,
you know that?!

441
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,083
Hey, I never said I was
going to help you safely.

442
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,541
You're such an idiot.

443
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,708
[SHIHO]
Juliet! I'm gonna maki-maki you!

444
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,458
[ARIKA]
"Dear, Sir.

445
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,375
Well... I've decided to
start calling you 'Sir.'

446
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,041
Nao, one of the senior
students of the Academy,

447
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,166
told me that that's what
older men like to be called.

448
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,875
Oh, let me tell you
about Nao, my Big Sister.

449
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,875
I've been appointed
to her room duty.

450
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,208
She says she doesn't mind

451
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,708
because she thinks
I'm interesting.

452
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,750
I rely on her, and my
roommates Nina and Ersty,

453
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:58,791
and so many of my classmates.

454
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,291
I've made lots of friends
at this Academy."

455
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,375
What ugly handwriting.

456
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,041
[ARIKA]
"Classes are difficult,

457
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,750
but I'm enjoying each
and every day very much.

458
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,250
I owe it all to you.

459
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,041
Thank you, Sir."

460
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,375
[NINA]
What was with this episode?

461
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,000
Why did I have to endure that?

462
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,333
[NATSUKI]
I see. So it's you this time.

463
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,666
Then I'll leave the rest to you.

464
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,916
[NINA]
What are you saying?

465
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,333
[NATSUKI]
Don't worry.

466
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,000
Once you get used to it,
you'll find it quite pleasant.

467
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,875
[NINA]
N-No!
