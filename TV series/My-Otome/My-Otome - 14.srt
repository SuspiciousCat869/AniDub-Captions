1
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,500
[explosion]

2
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,541
[YOHKO] It's the Romulus
and Remus border!

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,750
A battle's taking place
between their Otomes?!

4
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,625
[REP A] You're the ones who
invaded our borders first!

5
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:33,916
That is ridiculous!

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,875
It was our border police
on our side of Lutesia

7
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,166
who were attacked first!

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,375
That is the biggest lie
I've ever heard!

9
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,750
And this is exactly
why a nation led by

10
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,125
an evil matriarchal family
cannot be trusted!

11
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,291
Look who's talking!

12
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,541
Your people were
descended from exiles!

13
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,958
[REP A, REP B]
Huh?

14
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,500
Sorry to interrupt,

15
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,583
but you two were having
such a fiery argument

16
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,083
that I couldn't help but find
myself drawn into it all.

17
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,791
And wow, it's burning me up.

18
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,416
Although it's true
that this skirmish

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,083
developed into a battle
between Meister Otomes,

20
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,375
I understand that there were
no fatalities on either side.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,875
It's probably best to take
a moment to calm down.

22
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,458
Isn't that right, Headmistress?

23
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,250
This is the first time
in half a century

24
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,166
that two Meister Otomes have
fought against each other.

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,708
If this turns into
something greater,

26
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,375
it'll almost certainly cause
widespread panic.

27
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,166
It is therefore the
Council's responsibility

28
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,666
to take measures to prevent
that from happening.

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,375
I hope the two of you understand
the severity of the situation.

30
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,083
[SERGEY]
Is this the beginning?

31
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,583
[STUDENT A]
Did you hear?

32
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,500
[STUDENT B] You mean about the
United Kingdom of Lutesia?

33
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,916
[STUDENT C]
Maybe it's just a rumor.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,666
[STUDENT D] But they're holding
emergency deliberations.

35
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,541
[IRINA] Everyone's talking
about these rumors.

36
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,166
Hey... what do you
think, Ers--? Uh!

37
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,291
Ah! A-Arika!
What are you doing?!

38
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,458
Huh? You mean this?

39
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,625
Uh.

40
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,166
[ARIKA]
I'm sorry!

41
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,125
I wonder what's really
going on in Lutesia.

42
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,708
Has Major Wang
told you anything?

43
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,375
No. This matter is none
of my business, after all.

44
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,583
You know, I feel so
sorry for those two.

45
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:55,083
[TOMOE] Yayoi is from Romulus,
and Miya is from Remus.

46
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,458
It must be hard
for both of them.

47
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,208
Oh no, I'm sorry!
I didn't do it on purpose!

48
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,125
Please believe me, Yayoi!

49
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,166
[YAYOI] Come on, stop
apologizing to me like that.

50
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,541
I mean, it's not like--

51
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,041
[LILIE] There's some tension
between Cardair and Florince now

52
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,958
because of what happened
with Big Sister Akane.

53
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,458
If all these rumors about
fighting turn out to be true,

54
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,958
then this makeup class
won't be of much use to us.

55
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,041
[MARIA]
Hmph.

56
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,666
Why does everyone
look so troubled?

57
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,375
If a baseless rumor can
affect you so much,

58
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,208
you will never have the strength
to become a great Otome.

59
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,291
It's just... a rumor, right?

60
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,166
Lutesia... is where I'm from.

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,333
And I can't believe two
Big Sister Meisters

62
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,000
would fight each other there.

63
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,291
Even if the rumor does
turn out to be true,

64
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,875
does that change anything?

65
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,083
[MIYA]
But I'm...

66
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,708
This is all part of the
path you've chosen.

67
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,416
It's not only about being
graceful and respected,

68
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,833
an Otome has to protect
her Master's life

69
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,375
and the fate of her nation,

70
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,375
and often must risk
her life in battle.

71
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,750
I am sure that all of
you understand this.

72
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,541
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
stepped foot into this Academy.

73
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,208
[whimpers]

74
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,583
[MARIA]
You don't have time to cry.

75
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,416
The promotion exams
are coming soon.

76
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,458
There is also the graduation,
and the commemorative

77
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,041
dance-battle between
representatives

78
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,791
of the Coral class and the
graduating Pearl class.

79
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,333
If you are all real Otomes,
then put your best foot forward,

80
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,291
and keep your head up.

81
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,791
[ERSTIN]
Huh?

82
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:42,125
[bell tolls]

83
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,916
[YAYOI crying]

84
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,291
[IRINA] I guess this must
feel awkward for you, Arika.

85
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,125
Considering the time
you told Miss Maria

86
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,750
that you were gonna prevent
wars from happening.

87
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,416
[ARIKA]
Huh?

88
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,875
Oh right, that!

89
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,125
But this was just a small
argument between countries.

90
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,333
There's no need to
get serious about it.

91
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,250
This sort of thing is
pretty common, right?

92
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,208
You make it sound so trivial!

93
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,958
My country and Yayoi's country

94
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,291
could end up at war
with each other,

95
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,875
and you have the
nerve to say that?!

96
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,291
Prevent wars?

97
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,208
Then why don't you do something
to stop this right now?!

98
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,541
When I entered Garderobe,

99
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,625
I always believed that my
future would be stable,

100
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,750
even if I didn't
become a Meister.

101
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,291
But why...? Why did this...?

102
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,250
Why did this have to happen?!

103
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,000
Someone, please do something.

104
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,958
Um... I... I didn't...

105
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,458
Calm down, it'll be
okay. Come with me.

106
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,500
We'll go somewhere private.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,666
Sorry, Miya...

108
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,666
Look, I understand
how you feel,

109
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,958
but don't worry too
much about it, Arika.

110
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,333
[ERSTIN] Irina's right.
Don't be too bothered by it.

111
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,958
She is to blame for
what just happened.

112
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,166
Huh?

113
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,250
Nina!

114
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,958
Even if it's only
a border conflict,

115
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,333
it became a battle
between Meisters.

116
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,666
You can't just casually
compare something like that

117
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,416
to a street fight.

118
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,833
Hey, Arika.

119
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,208
You're already weird,

120
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,541
but lately you've been
acting weirder than normal.

121
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,875
Is something wrong?

122
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,041
[ARIKA]
Huh?

123
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,333
No... there's nothing wrong.

124
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,708
[NINA]
Really? Well, good.

125
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,458
[REP A] Like I said before,
you instigated this!

126
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,000
[REP C]
That's not the issue!

127
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,166
What we need to determine here
is who is at greater fault!

128
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,541
[OFFICIAL B] Well, I would say
it's very clear who's at fault!

129
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,250
[OFFICIAL A]
Yes, very clear!

130
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,083
Enough! I'm calling
for a recess.

131
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,541
Really, it's all beacause
they used Otomes

132
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,708
for such a small conflict.

133
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,625
What do they think a Meister's
powers are for, anyway?

134
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,875
Those idiots...

135
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,416
[SERGEY] I'd say you've
made the answer clear

136
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,750
with your pretty speeches
over the past half century.

137
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,583
"Otomes are strong,
graceful, and beautiful,

138
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,708
but they are certainly not to be
regarded as weapons of war."

139
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,750
You're being awfully
calm about this.

140
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,208
What's Artai's position?

141
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,375
I hope it had nothing to
do with this incident.

142
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,875
No, of course it didn't.

143
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,083
Inciting this kind of
conflict between nations

144
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,875
wouldn't benefit Artai in the
slightest, you know that.

145
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,333
And besides,

146
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,416
when I chose Nina and Nao to
come to Garderobe Academy,

147
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,750
it was never with the intention

148
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,291
of having them engage
in a real fight.

149
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,208
Aren't you forgetting
to mention one other?

150
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,416
[SERGEY]
Huh?

151
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,166
Oh, really? Can't think of who.

152
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,000
[NATSUKI]
Hmph.

153
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,125
Well anyway,
isn't it almost time

154
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,541
for the graduation dance-battle?

155
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,333
Are you still having it,
even after all of this?

156
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,875
[NATSUKI] Of course.
Even at times like this--

157
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,875
No, because of times like this,

00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,833
who knows about the incident.

316
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,000
Where's Arika? She's late.

317
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,708
That girl is so annoying, always
making me worry like this.

318
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,750
[ERSTIN]
You sure have changed, Nina.

319
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,375
There was a time
not too long ago

320
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,875
when you wouldn't have worried
or cared about Arika at all.

321
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,916
I don't care!
It's not like that!

322
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,333
It's just the two of us.

323
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,083
We don't get this chance often,
so why don't we cuddle?

324
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:06,875
[ERSTIN giggles]

325
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,958
Hey, Nina! Ha, ha!

326
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,541
Hey, come on, stop it! Stop!

327
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,750
Come on, Nina.

328
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,583
[ERSTIN giggles]

329
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,041
[NINA]
Ersty, stop that!

330
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,458
[ERSTIN giggles]

331
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,083
[ERSTIN]
Big Sister Lena Sayers.

332
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,791
She became a Meister Otome

333
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,083
after graduating from
Garderobe Academy

334
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,000
with record-breaking marks.

335
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,041
She served the Royal
Family of Windbloom,

336
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,458
and inherited Windbloom's
Blue Sky Sapphire.

337
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,875
She was the Meister
for about ten years.

338
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,875
As an Otome, she served the
King and Queen faithfully.

339
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,666
But a day finally came
when she decided

340
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,041
to take off that Gemstone
once and for all.

341
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,208
You mean...?

342
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,375
[ERSTIN]
Mh-hm.

343
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,208
She did it to be with
the man she loved.

344
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,083
What happened to her?
Where is she now?

345
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,791
Fifteen years ago,

346
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,125
some rebels invaded the castle
and killed the King and Queen.

347
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,375
At that time, Big Sister
Lena went missing,

348
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,833
and so did her baby daughter,

349
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,750
who was born at about the
same time as Queen Mashiro.

350
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,500
I know the story, because
Miss Maria told it to everyone

351
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,250
when we first got to the school.

352
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,125
She was able to both fulfill
her dreams and find love,

353
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,375
as an Otome.

354
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,333
Actually, she was able to
live a really full life.

355
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,458
The kind any woman would want.

356
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,416
Miss Maria said she
couldn't manage that.

357
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Both love... and dreams?

358
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,333
You've gotta go and
find out for sure!

359
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,625
[ARIKA]
Grandma used to say,

360
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,833
"The more scared you are,

361
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,750
the more you need to
keep moving forward."

362
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,250
That guy might be a conceited
jerk who's always teasing me,

363
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:49,250
but... I have to go see
if these feelings are real.

364
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,750
I never expected to find
her in a place like this.

365
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,041
People tend to overlook
the simplest spots.

366
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,500
By the way, don't you
need to send your reply?

367
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,375
The letter arrived a week ago.

368
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,041
You know, from your
young lady friend?

369
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,750
[SERGEY] Look, I don't need
you pressuring me about it.

370
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,291
[YAMADA] Pardon me for
overstepping my boundaries.

371
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,125
You seem so happy
whenever you're sending

372
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,791
or receiving those letters.

373
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,791
[SERGEY]
That's just for work.

374
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,583
You're saying that the dress for
her birthday was just for work?

375
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,458
I have to admit,
I was surprised.

376
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,583
To think that the man once known
as the "North Hound" would--

377
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,166
Shut up.

378
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,875
So, it's still there.

379
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,041
Or should I say
it's been revived?

380
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,541
She's in there.

381
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,500
[YAMADA]
Well then... I'll be going now.

382
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,458
[ARIKA yelps]

383
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,500
Hey, what the heck's going on?!

384
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,833
[MAN A]
Hello, little rabbit!

385
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,416
It doesn't matter
how strong you are,

386
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,250
you're helpless in that
position, aren't you?

387
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,458
Stupid idiots!
Let me go right now!

388
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,291
What are you guys trying to do?

389
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,625
They're white.

390
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,583
Just how a Coral Otome
of Garderobe should be.

391
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,041
Pure, proper, and oh so pretty.

392
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,333
So, we're gonna get to mess
around with this one, right?

393
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,333
[MAN A]
Yep.

394
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,458
We were told to do
what we need to

395
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,333
to make her lose her
Otome privilieges.

396
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,041
[ARIKA]
Huh?

397
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,208
What?

398
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:29,333
It's true. There's no
mistake about it.

399
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,875
Miss Lena first gave
her own child

400
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,916
into the hands of my
colleague for safekeeping.

401
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,875
She then took the amulet
of the Royal Family,

402
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,541
the Blue Sky Sapphire,

403
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,166
and placed it around
the Princess' neck,

404
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,583
before taking them
both out of the castle.

405
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,583
So you're saying...

406
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,333
The girl who wears
the Blue Sky Sapphire

407
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,750
is the daughter of
the King and Queen,

408
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,750
and the true heir to Windbloom.

409
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,875
Now then, time to get
the party started!

410
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,791
Don't forget to take pictures.
We'll make a fortune.

411
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,208
I guess you could say

412
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,458
that we're having an early
Otome Graduation Ceremony.

413
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:14,541
[MEN laughing]

414
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,166
[ARIKA]
No!

415
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,083
No!

416
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,666
[MARIA]
Men are like wolves.

417
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,250
All of them.

418
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,916
You should be careful, everyone.
When I was young, they would--

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,958
[MIYA]
What?!

420
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,250
[TOMOE]
You're being impolite, Miya.

421
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,625
An Otome must remain
pure, proper, and pretty.

422
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,750
It's not right to doubt
or lie to others.

423
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,291
[MIYA] Actually, I think
women are scarier...
