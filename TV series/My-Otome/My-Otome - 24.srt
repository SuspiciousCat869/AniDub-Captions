1
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,250
[NINA]
Hmm...

2
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,875
[SERGEY] That uniform
looks really good on you.

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,583
[SERGEY] Congratulations on
being accepted, Nina- <i>chan</i> .

4
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,583
[NINA giggles]

5
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,916
[NINA]
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,291
I guess one day you'll stand
before me like this in a

7
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,291
beautiful wedding dress just
as I'm about to give you away.

8
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,666
But I'm never going
to get married! Ever!

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,708
I mean, I can't get married
once I become a Meister Otome.

10
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:04,750
That's why... uh... I...

11
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:08,208
I will always be your daughter.

12
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:11,250
And I'll never leave
your side, Father.

13
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,375
Is that OK, though?

14
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,708
[SERGEY] Of course
it's okay... Nina- <i>chan</i> .

15
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,041
[alarm buzzes]

16
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,375
[WOMAN 23A] Meister Nina, it's
time for the Royal Conference.

17
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,916
[CHILD 24A] Wow!
That's so awesome!

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,291
[MAN 24A] That's the fleet
of Remus' Imperial Guard.

19
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,875
[CHILD 24B] Look! That ship's
the Antoinette, from Florince!

20
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,333
[MAN 24B] More and
more Otomes and Kings

21
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,125
are coming to Wind City.

22
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,958
I wonder if this means all
those rumors are really true.

23
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,791
About the war, you mean?

24
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:24,875
What is His Highness thinking?

25
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,041
--Shh!
--Huh?

26
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,208
Oh yeah, you never
know who's listening.

27
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,166
All right, why don't
we get started?

28
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,000
Report on the current situation.

29
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,833
Of course. Just now,
King Charles of Florince

30
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,875
and his Meister Rosalie
have arrived in our nation.

31
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,000
They are about to sign
the treaty of alliance

32
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,458
with our government
very shortly.

33
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,750
This is all thanks to
the many demonstrations

34
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,208
of the Harmonium's power.

35
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,875
The deadline given by His
Highness is quickly approaching.

36
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,041
It will be interesting
to see how many nations

37
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,666
withdraw from the old treaty
and come over to our side.

38
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,375
[NINA]
What is Cardair's position?

39
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,541
[SMITH] They seem to be
focused on arguing over

40
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,666
the selection of the next heir.
I'm not surprised,

41
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,666
given every one of the
candidates has been eliminated.

42
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,666
[NAGI] How scary.
Still, for the most part,

43
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,583
things are going as expected.

44
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,000
But the actions taken by Aries

45
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,708
are very troubling,
Your Highness.

46
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,500
It could be fun if they
decide to come at us.

47
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,708
Well, if they do,
I'm counting on you, Nina.

48
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,750
Of course. Leave it to me.

49
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,041
[HARUKA] Why can't we
take the Suzushiro?

50
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,125
All that we need is the
ceremonial equipment, right?

51
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,666
Yes, but the problem is that
our usual imports of goods

52
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,375
from Remus have suddenly been
cut off. I'm guessing that Remus

53
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,833
has decided to side
with Grand Duke Nagi...

54
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,750
Damn that opportunistic hag!

55
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,291
How dare she go and betray us
at a time like this! Huh?

56
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,250
[SECRETARY 24A ] Madam
President. You have a guest.

57
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,041
Come in.

58
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,708
[HARUKA gasps]

59
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,416
Long time no see...
Big Sister Haruka.

60
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,833
[HARUKA]
Sara Gallagher?!

61
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,208
[YUKINO]
One of the Five Pillars,

62
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,125
the Milky Way Aquamarine!

63
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,250
But... I thought you were
supposed to be doing some work

64
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,333
with those dudes in the east!

65
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,083
You mean the "Eastern Kingdoms"?

66
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,000
How many times do I
have to remind you?

67
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,250
Please be precise with
your actions and comments!

68
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,500
Never mind.

69
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,166
I have some good news. Today,
I've brought some nice presents

70
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,875
for you, all the way
from Zipang.

71
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,375
[HARUKA, YUKINO]
Presents?

72
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,000
[MARIA] Laula Bianchi.
Rosalie Claudel.

73
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,666
Oh my goodness! Miss Maria!
Big Sister Yukariko!

74
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,666
Hello there!

75
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,333
[LAULA]
Good to see you again.

76
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,833
[YUKARIKO] I see. So your
wedding was cancelled

77
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,750
because of that
incident with Akane.

78
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,291
Yep, that's how it turned out.

79
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,875
And the girl who was supposed
to replace her went missing,

80
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,333
along with the Spiral Spin
Serpentine Gem.

81
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,291
As a result, I had no
choice but to reenter

82
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,625
a contract with this
Abyssal Jade gemstone.

83
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,125
You were telling me
you were relieved

84
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,291
to get out of the marriage
because it was political.

85
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,041
Aw, don't tell them that,
Big Sister Laula!

86
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:22,041
Stop being so mean to me!

87
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,750
]You are really not taking this
seriously enough, Rosalie.

88
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,833
This is completely different
from what we experienced

89
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,375
with the Lutesia
border conflicts.

90
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,708
This time, we might end up
having to kill each other.

91
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,666
Maybe even Carla,
and Big Sister Haruka...

92
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,666
[NINA] However... that is
what makes us Otomes.

93
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,750
All of you will be
under my authority.

94
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,625
Please follow my orders.

95
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,458
Very well. I will do as you say,
Ultimate Black Diamond.

96
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:49,916
It is only natural. I don't want
to see another city disappear.

97
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,125
Please show these two
to their quarters.

98
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,708
I will speak
with you both later.

99
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,208
[MARIA]
Wait a moment, Nina Wang.

100
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,750
[NINA]
Hm?

101
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,958
[MARIA] This is for you.
We found this

102
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,166
when we were collecting
Erstin Ho's possessions.

103
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,666
[NINA]
Huh?

104
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,291
[MARIA] It's a letter addressed
to you and Arika Yumemiya.

105
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,291
[TOMOE] So, how does
it feel to order around

106
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,833
all those prominent
Big Sister Meisters?

107
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,000
And not just that. What does it
feel like to control a weapon

108
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,333
that's said to have once
destroyed half the world?

109
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:29,416
It's nothing. I do what I do
because it is necessary.

110
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,875
For the sake of
your dearest father?

111
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,083
To make the Grand
Duke's ideals reality!

112
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,791
To change this twisted world...

113
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,125
[TOMOE]
Liar.

114
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,500
Hm. Just do whatever
you want to do.

115
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,416
Right now, you're able to make
any wish of yours a reality.

116
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,791
Even if you want a man,
there are plenty of loopholes

117
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,666
you could use.
For example, you can...

118
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,875
Shut up, right now! What would
you understand about it?!

119
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,458
I don't think you could!

120
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,416
I don't even want to understand!
You do nothing but make excuses

121
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,958
to hide the fact that your
jealousy is out of control,

122
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,500
killing your two best
friends in the process!

123
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,916
I suggest you leave...
Get out of my sight right now!

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,958
Hm. You know something, Nina?

125
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,708
I'm looking forward
to the war beginning.

126
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,416
From now on, let's both watch
our own backs, all right?

127
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,083
[TOMOE]
Nina is so mean.

128
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,500
I'm sure I didn't do anything
to make her angry like that.

129
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,333
That's a magic spell
to relieve the pain.

130
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,708
Ah! Please, just wait
a little longer.

131
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,458
If I have a bit more time,
I'm sure I can convince them

132
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,666
to set you and the
Headmistress free.

133
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,750
Don't worry about that.
Everything's all right

134
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,750
now that I have you,
my dear Tomoe.

135
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,583
Oh, Big Sister...

136
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,416
[IRINA] Headmistress,
it worked like a charm!

137
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,208
It took a bit of doing, but...

138
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,916
I was able to get that letter
to Big Sister Shizuru!

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,416
[various cheers,
affirmative reactions]

140
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,625
I see. Good.

141
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,541
[IRINA] And regarding
that other thing...

142
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,750
What did you find out?
Is it possible?

143
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,291
Yep, I'm almost
certain it is!

144
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,583
It's exactly the same as the
data left by Professor Yohko.

145
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,125
[NATSUKI]
Good job.

146
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,791
[IRINA] I can't
take all the credit.

147
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:21,041
My classmates also helped a lot.
And as for using the computer,

148
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,458
this book really came
in handy in the end.

149
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,541
It was something
Erstin left behind.

150
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,750
I see.

151
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,625
Any word from Aries?

152
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,875
They sent a message to report
their departure was delayed

153
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,750
by a few days, but they promised
they'll be here on time.

154
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,958
Mm. All right. Everyone, begin
your preparations as planned.

155
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,500
[various affirmative responses]

156
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,708
[MIYU]
My lady...

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,541
[MIYU] The ones who have
inherited your blood

158
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,916
have grown up to be
healthy and strong.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,625
Now it's time to do what I must.

160
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,625
[indistinct murmurs]

161
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,375
[MIDORI]
How's Rad doing?

162
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,625
[GAL] Not good.
Although I repaired his body

163
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,125
as best I could.

164
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,958
[RAD] Looks like this form
has reached its limit.

165
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,583
Still, we're fortunate that
our battle against Cardair

166
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,291
only cost the lives
of Lumen and myself.

167
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,583
[MIDORI]
But Reito...

168
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,125
[RAD] Midori. We knew
what would happen.

169
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,958
I'm already dead.
Now I can finally...

170
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,333
--[YOHKO] Not yet!
--[RAD] Hmm?

171
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,833
[MIDORI]
Yohko...

172
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:50,083
I won't accept it. I don't want
to lose you a second time.

173
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,625
Reito.

174
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,500
[NINA]
Ersty...

175
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,041
[ERSTIN] Dear Arika and Nina.
By the time the two of you

176
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,666
read this, chances are
I will already be gone.

177
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,208
[NINA]

178
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,083
[ERSTIN] I've always known
that a day would come

179
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,250
when I would have
to fulfill my duty.

180
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,333
And so I forced myself
not to get close to anyone.

181
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:38,208
I purposely kept myself from
making too many friends.

182
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:43,041
But then I met you, Nina...
and later Arika too...

183
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:48,666
and I got to know everyone in
my class. I had a lot of fun.

184
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,791
I was hoping that the black
letter would never come to me,

185
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:56,416
and that I could remain together
with everyone forever. But...

186
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,750
[ERSTIN] I really don't know if
serving the God of Intelligence

187
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:07,041
and taking back the power of
science is a good idea or not.

188
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,541
But I can't bring myself
to go against it.

189
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,375
Ever since I was a child,
I've been brought up

190
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,166
to believe that it's
the right thing to do.

191
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,208
[ERSTIN] I'm sure you can both
make your own decisions.

192
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,625
Because you're both very strong.

193
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,083
[ERSTIN] I really loved both
of you. I was very fortunate

194
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:32,416
to have been with you and
have both of you in my life.

195
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,958
Nina, Arika... there were
many things I couldn't say,

196
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:40,291
but I wanted to
say... I'm sorry.

197
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,958
But I can say thank you.
Thank you so much...

198
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,208
[NINA] "...for being my
most precious friends.

199
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,333
Love, Erstin Ho."

200
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,750
[NINA weeps]

201
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:57,291
Oh, Ers... I'm not strong...
I'm not strong at all.

202
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,875
What you went through...

203
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,875
[NINA weeps]

204
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,333
[SERGEY]
Nina...

205
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,125
Nina, what's wrong?

206
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,208
Why did I do such
terrible things to my friends?!

207
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,666
Ersty... I made you...
and Arika...!

208
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,666
[SERGEY]
Nina!

209
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,375
Get a hold of yourself, Nina!

210
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,541
That's not even all of it...
I killed them. All those people.

211
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,583
[SERGEY]
That's enough!

212
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,291
That's enough, Nina.
I'm here.

213
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,750
[NINA]
Father...

214
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:34,416
[NINA sobs]

215
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,791
[SERGEY]
Have you calmed down?

216
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,291
Yes. I'm sorry. I, uh...

217
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,000
Stop forcing yourself.

218
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,500
I'll go have a word with
His Highness. I'll convince him

219
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,458
not to ask you to use
that damn thing ever again.

220
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,208
[SERGEY] If that doesn't work,
I'll protect you

221
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,291
and think of a way for you to
escape from him. So that way...

222
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,916
[NINA]
That's impossible.

223
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,666
[SERGEY]
Huh? Ah...

224
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,333
[NINA] You understand that more
than anyone, don't you, Father?

225
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,583
It's just that the one
person most important to me

226
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,833
is suffering... And yet I...
I can't do anything about it!

227
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,250
[SERGEY groans]

228
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,333
[NINA]
Then...

229
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:23,250
Then, please... take away
my right to become an Otome.

230
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,083
That's crazy!
How could I do that?

231
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,750
[NINA]
You're right.

232
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,833
It couldn't happen.
Because I'm not...

233
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,125
'Cause I couldn't
become your blue star.

234
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,666
[SERGEY gasps]

235
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,500
Ah, Nina...

236
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,166
You'll be... my father?

237
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,625
Let's play, Father!

238
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,458
Thank you very much, Father.

239
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,166
[NINA]
Sergey...

240
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,083
[NAO]
So, enjoying the scenery?

241
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,625
Nao, maybe you can help me
figure something out.

242
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,000
What do you think? About
the existence of us Otomes.

243
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,166
Huh? Why the sudden
deep thoughts?

244
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,791
We're a necessary evil.

245
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,250
I thought you'd say that. Here.

246
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,958
Huh?

247
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,041
[NAO]
Hm?

248
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,708
[NATSUKI]
The "Break String Spinel."

249
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,416
That's the Meister Gem
I set aside for you.

250
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,833
[NAO] You mean you had this
on you all this time?

251
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,708
I'll admit, there were times
when you really pissed me off.

252
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,291
But on the whole, I'm actually
very thankful to you.

253
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,500
I was only able to get
this far because of you.

254
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,916
[NAO] The proper payback for
those who barge in and take away

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,083
our home is to let them
experience some physical pain.

256
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,625
Even if that person happens
to be Grand Duke Nagi.

257
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,583
Whatever you say.
I won't argue.

258
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,625
[SERGEY]
Lena...

259
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,000
Ever since that day,
I've been chasing after you.

260
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,166
It was like running after a star
that I would never reach.

261
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:47,708
[SERGEY] I was lured in by His
Highness's unstoppable will...

262
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,541
I believed there was
nothing in this world

263
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,166
that His Highness
couldn't get his hands on...

264
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,458
And that's why I...

265
00:16:55,541 --> 00:17:00,458
[gunshots]

266
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,000
But from now on,
that's all over.

267
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,000
[SERGEY]
I have finally realized...

268
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,583
I've finally realized
what's most important to me.

269
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,333
[SMITH] That would be most
troublesome, Major.

270
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,833
And here you were the trusted
friend of His Highness!

271
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:22,083
I never dreamed that you
would attempt such a thing.

272
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,375
[SERGEY] It's because I'm His
Highness' friend that I must

273
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,416
right the wrongs
he plans to commit.

274
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,958
No one wants to plunge this
world into war and chaos.

275
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,416
We have to stop it.

276
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,541
[SMITH] Chaos?
But chaos is perfectly fine!

277
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,208
It's the force of life
that makes people

278
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,416
compete with each other
and move forward.

279
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,208
Without chaos,
we are merely stagnant.

280
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,333
Are you truly happy
living in this world

281
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,041
of artificial limitations?

282
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,500
I'm happier to live in this
world than I would ever be

283
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,583
in a world where
I have to sacrifice

284
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,541
the people most important to me.

285
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,083
[SMITH]
Heh!

286
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,708
[gunshot]

287
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,041
[SMITH]
No... way...

288
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,541
Don't worry, Smith.
I promise I'll make sure

289
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:07,916
to bury you along with
your precious Harmonium.

290
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,916

[SERGEY]
Your... High... ness...

293
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,500
Well, that's really quite
a shame. Sorry, Sergey.

294
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,916
[SERGEY]

295
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,583

[SOLDIER 24A]
Miss Nina! Come quickly!

Something's happened
to Major Wang!

[NINA] This... This can't be...
Father? Father!!

301
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,416
[NAGI] It seems he had
a gunfight with Smith.

302
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,000
[NAGI] It really is
a terrible shame.

303

[NINA]
Father!!

304
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,916
[NAGI] He's suffered
massive brain damage.

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,125
He's still breathing,
but not for much longer.

[NINA] No! Father!
You can't die!

But Nina, there is
still hope for Sergey.

00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,375
[NINA]
Huh?

309
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,666
You can use this Harmonium!

310
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,125
As the ultimate weapon,
this thing is capable of putting

311
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,583
a warp in time and space.
If you wish, it will give you

312
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,791
the power to stop time before
Sergey has stopped breathing.

313
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,250
And then once we open
Garderobe's forbidden library...

314
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,916
and use the power that's
been sealed inside...

315
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,625
it should be possible to
bring Sergey back to life.

316
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,958
So, dear Nina. Tell me.

317
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,541
What is it that
your heart wishes for?

318
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,125
[NINA]
I...

319
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,416
[NATSUKI] People.
The day has finally arrived.

320
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,583
Today is Nagi's deadline
for a final answer.

321
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,125
We must find a way to put
an end to his ambitions

322
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:58,750
and free this city and its
people. We hereby commence

323
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:02,500
"Operation Garderobe
and Wind City Liberation"!

324
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,958
A message from
the resistance headquarters!

325
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:09,416
"Otomes will dance."
I repeat, "Otomes will dance."

326
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,916
Then launch the signal flares!

327
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,708
[SOLDIER 24B]
Hm? Three red signals?

328
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,541
Ah! It's a declaration of war!

329
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,791
[siren]

330
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,291
All units, take level one
combat positions!

331
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,958
Engines, maximum output!

332
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,416
Main tank blow,
up trim thirty degrees!

333
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
[NAVIGATOR 24A]
Aye, up trim thirty degrees.

334
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,750
Here comes the ultimate desert
Dreadnought, the Suzushiro!

335
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,625
Let's go! Begin surfacing!

336
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,375
[soldiers wail]

337
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,250
Ah. They're coming.

338
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,250
[ROSALIE chuckles]

339
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,791
[TOMOE]
Ah.

340
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,916
[HARUKA] Okay now, let's get
this show on the road!

341
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,958
Extend the battle decks!
Unlock the cannon launchers!

342
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,333
And open fire!

343
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,000
[NINA] Sergey...
For your sake, I am willing

344
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:17,125
to make the entire world,
and everyone in it, my enemy.

345
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:21,875
Well, it's started.
Are you ready to do this, Nina?

346
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,333
[NINA]
Master. I am ready.

347
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,333
[MAI]
You're going, aren't you?

348
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,791
Huh? You're going?

349
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,250
[ARIKA]
Yeah.

350
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,583
[MAI sighs]

351
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,958
[MAI] But you guys haven't
finished training yet.

352
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,083
Yes, but out there,
everyone is taking part

353
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,375
in this battle to win back
my nation. So that's why

354
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,958
I have to go. It's my duty
as Queen. Right, Mai?

355
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,375
[MAI] Of course.
You're quite right.

356
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,166
[MIYU]
Arika. You must realize

357
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,333
the full scale of
what you will face.

358
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,083
Many different Otomes,
the "Ultimate Black Diamond,"

359
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,000
and the Harmonium will all
be standing in your way.

360
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,666
Knowing all this,
do you still wish to go?

361
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,875
That's the reason I'm going.
Mashiro and I have to create

362
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,750
a nation where everybody
can live happily.

363
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,416
Right now, that's the
dream I'm fighting for!

364
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,041
[MASHIRO]
Hm.

365
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,625
Don't worry about it! You both
have been working really hard!

366
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,375
I know you can do it!

367
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,833
[ARIKA]
Hm!

368
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,375
[MASHIRO]
Hm.

369
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,416
[ARIKA]
So wait for me... Nina.

370
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,625
[MAI]
You're going, aren't you?

371
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,750
[MASHIRO] Yeah. Everyone's
fighting to win back my nation.

372
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,833
[MIKOTO] Then let me teach
you my ultimate attack!

373
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,083
[ARIKA]
Yes, Master!

374
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,708
[MIKOTO] The cat in the
sky turns three times!

375
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,458
[ARIKA] Awesome!
I'll definitely win with that!

376
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,583
[MAI]
Are you sure you wanna go?

377
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,250
[MASHIRO]
Yeah, maybe not...
