This is the Schwartz's doing.

retreat to Garderobe.

This is an emergency.

I don't know.

31

We were attacked, and then
there was a loud bang.

32
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,833
It was a close call.

I barely got you

Finally, the technology
of Garderobe belongs to us.

We cannot let Schwartz
have their way with it.

Its target was the
port by the desert?

That's right. I want you
to go and check it out.

It's up to you.

need to take care of.

[SERGEY]
Look, you're my daughter.

48
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,000
But the reason I adopted
you and brought you up

49
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,541
was for the sake of His
Highness, Grand Duke Nagi.

And for the future of Artai,
so please, Nina- <i>chan</i> ...

[NATSUKI]
amn the Schwartz!

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,583
How in the world were they
able to do that to the castle?

54
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,000
It would appear they've managed

55
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,625
to infiltrate much deeper
than we thought possible.

What about Arika?
Has she shown up yet?

Not yet. I'm worried about her.

She could be with the Queen.

Then there still might be hope.

In accordance with Clause C of
the Otome Concealment Treaty,

this Academy will now
take a defensive posture.

carry out their duties

[SMITH] It seems things are
going according to plan.

We should be able to
stall for a bit longer.

It was a long time ago
that our ancestors

created the power of the Otome.

throughout the world.

164
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,541
It's that guy from Schwartz.

165
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,041
You're here? As I recall,
aren't you supposed to be...?

166
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,208
[ARIKA]
Hey you!

167
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,375
I don't know what
you're planning,

168
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,208
but stop getting in our way!

169
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,250
[SERGEY]
Ah!

170
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,708
[SERGEY]
Huh?

171
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,208
Don't worry, we won't
get in your way.

172
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,250
Just hand over
Queen Mashiro to me,

173
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,125
and the rest of you can
go without any trouble.

174
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,500
Use the Blue Sky Sapphire.

175
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,541
As long as you're a Meister
with your own Master,

176
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,166
it should still work and
let you use your Robe.

177
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,625
Mashiro!

178
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,541
Touch it!

179
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,833
Wh-What?!

180
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,125
I knew it!

181
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,666
Major Wang, do you know
what you just did?!

182
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,625
I command you,
release thy power.

183
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,125
Okay then! Time to get
rid of this weirdo!

184
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,125
Yeah, with pleasure!

185
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,083
Materialize!

186
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,833
The tables have turned now,
you Schwartz creep!

187
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,041
Get outta here
before you get hurt!

188
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,583
Huh... Is that the Blue
Sky Sapphire? What's this?

189
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,666
It looks like you haven't called
forth its full power yet.

190
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,708
All the same, this is
still rather troublesome.

191
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,166
Ah, well...

192
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,541
I really hate to do this,

193
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,208
but it seems I need to call
on someone for back-up.

194
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,833
It's time, Miss Erstin!

195
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,875
[ARIKA]
Uh?

196
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,458
[SMITH] Now is the hour to prove
your loyalty to the Schwartz!

197
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,833
Show your faith in the god
of knowledge and wisdom!

198
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,750
Arika... I...

199
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,291
I'm sorry...

200
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,375
No way... This can't...

201
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,041
This can't be...

202
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,541
It's not true! It's
a joke! Right, Ersty?!

203
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,708
It's no joke.

204
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,541
She is the daughter
of the Ho family,

205
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,458
one of the strongest
supporters of our cause.

206
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,666
She has been trained for
our service since her birth.

207
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,500
Under the contract of darkness,
I fulfill my oath to you.

208
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,333
God of the ancient light,
knowledge, and wisdom,

209
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,583
grant me a loyal servant.

210
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,875
[SCHWARTZ MEMBER E]
Surrender!

211
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,083
Otomes without their Robes
are no match for our power!

212

Slaves maki-maki, Schwartz
maki-maki, Slaves maki-maki--

Your tongue's all twisted.

217
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,416
You must remain calm, everyone.

218
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,666
It's during these times
that we must believe

219
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,416
in Our Lady all the more.

220
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,708
[MARIA] Two hundred years
of Garderobe history,

221
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,500
and to think it comes to this...

222
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,250
I'm gonna lure them
away from here.

223
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,416
When I do, you run.

224
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,958
I can't do something like that!

225
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,541
I'm staying here till the end.

226
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,541
Don't say such
childish things, Natsuki!

227
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,791
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

228
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,291
As long as you survive,
Garderobe will survive,

229
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,416
even if the school itself were
to be completely taken over.

230
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,833
You have to run, all right?

231
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,000
I understand.

232
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,916
Now that sounds like
the Natsuki I know.

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,208
Don't die!

234
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,333
Ersty, stop!

235
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,458
I'm begging you. Please
hand over Queen Mashiro.

236
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,750
That way, I won't have to--

237
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,625
I can't do that!

238
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,166
I don't understand why
you're doing this, Ersty.

239
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,500
[ERSTIN]
It was decided a long time ago.

240

By my father, my mother, my
grandparents, even further back!

00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,708
That's why...

242
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,125
You said it yourself,
didn't you, Arika?

243
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,625
That if everybody
had this technology,

244
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,125
then all of us
would all be happy!

There wouldn't be...

Ersty, what's wrong?

251
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,500
The bond between
a Slave and Lord

252
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,583
is the same as between
an Otome and Master.

253
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,333
If the Slave is hurt, then
the Lord will be hurt as well.

Hey there, Mashiro!

All you have to do is come
along without making a fuss,

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,833
and then no one
will have to fight.

Uh! Nagi!

Hello there, Sergey. I didn't
expect you to be out here too.

265

I guess you really
are a hard worker.

behind all of this?

[chuckles] Yep! Good job.
You figured it out!

268
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,125
See, I have a major problem

269
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,250
with the way that Garderobe
handles things.

270
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,708
Don't you think it's strange?

271
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,583
They claim to maintain peace,

272
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,708
but only by pointing
double-edged swords

273

called Otomes at each other.

274

Oh, by the way, you don't have
to worry about your city.

Right now, my army
is in the process

00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,958
of "liberating" it
from the Slaves.

277

That's a dirty tactic!

278
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,833
It's called politics.

279
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:41,375
Now, dear Mashiro, it's time
for you to make a decision.

280
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,625
Will you sit and watch

while these friends of
yours kill each other,

and become my possession?

No... Father...

323
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,541
No...

324
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,583
No!

325
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,541
Well, isn't that interesting?

326
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,541
The Ultimate Black Diamond
reacted to your emotions.

327
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,208
The ones deep in your heart.

328
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,875
What's that legendary
Gemstone doing here?

329
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,000
Okay, Nina,
I'll make you a deal.

330
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,375
If you can stop those girls,

331
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,916
I will forgive Sergey's
little betrayal.

332
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,791
In that case, Nina Wang,

333
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,291
Otome of the Ultimate
Black Diamond,

334
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,416
do you swear to accept
me as your master?

335
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,541
Then hear me, Nina.

336
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,958
In my name, I hereby
release your powers.

337
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,583
You mustn't! Nina!

338
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,333
Materialize!

339
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,541
You haven't been very
fair to me, Father.

340
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,416
You told me that the
one reason I was here

341
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,166
was to become Grand
Duke Nagi's Otome.

342
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,625
That's why I tried so hard.

343
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,166
[NINA]
Tell me, why?

344
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,125
Why? Why are you here, Arika?!

345
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,291
If only you weren't around!

346
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,875
Stop, Nina!

347
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,291
Why? Why do things
have to be this way?

348
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,041
You and I are
friends, aren't we?

349
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,041
Shut up! I don't
care about you!

350
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,500
No!

Ersty!

Ersty, hang in there!
Talk to me, Ersty!

00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,000
Why did you...?

357
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:44,791
Arika... I... I'm so sorry...

358
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,708
I'm sorry, Nina...

359
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,833
To tell the truth...

360
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,833
...it's not...
about the technology.

361
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,083
If only... If only
there was no war...

362
00:20:56,166 --> 00:21:00,166
...I could be together with
everyone... forever...

I'm happy... to have
been... your friend...

00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,291
That's why... I...

367
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,916
Ersty, no...

368
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,416
Arika...

I finally got to use my Robe,

378
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,166
but what's with these
new developments?

379
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,833
[SHIZURU] There's not
much we can do about that.

380
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,166
[NATSUKI] What's wrong with me
having some heroic moments?

381
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,125
[SHIZURU] That's true,
but you are really cute

382
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,375
when you're all helpless
like this, Natsuki.

383
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,750
[NATSUKI]
You're so mean to me!

[SHIZURU]
That's a good girl.
