1
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,458
My... birthday?

2
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,583
Yeah.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,833
I realized the other day

4
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,041
that I'd forgotten to
ask you about it.

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,583
I certainly hope it
hasn't passed yet.

6
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,791
So when is it, Nina? Is it soon?

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:30,916
[NINA]
Uh... Mh-hm..

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,541
[SERGEY]
Huh?

9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,083
Mm. I see. I'm sorry.

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,333
Hmm...

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,791
Well... how 'bout we
make it September 7th?

12
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,791
I'm off work that day, so we
can have a big birthday party!

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,041
[gasps]

14
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,791
So think about what you
want for your present!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you all right, Sergey?

16
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,166
[NINA]
Father...

17
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,333
Sergey...

18
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,625
[NAGI]
I'm sure one thing is clear.

19
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,166
You'd better not think
of betraying me.

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,333
Yes.

21
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,125
Anyway, you still have
a job to focus on.

22
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,833
It's up to you to find
the real Princess.

23
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,375
[SERGEY]
Right.

24
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:34,333
Because whoever controls her
can control the entire world.

25
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,916
[knocking]

26
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,875
Another tax hike?

27
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,541
Yes.

28
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,041
The Queen's forcing it through.

29
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,875
She wants it to
bypass the committee.

30
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,083
The costs of the coronation
and castle repairs

31
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,333
have really depleted
the national treasury.

32
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,416
On top of that, the Queen's
birthday is approaching,

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,666
and the entire kingdom
will be celebrating that.

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,791
This increase is probably
to cover those costs.

35
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,208
[SERGEY] The unemployment
rates are skyrocketing,

36
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,875
but they're all so carefree.

37
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:09,875
Let's see... what day is
Queen Mashiro's birthday again?

38
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,375
Huh?

39
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,416
Well then, I'd better make
sure I don't forget.

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,750
The real Princess...

41
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,583
[IRINA]
Really? That's a great!


42
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,625
[LILIE] Yeah, Arika,
you're ranked 29th now?


43
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,208
That's a huge improvement!


44
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,625
But I couldn't have done so well
without Ersty and Irina's help!

45
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,375
Don't talk with your
mouth full, Arika!

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,166
Thank you so much!

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,625
Man, I can't believe it.

48
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,250
It's a wonder that you
rose to 29th place.

49
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:15,125
Well, she did challenge the
survival test by herself.

50
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,041
And she broke the record
for the fastest time.

51
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,125
[LILIE chuckles]

52
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,416
[IRINA]
Huh?

53
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,166
[YAYOI]
C'mon, cheer up, Erstin!

54
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,166
Even though you couldn't
retake that test,

55
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,833
you still came in 30th!

56
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,166
I think that's pretty good!

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,583
Let's do our best next time!

58
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,583
I'll do anything I can
to help you out, Ersty!

59
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,291
And all of us will reach
for our dreams together!

60
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,375
[ALL chuckle nervously]

61
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,833
Aw, thank you, Arika.

62
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,625
And Nina and Tomoe both held on

63
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,875
to their first and
second places.

64
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,375
Well, it's not like
I did anything special.

65
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,541
Ahh...

66
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,625
Just once I wanna say that too.

67
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:00,291
Stand at the top, and say,
"I didn't do anything special."

68
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,875
[ARIKA, ERSTIN, YAYOI,
LILIE laughing]

69
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,208
[YAYOI]
It's not like you.

70
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,666
[IRINA]
No?

71
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,625
[NATSUKI] So, we're the ones
who hide technology away

72
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,541
and cause disorder in the world.

73
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,250
Huh.

74
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,541
Those are rather
painful words to hear.

75
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,041
That power of theirs...

76
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,416
Tey've analyzed
body-implant nanomachines

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,666
and learned how to control them.

78
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,291
[SHIZURU]
They don't appear to have

79
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,250
the power or technology
to materialize a Robe yet.

80
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,375
But that's only
a matter of time.

81
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,791
If they keep blindly
grasping at power like that,

82
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,416
it will only lead
to destruction!

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,625
Why won't they understand that?

84
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,458
[SHIZURU] I'm also worried
about what's contained

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,583
in that data pod.

86
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,458
I wonder who the Aswad
are working for.

87
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,916
It could be Cardair,
or maybe Florince?

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,458
Ever since that organ
note was heard,

89
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:54,000
it seems that everyone has
been acting suspiciously.

90
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,291
Peace is very weak...
and fragile.

91
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,541
It can be easily broken,

92
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,416
even though it was
bought with the sacrifices

93
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,666
of so many Otomes.

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,583
Don't forget,
no matter what happens,

95
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,708
I'll always be by
your side, Natsuki.

96
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,833
Oh, Nina.

97
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,833
Uh... Tomorrow is
your birthday, right?

98
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,791
Would you mind if I gave
you a present, then?

99
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,166
[YAYOI]
What? Are you serious?

100
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,750
Tomorrow's Nina's birthday?

101
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,833
That's cool.

102
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,000
Did you know that you have

103
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,291
the exact same birthday
as Queen Mashiro?

104
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,250
What?! Mashiro's birthday
is tomorrow too?!

105
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,083
Yeah! That means we're
gonna have a big party!

106
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,416
No. There's no need for that.

107
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,750
Aww!

108
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,041
All you hafta do is smile
and say "great idea!"

109
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,791
Really, Nina, you're not being
honest with your feelings.

110
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,958
[NINA screams]

111
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,000

[BOTH gasp]

115
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,458
Just because you've
completed your exams

116
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,583
doesn't mean you can
stand around wasting time.

117
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,958
Nina Wang, Arika Yumemiya,
please come with me.

118
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,208
I have something to discuss
with the both of you.

119
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,541

Huh?

120
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,208
[ARIKA groans]

121
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,208
[ARIKA] They called us in to
give us extra work to do!

122
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,333
Extra work?

123
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,666
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm.

124
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,583
Something about some
Prince from another country

125
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,666
coming to visit the
academy tomorrow.

126
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,208
[NINA]
He's from Zipang.

127
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,583
It's the country on the far
eastern coast of the continent.

128
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,166
So we have to serve as
attendants to Mashiro

129
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,625
when she welcomes him.

130

[ERSTIN gasps]

131
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,833
But that's wonderful!

00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,583
What's that, by the way?

133
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,250
Oh! It's something from
the man sponsoring me.

134
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,458
I don't know what it is though!

135
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,750
What about yours, Nina?

136

a necklace, is it?

[growling]

325
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,458
Mikoto!

326
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,208
[BOY]
Uh... are you all right?

327
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,625
[BOY]
Uhh...

328
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,333
Um, you mean you have
feelings for Sergey?

329
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,291
[ARIKA gasps]

330
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,708
I mean... Major Wang, of course.

331
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,375
Do you... like him?

332
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,750
[NINA gasps]

333
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,208
And what about you?

334
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,250
[ARIKA]
Huh?

335
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,666
What happened then?

336
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,041
In the survival test,
when you two were alone?

337
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,083
[gasps]

338
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,500
Nothing happened! Nothing!

339
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:34,250
It's true that he saved me,
but that's it! Nothing more!

340
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,458
[grumbles]

341
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,416
[ARIKA gasps]

342
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,291
[ARIKA]
Huh?

343
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,708
Then this is all the more reason

344
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,791
why we have to find
that pocket watch!

345
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,166
Huh?

346
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,916
Grandma told me that
if you get something

347
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,250
from a person important to you,

348
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,916
then that thing
is important too!

349
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,333
Arika...

350
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,083
[SERGEY]
Well, hello there, girls.

351
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,541
What're you two doing out here?

352
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,791
Are you lost?

353
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,666
Last I heard, you girls
are supposed to go

354
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,333
and pick up the
Prince of Zipang.

355
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,291
[NINA]
Father.

356
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,666
Sergey.

357
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,958
[NINA]
Listen up. Act normally.

358
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,125
If you tell him what I said,
you're dead meat.

359
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,958
Oh, we're on our way right now.

360
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,625
We still had some time,
so we took a detour.

361
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,375
And came all the way out here?

362
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,166
Never mind.
I'm glad I found you.

363
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,875
[ARIKA gasps]

364
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,541
We've been looking
all over for that!

365
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,541
[NINA growls]

366
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,041
[ARIKA whimpers]

367
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,791
Just as I thought, you've
been out here looking for it.

368
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,875
Honestly, ditching
academy work for this?

369
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,333
I'm very sorry, Father, but I...

370
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,291
It's okay.

371
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,625
I'm glad to see you like
the chain for your watch.

372
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,125
[sighs]

373
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,833
Well then, one more time.

374
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,375
Have a happy birthday, Nina.

375
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,875
My goodness, you
certainly have grown!

376
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,833
It's hard to believe
that it's been exactly

377
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,416
six years since we met.

378
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,583
Exactly?

379
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,166
[SERGEY]
Hm?

380
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,166
Wait a minute, are you telling
me you don't already know that?

381
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,416
Well, come to think of it,
I guess that's natural

382
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,666
because you were in the hospital
for a while after we met.

383
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,083
[NINA]
Huh?

384
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,625
That's how I chose your
birthday. It's September 7th.

385
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,750
Because that's the day
you and I first met.

386
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,875
Thank you, Father.

387
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,541
What's gotten into you?

388
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,541
Nina- <i>chan</i> .

389
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,291
[ARIKA]
I'm happy for you, Nina.

390
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,208
[thumping]

391
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,416
[ARIKA]
Huh?

392
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,000
So... what're we gonna do?

393
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,333
I don't know why
you're asking me.

394
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,791
I have no idea
what we should do.

395
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
His Grace has arrived!

396
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,291
The Prince of Zipang!

397
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:25,083
Thank you everyone! I am honored
by this warm reception!

398
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,708
[ARIKA] Wow... so big
and white and soft.

399
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,125
[ERSTIN] Stop staring at it.
I'm embarrassed.

400
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,666
[ARIKA]
Hey, do you mind if I lick it?

401
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,916
[IRINA]
Wh-Wh-What are you two doing?!

402
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,083
[ERSTIN]
I'm making a cake.

403
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,416
[ARIKA]
It's my birthday present!

404
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,291
