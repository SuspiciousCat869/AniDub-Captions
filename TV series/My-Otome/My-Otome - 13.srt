Huh?

00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,750
What's wrong?

5
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,666
Aren't you gonna say something
like, "Wow, it's so jiggly!

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,250
It's just like Erstin's boobs!"
or something weird like that?

7
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,208
No. I don't feel
that hungry anymore.

Well, this is a major event.

10
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,166
Arika has lost her appetite?

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,333
What's next?
Snow in the forecast?

00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,666
[ARIKA groans]

00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,750
Wait, that's...

14
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:56,625
What is it?

00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:57,791
[IRINA gasps]

16
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,375
[NINA] That's Big Sister
Akane and Kazuya,

17
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,125
the son of the Krau-xeku
family of Cardair.

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,458
Are you sure it's them?

19
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, maybe it's someone else.

20
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,916
Here, look through these.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,958
[IRINA]
Uhh...

22
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,083
Well, whatever.

23
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,833
Big Sister Akane is
Pearl Number One.

24
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,708
She's not gonna
make any mistakes.

25
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,625
[ARIKA]
What do you mean, "mistakes"?

26
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,333
Don't make me explain.

27
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,166
[ARIKA]
Hmph.

28
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,500
Meanie.

[ARIKA screams]

33
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,750
--I'm sorry!
--Stop right there!

34
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,708
Those two really have
become good friends lately.

35
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,666
Uh, yeah...

36
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,208
Kazu...

37
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,291
Akane, it's no use. I can't
hold back anymore. I...

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,250
Kazu, what're--?

39
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,333
[AKANE]
Stop, stop.

40
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,041
[AKANE]
No, you mustn't.

41
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,250
No!

42
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,291
[gasps]

43
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,958
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

44
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,875
To do this to someone
aspiring to be a Meister...

45
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,833
I should be the one apologizing.

46
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,291
I'm sorry... Really, I am.

47
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,583
But, Akane.

48
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,875
[AKANE]
Sorry. Sorry. I'm really sorry.

49
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,291
[MARIA]
Akane Soir.

[AKANE gasps]

51
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,333
Were you listening to me?

52
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,916
You have an important guest.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,416
Please go to the Headmistress'
office immediately.

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,833
Uh... Yes, right away.

55
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,458
Uh! You want me to
become a Meister?

56
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,333
I'm sure you must be surprised
at the sudden request.

57
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,625
King Charles' Meister,
Rosalie Claudel,

58
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,916
is getting married and
will therefore be retiring

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,333
from her Otome position
in a short time.

60
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,833
Big Sister Rosalie
is getting married?

61
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,958
You have been selected

62
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,750
to inherit the "Pure
Heart Malachite,"

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,250
the Gem which
traditionally serves

64
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,833
the Royal Family of Florince.

65
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,416
But I'm still a student,
so how can I--?

66
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,833
This decision is
not unprecedented.

67
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,291
We're making the
exception for you

68
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,875
because of your
special abilities.

69
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,333
[OFFICIAL A] We have already
contacted the Soir family,

70
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,541
and your parents were
especially pleased.

71
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:51,916
Congratulations, Mademoiselle.
Or rather, Meister Akane Soir.

72
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,833
[YAYOI]
Awesome!

73
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,333
Isn't it great news?

74
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,708
To be chosen as a Meister
while still a student?

75
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,875
That's the first time I've
ever seen it happen!

76
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,208
I hear the Palace of
Florince is magnificent!

77
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,625
Oh, how wonderful!

78
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,916
Irina, Erstin,

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,833
you're on Big Sister
Akane's room duty, right?

80
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,041
Have you heard anything else?

81
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,333
Uh, no.

82
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,750
We haven't seen her
since hearing about this.

83
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,166
Is it about Kazuya?

84
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,333
Well, yeah.

85
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,000
Cardair and Florince
have never had

86
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,041
a good relationship
with each other.

87
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,375
What do you mean?

88
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,750
It's not something you
need to know about, Arika.

89
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,500
[ARIKA]
Oh... All right.

90
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,875
[NINA]
Huh?

91
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,250
[CHIE]
Congratulations!

92
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,291
You've reached your dream
before everyone else.

93
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,833
Let me give you my blessings.

94
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,666
Thank you very much, Chie.

95
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,208
But truthfully, it all seems
too surreal right now.

96
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,500
What's up with you?

97
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,750
If you wanna brag,
now's the time, so go ahead!

98
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,208
Well, Akane, it'll be tough
not having you around,

99
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,958
especially when there're
problems like we had

100
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,291
during the survival test.

101
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,416
We'll be fine!

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,750
After you're gone,

103
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,625
I'll be able to guide our
underclassmen properly.

104
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,041
[sighs]

105
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,458
What's wrong with me?

106
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,416
Why do I have this heavy
feeling in my chest?

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Huh?

108
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,000
This is...

109
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,666
Hey, Arika, are you
feeling any better?

110
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,500
[gasps]

111
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,333
Hey, that's mine!

112
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,041
Did you look?

113
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,291
[NINA]
Hey!

114
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,458
[ARIKA]
How did I get here?

115
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,416
Oh, looks like you're awake.

116
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't get it. Why am I here?

117
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,291
You fainted suddenly, remember?

118
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,000
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm.

119
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,291
I was quite surprised.

120
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,208
Out of nowhere,
Nina burst in carrying you.

121
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,041
Nina carried me?

122
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,000
[YOHKO] She said you
were acting strangely.

123
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,625
She thought maybe the
nanomachines went haywire.

124
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,291
What's wrong?
Is something bothering you?

125
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,041
Uh, Professor Yohko?

126
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,291
[YOHKO]
Hm?

127
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,666
And that's how it is.
Am I really sick, Professor?

128
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,666
Well, your nanomachines
are fine, but you are sick.

129
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,000
[ARIKA yelps]

130
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,208
According to an old saying,

131
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,583
it's a sickness not
even god can cure.

132
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,500
Am... Am I gonna die
from this sickness?

133
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,041
In some cases,

134
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,333
you may go through pain and
suffering even worse than dying.

135
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,833
Grandma, I'm... I'm gonna...

136
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:46,041
Hey, do you know the story
of the Fire Stirring Ruby?

137
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,250
Let's see...

138
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,666
Ah! Here it is!

139
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,083
Which one?

140
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,708
[IRINA] <i>Biographies of</i>
<i>Otomes</i> , chapter 109:

141
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,500
"The Legend of the
Fire Stirring Ruby,

142
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,583
hersorrowful soul wandering
around the Sprites' Forest."

143
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,833
Wow...

144
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,250
Is this story really old
enough to be a legend?

145
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,375
No, this is a story from
just a few years ago.

146
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:11,708
They say during that time there
was a very exceptional Otome.

147
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,500
Everyone had great hopes for
her future, and it was decided

148
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,541
that she would inherit
the Fire Stirring Ruby

149
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,750
when she graduated the academy.

150
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:23,625
But unfortunately, she had
also fallen in love with a man.

151
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,250
She had already decided
which Master she would serve

152
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,750
even when she first enrolled,

153
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,166
so she found herself torn
between choosing love

154
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,041
and choosing her dreams.

155
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,333
Then, on top of all that,

156
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,083
our great predecessor
singled her out

157
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,666
to become one of
the Five Pillars.

158
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,083
Huh? The Five Pillars?

159
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,666
Wait a minute,

160
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,500
you mean like the Headmistress
and Big Sister Shizuru, right?

161
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,833
[NINA]
That's right.

162
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,875
They are Otomes who
serve our predecessor

163
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,333
instead of an ordinary master,

164
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,333
and protect the
existence of Otome.

165
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,250
It's a highly
respected position.

166
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,000
But it only made
the decision harder

167
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,208
for the Fire Stirring Ruby.

168
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,041
She had to think long and hard

169
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,125
about which path
she would choose.

170
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,166
So she went into
the Sprites' Forest,

171
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,333
where the future-telling
god resides.

172
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:08,125
But in the end, she never
emerged from that forest.

173
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,500
People sometimes
say that her soul

174
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:16,166
is still wandering inside
that dark forest.

175
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,333
[TOMOE]
She was very foolish.

176
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,458
All because she loved a man.

177
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,541
What do you mean?

178
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,833
Falling in love with a man

179
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,125
goes against the principles
of being an Otome.

180
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,333
That's why Garderobe
places so much emphasis

181
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,125
on bonding with our Big Sisters.

182
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:33,000
After all, we can always develop
a feeling of love from that.

183
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,416
We've received intelligence

184
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,458
on that man from
Schwartz, John Smith.

185
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,875
He was last seen in the
vicinity of Artai's borders.

186
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,083
Shizuru, can you go
and investigate?

187
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,750
Of course, Natsuki.
If that's what you wish.

188
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,166
Thank you.

189
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,666
Although truthfully, I'd prefer
to have you remain here,

190
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,166
more than ever.

191
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,500
[ARIKA]
The Fire Stirring Ruby...

192
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,333
Why did Professor Yohko want
me to know about that story?

193
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,666
[NAO]
So, what're you gonna do?

194
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,625
[AKANE]
There's nothing I can do.

195
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,166
I knew this would
happen someday.

196
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,500
If you leave the school,

197
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,833
then I'll be raised to the
number three position.

198
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,916
That'll turn my life
into a big hassle.

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,583
I'm really sorry, Nao.

200
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,666
I've always been pushed by
everyone to become a Meister,

201
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,333
so I did my best to
achieve it, and now--

202
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,208
Man, stop trying
to be so perfect.

203
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,208
Why don't you do
what you wanna do?

204
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,958
Go ahead and give everything up.

205
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,541
That's impossible.
Both for Kazu and myself.

206
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,333
Ah, forget it. I guess
that's not your style.

207
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:35,416
Me, a Trias? Ugh... What a pain.

208
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,375
[ARIKA]
Don't!

209
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,916
Arika?!

210
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,750
[AKANE]
Arika, can I ask you a question?

211
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,208
Have you ever fallen in love?

212
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,500
[ARIKA]
Hm? No, I haven't.

213
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,416
Love is such a
mysterious thing.

214
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,250
Before I ever met him,

215
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,458
I had no idea that he even
existed out there in the world.

216
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,666
But now even just a
single word from him

217
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,041
can bring me such joy
or such sorrow.

218
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,916
Somehow, just thinking about him

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,541
can make my heart feel so tight
that it becomes painful.

220
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,958
Why...?

221
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:25,375
Why... do we fall in love?

222
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,083
[NAGI] So, the song, the player,
and the protector...

223
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,708
[SMITH] Those seem to
be the requirements

224
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,625
for activating the Harmonium.

225
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,583
This looks interesting.

226
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,750
Seems like having you
find the real Princess

227
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,958
was worth the price
I had to pay.

228
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,916
By the way,
there's one more thing.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,208
Thanks to the data we've
gathered about this,

230
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,125
and the lost technology
of materialization,

231
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,625
we can now create something

232
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,333
that's very close to
the original structure.

233
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,791
Stop flattering yourself.
So, is it usable?

234
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,958
[SMITH] Of course it is,
Grand Duke Nagi.

235
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,666
You will learn of its
abilities very soon.

236
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,291
Thank you!

237
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,000
[KAZUYA]

[AKANE] I'm sorry I asked you to
come out here all of a sudden.

Big Sister Shizuru... Um...

244
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,833
I heard you'd be leaving
the school for a while

245
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,958
because of work.

246
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,708
So I... So I--!

247
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,458
Time sure flies by.

248

I guess you'll be becomin'
a Pearl pretty soon,

[TOMOE]
Big Sister... I...

251
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,500
You remind me of the
way I was a long time ago.

252
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,958
That's why...

253
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,208
That's why I'm tellin' you
not to get distracted.

254
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:06,625
Keep your focus on what's
ahead of you, all right?

I'm just heading off
to work right now!

00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,041
Then allow me to accompany
you for part of the way.

thought you loved me too!

But I can't...

I just can't give up my
country or my dreams!

Isn't it the same
with you, Kazu?

you'll be able to
serve your country?

Isn't that why you
study so hard?
