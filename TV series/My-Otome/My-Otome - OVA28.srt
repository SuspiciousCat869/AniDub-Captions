1
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,625
[YUKINO] So, what are the
demands of the terrorists

2
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,708
who hijacked the bus?

3
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,125
[ADJUTANT A] They want
the peacekeeping force

4
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,375
stationed in Artai to be
withdrawn immediately, ma'am.

5
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,000
They are also
demanding the release

6
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,500
of the former Grand
Duke, Nagi Dai Artai,

7
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,458
who's currently being held at
Desperate Prison pending trial.

8
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,250
Lieutenant General
Boman, your report?

9
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,541
[BOMAN]
Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,375
The bus that's been
hijacked was on the way

11
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,000
from the eastern border
to the capital city.

12
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,416
There are ten hostages,
including the crew of the bus.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,958
The terrorists have set
up a large bomb inside,

14
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,708
and are threatening to detonate
it and kill the hostages

15
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,208
unless we comply
with their demands.

16
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,666
Madam President, remember,

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,458
the next election
is drawing near.

18
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,291
If this situation
is handled poorly,

19
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,500
it could have a drastic
effect on the outcome.

20
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,875
[YUKINO]
Who's handling this?

21
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,458
As of 12 minutes ago,

22
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,625
our national security force has
taken command of the situation.

23
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,250
The Delta Otome Squad
has already been deployed

24
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,958
to the scene.

25
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,458
With your authorization,
they can move in immediately.

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,958
As there are hostages involved,
we can't make any hasty moves.

27
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,666
Please act with caution.

28
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,166
Leave it to us, Madam.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,375
The operation name
is "Silent Sea."

30
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,958
A silent sea, huh?
That's a very appropriate name.

31
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,916
[BOMAN]
Thank you, Madam President.

32
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,416
You do know the operation has
to be handled quietly, right?

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,708
Everything should be fine.

34
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,541
I've taken all the usual
precautions-- Huh?

35
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,958
I'm very sorry!

36
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,083
She got away!

37
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:03,208
I thought I told you! Rocks of
that size don't work anymore!

R-One, standing by.

39
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,625

[JESSICA]
R-Three, standing by.

41

[DOROTHY]
Target in sight. Ready to fire.

42
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,916
Stay in position, Dorothy.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,125
We must avoid any
unnecessary disruption.

44
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,875
Gotta be quiet...
Quiet and calm...

45
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,000
Silent...

46
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,083
[BOTH]
Shhh...

47
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,875
Ah!

48
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,083
Shh!

49
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,708
Roger that, Lieutenant
General Boman.

50
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,958
Before the Brigadier gets here,

51
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,000
you want us to stay silent
and secretly-- Ah!

52
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,250
[HARUKA]
All right, you cowards!

53
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,416
Let the hostages go
and come out here

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,541
so I can deal with
you face to face.

55
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,208
You hear me?

56
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,708
It's the Brigadier!

57
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,500
Brigadier Armitage
is really here!

58
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,750
Go, Brigadier!

59
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,416
Beat up those terrorists
and send 'em packing!

60
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,458
That's right!

61
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,916
[PEOPLE cheering]

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
[GIRLS] Major Hallard! We wanna
see you do something too!

63
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,875
[CHIE]
Well that's not gonna happen!

64
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,458
Okay, calm down. Just calm down.

65
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,416
It looks like we were too late.

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,375
[ADJUTANTS]
We're sorry...

67
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,541
Oh, Irina Woods,
isn't it? Hello.

68
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,125
Yes, I can hear you
loud and clear.

69
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,833
This thing has become really
convenient to have around.

70
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:33,125
Huh? Wait, you're telling me
Arika Yumemiya came here?

71
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,625
In what kind of vehicle?

72
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,583
[HARUKA] Well, cowards?! You've
been thinking long enough!

73
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,875
How about an answer?!

74
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,500
Who is that woman?
She sounds like she's crazy!

75
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,708
That would be Brigadier
Haruka Armitage.

76
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,750
She's the Otome of
President Chyrsant!

77
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,250
[MAJOR A]
So she's the Destroyer Armitage.

78
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,500
[LIEUTENANT A]
If we don't watch our step,

79
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,041
this whole thing could
blow up in our faces.

80

Mashiro, that's my snack.
Go get your own, 'kay?

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,166
We're sorry to interrupt

00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,791
presidential candidate
Ishigermin's interview,

83
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,708
but there are new developments
in the bus-jacking.

84
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,833
We now go live to our
cameras on the scene.

85
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,791
That's it, huh?

86
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,958
If you're not coming out,

87
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,958
then I'll have to come
get you bastards!

88
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:07,875
Stay back!

89
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,083
If you come near us,

90
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,416
I'll blow up the bus
and all the passengers!

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,166
Huh! I dare you to try it!

92
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,458
You're up against people with
the soul of Aries in them!

93
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,583
They're not going to die just
because of some puny-- Ah!

94
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,125
Is this for real?

95
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,833
[SARA]
Please excuse us!

96
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,041
Pardon me for dropping in.

97
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,500
I've just come from Garderobe.
Who's in command here?

98
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,000
I-- Ah!

99
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,708
My, you certainly
have come a long way

100
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,333
to become Delta's
leader, Chie Hallard.

101
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,000
I've come here to tell you
something off the record.

102
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,791
[CHIE] The Cat God Mountain
has disappeared

103
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,208
and it took Queen Mashiro
and Meister Mai with it?

104
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,041
Told her something
was gonna happen.

105
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,375
What's that? You mean
you know Meister Mai?

106
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,625
Of course I do!

107
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,458
She's the one who owns
that ramen shop, right?

108
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,333
She wanted to start up
a chain of restaurants,

109
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,791
so I told her she should open
her main branch here in Aries.

110
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,458
But she didn't listen,
and now...

111
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,708
[SARA sighs]

112
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,125
After that, Meister Arika
also went missing,

113
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,916
but she left a note saying
she was going to look

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
for Queen Mashiro by herself.

115
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,875
Any clue as to where
she could've gone?

116
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,375
[SARA] Yes. We were able
to locate the bus she took.

117
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,416
A bus...?

118
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,000
[SARA]
Yes, a bus.

119
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,625
Don't tell me...

120
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,333
Yep. I'm afraid so.

121
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,666
[HARUKA]
Hm?

122
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,125
[CHIE] Ugh. How the heck
are we gonna resolve this?

123
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,625
[SARA] Hey, don't worry.
I'm here to help.

124
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,958
We've found out the
identities of the culprits.

125
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,500
It appears their leader
is a former Artai soldier

126
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,083
from the ground forces.

127
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,000
The rest of them are also former
members of the Artai military.

128
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,333
What's the current situation?

129
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,833
I'm afraid that it's
been a stalemate

130
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,208
ever since the Brigadier
stirred things up.

131
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,500
Right now, we're
still in the middle

132
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,458
of investigating
what happened at Wind.

133
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,833
On top of that,

134
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,250
the Strategic Otome Limitation
Talks are coming up.

135
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,791
We cannot afford to fail here.

136
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,500
Big Sister Haruka,
would you like a muffin?

137
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,458
How can you be calm
at a time like this?!

138
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,750
Well, we are in a stalemate.

139
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,166
There's nothing
we can really do.

140
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,291
But it's our job to go
into situations like this

141
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,416
and break them up!

142
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,708
With something like
a full out attack!

143
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,750
Please calm down,
Big Sister Haruka.

144
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,333
The situation will change even
if we don't do anything.

145
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,333
Besides, we can't go
on an all-out attack

146
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,500
without your Robe, right?

147
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,666
Sara Gallagher.

148
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,666
An Otome's dedication
to her duty

149
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,458
has nothing to do with
wearing her Robe!

150
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,708
[SARA]
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,416
What's important is our
fighting spirit, huh?

152
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,458
[TOMOE]
Dear bus-jacking terrorists...

153
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,708
We are pleased to bring you

154
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,416
our leading presidential
candidate, Ishigermin.

155
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,666
Vote Ishigermin, for everyone's
hopes for a better future!

156
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,708
As a man who
understands the people,

157
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,750
Wattari Ishigermin has come
to hear your demands.

158
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,166
Feel free to call him
whatever you like.

[ISHIGERMIN] What are you

Well, well, if it isn't
Wattari Ishigermin.

I've been hoping to meet you.

You would never understand,

Citizens of this nation,
I am upset and frightened.

169

I feel this way because such
a boorish, violent person

core of our government!

It sounds pretty good
if you ask me!

You're way more annoying
than the Brigadier!

now, you and me!

I refuse! And so would anyone
in their right mind would!

181

Do you know why
I'm still so calm

much verbal abuse

It's because I...

Yes!

With love, I can overcome any
hardship life might throw at me!

191
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,333
And for the sake of love,

I wanna take this world into
my own hands and make it new!

I wanna share these

Who is this guy?

and caricatures for a living.

will introduce her to the world!

Right now, she's my secretary,

but before long, she will
be the new First Lady

She's the little witch who
joined with the Valkyries!

00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,791
that we always follow
at times like that.

319
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,291
What kind of rule?

320
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,708
[YUKINO] We decided that,
if I turn out to be wrong,

321
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,958
then Haruka gets to scold
me as much as she likes,

322
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,833
and if Haruka's wrong,
then I get to scold her.

323
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,541
[YUKINO] After that,
we have a nice long talk,

324
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,291
and once we find a path that
we both think is right,

325
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,916
we walk down that path together,
without any hesitation.

326
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,416
[SARA] This is the Milky Way
Aquamarine, Sara Gallagher,

327
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,208
the first of the Five Pillars.

328
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,291
I request a contract with
the Surrogate System.

329
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,166
Materialize!

330
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,083
[YUKINO]
That's why I'm sure that Haruka

331
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,125
will do what I believe is right.

332
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,041
That's just who she is.

333
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,583
Brigadier Haruka
Armitage... my Otome.

334
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,041
All right, here I go, Yukino!

335
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,750
Go!

336
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,541
[screaming]

337
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,125
[SERGEANT A]
Enemy attack!

338
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,916
[LIEUTENANT A]
Major, what do we do now?!

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,625
Fight them off! Fire!

340
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,875
Fire!

341
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:08,750
Damn it!

342
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,791
[gasps]

343
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,666
Mikoto!

344
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,083
[HARUKA] So you thought
you'd hold some hostages

345
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,000
and demand that we release Nagi.

346
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,000
But you guys never had a
chance 'cause you were trying

347
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,041
to get what you want by
using other people!

348
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,625
If you really wanna fight,

349
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,541
then why don't you do it on your
own without the help of others?!

350
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,375
No way, it's a Child!

351
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,375
[YUKINO screams]

352
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,875
Yukino!

353
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,791
[YUKINO screams]

354
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,708
New target's been confirmed
as enemy life form!

355
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,416
Delta Force, attack!

356
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,083
[YUKINO]
Haruka!

357
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,958
Brigadier! Miss Yukino!

358
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,708
Hear me, Haruka Armitage,

359
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,541
my Otome of
Continental Orb Topaz,

360
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,958
in my name, I hereby
release your powers.

361
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,166
Madam President!

362
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,708
Madam President! Brigadier!

363
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,000
[HARUKA] You're really
starting to make a big mess!

364
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,208
In the name of the
President of Aries,

365
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,125
I'm gonna cut you up
into little pieces!

366
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,208
How's that? Hm?

367
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,250
Arika!

368
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,875
Please evacuate the area,
President Chrysant.

369
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,416
Thank you very much for
your help, Meister Sara.

370
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,458
[BOTH gasp]

371
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,375
[gasps]

372
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,250
What?

373
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,291
Big Sister! Did you see that?!

374
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,791
See what?

375
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,958
[SARA]
That thing...

376
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,416
No... Her...

377
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,041
Impossible!

378
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,291
The Predecessor...

379
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,583
[YUKINO]
The Pure White Diamond...

380
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,166
Grand Meister Fumi Himeno.

381
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,291
Delta Formation Attack!

382
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,416
There is no way the
Predecessor would attack us!

383
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,125
I'll find out who
you really are.

384
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,291
Are you gonna stop
clinging to me, or what?

385
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,666
 Oh.

386
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,583
All right, but don't pursue
it too far from here.

387
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,708
Good luck!

388
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,500
Yukino!

389
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,208
Huh?

390
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,916
No! Haruka!

391
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,916
How dare you attack
me from behind!

392
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,666
Next time we meet...

393
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,416
B-Brigadier?!

394
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,125
[ARIKA]
Brigadier?

395
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,166
Brigadier!

396
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,916
What a shame.

397
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,583
It looks like your plan
to be freed didn't work out.

398
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,583
[NAGI]
Oh, you mean those guys?

399
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,958
I don't think so.

400
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,666
If I threw my lot in
with the type of guys

401
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,750
who'd attempt a bus jacking,

402
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,708
I'd only end up
caught again anyway.

403
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,000
Of course people like
that would fail!

404
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,083
You're still a
despicable bastard.

405
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,875
Aww, you should call
me a good boy!

406
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,375
I like staying here. I get three
meals a day and naptime.

407
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,791
And I don't have to
work my butt off

408
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,666
like the people
in the Black Valley.

409
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,291
Huh? Why the long faces?

410
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,833
Did something happen at the
Black Valley by any chance?

411
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:35,750
Yes, it did!

412
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,083
The Black Valley disappeared,

413
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,458
and it took Mashiro and
Mai along with it!

414
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,791
Please, Nagi, tell me!

415
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,458
Where is everyone now?!

416
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,541
Oh? Then its come back, has it?

417
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,750
No, wait... Better
to call it "she."

418
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,416
She came to Garderobe.

419
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,958
Let me guess,

420
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,500
the nanomachines inside the
defeated Otomes have solidified.

421
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,625
Although they still
show life signs,

422
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:02,250
their bodies have become
as hard as rock.

423
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,916
Am I right?

424
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,875
What do you know, Nagi?

425
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,041
[NAGI]
Hm. I don't know very much.

426
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,625
But the little bit I do know

427
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,875
I learned from reading the books
found among the Artai archives.

428
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,958
Should you be wearing
your Meister uniform

429
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,916
around the Team Stripes' base?

430
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,208
What difference does it
make at this point?

431
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,375
If the officials at the palace
have a problem with it,

432
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,208
they can come here
and talk to me about it.

433
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,666
Those Peacemakers
are nothing more

434
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,750
than a bunch of little
wet-nosed runts.

435
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,833
Anyway, how about those things
I asked for, Yamada- <i>chi</i> ?

436
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,666
Don't call me
Yamada- <i>chi</i> , okay?

437
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,750
Why not?

438
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,750
So are you serious about going?

439
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:10,041
I've been wasting time ever
since I got back to this place.

440
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,291
It's still just as cold,
and the food's so greasy,

441
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,708
I can barely eat it.

442
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,541
I went to Garderobe 'cause
I couldn't stand it here.

443
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,458
Have I been demoted
or something?

444
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,083
So you're taking it out on me.

445
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,416
Well, I can't really make
any recommendations.

446
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,791
Rumor has it there are problems
with the Five Pillars.

447
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,041
[NAO]
Don't worry, Yamada- <i>chi</i> .

448
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,333
[door opens]

449

[SERVANT A]
Meister Juliet Nao Zhang.

450
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,291
We've brought a guest for you.

451
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,500
I'm glad you could make it...

452

Nina.

453
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:49,000
It's good to see you,
Big Sister Nao.

454
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,333
[NINA] So what did you
wanna see me for?

455
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,958
[NAO] They want you
to do the preview.

456
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,166
[NINA] What? You called me
all this way just for that?

457
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:09,916
[SARA]
Hold on.

458
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,375
[NINA]
Big Sister Sara?

459
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,541
[SARA] You girls lack the
experience and understanding

460
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:13,833
of what it takes
to make a preview.

461
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,041
I'll show you how it's done.

462
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,666
[NAO] Sure, if you can
do better, show us.

463
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,833
[SARA]
All right. Next time--
