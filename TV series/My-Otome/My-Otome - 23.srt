Please tell me one
thing, Your Highness.

168
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,791
The casket of the
Valkyries' Predecessor...

169
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,083
Whose body is resting inside it?

170
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,041
I guess I can't hide it
from you any longer.

171
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,083
That's right. Inside it is...

172
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:38,583
Lena... You and...
that girl... I can't...

173

[MIYU] It was during the
rebellion 15 years ago.

174
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,666
I had made my way to
Wind City, but unfortunately,

175
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,125
I was too late.

176
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,583
However, as fate would have it,

177
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,250
I was able to
find Lena's daughter.

178
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,541
[MIYU] I picked up the
infant and carried her out

179
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,166
of Windbloom, then handed
her to your grandmother.

180
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,250
That child was you, Arika.

181
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,416
If so, that means I'm really...

182
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Yes.

183

You are the only
daughter of Lena Sayers,

184
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,375
the "Blue Sky Sapphire."

185
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,083
My mother...

186
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,750
[gasps] Well, then,
how did the Gem...?

187
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,458
[MIYU] I found the Gem when it
was about to be sold to Artai,

188
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,208
and took it for safekeeping.

189
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,625
Then I gave it to your
grandmother to pass to you.

190
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,750
It is, after all,
rightfully yours.

191
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,750
Thank you, Miyu.
But I don't understand.

192
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,666
Why did you do so much for me?

193
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,541
Because, you are the blood
of my special person.

However, it is true that
I have existed much longer

than any human has.

I'm only a replacement...

The Minister's replacement
for Nina. Nothing more.

216
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,791
I may not know your origins,

217
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,791
but do you know of the
story regarding the master

218
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,291
of the Pure White Diamond?

219
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,583
About the Otomes'
Predecessor, Fumi?

220
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,416
Every human has their own will,

221
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,958
and it is their will
that decides their fate.

222
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,708
A true leader or king is not
controlled by their birth,

223
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,791
but instead, rises by their
own will, lays down a path,

224
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,583
and does what needs to be done.

225
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,708
That is one conclusion
of many I have reached

226
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,833
through hundreds of
years of observation.

227
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,708
By the way, Miss Mai,

228
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,166
what was it that made you
wanna become an Otome?

229
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,500
I have a younger
brother back home.

230
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,208
He has a lot
of responsibilities,

231
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,750
which can be hard for him.

232
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,791
As his older sister, I felt like
I had to help him... or...

233
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,375
Well, something like that.

Miss Mai, please tell me!

from all of a sudden?

I don't really understand.

Why is it that Otomes exist?

240

What am I supposed to do?

00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,583

Don't worry.

I'm sure that, one day,
you'll understand.

251
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,416
Or rather...

252
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,000
It's something only you
can understand, Arika.

253
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,125
But then, what if I make
some horrible mistake?

254
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,416
I'm still a fool,

255
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,666
so there's lots of things
I don't understand.

256
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,958
That's why...

257
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,708
That's why Ersty...

258
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,291
In that case,
what you have to do

259
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,125
is think it through
for yourself.

260
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,458
Decide on your own
what is best for you.

261
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,291
And if you think
you've made a mistake,

262
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,541
you can always start again
from the beginning.

263
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,708
Of course, some things can't
return to the way they were.

264
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,750
But, you have to believe
things will work out

for the best in the end,
otherwise you won't be able

Miss Mai...

268
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,666

after meeting with

I thought about why Garderobe
sealed its technology away,

271
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,708
and why Otomes existed.

272

That's the reason I decided
to stay with Mikoto.

There's nothing wrong with
asking for other opinions,

I fell into the trap, and then,

325
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,000
the Gem ended up in her stomach.

326
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,458
And it hasn't come back out?

[MAI]
Mm-mm. No.

328
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,500
In fact, we were somehow
able to enter a contract

329
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,083
under those conditions.

That doesn't make any sense.

It's because Mikoto
is the Crystal Princess.

Yes.

guidelines to maintain order

335

"Otome-type Higher order
Materialization Powers."

00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,625
Huh?

338
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,458
The Crystal Princess
is an original.

339
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:21,583
The last remaining pure wielder
of higher order materialization.

I really hated that girl.

But no matter how cruel
I was or how much I ignored her,

You were only following
orders, nothing more.

All of the blame for this
should be placed on me...

Both you and His

And if it can lead humanity
to a more glorious era,

it's my duty to do everything
within my power to aid you.

Even if it means I have
to kill my friends.

369
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,083
Because I'm still an Otome.

She did that so I could escape.

I just hope she's not
being tortured right now.

[NATSUKI]
Yeah.

And when it comes down to it,

I am still the
Headmistress of Garderobe.

It's about those two.

I guess this makes
everything clear now.

I'm not the real queen.

than a replacement.

all those things

Even if I reclaim the

nothing is really gonna change.

But now, Nagi has the Harmonium.

If he can use it to truly

change this world
for the better, then...

Maybe he'll be able
to create a new world

for Otomes to fight.

when Nina appeared
at the Dragon's Cemetery.

She was crying.

wasn't just because

00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,625
Ha!

488
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,833
If you are Arika's Master,
and intend to remain

489
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,375
with her in the days ahead,

490
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,666
then there is one thing
I must ask you.

491
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,041
Do you think you can
reach... your goal?

492
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,541
I don't know.

493
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,291
But I swore to my citizens
I would, together with Arika.

494
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,833
Then learn your role well.

495
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,375
Become a queen worthy
of being Arika's Master.

496
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,541
Learn my role?

497
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,250
How am I supposed to do that?

498
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,625
How about taking some
lessons from Mai?

499
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,083
Huh?

500
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,458
[NATSUKI]
It's something she hid from me,

501
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,416
but Mai is the older sister
of the prince of Zipang,

502
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,041
Takumi Tokiha no Kami Tadayori.

503
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,416
She's none other
than Princess Mai...

504
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,041
Mai- <i>Hime</i> .

505
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,208
Hey, Mashiro. Please
wait a bit more.

506
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,791
I'll become a powerful Otome.

507
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,916
Then wars will be total history!

508
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,958
That's good. That's
really good, Arika!

509
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,125
[ARIKA]
Hm.

510
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,291
[MAI] Isn't this supposed to be
a steaming-hot school drama?

511
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,791
[NATSUKI]
Uh, we already did that.

512
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,333
[MAI] Oh, but I'm sure
Midori is really--

513
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,791
[NATSUKI]
We've already done that, too.

514
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,083
[MAI]
What?!

515
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,750
Come on! I'm finally
making an appearance and--

516
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,916
[NATSUKI] Poor girl.
There, there, don't cry.

517
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,291
[MAI] It's not comforting
when you do it, Natsuki.
