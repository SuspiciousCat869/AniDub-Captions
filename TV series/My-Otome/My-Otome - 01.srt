Hey!

I'm very sorry, but from

As you can see, I'm very busy.

181
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,208
[ARIKA] Um, I'm looking for
the way to Garderobe Academy.

182
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,333
Do you know it?

[ARIKA]
Well, I'm looking for my mother.

186
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,875
But the only thing I know about
her is that she was an Otome.

187
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,083
So I thought, Garderobe is
a school for Otomes, right?

188
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,416
So, then, if I
become an Otome too...

189
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,583
[NINA]
Impossible.

know anything, do you?

193
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,125
Galelia.

Huh. I don't know what kind
of backwoods place that is,

anything about being an Otome.

200

the old technology of Earth

is that the princess?

[NINA]
No. "That" is an Otome.

204
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,250
She is Meister Shizuru.
