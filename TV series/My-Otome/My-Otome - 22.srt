1
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,791
[NGUYEN] My condolences
regarding the youngest daughter

2
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,500
of the Ho family.

3
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,958
I never figured that
the whole family

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,291
was working for the Schwarz.

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,458
I was careless.

6
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,708
[NATSUKI]
Your Majesty...

7
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,250
However...

8
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,708
I can understand what the Ho
family must have been feeling.

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,083
[ANH]
Miss Natsuki.

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,875
I'm sure that you
know this by now:

11
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,166
many of the Otomes in the
past came from that family.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,166
And during the War
of the Dragon King,

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,375
they lost many of
their female relatives.

14
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,083
I do understand, Big Sister Anh.

15
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,750
However, if Nagi sets the
Harmonium into motion,

16
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,708
this world will be
thrown back to the age

17
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,291
of the Dragon King War.

18
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,333
No, even worse, back to the days
of the War of the Twelve Kings!

19
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,208
We must prevent that
from happening at all costs!

20
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,916
For this reason, Your Majesty,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,625
I ask you to please
lend us your power.

22
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:10,083
You really have grown to become
quite impressive, Headmistress.

23
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,958
Th-Then...

24
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,833
Yes. The nation of Annam will
follow the terms of the treaty

25
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,125
and aid Garderobe
as best we can.

26
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,750
Thank you very much,
Your Majesty.

27
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,083
[meows]

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,083
[meows]

29
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,958
[REFUGEES chattering]

30
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,333
Don't worry.

31
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,791
Yes, there's still lots left,
so hold your horses.

32
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,041
Here you go, son. Eat up.

33
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,500
Thank you so much.

34
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,958
[MASHIRO]
I see. So the five of them left.

35
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,500
[VILLAGER 22A]
Yeah.

36
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,333
They went to deliver our message
of retribution to Cardair.

37
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,500
Leader...

38
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,333
Hey. What's that over there?

39
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,333
[MASHIRO] Don't tell me
they've returned already!

40
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,541
[VILLAGER 22A]
No, it's not them.

41
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,541
I don't like the looks of this.

42
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,041
[VILLAGER 22B]
Hurry! Prepare for an attack!

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,541
[BOTH gasp]

44
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,291
Wait a minute, isn't that...?

45
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,791
[ARIKA]
Sergey...

46
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,416
[SERGEY]
Attention, citizens of Aswad.

47
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,250
I am Major Sergey Wang
of the Imperial Military

48
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,291
of Artai Principality.

49
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,666
We have no intention
of fighting with you.

50
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,250
Our only purpose
here is to pick up

51
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,416
Queen Mashiro of
Windbloom Kingdom,

52
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,375
along with the Otome
accompanying her,

53
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,000
Arika Yumemiya.

54
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,958
We ask that you turn
those two over to us

55
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,083
as soon as possible.

56
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,625
Your deadline is noon.

57
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,541
Have them come to
the Dragon's Cemetery.

58
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,666
If they are late,
we will be left with no choice

59
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,000
but to discontinue
our peaceful relations.

60
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:30,833
I trust you will make...

61
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,958
Hey, what are you doing?

62
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,416
They're gonna see you!

63
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,666
[MASHIRO]
A-Arika!

64
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,458
[SOLDIER 22A] Sir! A message
from the Valkyrie Unit.

65
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,166
"We will begin
our plan shortly."

66
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,541
[NAGI]
I see.

67
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,708
[SOLDIER 22B] We have
a report from Mister Smith.

68
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,375
"Our insurance has awakened."

69
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,458
[NAGI]
Really?

70
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,375
Insurance?

71
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,041
Yes, that's right.

72
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,916
It's someone who may know
the final verse to the song.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,166
[NINA]
Huh?

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,666
[NAGI] Our search team
found her at the bottom

75
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,666
of the valley, barely alive.

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,875
She's the one person
who is closest to Mashiro.

77
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,916
[MASHIRO] I'll leave these
people in your capable hands.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,333
All right. Sure thing,
Your Majesty.

79
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,583
Arika.

80
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,791
It'll be fine. Come on,
let's go, Mashiro.

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,083
You know this has
to be a trap, right?

82
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,875
But we still have to go.

83
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,208
[meows]

84
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
[LUMEN]
There they are.

85
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,958
Looks like the Otomes from all
the nations have gathered here.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,208
[LUMEN] Mm. Even the Lovely Onyx
is making an appearance.

87
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,916
It looks like
they're ready for us.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,416
[RAD] This fight might be
a bit tougher than we thought.

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,750
[MIDORI] But we're still goning
to push through and defeat them.

90
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,083
[RAD]
Yeah.

91
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,708
Let's go.

92
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,541
--[humming]
--[SERGEY] Huh?

93
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,208
I knew it. I knew
you'd come here.

94
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,291
Are you all right?

95
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,458
[gasps]

96
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,000
[SERGEY]
I'm assuming Queen Mashiro

97
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,166
is hiding somewhere close by.

98
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,250
That shows good judgment.

99
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,708
You always have
to be cautious...

100
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,750
...when you're facing the enemy.

101
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,958
[gasps]

102
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,333
[ARIKA]
I don't understand.

103
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,583
Why did you have
to be my patron?

104
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,833
Why did you support me?

105
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,750
And what about that time...?!

106
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,083
That was because you...

107
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,458
[SERGEY growls]

108
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,916
I should stop making excuses.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,875
It was probably because...

110
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:11,458
I was... because I was
attracted to you.

111
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,583
Even I was surprised by myself.

112
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,458
After all, you're the
same age as Nina.

113
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:21,125
But I admit, I was deeply
attracted by that brilliant

114
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,750
smile of yours.

115
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,000
To the way you looked ahead
and chased after your dreams.

116
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,666
I was drawn to you and
your determined eyes.

117
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,166
That's why, when the time came,

118
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,916
I betrayed the Grand Duke,
and tried my best to save you.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,041
It was the first time I'd
ever done anything like that.

120
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,083
But... the result of that was...

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,458
How's... Nina?

122
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,666
She's fine. On the
outside, at least.

123
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,708
But, looking at her
now hurts me.

124
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,041
And so that's why...

125
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,041
I have a duty to take care
of the mistakes I made.

126
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:06,333
As a soldier of Artai...
and also... as a father to Nina.

127
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,916
[ARIKA]
I feel sorry for Nina.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,750
[gasps]

129
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,041
[ARIKA]
I...

130
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,375
I think...

131
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,750
I probably fell
in love with you, too.

132
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,708
I loved you.

133
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,708
That's why I understand how
Nina feels about you, Sergey!

134
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,375
[growls] I know that!

135
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,125
I've always known!

136
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,708
But then, why?!

137
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,583
It's not something logical.

138
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,208
Nina... is my daughter.

139
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,291
But, Sergey!

140
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,833
[SERGEY]
So right now...

141
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,333
...as her father, I have to do
whatever I can for her sake.

142
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,208
That is how I can
express my love for Nina.

143
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,750
[ARIKA]
Mm.

144
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,833
I was hoping that
you'd surrender.

145
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:55,541
But I suppose you'd rather,
keep chasing your dreams, right?

146
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,916
[ARIKA]
Hm.

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,333
That's the Antsy I know.

148
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,375
[grunts]

149
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,583
Ugh.

150
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,708
[gasps]

151
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,166
Are those Slaves?

152
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,583
[grunts]

153
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,833
[yelps]

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,875
[ARIKA grunting]

155
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,333
Arika!

156
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,583
What?! No way!

157
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,583
Princess Mashiro
should be hiding

158
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,791
somewhere around here. Find her.

159
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,875
Roger that.

160
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,416
[NAGI] You've memorized
the song, right?

161
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,583
[NINA]
Yes.

162
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,875

324
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,708
The accursed Gem
of the Valkyries.

325
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,500
You people would play
around with the corpse

326
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,291
of Lena Sayers in order to
create these abominations?

327
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,166
[gasps] Her corpse?!

328
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,291
The most important order left
by that person is up to me.

329
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,583
I must destroy you people.

330
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,083
You...!

331
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,500
A cyborg's sword won't beat us!

332
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,458
I'll show you what we can do!

333
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,583
[MIYU] Unlock Numbers
Four through Twelve.

334
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,458
Set anti-materializer
output at 50 percent.

335
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,166
[TOMOE yells]

336
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,583
[TOMOE]
My Element!

337
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,041
[gasps]

338
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,625
[SERGEY grunts]

339
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,458
Wait, Miyu! Don't!

340
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,416
Nina, you can use
this thing to do

341
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,166
whatever you want!

342
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,041
So, what is it you
wanna do right now?

343
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,333
[SMITH]
So beautiful!

344
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,833
At last, this is the power
of the legendary Harmonium!

345
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:14,958
[SMITH gasps]

346
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,375
What happened?

347
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,875
Did we just travel
through time and space?

348
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,375
Well, there seems
to be a floor. Look.

349
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,791
But more importantly,
it's this place...

350
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,958
Sergey!

351
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,750
I apologize for this.

352
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,375
I believe I avoided
critical areas, but...

353
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,208
[groans]

354
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,500
[gasps]

355
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,375
[MIYU]
Arika, be careful.

356
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,791
It's coming.

357
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,958
[ARIKA]
What is it?

358
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,166
How come there's a
thunderstorm all of a sudden?

359
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,375
No... That's not a thunderstorm.

360
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,791
Oh, no... Don't tell me...

361
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,416
It's the Ultimate Black Diamond.

362
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,375
Nina...

363
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,375
Ah...

364
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,375
Nina... it's you...

365
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,166
Hello, Father.

366
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,333
[gasps]

367
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,208
Father! You've been wounded!

368
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,250
[sighs] Nina...

369
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,625
Arika... But why...?

370
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,291
[NINA growls]

371
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,916
[NINA]
Arika... It was you again!

372
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,958
Nina! It's not like that!

373
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,958
Please, Arika,
you must stand back.

374
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,083
[ARIKA]
But...

375
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,041
No, Nina! Stop this!

376
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,375
I won't forgive you.

377
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,375
I won't forgive somebody
who hurts my father!

378
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,625
Never!

379
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,166
[MIYU]
Sword Marie.

380
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,125
Begin the higher order
materialization sequence.

381
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,833
Miss Alyssa,
grant me your power!

382
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,291
[MIYU] Confirming hereditary
information of Alyssa Sears.

383
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,708
"Artemis: the golden sword."
Mission start.

384
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,375
[screams]

385
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,583
[BOTH grunt]

386
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,375
[ARIKA grunts]

387
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,708
[ARIKA]
Huh?

388
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,208
[gasps] Wha--?

389
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,333
[ARIKA]
What?

390
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,041
[TOMOE] Isn't this Robe
simply wonderful?

391
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,416
[MIYU]
No.

392
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,875
[TOMOE] I'm so excited,
my heart is about to burst!

393
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,458
[MIYU] Your small chest
doesn't show it.

394
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,708
[ARIKA] Miyu! You
shouldn't be so honest!

395
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,041
[MIYU] I understand.
Oh, you're beautiful.

396
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,416
You have such a nice body.

397
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,250
[TOMOE]
I'm going to kill you for sure!
