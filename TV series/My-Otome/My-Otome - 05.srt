No.

somehow got a hold
of Arika's uniform?

It seems that's
what this is about.

Word is that the really rabid
fans collect that sort of thing.

Items like genuine uniforms
and gym clothes

ridiculously high prices.

But that girl couldn't have
anything to do with it, right?

102
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,458
Unlikely. Because that girl
comes from the border lands.

uniform could be sold there.

means she has no

to fight a dance battle,

for addressing a senior!

and get into this academy,

money to pay tuition!

As the top three students
of the Pearl Class,

we're known as the "Trias,"

guidance to the students.

where was the last place you
saw this uniform yesterday?

130

It got dirty last night,

00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,333
and I wanted to
wash it right then,

132
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,250
but I ended up forgetting
it in the laundry room.

I know I might not
have a lot of money,

136
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,708
but I would never do
something like that!

How did it end up in that store?

that other students think
you don't belong here!

for a girl like you,

without family or support,
to attend this academy!

who has expressed a
desire to support you.

helped by your mother

but if you do, I imagine you
would no longer have to deal

163
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,500
with so much slander
and unfounded suspicion.

164
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,625
Arika Yumemiya.

165
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,166
For now we'll set
aside the facts

166
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,083
of how your uniform
came to be sold,

167
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,291
but you are still responsible

168
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,250
for not taking care
of it properly.

169
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,625
Do you understand this?

170
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,666
Yes.

171
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,708
Then until the case is resolved,

172
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,125
you will be confined
to the dormitories.

173
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,458
You are hereby
suspended from classes.

174
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,583
Arika sold her uniform?

175
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,000
That's what I heard!

176
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,041
I think that's why Big Sister
Shiho dragged her away!

177
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,458
[LILIE]
No way!

178
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,583
Uh, but come
to think of it,

179
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,625
yesterday she was talking about
needing to make some money.

180
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,833
[YAYOI]
So that's why!

181
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,416
[LILIE]
Mh-hm.

182
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,833
[TOMOE]
Stop it, everyone.

183
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,500
Even if she's new,
she's still our classmate.

184
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,291
We should believe her,
even if no one else does.

185
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,375
Oh boy. This is serious.

186
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,875
Well, if that's the case, Nina,

187
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,333
maybe you shouldn't
spend so much time

188
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,375
worrying about that Arika girl.

189
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,083
Besides, she might be
crushed very soon.

190
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,041
[ERSTIN]
What should we do, Nina?

191
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,000
We do... nothing.

192
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,541
If it's true, then she'll be
kicked out, simple as that.

193
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,375
What a harsh outlook!

194
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,625
[MASHIRO]
What?!

195
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,000
That little brat?!

196
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,333
Yes, it's something about
her selling her uniform.

197
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
It's the talk of
the school right now.

198
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,291
I gotta act on this now!

199
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,916
[AOI] Miss Mashiro,
where are you going?

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,875
Well, duh! The academy!

201
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,375
You can't!

202
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,458
Until you finish this, I'm not
letting you out that door!

203
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,041
[growls]

204
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,208
[CHIE] I feel kinda
sorry for that girl.

205
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,625
Judging by her reaction,

206
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,291
I doubt she's ever experienced
this level of teasing.

207
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,208
I was just doing my job
as a member of Trias.

208
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,875
Yes, there is that too.

209
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,166
So, what do you think?

210
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,541
We oughta do something,
right, Akane?

211
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,875
Yes, that's right.

212
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,416
[ARIKA] "Many years ago, I was
greatly helped by your mother.

213
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
It is my fond wish
to repay her kindness

214
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,875
by providing you, her daughter,

215
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,250
with support at
Garderobe Academy.

216
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,833
Do not worry about
paying me back.

217
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,958
Please take advantage of my
offer to achieve your dreams.

218
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,958
I hope you will become
as wonderful an Otome

219
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,375
as your mother was."

[ARIKA]
Mother.

222
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,791
Is it really all right for me
to believe this person?

223
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,583
[SHIHO] Are you suggesting
someone stole it

224
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,416
just to frame you?

225
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,791
Sure, it makes sense

226
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,041
that other students think
you don't belong here!

227
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,083
It's inappropriate
for a girl like you,

228
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,958
without family or support,
to attend this academy!

--[door opens]
--Huh?

[ARIKA]
Nina.

231
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,625
Can I ask you something?

232
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,625
Do you think...
people really hate me?

233
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:10,416
Ya know, this is the first time
I've ever been to a real school.

234
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,250
And I was looking forward to it.

235
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,000
But now... I'm thinking...

236
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,833
...maybe I shouldn't
have come here!

237
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:23,041
[NINA] If you truly think that,
you should hurry up and leave.

238
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,666
I thought you wanted to become
an Otome no matter what!

239
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,583
That's why you challenged
me to a dance battle,

240
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,750
even though you had
no chance of winning!

241
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,791
But...

[growls]

243
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,166
I guess that's as
far as it goes.

00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,166
Nina...

245
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,958
[SERGEY]
Even if you somehow win,

246
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,708
you'll be crushing
the dreams of Nina,

247
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,916
who has endured strenuous
training to enter the academy.

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,958
Is your dream really
worth that much to you?

249
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,875
[ARIKA]
I finally found my dream.

250
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,625
So I'll keep chasing
after it, no matter what.

I swear I didn't
sell my uniform!

how this happened!

It's nice to meet you!

So, the person who came to
the store to sell it was a man?

00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,708
Yeah, he told them
that he'd found it.

But the store clerks don't
remember his face at all.

Now, about the uniform.

00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,625
Was the torn apron mended
by someone in the store?

Yeah, that's what I hear.

00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,166
Did you think you'd get away
with it, my dear "brother"?

322
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,833
[NINA]
Huh?

323
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,708
[gasps] Juliet!

324
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,458
[MAN A screams]

325
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,916
Thank you so much
for all your help.

326
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,541
We're sorry we troubled you.

327
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,125
[SERGEY]
Huh?

328
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,041
Oh, don't mention it. I'm happy
to do whatever Akane asks of me.

329
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,041
And since it was my first time
in that kind of place,

330
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,458
I learned a lot.

331
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,375
Bye now!

332
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,583
[ALL]
Thanks for everything!

333
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,958
[SERGEY]
I'm not impressed.

334
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,916
Future Otomes
on a date with a man?

335
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,291
Good afternoon, Major Wang.

336
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,541
[SERGEY]
Hello, Erstin, Irina.

337
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,625
Thanks for always
looking out for Nina.

338
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,375
What are you doing here?

339
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,791
Oh? You seem to be a bit
down about something, Antsy.

340
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,166
Oh that's right,

341
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,458
didn't you sell your uniform
to pay your tuition?

342
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,333
I'd never do such a thing!

343
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,250
[SERGEY] But I hear you
don't have any relatives

344
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,916
or financial support.

345
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,416
Wrong! Guess again!

346
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,041
There is someone who's decided
to help me out after all!

347
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,416
Oh? Who is this weirdo?

348
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,208
I'm sure he's a very kind
and cool person, unlike you!

349
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,916
Well, I suggest you
study hard, then.

350
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,583
You don't wanna let such
a nice person down!

351
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,000
[ARIKA] I don't need
you to tell me that!

352
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,250
[AKANE] Is that so? I'm sorry
he couldn't be of much help.

353
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,250
[CHIE] Well, I guess there
wasn't much we could do.

354
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,875
After all, it takes experience
to force information

355
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,625
out of the sort of people
who go to those stores.

356
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,750
[groans]

357
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,125
At this rate...

358
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,625
[MASHIRO]
I found you!

359
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,291
I heard you did
a major screw-up

360
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,125
on your first day
in the academy!

361
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,125
It's you.

362
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,333
Your Majesty!

363
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,958
You came all the way
out here to say that?!

364
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,791
You bet!

365
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm here to laugh at you!

366
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:39,041
[laughing]

367
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,875
Miss Mashiro.

368
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:45,833
I should share this with Mikoto!
Where is she? Bring her to me!

369
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,166
Uh... if it's that cat
you're talking about...

370
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,375
Hey. That handkerchief...

371
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,958
Ah! So then, last night...

372
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,333
That's it!

373
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,333
I've solved the mystery!

374
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,708
And the culprit is...

375
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,500
The pet of Queen Mashiro...
Mikoto the cat!

376
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,750
What did you say?!

377
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,291
[IRINA]
Last night, during dinner,

378
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,666
the cat was present when
Tohika mushroom soup

379
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,125
was spilled all over
Arika's uniform.

380
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,333
Tomoe's handkerchief
also got soup on it

381
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,666
when she helped to clean up.

382
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,250
This is that handkerchief!

383
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,708
Mikoto's favorite food
is Tohika mushroom.

384
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,125
It's right, isn't it?

385
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,833
[MASHIRO]
Uhh... Uh-huh.

386
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,000
[IRINA]
So last night,

387
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,791
the cat found the
mushroom-covered uniform

388
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,166
that Arika left in
the laundry room.

389
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,583
And when Mikoto was taking
it away, she dropped it.

390
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,041
This is nothing but
your imagination!

391
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,291
[IRINA]
Check this out!

392
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,208
The tear on the uniform
is irrefutable proof!

393
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,375
You all saw how the
same kind of tear

394
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,000
was made on the handkerchief.

395
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,791
That place is
probably on the route

396
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,541
Mikoto always takes on her way
back to the State Guest House.

397
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,958
And then, someone found
the uniform, picked it up,

398
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,875
and sold it!

399
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,041
In other words, how the
uniform went missing

400
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,791
and how it was sold
are entirely unrelated!

401
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,500
And that is the truth
behind this matter!

402
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,375
So there you have it,
Your Majesty.

403
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:25,083
All lies! Mikoto would
never do such a thing!

404
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,083
Mikoto! Wait a minute!

405
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:30,958
[MASHIRO]
Uh...

406
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,083
Ugh! Nothing but lies!

407
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,250
You're all
disrespectful riff-raff!

408
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,875
These are all false accusations!

409
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,625
They have to be
'cause I say so!

410
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,000
That means there's
no mistake about it!

411
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,083
[NATSUKI sighs]

412
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,375
Well then, Arika.

413
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,541
It seems that the
conclusion of this incident

414
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,000
is in the hands of Her Majesty.

415
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,458
Right, and I think it's
clear to everyone now

416
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,750
that I did not sell my uniform!

417
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,250
And thanks to all this,
I became friends with people

418
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,166
who never stopped
believing in me.

419
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,583
So I've decided.

420
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,125
I don't know who
wrote this letter,

421
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,125
but I'm gonna believe in them.

422
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,458
Is that so?

423
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,750
Yes!

424
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,166
And that is how it all ended!

425
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,791
Really? Wow!

426
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,583
The cat was behind it?

427
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,083
But that's good news.

428
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,833
If one of the students
had been behind this,

429
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,666
there would've been
all sorts of trouble.

430
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,916
[TOMOE sighs]

431
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,291
Irina, Ersty, thank you
both so very very much!

432
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,791
And you too, Nina!

433
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,333
For... well, you know!

434
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,291
Oh please, I didn't
do anything for you.

435
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,000
And I don't ever plan to.

436
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,625
What a meanie.

437
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,041
[ERSTIN, IRINA chuckle]

438
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,250
I feel bad putting Queen Mashiro
and Mikoto on the spot.

439
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,458
But hey, the whole
thing's wrapped up now,

440
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,791
so it's probably for the best.

441
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,208
[NINA]
If this scares you,

442
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,375
then I suggest you never do
anything stupid like this again.

443
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,125
I don't intend to tell anyone,

444
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,333
but if you continue to go
out with men like that,

445
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,708
you're only going to get burned.

446
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,083
Uh... What are you
talking about?

447
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,291
I can't stand anyone who
pulls dirty tricks like that.

448
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,458
If you ever do it again,
I won't forgive you.

449
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,333
[screams]

450
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,875
[MARIA]
That was quite a show.

451
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,166
And you, agreeing with that
absurd investigation.

452
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,875
[NATSUKI] Just let this
one go, Miss Maria.

453
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,125
And then there's this
anonymous supporter.

454
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,458
Isn't it a little rash
to accept that?

455
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,041
[sighs]

456
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,791
At the moment, the only
leads we have about Arika

457
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,333
are the Blue Sky Sapphire
and that individual.

458
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:47,416
We have to take advantage
of any and all opportunities.

459
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,041
No matter what
his plans may be.

460
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,541
[MIYA]
I'm sorry! But...

461
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,291
[TOMOE] I told you
to tear her uniform up

462
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,833
and leave it on her desk.

463
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,583
But what did you do?

464
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,500
You wanted to make
some pocket money.

465
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,125
[MIYA] I... I thought it would
make a lot more trouble!

466
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,041
Besides, I just couldn't
rip up a uniform like that!

467
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,041
That's why...

468
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,916
Ah!

469
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,208
I'm sorry! Next time--
Next time I'll do it right!

470

[ARIKA]
This mushroom soup is delicious!

471
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,916
[MASHIRO]
It's Tohika mushroom,

472
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,041
a special variety from
the "big breast" family.

473
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,666
Nicknamed the Mai-mushroom.

474

Ah, how sad. The poor girl,
reduced to a fungi!

I'm just as happy as ever!
