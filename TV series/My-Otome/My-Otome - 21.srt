00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,625
[WOMAN 21B]
No way...

170
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,291
[MAN 21F]
But she's...

171
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,291
Mimi!

172
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,875
Hang in there!
Don't give up! Mimi!

173
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,958
[SERGEY] These five girls are
the applicants we have so far.

174
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,000
If things play out right, there
should be more volunteers soon.

175
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,125
Very good, but can these
girls be trusted?

176
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,625
You won't have to worry
about that, Your Highness.

177
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,166
From the moment they
first wear the Gem,

178
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,583
they become our Otomes.

179
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,791
Valkyries will be totally
incapable of betraying us.

180
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,000
[NAGI] So you're saying
you used the same Gem design

181
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,666
of that of a Slave?

182
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

183
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,666
Well, time is of the essence.

184
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,041
Let's have the Valkyrie Unit
give us a hand now.

185
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,416
Yes, sir.

186
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,625
[NAGI] My informants tell me
Mashiro has been found.

187
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,666
But since the report
comes from Cardair,

188
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,166
it might not be true.

189
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,833
Apparently, Arika is there, too.

190
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,041
[gasps]

191
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,083
Of course, the
situation has changed,

192
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,000
as we no longer need Arika.

193
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,000
As a matter of fact,
at this point,

194
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,583
she's only in our way.

195
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,541
[gasps]

196
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,666
[gasps]

197
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,833
But...

198
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,000
...we still need to get our
hands on Mashiro's song.

199
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,375
Think you can catch her?

200
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,791
I thought the issue with
the song had been resolved.

201
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,833
[NAGI]
I know.

202
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,500
But if that person
never wakes up,

203
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,291
what are we supposed to do then?

204
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,375
Yes, but still...

205
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,291
Let me go instead!

206
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,166
Afraid I can't let you.

207
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,375
But...

208
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,291
[NAGI]
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Nope.

209
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,625
Your Highness, I, Sergey Wang,

210
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,000
will complete this
mission flawlessly.

211
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,041
--[NINA gasps]
--[NAGI] Huh?

212
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,541
[SERGEY]
Nina, don't worry about me.

213
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,375
I have been a part of Artai's
military since I was born.

214
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,041
This is what I was meant to do.

215
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,500
But, Father...

216
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,750
So you just concentrate
on fulfilling your duties.

217
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,708
Protect His Highness,
the Grand Duke,

218
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,125
as his Meister Otome, Nina.

219
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,416
Yes.

220
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,333
We've gathered almost
all the cards.

221
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,916
Now, when we finally do
obtain the last key,

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,916
how should I use that thing?

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,375
The power of technology...

224
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,958
[NAGI] Will it lead us down
a path of destruction,

225
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,250
or towards a bright
future for humanity?

226
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,166
[NAGI] But, no matter what, the
ending is not for you to decide.

227
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,250
Isn't that right...
so-called Predecessor?

228
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,750
As I pray to you,
I can't help remembering

229
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,916
the words of that girl,
Arika Yumemiya.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,416
"If Otomes are friends,
then why must they

231
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,625
be forced to kill each other?
I will never do such a thing,

232
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,958
and I will never allow
that to happen."

233
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,666
I could not tell her,
but that's something

234
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,833
I've been secretly
searching for,

235
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,500
and something that every
Otome desires in her heart.

236
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,708
I feel the same, however,

237
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,416
conflicts are inevitable as long
as there are nations and people.

238
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,291
[YUKARIKO] That's why this
world has to be steered

239
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,958
from the path of destruction.

240
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,666
That's why Our Lady
decided that--

241
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,375
I know that. In fact...

242
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,541
I know that all too well.

243
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,666
It's because of that ideal
that we have sent out

244
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,208
so many of our students
and sacrificed their lives.

245
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,500
[MARIA] And yet, after all that,
the only thing I can do

246
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,666
is stay here and pray.

247
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,500
Miss Maria...

248
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:53,500
If you don't mind, will you
allow me to pray alongside you?

249
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,500
Even if we pray, it won't
solve anything, you know.

250
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,375
I know that.

251
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,708
But still... It's something.

252
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,416
[TOMOE] I have to go and find
Queen Mashiro and Arika now.

253
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,208
If I manage to succeed,

254
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,250
I'll put in a request
to His Highness,

255
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,000
and ask about freeing
the Headmistress for you.

256
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,625
Don't worry yourself,
I'll be waitin' here patiently.

257
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,041
Goo-goo, ga-ga. Goo-goo.

258
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,916
You're... embarrassing
me, Big Sister.

happened today.

very strange dreams lately!

a favor to ask of you.

What did you say?

297
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,083
It seems that this information

298
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,500
was originally
released by Cardair.

299

[HARUKA]
Queen Mashiro is with Aswad?!

Are you sure about that?

301
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,500
Yes, this comes from
a reliable source.

[NATSUKI]
And how's the conference going?

We haven't been able
to reach a consensus yet,

00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,500
but I am confident

305
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,250
that it's going to happen
soon, Headmistress.

306

Of course, I understand.

Why don't you leave it up to us?

for coming here!

resources to accept outsiders.

our rules by allowing

you to treat your wounded here.

you make an exception?

hardly move anymore!

00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,041
Why do you even care?

328
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,333
These people rejected you,

329
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,833
and no longer recognize
you as their queen.

330
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,750
They even went so far as
to kill your maid, right?

331
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,708
Yes, I know it's all
very confusing,

332
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,791
but I can't leave
them like this.

333
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,541
Can you take on the burden
of all these people here?

334
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,708
To save them, you
must be responsible

335
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,750
for all of their lives.

336
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,375
[ARIKA]
Mashiro!

337
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,916
What's wrong?

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,250
No, Mimi!

339
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:39,583
A-Am I... gonna... die?

340
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,083
No! No, you won't die!

341
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,500
Guess... I'm being punished...

342
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,041
...because of that maid.

343
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,083
No!

344
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,958
I'm the one to blame
for all of this!

345
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,125
It's because...
It's all because of me!

346
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,791
I let Aoi... and you...

347
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:00,583
Before... everyone...
used to laugh...

348
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,833
So... why...?

349
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,833
Mimi...

350
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:09,666
[gasps] Fa... ther...

351
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,416
I can be with you... again...

352
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,500
[gasps]

353
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,250
Mimi!

354
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,000
Again... It's my fault.

355
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,208
Everyone, please listen to me!

356
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,833
I am... I am Mashiro
Blan de Windbloom.

357
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,833
I am the Queen of
Windbloom Kingdom!

358
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,125
I wasn't a good queen,
and because of that,

359
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,500
I have caused great
pain to everyone.

360
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,166
I'm sure that some of you
still despise me.

361
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,166
I'm truly sorry.

362
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,791
But...

363
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,708
If you give me another chance,
I wanna become a good queen.

364
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:59,458
If you let me remain your ruler,
I will right my previous wrongs.

365
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,916
Watch over you,
listen to the people,

366
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,041
and become a queen
who can properly...

367
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,041
...lead her people.

368
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,791
I make this pledge
to you right now!

369
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,500
I will use this life of mine
to protect you all!

370
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,791
So please, I ask you,
entrust your lives to me!

371
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,625
Leader.

372
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,375
I beg you.

373
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,708
Please allow these people
to stay here for a little while!

374
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,208
Mashiro...

375
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:45,583
Is this a formal request
from the Queen of Windbloom?

376
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,500
[MASHIRO]
Mm.

377
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,250
Then stand, Mashiro.

378
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,458
I promise this in return.

379
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,833
Once I take back my country,

380
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,333
I will give you
what you want most.

381
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,500
I'll give you
Garderobe's technology.

382
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,208
Are you able to do that?

383
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,500
Yes, I am.

384
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,541
I will do whatever I can.
You must believe me.

385
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,166
[MIDORI]
Just remember one thing.

386
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,958
That anyone who betrays us...

387
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:14,916
I know.

388
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,333
I swear to you, Leader of Aswad!

389
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,500
Then I will believe you.

390
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,250
The Queen of Windbloom.

391
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,291
Our ally, Mashiro Blan
de Windbloom.

392
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,791
The Queen...

393
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,166
[WOMAN 21C]
Queen Mashiro...

394
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,041
Her Majesty...

395
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,125
Mimi, I'm so sorry.

396
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,125
If only I had done this sooner.

397
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,666
The one person most responsible
for causing you all to suffer

398
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,958
is none other than me.

399
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,125
Arika... this is
the last time...

400
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,625
So please, just for now...
let me cry in your arms.

401
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,291
From now on, I'm not
gonna cry again.

402
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,208
At least, not until,
I take back my country

403
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,666
and help everyone smile again.

404
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,916
[MASHIRO] But I still wonder...
Can I do this?

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,166
Am I really the right
one for this task?

406
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,291
[ARIKA]
What do you mean?

407
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,708
[MASHIRO]
Well, you might be the real

408
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,291
princess of Windbloom.

409
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,833
[ARIKA]
I don't think so.

410
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,166
I'm not like you. I don't have
what it takes to be a queen.

411
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,625
Besides...

412
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,583
[ARIKA]
I wanna become an Otome.

413
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,166
Even though there are still many
things I don't understand...

414
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,791
I wanna be able to use my power

415
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,208
to protect the people
important to me!

416
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,833
Then please lend me
that power of yours.

417
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,208
I need your strength
as my Otome...

418
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,166
No, rather, as the
Otome of Windbloom.

419
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,125
[ARIKA]
Mm!

420
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,333
[gasps]

421
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,875
That's not right.

422
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,125
Yes, Master.

423
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,083
[meows]

424
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,875
[MIDORI]
Arika.

425
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,750
You once asked me
about the righteousness

426
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:40,458
of an Otome's powers, whether
they were for good or evil.

427
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,708
That is something you
decide for yourself.

428
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,166
Together with your
queen by your side.

429
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,291
Let's go!

430
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,875
In the name of our
world of the stars,

431
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,666
we will carry out
our promised revenge!

432
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,375
I see.

433
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,041
So it looks like
they've already left.

434
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,541
[CHIE] Just as you
predicted, Major Wang.

435
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,416
It was more than obvious.

436
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,083
The information leaked.

437
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,791
Emperor Argos planned to
have us fight the Aswad.

438
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,250
But we don't have to.

439
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,875
You're too cautious.

440
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,125
I wouldn't mind fighting them.

441
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,291
Well, then, let us
begin our plan.

442
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,541
[ARIKA]
Rad, I was wondering.

443
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,250
When you're wearing your cape
what happens to your horn?

444
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,458
[RAD]
Touch it and find out.

445
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,166
[ARIKA]
Wow, it's soft and bendy!

446
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,583
[RAD]
And it stretches, too.

447
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,208
--Stretchy! Stretchy!
--[ARIKA laughs]

448
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,708
--Peek-a-boo! I see you!
--[ARIKA laughs]

449
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,208
[MIDORI] Rad's illness has
finally reached his brain.
