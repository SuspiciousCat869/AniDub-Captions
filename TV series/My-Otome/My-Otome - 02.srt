163
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,500
Why wait?

164
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,708
My castle has been destroyed
because of those commoners!

165
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,541
[NATSUKI]
Princess.

166
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,541
Huh?

167
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,041
Since the incident
14 years ago,

168
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,500
you have been the sole heir
to the throne of Windbloom,

169
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,958
and the people have eagerly
awaited your succession.

170
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,958
If I am not mistaken, your
coronation is next week.

171
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,250
[MASHIRO]
Indeed.

172
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,458
However, there are
certain factions

173
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,958
that do not agree
with your succession.

174
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,458
There are even
reports that suggest

175
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,541
yesterday's monster
attack was planned

176
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,250
by those dissenting movements.

177
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,125
[NATSUKI]
Nevertheless...

178
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,416
If you had remained within
the castle as protocol dictated,

179
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,916
it is doubtful you would
have been attacked

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,166
in the first place.

181
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,208
So tell me, Princess.

182
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,458
Who do you think is truly
responsible for this situation?

183
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,875
[MASHIRO growls]

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,333
[AOI]
Miss Mashiro!

185
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,125
Please, wait for me!

186
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,916
[NATSUKI]
So that's the "official" heir.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,833
It's a joke,
but I'm not laughing.

188
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,666
It might not be a joke;
we don't know for sure.

189
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,666
She might yet turn out
to be a genuine princess.

190
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,750
Yes. True.

191
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,000
[ARIKA]
I feel alive again!

192
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:22,875
[YOHKO]
Oh!

193
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,583
Have you had enough?

194
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,125
[ARIKA]
Yes. It was delicious.

195
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,916
I'm afraid your
clothes are still drying.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,166
You'll have to make do.

197
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,875
[ARIKA]
Oh, right.

198
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,166
[ARIKA] Professor Yohko,
may I ask a question?

199
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,750
I can become an Otome
for sure, can't I?

200
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,541
[YOHKO]
Huh?

201
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,041
But why "huh"?

202
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,708
I mean, I already asked the
headmistress and everything!

203
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,333
And I'm being allowed
to rest here, so...

204
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,416
[YOHKO]
Perhaps.

205
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,458
It all depends on
the deliberations.

206
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,833
Deliberations?

207
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,708
[YOHKO] Many representatives
from different countries

208
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,916
are gathering to discuss
the operation of the school

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,125
as well as
Otome-related matters.

210
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,375
So that means...

211
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,041
[MASHIRO]
It's never gonna happen!

212
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,458
[ARIKA] Hey, it's you!
From yesterday!

213
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,583
[YOHKO] Princess, I'm not
comfortable with this.

214
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,083
[ARIKA]
Huh? Princess?

215
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,583
That's correct!
Indeed, I am...

216
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,291
Come on!

217
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,708
Huh? Oh, right.

218
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,416
May I present Mashiro
Blan de Windbloom,

219
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,083
the Crown Princess
and future queen

220
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,458
over all of Windbloom Kingdom!

221
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,458
Omigosh, you're a princess?

222
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,250
You're nothing like
I thought you'd be!

223
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,833
[MASHIRO]
What's that supposed to mean?

224
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,083
[ARIKA]
Uh, nothing.

225
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,583
What do you mean,
"It's never gonna happen"?

226
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,083
The duty of the Otome
is one of honor,

227
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,708
and dedicating her life
to serving nobility like me.

228
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,916
How could a worthless little
thing like you be of any use?

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,083
Who are you calling worthless?

230
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,625
That would be you.

231
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,666
[ARIKA]
How dare you!

232
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,500
Knock it off!

233
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,541
[ARIKA yelps]

234
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,666
[MASHIRO laughing]

235
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,916
[MASHIRO]
That was great!

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,333
Let's go.

237
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,416
[AOI]
Miss Mashiro!

238
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,583
[YOHKO]
Are you all right?

239
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,916
Oh, please!

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,291
You gotta let me join
this deliberation thingy!

241
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,375
You want to what?

242
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,583
I wanna ask
personally and properly.

243
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,458
That's really not possible.

244
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,458
The headmistress said that
you are not to be there.

245
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,125
Why'd she say
something like that?

246
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,791
Wait just a moment.

247
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,208
Deliberations, huh?

248
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,041
[YOHKO]
Oh, boy...

249
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,875
I should've known
she'd escape.

250
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,500
[ARIKA]
Grandma always told me,

251
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,875
"If you ask with your whole
heart, things will work out!"

252
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,875
[ARIKA]
Where am I?

253
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,625
[YUKARIKO] All right,
does everyone understand?

254
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,166
All of you must remember,

255
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,708
as an Otome, you always
greet your master

256
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,416
with your very best smile,

257
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,875
no matter what the
circumstances are.

258
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,875
Now then, why don't
we practice a little?

259
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,458
[YUKARIKO]
Welcome home, Master!

260
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,333
[STUDENTS]
Welcome home, Master!

261
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,083
[MARIA]
Nina Wong, come with us.

262
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,541
The inquiry by the Garderobe
deliberation council

263
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,666
will begin shortly.

264
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,416
Yes.

265
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,958
[ARIKA]
Wow...

266
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,750
This is so completely
totally awesome!

267
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,375
And so beautiful...

268
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,875
So this is the place.

269
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,208
This is where my mother
studied all those years ago.

270
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,250
Okay! Next stop, deliberations!

271
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,791
[ARIKA] ...as soon as
I figure out where they are.

272
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,250
[bell tolling]

273
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,416
We shall hereby
commence today's

274
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,666
Garderobe Council Meeting...

275
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,916
[SERGEY]
Excuse me...

276
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,208
Before we begin,
may I say a few words?

277
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,625
[SHIHO]
So that's how it is.

278
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,833
Poor Nina.
I'm worried about her.

279
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,375
[MIYA] I'm a little glad
she got taken down a peg.

280
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,166
Yeah!

281
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,291
How awful!

282
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,291
You mustn't say
such things, Miya!

283
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,833
Nina's a good friend
and classmate, isn't she?

284
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,166
[MIYA]
Yes, Big Sister Shiho.

285
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,625
[YAYOI]
We'll be going now, Big Sister.

286
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,833
[MIYA]
Please excuse us!

287
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,000
[SHIHO]
Of course!

288
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,583
[laughing]

289
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,208
It's working; it's working!

290
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,208
It's the effect of
my family's legendary

291
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,208
"Maki-Maki Turning Trauma Doll"!

292
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,416
It serves her right for refusing
to clean my room for me!

293
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,458
Now, it's time
to finish her off!

294
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,166
Red maki-maki, blue maki-maki,
red maki-maki--

295
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,250
[ARIKA]
Excuse me?

296
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,416
Could I ask you
for some directions?

297
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,291
I'm looking for the
place for deliberations.

298
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,833
Did... did you see
what I was doing?

299
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,750
[ARIKA]
Mm-hmm.

300
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,000
Is that so...

301
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,750
[SHIHO]
By the way, who are you?

302
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,125
You're not a student of
this school, are you?

303
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,458
Uh... Well, no...
not yet, anyway.

304
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,916
But I hope to
become one soon.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,458
[SHIHO]
That's certainly a relief.

306
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,458
In that case...

307
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,458
[SHIHO] I'll try this
maki-maki on you too!

308
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,000
[ARIKA screaming]

309
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,125
[SHIHO]
Stop!

310
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,333
Did you see that?

311
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,458
What was it?

312
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,291
Why me?!

313
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,375
Stop!

314
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,458
[SHIHO]
Come back here!

315
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,625
[JEANNE]
Big Sister Shiho?!

316
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,208
Oh! Oh, it's terrible!

317
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,041
There's an intruder on campus!

318
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,375
[SHIHO]
Could you help me catch her?

319
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,791
Yes, Big Sister!

320
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,083
[STUDENT 2D]
An intruder?

Is it a peeping tom?

All right,
let me explain that.

00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,666
Did you hear?
She got into the building!

343

Do you mean that intruder girl?

You gotta be kidding!

It would be so cool
if it turned out

like the monster
incident yesterday!

Don't say that, Irina!

All right, girls,
please calm down.

Everything will be fine.

350
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,750
I'm sure that under the
gracious guidance of Our Lady,

351
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,125
the intruder will
soon be brought to--

Ah... oh, excuse me.

The appearance of a Slave,

the unauthorized engagement
of a dance-battle

by Meister Shizuru,

361
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,583
and the destruction
of Fuka Palace.

362
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,166
I would like to hear
an explanation directly

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,458
from the individuals involved,

[COUNCIL REPS chattering]

366
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,250
The topic of today's meeting
is related to these incidents.

367
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,958
Sitting there is Nina,
a student at our academy.

368
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,541
She is one of the girls
involved in yesterday's events.

369
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,500
Another participant
is a girl named Arika,

370
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,458
who wishes to
enroll in the Academy.

371
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,791
Although it's an
exceptional case,

372
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,875
as Headmistress,
I hereby grant my approval

373
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,166
to the enrollment
of Arika Yumemiya.

374
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,458
[ARIKA] Aw, why did things
end up like this?

375
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,750
What's going on here?
Who are you?

376
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,375
[ARIKA] Excuse me,
but I'm looking for the place

377
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,916
where they have deliberations!

378
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,666
Deliberations, huh?

379
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,000
You'd want the conference hall.

380
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,333
That's gotta be it!

381
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,666
Please tell me where it is!

Hi there, spiral-head.

[SHIHO]
Don't call me spiral-head!

Then don't call me Juliet.

We're looking for an intruder.

No, I didn't.

Thanks.

for the conference hall,

You know how many girls
there are every year

who apply to this school
and are rejected.

You know how bitterly they cry.

You cannot accept this girl
based purely on your own whim!

410
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,666
[NATSUKI]
I can make this guarantee.

411
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,125
This girl, Arika,

412
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,708
has the potential to become
a truly outstanding Otome.

413
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,250
And the same applies to Nina.

[NATSUKI]
For this reason,

415
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,333
in the matter concerning Nina,

416
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,208
I have no intention
of punishing her.

417
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,375
I understand her actions
during this incident

418
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,416
were all in an attempt to
protect Princess Mashiro.

I see.

420

[MASHIRO]
I disagree!

Neither that girl Nina
nor that rude idiot Arika

00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,458
have any qualities necessary
to become an Otome!

is this stupid place?

You're not getting away!

That's it!

[SAKOMIZU]
P-Princess...

433
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,625
Even Princess Mashiro
cannot go against the will--

434
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,583
[REP 2A] Actually,
Princess Mashiro is correct.

435
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,791
It appears so.

436
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,583
Considering the powers
of the Otome

437
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,583
and the responsibilities
of the position,

You are Nina's foster father.

something, or what?

[SERGEY]
Your Highness!

We weren't expecting
you until tomorrow!

466

here as soon as possible

to see my dear
little Mashiro.

468

[MASHIRO] Well I certainly
don't want to see you!

Aww, you're as cold
and cruel as ever, I see.

Excuse us, Your Highness,

but we're in the
middle of deliberations.

00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,458
[NAGI] I've already been
briefed about everything.

473

This girl here is the one
who wants to become

00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,791
an Otome, right?

Hmm...
What's the problem?

00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,875
Let her join.

Y-Your Highness!

Even if you are the

that does not give you
the authority to make

481
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,625
such decisions alone!

482
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,125
And if I may add,

483
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,916
we are also questioning the
guilt and possible expulsion

484
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,041
of Nina Wong, an Otome
candidate from your nation.

485
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,291
You therefore have a direct
interest in the outcome

486
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,208
and should refrain from
making further comments.

487
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,250
[NAGI]
Hmm...

488
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,250
Hey, tell me something.

489
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,208
Are you willing to do anything
in order to become an Otome?

490
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,416
[ARIKA]
Oh! Yes!

491
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,583
Then how's this for a solution?

492
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,875
As entertainment for dear
Mashiro's coronation ceremony,

493
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,083
why not have Nina and this girl
engage in a dance-battle?

494
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,916
The winner stays at the academy.

495
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,583
The loser leaves!

496
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,750
Not a bad idea, huh?

497
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,458
[NATSUKI]
But Your Highness, that's...

498
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,708
A dance-battle?

499
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,625
[NINA] I will participate
in this challenge.

500
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,666
I beg the council...

501
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,041
Allow me the chance to
fight against this girl!

502
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,291
[ARIKA]
What a surprise!

503
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,125
I didn't know Mashiro
was a princess!

504
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,333
[MASHIRO]
Overwhelmed, are you?

505
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,791
[ARIKA]
Yep!

506
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,000
'Cause I thought you were
a boy when I first met you!

507
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,500
[MASHIRO] What are you
saying? I'm a girl!

508
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,041
[ARIKA]
Well let me check!

509
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,458
[MASHIRO]
Stop that!

510
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,708
[ARIKA] You're right!
Nothing there, top or bottom!
