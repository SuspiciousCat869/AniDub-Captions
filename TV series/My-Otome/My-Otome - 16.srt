That's enough!

00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,333
The winner is Arika Yumemiya.

5
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,875
All right!

[ERSTIN, IRINA laughing]

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,416
[YUKARIKO] Arika, Nina,
congratulations to you both.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,916
You two will be the
representatives of the class.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,625
This year, the ceremonial
graduation dance-battle

10
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,958
will be held at the same
time as the inauguration

11
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,625
of the new Fuka Palace.

12
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,625
And so, there will be many
distinguished guests attending.

13
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:52,833
You must both take heart

14
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,291
not to shame the good
name of Garderobe.

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,333
[BOTH]
Yes, ma'am!

[STUDENTS cheering]

17
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,333
[ERSTIN]
Congratulations, Arika!

18
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,041
[ARIKA]
I did it, Ersty! I did it!

19
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,875
[MARIA]
Tomoe Marguerite.

20
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,583
As the runner-up, you will be
the substitute for those two.

21
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,041
Even though you lost,

22
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,291
I trust you will be sure to
keep up on your training.

23
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,833
[TOMOE] Yes, of course.
I understand, Miss Maria.

24
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,166
[ARIKA]
I did it, Sir!

25
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,875
[SERGEY] Is that so?
Antsy made it after all.

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,916
[NINA]
Huh?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,750
[SERGEY]
Anyway, good job, Nina- <i>chan</i> .

28
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,541
As always, I'm proud to
call you my daughter.

29
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,291
But the ceremonial dance-battle
is two against two.

30
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,666
That means I'll have to
fight together with Arika,

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,458
and when I think about
having to train with her,

32
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,541
it's hard for me
to stay confident.

33
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,083
Don't worry too much about it.

34
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,958
The two of you might actually
make a very good team.

35
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,166
Do you really think so?

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,375
But no matter what happens
in this dance-battle,

37
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,708
you must never forget.

38
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,333
You're going to be the Otome
for Grand Duke Nagi.

39
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,416
That is your destiny.

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,416
Uh, yes... Of course, Father.

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,750
That's right.

42
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,375
Trust me, it's for
your own good.

43
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,500
[YUKARIKO]
It's that time of year again.

44
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,416
Tomorrow, we'll be having
rehearsals for the celebrations.

45
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,791
And next week will be
very busy and eventful,

46
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,666
with the ceremonial
dance-battle,

47
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,250
the graduation ceremony,

48
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,083
and the Meister
ascension ceremony.

49
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,416
The examinations for class
promotions are also coming up.

50
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
So to honor Our Lady, I ask all
of you to please do your best.

51
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,375
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am!

52
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,708
Come on, Arika, let's get going.

53
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,208
[ERSTIN]
Arika, want me to help you?

54
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,791
No, it's fine.
I can do it myself.

55
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,666
Arika!

56
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,416
Oh, sorry. I'll be right there!

57
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,375
I'll bring you guys
something to eat later.

58
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:05,083
Thank you, Ersty!
I can't wait! See ya later!

59
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,250
Wow, gettin' all fired
up about it, huh?

60
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,541
Well, their opponents are

61
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,583
Big Sister Chie and
Big Sister Shiho,

62
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,375
Numbers One and Two
of the Pearl class.

63
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,333
That's why the two of
them have to practice

64
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,375
until really late every night.

65
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,541
I meant you, Ersty, not them.

66
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,333
[ERSTIN]
Hm?

67
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,208
[IRINA]
I mean, come on!

68
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,666
Not only do you bring them food,

69
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,875
but you've taken over some
of their duties too, right?

70
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,166
But that's about all
I can do to help.

71
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,041
And besides, whenever I go
to watch them practice,

72
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,750
they always make me
wanna do my best too.

73
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,750
Right on! Then if you
need anything, tell me.

74
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,291
I'll be glad to help.

75
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,875
Thank you so much, Irina!

76
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,250
Those two sure are working
pretty hard, don't you think?

77
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,375
[TOMOE]
Yes.

78
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,041
Forgive me, Big Sister Chie.

79
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,583
I have been useless
as your room helper.

80
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,166
[CHIE]
Not at all.

81
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,541
Besides, I'm not exactly what
you'd call an ideal Big Sister.

82
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,333
You're really skilled
in a lot of things,

83
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,875
and there wasn't
much to teach you,

84
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,916
so honestly, I feel
like I didn't spend

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,541
enough time with you.

86
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,625
And I apologize for that.

87
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,500
That's not true.

88
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,208
However, I think I've paid
close atention to you.

89
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,291
I've always been watching you.

90
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,625
Stop what you're doing.

91
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,291
Big Sister Shizuru
would be upset too

92
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,000
if she found out how you
made Miya do those things.

93
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,125
I'm sorry, Big Sister,

94
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,875
but I have no idea what
you're talking about.

95
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,333
Really?

96
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,583
[ARIKA]
Mmm!

97
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,125
It's so good!

98
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,458
Thank you for everything
you've done, Ersty.

99
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,791
Um... you guys?

100
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm gonna do my best!

101
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,500
I've got to, with Ersty
cheering us on!

102
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,875
Then you don't mind
if we increase

103
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,500
our training time, do you?

104
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,541
[ARIKA yelps]

105
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,000
Just kidding!

106
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,666
Sorry about that, Ersty.

107
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,500
What was it you were
trying to say earlier?

108
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,166
Oh... it was nothing.

109
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,166
[NINA]
I see. Well, okay then.

110
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,583
Ugh! Hey, Arika! That was mine!

111
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,125
[ARIKA]
First come, first serve!

112
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,291
[NINA]
What the--? Agh! Why you!

113
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,125
[NAGI]
So that's the whole story.

114
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,333
I'm hoping you guys
can lend us your power.

115
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,708
We refuse.

116
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,083
[RAD] We hear that you
are working with

117
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,666
those despicable cowards
from the Schwartz.

118
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,416
Therefore, we cannot help you.

119
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
Aw, and here I thought you
were supposed to be partners

120
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,333
with them at one time.

121
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,916
If you don't mind me asking,
why the messy split?

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,958
[RAD]
That is none of your business.

123
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,583
I guess there's no hope, then.

124
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,375
I'll just have to
give up on you guys.

125
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,333
[RAD]
It was a trap.

126
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,333
He knew that we would refuse
to help with his little scheme.

127
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,500
But at the same time,
we can't just sit and watch.

128
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,458
We'll have to make a move too.

129
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,375
[RAD] So you're willing to
stick your hand in the fire?

130
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,791
[MIDORI]
Yes.

131
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,000
I can't afford to keep our
people waiting any longer.

132
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,875
[sighs]

133
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,708
How is Our Lady?
Is she doing well?

134
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,291
Yes.

135
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,875
Preparations are complete for
the Five Pillars Examination.

136
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,125
The production of the new Gems

137
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,916
for next year's Pearl
and Coral classes

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,625
is coming along well too.

139
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,916
Also, since Miya has
withdrawn from the school,

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,416
I've dissolved her Gem in
special amniotic fluid.

141
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,125
We'll be re-crystallizing
it later.

142
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,208
[NATSUKI]
I see.

143
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,208
By the way, how is
Shizuru doing?

144
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,375
She should be coming
back soon, right?

145
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,958
We ran out of time.

146
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,500
In the end, she wasn't able to
find Smith, let alone catch him.

147
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,750
But the graduation
ceremonies are approaching,

148
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,416
and on top of that, we have to
plan a new course of action

149
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
to deal with these
new types of Slaves.

150
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,750
But fortunately,

151
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,375
even though things are
still tense right now,

152
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,541
the situation hasn't
changed all that much.

153
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,708
Now that Fuka Palace
is almost rebuilt,

154
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,750
Queen Mashiro is finally
acting like a real Queen.

155
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,625
If she can continue
to motivate herself,

156
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,833
I'm sure the civilians will have
respect for her once again.

157
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,625
[YOHKO] Let's hope things
will stay like this,

158
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,166
without incident.

159
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,000
[NATSUKI]
Mh-hm.

160
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,416
[MARIA]
In the presence of Our Lady,

161
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,000
we shall now begin the
Examination of the Five Pillars.

162
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,041
[NAO]
Hm.

163
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,541
Oh my gosh, big news!

164
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:50,333
Big Sister Nao has been chosen
as one of the Five Pillars!

165
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,541
Is she replacing the
vacant Fourth Pillar?

166
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,333
[YAYOI]
Mh-hm!

167
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,625
And not only that,

168
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,833
Big Sister Shiho has been
chosen as the Otome

169
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,666
for King Charles of Florince!

170
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,666
Oh, really? I guess
Cardair backed off!

171
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,458
Probably because of
the whole incident

172
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,791
between Big Sister
Akane and Kazuya.

173
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,625
[YAYOI] Becoming the Otome
for a former enemy country?

174
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,083
It's so dramatic!

175
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,500
Seems more like a
shrewd political deal.

176
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,458
[YAYOI] But since they were
so interested in her,

177
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,166
Big Sister was like
really happy!

178
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,125
Well, I guess as long as
she's happy, that's good.

179
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,083
Oh! What about Big Sister Chie?

180
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,500
Is she gonna be serving
her homeland Aries?

181
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,208
Yeah, although she
is whining about

182
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,583
having to serve under
Brigadier Armitage.

183
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,083
Wow, I'm so envious
of our Big Sisters.

184
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,708
All of them have been
offered positions to serve.

185
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,083
Oh, one more thing!

186
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,791
I heard that Big Sister Shizuru
is coming back soon!

187
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,833
[TOMOE]
Huh?

188
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,541
[LILIE]
Isn't that great, Arika?

189
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,833
She'll be here to see you

190
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,708
when you take center
stage in the dance-battle!

191
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,041
[ARIKA]
Uh-huh!

192
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,958
Now, us normal people
still have an exam to take

193
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,875
so we better'd stop the chatter
and get back to studying.

194
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,125
Irina, I'm having
trouble understanding

195
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,875
parts of molecular biology.

196
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,125
I'm sorry, but right
now I have to run.

197
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,333
I've gotta return this
book to Professor Yohko.

198
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,416
Why don't I return
it for you, Irina?

199
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
I have something I need
to ask her anyway.

200
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,541
[IRINA]
Okay, sure! I'd appreciate that.

201
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,291
Hey, Big Sister Nao!

202
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,208
We heard you were
selected as a Pillar.

203
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,000
Congratulations,
you must be proud.

204
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,041
[NAO]
Proud of what?

205
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,166
But this is fantastic
news, isn't it?

206
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,125
It's screwed up my life plans!

207
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,791
They want me to join the
Old Ladies' Military Club?

208
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,833
Like I even care about Our Lady,
or whatever they call her.

209
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:30,666
[MARIA clears throat]

210
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,416
[NAO whimpers]

211
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Uh, please excuse us.
We have to be going.

212
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,958
Big Sister Nao! Take care!

213
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,083
[YOHKO] Erstin! Do you
know where Irina is?

214
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,541
There's something I have
to tell her right away.

215
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,666
[ERSTIN] Um, I'm pretty
sure you can find her

216
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,583
in the library right now.

217
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,041
[YOHKO]
Thank you.

218
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,916
[ERSTIN] Excuse me, Professor,
but is something wrong?

219
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,875
[YOHKO] That fluid is
extremely dangerous.

220
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,500
If you accidentally
get it on yourself,

221
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,750
it can cause terrible burns.

222
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,708
[TOMOE] I have something
I need to ask her anyway.

223
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,666
Hye, practice felt
pretty good today.

224
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,166
It was all right.

But how did this happen?

Ersty.

237
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,500

I'm still not sure how or why

something like this happened.

240

But Ersty's burns
weren't that serious,

241

so that's something
to be thankful for.

242

Professor Yohko said that if it
had splashed directly on her,

her injuries would've
been a lot worse."

out for a little walk?

Are you really okay?

00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,041
Yes.

249
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,666
Thanks to my nanomachines and
because I got help so quickly,

250
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,208
I should fully heal before
the promotion exam.

[ARIKA]
That's good.

The nanomachines
sure are powerful.

I've been thinking about it.

You know, something this helpful

should be shared with everyone,
not just Otomes.

00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,875
Wave the handkerchief
during the dance-battle,

316
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,583
and I promise I'll see you.

317
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,958
After that, please
allow me to meet you.

318
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,833
I wanna say thanks in person.

319
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,541
It's the least I can do after
all you've done for me.

320
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,875
To my dear Sir. From Arika."

321
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,666
The day's finally come.

322
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,208
I'm so relieved we're able

323
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,583
to welcome this day with
such beautiful weather.

324
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,083
I think it's a good sign.

325
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,125
[NATSUKI] I want to thank
all of you for your assistance.

326
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:21,000
Miss Maria, Miss Yukariko,
and of course, you too, Shizuru.

327
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:21,916
[SHIZURU]
Hm.

328
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,916
However, it is a
bit of a shame.

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,916
It seems that this year
most of the nations

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,375
have sent representatives rather
than members of royalty.

331
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,166
Well, that can't be helped,

332
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,333
considering the world's
in such disarray.

333
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,875
It doesn't bother me.

334
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,666
At least this way, we'll have
fewer things to worry about.

335
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,750
[PEOPLE cheering]

336
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,041
Remember, to this day, no Coral
has ever beaten a Pearl.

337
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,041
So just think of this as
a simple test of skill,

338
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,291
and take it easy.

339
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,125
I will definitely win!
For your sake, Father.

340
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,416
Ha. Okay. I understand,
Nina- <i>chan</i> .

341
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,541
[ARIKA]
Huh?

342
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,166
[SERGEY]
Oh, hey, Antsy.

343
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,916
What are you doing here?

344
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,666
[SERGEY] I received an
invitation asking me

345
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,958
to come observe
this dance-battle.

346
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,500
[ARIKA]
Hmph.

347
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,083
Well, just be sure to try hard
to not be a burden for Nina.

348
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,666
Stop mocking me!

349
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,166
I'm definitely gonna
become a Meister Otome!

350
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,000
My patron will be watching too,
so I'm fighting for him!

351
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,000
I see. You're probably right.

352
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:25,000
This "patron" of yours,
he must be watching over you.

353
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,041
Uh, Father?

354
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,291
[NATSUKI]
I expect a dance-battle worthy

355
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,500
of this year's graduation,
so please try your hardest.

356
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,833
[ARIKA, NINA, SHIHO, CHIE]
Yes!

357
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,416
I am gonna be reborn
along with this new castle.

358
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,875
Hey, and don't forget,
Arika, it's a race.

359
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,125
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm.

360
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,916
Nina, good luck to you too.

361
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,750
Even though it was
only for a short time,

362
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,500
you were my first contract.

363
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,750
Do your best.

364
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:56,416
[NINA]
Yes!

367
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,750
[NATSUKI] Now, as part of this
year's Garderobe graduation,

368
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,750
we'll begin the
ceremonial dance-battle.

369
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,250
What are you doing?
Calm down and focus.

370
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,875
I'll take this chance
to do my maki-makis!

371
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,833
Red maki-maki, blue maki-maki--

372
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,416
Stop that.

373
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,541
Go for it!

374
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,250
Do your best!

375
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,291
Ugh. Who really cares what
happens here? I sure don't.

376
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,291
[MASHIRO]
My fellow citizens!

377
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,166
Before we begin
the dance-battle,

378
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,916
I would like to unveil my
restored castle for you,

379
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,916
the brand new Fuka Palace.

380
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,708
[applause]

381
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,500
[MASHIRO] I now wish
to make a declaration!

382
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,000
With this castle,

383
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,875
we will usher in a new and
brighter era for our country!

384
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,250
[MASHIRO]
Huh?!

385
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,833
[PEOPLE chattering]

386
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,083
Huh? That's nothing like the
castle in Mashiro's drawing.

387
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,625
What horrible taste.

388
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,333
[MASHIRO] Wh-What is that?!
I never authorized that design!

389
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,666
N-No! I never--
This isn't my castle!

390
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,541
It's moving. What is that thing?

391
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,916
My castle's supposed to be...

392
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,083
Now, let's get started.

393
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,708
No way!

394
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,375
And fire.

Things are looking bad.
