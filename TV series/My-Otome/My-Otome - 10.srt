[ERSTIN panting]

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,416
Hang in there. I'm gonna
go call for help.

3
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,291
Based on where they
were yesterday evening,

4
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,750
they can't have gotten very far.

5
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:39,791
This is all very worrying
about Erstin and Arika.

6
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:44,583
Uh, I'm not worried at
all about that girl. No way.

7
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,333
Arika...

8
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,791
I see. So Arika is...?

9
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,708
Yes. But I doubt it's anything
to be concerned about.

10
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,958
In any case, she'll pop up
pretty soon, knowing that Antsy.

11
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,625
[NAGI]
Huh.

12
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:02,083
Well then, let's hope she's
lost and nothing more.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,791
If you're worried, Sergey,

14
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,041
you can always go and
join the search, you know.

15
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,125
Yes, but...

16
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,625
To tell the truth...

17
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,916
[chuckles]

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,416
I want you to go out there
and search for her,

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,541
because there's something
else I'd like you to check on.

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,750
So there are ruins from the time

21
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,375
of the War of the
Twelve Kings here.

22
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,625
Huh?

23
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,041
[LUMEN]
Farewell, my cute little girl.

24
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,666
I'll pray that you
find happiness

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,875
in the world of the stars!

Antsy!

[LUMEN]
Oh, now what?

29
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,291
[LUMEN]
My goodness, how bothersome.

30
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,416
Come out, come out,
my dear little Kedos.

31
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,958
A Slave! Is it Schwartz?
No, it's Aswad!

32
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,000
[LUMEN]
Farewell and take care.

33
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,916
I hope you can find happiness
in the world of the stars too.

[laughing]

35
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,458
We'll set up camp here today.

36
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,500
[TOMOE]
Big Sister Chie!

37
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,916
I'm here to retrieve you.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,833
The survival test
has been cancelled.

39
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,166
[NINA]
What?

40
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,791
Arika's team was lost,
and the trace disappeared.

41
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,041
Luckily, we found Erstin
just a few minutes ago.

42
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,916
She's all right now,

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,125
but I'm afraid that
Arika is still missing.

44
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,083
She's missing?

45
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,708
How awful!

46
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
[CHIE] Right now there's a
search party looking for her,

47
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,250
and we're also picking up
the other students too.

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,500
Now listen, and stay calm.

49
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,583
Your father, Major Wang,
was helping us with the search,

50
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,083
but we've lost contact
with him as well.

51
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,583
[SERGEY groans]

52
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,791
Hey, Antsy.

53
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,958
Wake up!

54
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,708
[SERGEY]
Huh?

55
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,916
[RAD] A student from
Garderobe Academy?

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,958
[LUMEN]
That's right.

57
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,666
[LUMEN]
And there was also one boat,

58
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,166
which I believe was
searching for her.

59
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,750
We must hurry.

60
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,500

61
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,375

64
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,083
I'm glad that you were able
to bring her back, Chie.

65
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,500
She's smart enough to
understand the situation.

66
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,125
But I think she's
resisting the urge

67
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,083
to run out there
and look for them.

68
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,250
[MASHIRO]
You guys!

69
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,291
[BOTH]
Huh?

70
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,708
What are you waiting
around here for?

71
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,666
Hurry up and find Arika!

72
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,291
That means you too!

73
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,041
Hurry up and go!

74
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:21,291
You really must be worrying
about Arika, Your Majesty.

75
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,625
No way, I hate that girl!

76
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,666
[MASHIRO] But there'd be trouble
if something happened to her.

77
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,833
[IRINA] Professor Yohko, how's
Erstin doing? Is she okay?

78
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,333
She'll be fine.
There's no need to worry.

79
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,791
Thank goodness.

80
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,291
Yes, I'm so glad she's okay.

81
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,250
Now let's just hope
that Arika is all right.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,791
Is that true?

83
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,041
Yes.

84
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,958
If the antibodies in the
injector gun were used,

85
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,791
the antigens would've
disintegrated.

86
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,333
[NATSUKI] But surely those two
would've already tried that.

87
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,791
They did. But somehow,
it was ineffective.

88
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,750
[NATSUKI]
Hmm..

00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,041
We are detecting a high
materialization reaction,

92
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,833
and it's not from
an Otome's Robe.

93
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,541
It's from where we lost
contact with Major Wang.

00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,833

95

You're not leaving.

Let me go!

00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,500
My father! He's out there!

98
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,541
I understand how
painful this is.

99
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,583
But for right now, all you
can do is be patient.

100
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,000
Do not worry.

101
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,583
I assure you that we will
find them, no matter what.

Damn, it's starting
to get really cold.

104
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,125
But starting a fire would
reveal our location to them.

105

Damn it!

111
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,833
What am I thinking?

112
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,583
I mean, this girl is the
exact same age as Nina.

113
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,000
So why...?

114
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,250
That's right.

115
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,291
Her body is still so
frail... and delicate...

116
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,375
This frail... and
delicate body...

117
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,125
I finally found my dream.

118
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,666
So I'll keep chasing after it,
no matter what.

[DYNE grunting]

120
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,000
They was a cyborg?

121
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,833
And near the shoreline, we also
found wreckage from the boat.

122
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,458
Along with this.

123
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,291
That little idiot!

124
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,750
Hey, what were
those ruins anyway?

125
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,291
It's a research facility,

126
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,875
probably built by the people
of the early Immigration Era.

127
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,708
[HARUKA] The place was
investigated years ago,

128
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,250
but nobody found anything.

129
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,958
So why is someone so interested
in it now, all of a sudden?

130
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,666
Whatever!

131
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,000
The important thing is we
hurry up and find them!

Huh?

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,125
Thank you for giving us
such a good report.

135
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,458
But Aries will take
care of things now.

136
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,416

to send our troops in.

Come on! Why aren't
you taking action?

Please allow me to go too!

140

If it were only a simple search
mission, it wouldn't matter,

141
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,250
but Garderobe cannot interfere
with matters of another nation

without consent from the

But I...

144
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,250
However, in a case like this,

145
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,583
an emergency resolution
may be made

146

164
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,333
[SERGEY]
Wait, Antsy!

165
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,750
Could you cover up your poor
excuse for a chest? Please?!

166
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,875
[ARIKA screaming]

167
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,416
Well, there you have it.

168
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,166
Hey, look, I understand
how you feel,

169
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,375
but could you go
a bit easy on me?

170
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,583
[gasps]

171
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,416
Sorry!

172
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,625
Are you all right?

173
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,416
Look, first of all,
put on your clothes.

174
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,416
Once that's done, I'll explain
everything to you properly.

175
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,208
And stop worrying.

176
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,666
I didn't do anything to you,
if that's what you're thinking.

177
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,333
[RAD]
Not yet, Gal?

178
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,875
[GAL]
You sure are impatient, Rad.

179
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,416
It's all smooth sailing
with me at the wheel,

180
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,333
so don't worry about it!

181
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,375
[SERGEY]
So you went off all by yourself?

182
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,708
I know you like to overdo
things, but that wasn't smart!

183
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,083
[ARIKA] But Ersty was in
trouble, so I had to go!

184
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,625
I wonder how she's
doing right now.

185
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,291
[SERGEY] I'm sure that the
others have found her by now.

186
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,541
In any case, you and I
should hurry back quickly.

187
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,791
Before that, I should
say thank you, Mr. Wang.

188
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,250
Please just call me
Sergey, all right?

189
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,500
[ARIKA gasps]

190
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,083
Just because
you saw me naked

191
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,500
doesn't mean I'm
gonna be friendly!

192
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,250
You don't have any reason to
start feeling self-conscious.

193
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,125
You're ten years away
from that, little Antsy.

194
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,333
Let's get going.

195
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,666
Oh, you--!

196
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,208
[GAL]
Easy as pie.

197
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,791
[ARIKA]
So that's why,

198
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,541
in order to live up
to his expectations,

199
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,166
I'm gonna become a great Otome!

200
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,416
[SERGEY]
Huh, whoever he is,

201
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,458
he certainly has some
unusual ideas!

202
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,958
[ARIKA]
Oh, I agree.

203
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:45,583
Hey!

204
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,916
[SERGEY chuckles]

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,291
I envy you, the way you're
having fun all the time.

206
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:53,458
Yep! Why? Are you saying
that you don't have fun?

207
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,250
Well, I can't exactly
have fun all the time.

208
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,416
[ARIKA]
But that's because you wanted

209
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,125
to be a military guy, right?

210
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,500
Huh?

211
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,166
It turns out that reality

212
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,541
is often very different
from the ideal.

213
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,708
[ARIKA]
Hm?

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,791
[ARIKA]
What are you doing?

215
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:11,875
[SERGEY]
Shh.

216
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,750
[gasps]

217
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,583
Hey, uh... who are those people?

218
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,000
They're Aswad.

219
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,875
They have no allegiance
with any country,

220
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,000
and they wander
around aimlessly.

221
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,416
They're a group that
believes strongly

222
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,166
in the technology
from the Earth Era,

223
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,208
before the time of Immigration.

224
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,666
What is that?

225
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:40,875
What the--?

226
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:41,875
[ALL]
Huh?

227
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,750
[gasps]

228
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,000
[RAD]
Commander.

229
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:45,750
Kill them.

230
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:46,458
[DYNE]
Right on!

231
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,791
[GAL]
Yes, ma'am!

232
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,791
[LUMEN]
Oh? What's this?

233
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:58,083
The cute little girl is still
alive. Aren't you lucky?

234
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,750
[HARUKA]
Stop it right there!

235
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,791
[HARUKA] People like you
will never damage

236
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,375
my beautiful land of Aries!

237
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,416
I won't allow it!

238
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,875
Materialize!

239
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,625
I haven't given you
authorization yet, Haruka!

240
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,875
What?!

241
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,125
[RAD]
Huh. Finish them off now.

242
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:26,875
[GAL]
Yeah!

243
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,083
[yells]

244

[ARIKA]
Big Sister Shizuru! Nina!

245
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,916
You're safe, Father!

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,708
[SERGEY groans]

247
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,916
Are you all right, Sergey?

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
[SERGEY]
Yeah, I'm fine.

249
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,125
Thanks for saving me, Nina.

250
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,833
I think that's
more than enough.

251
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,166
[RAD]
Natsuki Kruger.

252
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,166
Members of Aswad, what are
you intending to accomplish

253
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,416
by sneaking into this place?

254
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,125
[MIDORI]
Garderobe.

255
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,250
The place that keeps science
and technology hidden.

256
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,208
And by doing so causes
disorder in the world.

257
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,791
Hm.

258
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,416
Do you really think people of
your level can hope to stop us?

259
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,541
[HARUKA]
Shut your mouth!

260
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll show you how
we treat criminals!

261
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,833
Are you all right, Haruka dear?

262
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,666
What did I say about
calling me "dear" in public?

263
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,041
Hurry and authorize me!

264
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,041
Hear me, Haruka Armitage,

Continental Orb Topaz.

Otome, in my name, I hereby
release your powers.

267
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,833
One more time!

Materialize!

269
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,916
Hey you, criminals!

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,291
Get ready!

271
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,833

She blocked it with
her bare hand.

275
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,416
For the sake of our
desires and goals,

276
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,958
you must die, Otomes!

277

The Schwartz will
be keeping this,

00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,791
but thank you for all
your help, Miss Midori.

It's Smith!

That bastard! After him!

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,916
You're my opponent,
so stand and fight!

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I bid you, come out,
Steel Fang! Gakuten-oh!

286

Gakuten-oh?

287
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,625
If you do not fear the combined
power of Gakuten-oh and myself,

288
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,041
then come attack us!

00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,625

It's nothing but a single Slave!

292
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,458
You're so naïve!

293
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,583
Haruka!

294
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,791
[yells]

295
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, wow.

296
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,416
You sure can fight.
Who would've guessed?

297
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,875
[MIDORI]
Huh.

298
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,541
You have so much power, and
yet you choose to waste it

299
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,500
by protecting this
twisted world.

300
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,333
Why?

301
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,041
I should think it's obvious.

302
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,583
I fight for the person
most important to me.

303
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,750
Well then, you can show
your devotion by dying.

304
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,125
Gakuten-oh, charge!

What? This is as far as I get?

307
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,916
We will settle this...
at another time.

308
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Very well. I'm gonna
getcha next time!

309
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:48,916
[YOHKO]
Huh?

310
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,375
Midori!

311
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,375
That was incredible.

312
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,875
Uh-huh.

"So in the end,

the field trip survival
test had to be retaken.

00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,708
Although everyone was
complaining about it,

316
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,708
I felt a little relieved."

please keep watching
over me, Sir!"

00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,708
we'll be returning to
our nation as scheduled.

325
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,791
Especially since those
people back home

326
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,000
are going to start moving
"secretly" again.

327
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,166
[SERGEY]
Yes, sir.

328
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,500
Honestly, we're
surrounded by such fools.

329
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,125
I've had it with my brothers'
wives and their brats.

330
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,208
You know, looking
back in hindsight,

331
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,583
I should've had you
get rid of them all.

332
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,875
Your Highness.

333
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,833
May I ask what it is
exactly  you're planning?

334
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,500
Is this about the Schwartz?

335
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,708
[SERGEY]
Yes.

336
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,166
What do you think?

337
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,041
[chuckles]

338
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,416
Of course, you have some things

339
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,958
that you've been hiding
from me too, right?

340
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,458
I'm sure one thing is clear...

341
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,291
You'd better not think
of betraying me.

342
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,458
Yes.

343
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,375
[NATSUKI] How cunning.
Only you can use Gakuten-oh.


344
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,666
[MIDORI] What are you saying?
You have one too.


345
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,333
[SHIZURU barks]


346
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,541
[NATSUKI]
Shizuru?


347
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,166
[SHIZURU]
I'm Duran! Ha! Licky, licky...


348
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,375
[NATSUKI] Hey, stop! Watch where
you're licking, Shizuru!


349
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,375
[MIDORI]
One must be cautious


350
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,291
of the Bewitching
Smile Amethyst.
