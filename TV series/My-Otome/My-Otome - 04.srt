00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:26,750
Queen Mashiro!

[CROWD screams]

00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,875
Everyone! Run! Go!

[ARIKA grunting]

5
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,708
Wow!

6
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,250
No way!

7
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,625
[YAYOI]
Amazing...

8
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,583
Get out of here! Hurry!

9
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,208

[ARIKA screams]

13
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,333
[HARUKA]
Hey, Coral!

14
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,208
Great job holding on so long!

15
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,791
Isn't she from Aries?

16
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,166
Continental Orb Topaz!

17
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,166
You got a tight
future ahead of you.

18
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,000
Haruka, I think you
mean "bright future."

19
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,500
All right, Coral, listen up.

20
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,583
An Otome needs three things.

21
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:56,125
Strength, skill, and guts!

22
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,333
They're not done?

23
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,833
Hurry up!

24
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,750
Please, Arika, try
and calm down.

25
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,708
But I don't know
what's gonna happen!

26
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,750
So how am I supposed to
be calm at a time like this?

27
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,333
It's not possible!

28
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,000
The council has
made its decision.

29
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,208
Please come in.

30
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,875
Well, then, it's time.

31
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,208
I shall now announce
the council's verdict.

32
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:29,000
Before you do so,
I have a favor to ask.

33
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,208
[SERGEY]
Huh?

34
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,083
[NATSUKI]
Go ahead. What is it?

35
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,000
[NINA] I would like the
opportunity to face this girl

36
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,500
in a dance-battle again.

37
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,708
I want to have
a decisive result.

38
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,958
That is something
I cannot allow.

39
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,583
Besides, if it
still matters to you,

40
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,916
you will have many chances
for a rematch in the future.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,958
Rematch? You mean...?

42
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,208
First, Nina Wong.

43
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,125
We have deemed you the
winner of the dance-battle.

44
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,333
All charges against you
have been dropped.

45
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,375
As for you, Arika Yumemiya,

46
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
due to your efforts
to prevent casualties

47
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,625
and your display
of skill and potential,

48
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,333
this committee has decided
to grant your special request.

49
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,791
Uh... So that means...?

50
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,250
We accept your enrollment.

51
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,666
[ARIKA]
Thank you very much!

52
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,166
[ARIKA]
I'm really, truly grateful!

53
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,375
Thank you so much!

54
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,583
If you want to thank someone,

55
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,375
you should really
thank those two.

56
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,000
The others were
stubborn, like Princess--

57
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,583
No, Queen Mashiro, I should say.

58
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,125
The one who helped
convince them

59
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,125
is the President
of Aries Republic.

60
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,916
Her Excellency, Yukino Chrysant.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,083
Well, it was Meister
Haruka who told me

62
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,000
that you have the makings
of an excellent Otome.

63
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,916
All I did was report
that to everyone else!

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,958
[HARUKA]
Hmm...

65
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,791
Oh! What the...?!
What are you...?!

66
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,208
[screams]

67
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,416
[HARUKA] Looks like she'll
need a lot more training.

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
This is the President
Yukino's Otome,

69
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:07,333
Meister Haruka Armitage,
the Continental Orb Topaz.

70
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,416
You make sure you learn
everything you can

71
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,416
at this academy!
You've got a lot of potential.

72
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,666
I know, because I say so,
and I'm never wrong.

73
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,625
[ARIKA]
Right!

74
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
Please do your best!

75
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,625
We shall be taking
our leave now.

76
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,000
[NATSUKI] Thank you for your
assistance, Your Excellency.

77
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,291
And your help was
appreciated too, Haruka.

78
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,291
I wasn't doing it for
you or the headmistress.

79
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,125
To become an Otome,
you need energy!

80
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,000
And I sense a lot
of it in this girl.

81
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,791
Well, you certainly
haven't changed!

82
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,125
You and I still
have a battle to fight!

83
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,875
You'd better get practicing
if you hope to beat me!

84
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,125
[SERGEY] Well, I'm
pleased with the decision.

85
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,000
[NINA]
Yes.

86
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,708
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

87
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,625
Not at all; in fact,
it was rather fun!

88
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,041
Work hard and become
a great Otome!

89
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,291
Well, it seems that
things have ended up

90
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,500
exactly how the
headmistress had hoped.

91
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,041
I don't see a problem.

92
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,000
For the time being.

93
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,166
After all, we didn't
lose anything.

94
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,666
Or are you beginning
to have a few doubts

95
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,333
about that girl, Arika?

96
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,666
No, sir.

97
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,541
I don't have any doubts.

98
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,333
[NAGI]
Hmph.

99
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,250
Well, whatever.

100
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:37,041
But she certainly is a
very interesting girl!

101
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,500
It seems that every
time I leave our country,

102
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,416
I run into all sorts
of interesting things.

103
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,583
Like the worshippers
of the Black Valley.

104
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,958
So I'm thinking

105
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,666
it will be a little while longer
before I go back home to Artai.

106
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,708
[SERGEY]
Huh?

107
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,208
[MASHIRO]
Damn that President of Aries!

108
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,208
She puts on an honest
and quiet face,

109
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,958
but she ends up manipulating
everyone with pretty words!

110
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,000
I hate people like that!

111
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,708
I am supposed to be
the queen of this country!

112
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,375
But my castle is still
in that wretched state,

113
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,083
and nothing is going
the way I want it to!

114
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,291
Miss Mashiro?

115
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,291
What is it?

116
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,583
I'm sorry to rush you,

117
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,416
but you must go over
these documents

118
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
submitted for your approval.

119
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,833
You see,

120
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,333
the various ministries
can't continue their work

121
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,583
without them.

122
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,625
That uniform is proof of
being a student of Garderobe.

123
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,083
Keep that in mind,
and wear it with great care.

124
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,250
[ARIKA]
Yes!

125
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,583
Arika Yumemiya,
you are about to become

126
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,458
a student at this academy.

127
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,250
But first, there are some things
you must be informed of.

128
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,666
All Otome must abide
by certain regulations

129
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,541
as well as observe
several restrictions.

130
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,958
One of them is that
you must always abstain

131
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,916
from any relationships with men.

132
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,625
The nanomachines are the
source of an Otome's power,

133
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,750
but they are vulnerable
to Y-chromosomes

134
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,541
and a type of serine protease

135
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,583
called prostate
specific antigen,

136
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,125
both found in males.

137
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,333
If you get either of
them into your system,

138
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,166
your nanomachines will dissolve,

139
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,791
and your body will build
complete immunity against them.

140
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,500
You would never possess
the power of Otome again.

141
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,708
In other words,

142
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,833
if you fall in love with
a man and marry him...

143
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:36,083
Or... do a few certain
other things with him,

144
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,458
you will lose the power
of the Otome.

145
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,708
You must remember this.

146
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,791
Oh.

147
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,666
[NATSUKI]
There is one other thing.

148
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,208
If you become a Meister Otome,

149
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,333
that is, become
a full-fledged Otome

150
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,000
who serves a master,

151
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,958
you must remain by
your master's side

152
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,875
and share your life force
with theirs through your GEM.

153
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,500
[NATSUKI] If you are hurt,
your master will be hurt.

154
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,625
And if your master dies,
you will die too.

155
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,750
[ARIKA gasps]

156
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,333
[NATSUKI]
To give up love,

157
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,458
relinquish a woman's happiness,

158
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,000
and devote your life
to your master.

159
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,166
That is what it means
to be an Otome.

160
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,208
Tell me.

161
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,791
Are you prepared for that?

162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,208
Yes!

163
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,750
Then, Arika Yumemiya,

164
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,833
in the name of the
source of all Otomes,

165
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,041
our great ancestor,
I grant you this Coral GEM,

166
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,041
proof of your candidacy
to become an Otome.

167
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,208
I'm Arika Yumemiya! And, um...

168
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,708
My dream is to become a
really cute and cool Otome!

169
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,583
It's nice to meet all of you!

170
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:50,041
[YUKARIKO] Arika, your
seat number is number 51.

171
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,083
You will attend classes
starting tomorrow.

172
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,875
Good luck, and do
your best to move up

173
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,208
the class rankings, okay?

174
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,250
Right!

175
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,541
Now then, Nina,
Erstin, please stand!

176
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,333
--Yes, ma'am.
--Uh, yes.

177
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,750
I have a favor
to ask of you both.

178
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,791
[ARIKA]
Wow, what a beautiful room!

179
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,416
And the view is great!

180
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
This is super cool!

181
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,416
[sighs, giggles]

182
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,000
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other, uh...

183
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,000
Huh? Oh, I'm Coral
number 17, Erstin Ho.

184
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,916
It's nice to meet you, Erstin!

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,375
This'll be fun!

186
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,416
I will agree to
share a room with you,

187
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,708
because the
headmistress orders it.

188
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,541
But I have no intention
of being cozy with you.

189
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,791
How mean!

190
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,625
And here I was thinking
we were all friends

191
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,125
in the same class!

192
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,666
[NINA]
Friends?

193
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,458
Every student in this school
is competing with each other

194
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,875
to become an Otome.

195
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,291
Your classmates are not friends.

196
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,500
They're rivals.

197
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,208
Rivals, huh?

198
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,958
What do you think, Erstin?
Is everyone like that here?

199
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,375
Uh, well... yes.
I suppose so.

200
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,166
You see, only one out of
two Corals can graduate

201
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,625
to the Pearl Class.

202
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,125
And only a handful of those
can become a genuine Otome

203
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,666
and receive the rank
and GEM of a Meister.

204
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,791
But this is the first
time I've ever seen Nina

205
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,875
get so tough and say
anything about a rivalry.

206
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,083
She acts serious
most of the time,

207
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,416
but she's also very nice.

208
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,583
[ARIKA]
Hmm...

209
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,916
Well, that's fine!

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,250
I'm going to do my best anyway!

211
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,958
And one day, I'll beat Nina
in a head to head battle!

212
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,416
Once again, you've gone farther
than I would have thought.

213
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,833
I am sorry, Miss Maria.

214
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,000
However...

215
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,375
I understand.

216
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,375
I was as surprised
as anyone to see

217
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,500
the Blue Sky Sapphire again.

218
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,500
But that...

219
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,041
...is a separate issue entirely.

220
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,500
Garderobe Academy
must treat every student

221
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,666
from every country
equally and with fairness.

222
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,833
A girl without
family or sponsorship

223
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,625
will have a difficult time.

224
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,583
I think you
understand that well.

225
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,375
[door closes]

226
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,875
[NATSUKI sighs]

227
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,791
So you decided to put them
both in the same room together.

228
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,375
Natsuki, you sure are mean!

229
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,333
You're not one to talk, Shizuru.

230
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,041
Those two will encourage
each other's growth

231
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,958
by being rivals.

232
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,125
They will be like you
and Haruka once were.

233
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,750
And also like me
and my old roommate.

234
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,458
[NATSUKI] First the
Slave Lords of Schwartz

235
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,875
use creatures to attack
Wind Kingdom,

236
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,250
and now we have the
cyborgs of the Black Valley

237
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,916
to deal with as well.

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,875
[SHIZURU]
Aswad.

239
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,416
The mysterious military unit,

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,791
active behind the scenes since
the War of the Twelve Kings.

241
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,708
[NATSUKI] Otome can't always be
merely the flowers of society.

242
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,250
We'll need those two
to become much stronger.

243
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,791
That may be so,
but before we worry about that,

244
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,708
I think there's a more immediate
problem for us to solve.

245
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:12,958
[NATSUKI]
You're right.

246
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,583
If I had known something
like this would happen,

247
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,375
I would've provided
some sort of a scholarship.

248
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,250
[NATSUKI]
This isn't good.

249
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,916
Oh, wow! A feast!

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,708
Looks delicious!

251
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,541
Did Nina and the others
really make this themselves?

252
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,750
But I can't really be happy.

253
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,000
Why? What happened?

254
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,625
You're, uh...

255
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,666
Irina.

256
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,250
Irina Woods.
We're in the same class!

257
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,916
Nice to meet you!

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,208
Here, one of the teachers
just gave me this.

259
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,541
Let me see.

260
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,458
Tuition... costs of
school materials...

261
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,958
...and other fees,
for a grand total of...

262
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,916
What?! That's a lot of money!

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,583
Which means I have
to find a way to make

264
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,333
some money really fast!

265
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,458
Mmm, this is delicious!

266
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,208
You're paying it
all by yourself?

267
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,583
[ARIKA]
Of course!

268
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,125
You mean you two don't?

269
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,125
I'm here on my
country's scholarship.

270
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,333
My homeland Aries is
taking care of all my fees.

271
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,583
And in my case, my
parents pay for everything.

272
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,666
You're lucky!
I don't have any family,

273
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,875
and I don't know
anyone who'd support me.

274
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,000
[YAYOI]
No way!

275
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,666
[ERSTIN] Ah! This is
Lilie, Yayoi, and Miya.

276
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,875
They're students in
Star Class, too.

277
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,625
What was that "no way" about?

278
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,166
Well, um, we were
just talking about Arika.

279
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,833
It's unheard of for someone
to enroll here midterm.

280
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,833
Besides that, you seem to
know Queen Mashiro personally,

281
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,500
and Big Sister Shizuru has
been watching over you too,

282
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,791
hasn't she?

283
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,750
[YAYOI] So we were just
guessing a little!

284
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,916
We thought you might
have some rich sponsor,

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,125
or maybe you're
a royal princess.

286
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,041
No, no, it's not
anything like that!

287
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,708
I don't even have any
family after Grandma died!

288
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,750
Oh, but my mother
should still be alive!

289
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,708
At least I think so...

290
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,875
Then why'd they
accept someone like you?

291
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,250
[TOMOE]
That's enough, everyone.

292
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,500
You shouldn't bombard her
with so many questions.

293
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,416
You're making
Arika uncomfortable.

294

Hello. I am the Number Two
Coral, Tomoe Marguerite.

I'm the student representative

at this school.

If there's anything
you need to know,

please don't hesitate to ask.
