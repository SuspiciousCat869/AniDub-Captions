have to find your own food.

00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,166
I let you lead the way because
you said you were from Aries.

162
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,291
I wonder how many students

163
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,416
are going to reach the
destination this year.

164
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,958
[YOHKO]
Headmistress, you had to quit

165
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,458
halfway through, didn't you?

166
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,583
Yes, but it wasn't my fault.

167
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,375
It was all because of the
other girl's poor planning.

168
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,833
That sure brings back memories.

169
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,000
When we received your distress
signal, I was sent to get you,

170
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,416
only to find you two
in a most improper--

171
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,333
Never mind!

172
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,125
I don't think so.

173
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,500
Ahh...

174
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,666
[NATSUKI]
Hey, Shizuru, not down there!

175
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,250
[gasps]

176
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,875
Well, you certainly
haven't changed much.

177
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,083
Shizuru, you and Haruka
were paired together

178
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,166
for this test, weren't you?

179
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,625
Yeah, and this so-called
brilliant Otome

180
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,083
was absolutely useless.

181
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,541
She left me with every
single responsibility.

182
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,875
Everything from carrying
the backpacks to cooking!

183
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,375
Ha! I knew it!

184
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,916
What?

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,125
Aoi, what the heck
is with this beach?

186
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,208
I came here to play, not to
be isolated from everything

187
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,791
like I'm some sort of
dangerous bacteria!

188
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,458
And on top of that,
that little freak is here!

189
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,666
Aw, come on.

190
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,208
We can play and have
fun together, Mashiro!

191
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,666
Over my dead body!

192
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,625
[YUKARIKO] Then let us keep
you company, Your Majesty!

193
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,208
[MASHIRO]
Huh?

194
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,541
I've always wanted to play that
game called beach volleyball!

195
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,625
Let's try it!

196
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,000
I'd be honored.

197
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,166
Thank you, Chie.

198
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,666
No problem.

199
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:51,791
[groans]

200
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,500
[NAGI]
This world is so unfair.

201
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,958
What did you say?!!

202
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,541
[NAGI]
I was only telling the truth!

203
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,375
[MASHIRO]
You dimwit! Come back here!

204
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,208
This world really is unfair!

205
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,916
I have to stay here and
watch the tent alone?

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:23,833
Some day... Some day
I'll maki-maki them all!

207
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,500
[tires squeal]

208
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
Kazu!

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,916
Hi. I ended up coming after all.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
That swimsuit... looks
really great on you.

211
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,583
Kazu, you're making me blush.

212
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,625
[SERGEY] That's the heir
to one of Cardair's

213
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,708
three royal families.

214
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,833
[CHIE]
Here you go!

215
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,666
[MIKOTO meows]

216
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,666
[MASHIRO]
This is so fun!

217
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,708
[ARIKA laughing]

218
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,541
Here!

219
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,708
I'm sorry, Arika.
I just can't...

220
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,166
[groans]

221
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,333
[gasps]

222
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,833
Ersty! Were you bitten?
Let me take a look!

223
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,333
If it's poisonous,
we have to act quickly!

224
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,041
I'm okay. It doesn't
really hurt.

225
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,708
Yeah, but still!

226
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:41,208
Arika? I was bitten on this leg.

227
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,291
[ARIKA]
Huh?

228
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,666
Don't worry. I'm fine.

229
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,000
Like Professor Yohko said,

230
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,041
the nanomachines inside
us should break down

231
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,833
any poisons or harmful
materials that enter our body.

232
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,333
[ARIKA]
Even so...

233
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,500
[gasps] You've got
blood blisters!

234
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,166
[ERSTIN] I-I'm fine.
Really, I'm all right.

235
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,166
Come on, let's keep going.

236
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,291
[ARIKA] Don't force yourself!
You just got bitten by a snake!

237
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,291
Look, the sun will
be setting soon.

238
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,916
Why don't we just set up
camp here for the night?

239
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,083
But I--

240
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,583
No "buts"! Besides, I think
this spot is perfect!

241
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,500
It's close to that little
river we just saw.

242
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,958
Let me just cut the
grass around here;

243
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,000
we don't want anymore
snakes appearing.

Please be very thorough with
scoring the dinners, everyone.

Yes ma'am.

Ta-da!

Number 17, Erstin Ho.
And Number 51, Arika Yumemiya.

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,541
I'm here to grade
you on your dinner.

00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,458
[ARIKA]
Okay, we're ready!

255
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,958
[SHIHO]
Hm?

256
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,041
What's with you? Don't tell
me you're giving up already.

257
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,541
[ERSTIN] No, I'm okay.
I'm just a bit tired.

00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,833

[SHIHO gasps]

261
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,375
I made them all by myself!

262
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,250
Zero points. Bye.

263
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,791
[ARIKA]
Aw, come on!

264
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,041
That's so mean if you're
not even gonna try 'em!

265
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,166
I went to a lot of
trouble making these!

266
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,916
I can tell without tasting.

267
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,750
Zero means zero.

268
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,583
Look! A flying swirl!

269
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,708
[SHIHO]
Huh?

270
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,958
[SHIHO screams]

271
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,458
That was unpleasant.

272
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,458
I wonder what kind of animal
makes such a terrible sound.

273
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,125
It sounded like a crow was
being strangled or something.

274
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,458
Excuse me, Big Sister Shizuru.

275
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,333
I put a lot of effort into
making this. Please enjoy.

276
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,916
Then I'll help myself.

277
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,958
[laughing]

278
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:14,041
[CHIE, IRINA, MIYA laughing]

279
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,083
I brought you
some water, Ersty!

280
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,416
[ERSTIN]
Sorry, Arika.

281
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,625
Stop that!

282
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,916
Jeez, Ersty, you've been
apologizing all day,

283
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,833
every hour on the hour!

284
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,041
Sorry.

285
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,000
Stop.

286
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,000
[ERSTIN]
Huh?

287
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,000
[chuckles]

288
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,125
[chuckles]

289
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,041
Now why don't I give
you a wipe down?

290
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,375
You must be uncomfortable
after sweating all day!

291
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,291
Don't worry about me.
What about you?

292
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,833
I took a dip in the river
and washed myself then.

293
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,125
Now don't be shy!

294
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,375
[ERSTIN]
Ah! Wait, no!

295
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,375
You're running a fever.

296
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,291
It's probably because the
nanomachines are being active.

297
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,583
And I used the injection
gun a moment ago, too.

298
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,541
Maybe... we should
just press the button.

299
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,875
[ERSTIN]
No, please!

300
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,333
If you do that, you'll be
disqualified as well!

301
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,333
Well, we already got minus ten
points for our dinner, so--

302
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,125
[ERSTIN] There's got to be a way
to earn back those points!

303
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,333
I don't wanna hold
you back, Arika!

304
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,208
Wow! They're jiggling!

305
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,500
Huh?

306
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,541
Actually, I'm the dead weight.

307
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,208
It's me holding you back.

308
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,875
I get the bad school grades.

309
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,833
[ERSTIN] I'm sure that you'll
become a great Otome, Arika.

310
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,208
I just know it.

311
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,833
Do you really think that?

312
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,083
[ERSTIN]
Mh-hm.

313
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,541
It'll definitely happen, because
you have a sincere dream.

314
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,041
You really want to
become an Otome.

315
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,708
But it's the same
with you, isn't it?

316
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,041
[ERSTIN]
Not really.

317
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,291
I just had slightly better
grades than the others.

318
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,625
Besides, what I really want...

319
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,541
