00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,500
[MINISTER A] Princess Mashiro,
you are the true successor

00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,041
to the Kingdom of Windbloom
and its throne.

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,291
Everything in this
country is yours.

00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,125
[MASHIRO]
I want that doll!

00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,875
[PEOPLE]
Yes, Miss Mashiro!

00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,333
[MASHIRO giggles]

8
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,000
[MASHIRO]
I hate this kinda flower!

9
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,750
[PEOPLE]
Yes, Miss Mashiro!

10
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,791
[MASHIRO giggles]

11
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,666
[MASHIRO]
Be my horse, Sakomizu!

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,916
[SAKOMIZU]
Yes, Miss Mashiro!

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,750
[MASHIRO]
Giddy-up!

[giggling]

16
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,125
[WOMAN A]
Princess!

17
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,875
[WOMAN B] Miss Mashiro!
It's time for your studies!

18
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,041
[MIKOTO meows]

19
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,958
[WOMAN A]
I've had it with that Princess.

20
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,875
Both the King and Queen were
decent, honorable people,

21
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,791
but she's nothing like them!

22
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,166
[WOMAN B]
You're right.

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,333
Maybe the rumor that's
going around really is true.

24
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:08,041
[WOMAN A] Hey, you shouldn't
be talking about that.

25
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,625
[WOMAN B] You can't blame me
for wanting to believe it.

26
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,000
I think it's true.

27
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,208
I bet the real princess was
with the King and Queen

28
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,458
when it happened.

29
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,000
[MASHIRO]
He's from Artai?

30
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,375
[WOMAN C]
Yes, he's the duke.

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,666
[NAGI]
Hi there. Are you Mashiro?

32
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,166
[MASHIRO]
Yes, I am.

33
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,666
So you're the one people
have been talking about.

34
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,375
Did you know everyone's calling
you the fake Princess?

35
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,541
[gasps]

36
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,041
How... dare you...

37
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,416
[WOMAN A]
She doesn't even resemble

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,291
the late King and Queen at all.

39
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,166
[WOMAN B] That could
mean the rumor is true.

40
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,166
[MASHIRO]
Stop!

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,333
[WOMAN A]
So, the real Princess...

42
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,250
[WOMAN B]
...together with her parents...

43
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,250
[WOMAN A]
...actually died.

44
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,375
[NAGI]
Fake Princess.

45
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,666
[MASHIRO]
Stop!

46
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,166
Stop it!

47
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,833
Was that because of you, Mikoto?

48
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,041
Were you giving
me nightmares? Jeez!

49
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,083
[meows]

50
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,416
Hey there, Mikoto.

51
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,791
I really am the Queen.
I am the Queen of Windbloom.

52
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:11,875
Aren't I?

53
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,666

[ARIKA]
"Dear Sir. Today is our day off!

55
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,458
It's my favorite
day of the week.

56
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,458
Since we don't have
morning cleaning today,

57
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,458
we all get to sleep in a little.

58
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,916
But even if it's a day off,

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,291
hardly anybody can
afford to take it easy.

60
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,666
Some people train.
Other people study.

61
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,708
Some students help the teachers.

62
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,208
And others clean their
Big Sisters' rooms.

63
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,916
There are so many things to do,

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,250
and everyone seems really busy.

65
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,333
Oh, what about me?

66
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:19,291
Well, actually, I've started
working part time.

67
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,666
I know you told me not
to worry about money,

68
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,333
but I still feel I'd like to
pitch in as much as I can.

69
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,083
I plan to pay off my
debt to you bit by bit.

70
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,333
Big Sister Nao introduced
me to the job.

71
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:34,083
Can you guess what it is?

Everyone says this
job is perfect for me."

we have a very special guest.

Queen Mashiro has come
all the way out here

counting on your hard work

so that this will become
a magnificent castle.

You came to observe
this all of a sudden.

00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,375
But remember,
this is not Garderobe.

00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,250
Therefore, you must
be very cautious.

the work so far?

Oh, her?

She might be small,
but she works really hard.

this to my mom later.

for you at the office.

to have come through undamaged.

I've decided.

Restart the construction
from scratch.

132
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,250

that at this stage?!

You're just gonna put all the
work we've done to waste?!

Be quiet!

You're talking to the
Queen of this nation!

What's wrong with doing
things the way I like?

Everything is wrong! You're
only thinking of yourself!

you're even a real Queen!

[NAGI] Oh boy. Looks like
you've done it now.

I haven't had the chance
to see her lately,

so I decided I should stop by.

00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,291
But what I get is a
very interesting scene.

Heh.

Yeah.

kept alive for many years.

Here, try using this.

Huh? Uh. Thank you.

is important. Be careful.

want to look any worse

163
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,875
than you already do.

164
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,833
Mind your own business!

165
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,041
[MAN IN BLACK A]
How 'bout over there?

166
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,625
[MAN IN BLACK B]
No sign of her.

167
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,208
[MAN IN BLACK A] Ugh! Where in
the world could Her Majesty be?

168
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,833
[MAN IN BLACK B]
Keep it down.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,458
[MASHIRO]
Father... Mother...

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,916
[SERGEY]
It happened 14 years ago.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,541
Fuka Palace was invaded
by a group of rebels.

172
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:28,041
Both the King and the
Queen were killed.

173
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,583
To make matters worse, the
Otome who served the King

174
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,916
had just retired
prior to the attack.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,583
No one was strong enough
to stop the rebels.

176
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,625
[ARIKA] You seem to
know a lot about this.

177
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,041
[SERGEY] Back then, I was
here as an exchange student.

178
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:45,166
During the attack, the infant
Princess went missing.

179
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,208
But just when people
were giving up hope,

180
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,416
the Minister of Interior
Affairs at the time

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,791
found the girl who we
know as Queen Mashiro.

182
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,625
He proclaimed her
the surviving Princess.

183
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,333
The only evidence
the minister had

184
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:02,250
was the confession of a
criminal he'd captured.

185
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,166
He has since passed away, and
the Princess is now the Queen.

186
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,958
Everyone pretends to
have forgotten about it,

187
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,958
but that rumor will
never go away.

188
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,875
That's terrible.

189
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,916
If you truly want
to be an Otome,

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,625
you'd better think hard about
who you want to serve.

191
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,958
Once you enter into
a contract-- What?

192
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,291
Hey, Antsy!

193
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,875
[ARIKA] I'll wash this and
return it to you later!

194
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,416
[SERGEY]
Hmph.

195
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,208
[MASHIRO]
I hate them all.

196
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,083
They're all making fun
of me behind my back.

197
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,833
[NAGI]
There you are, Mashiro!

198
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,833
[MASHIRO]
Hm?

199
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,041
Nagi?!

200
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,666
Oh man! I was looking
everywhere for you!

201
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,416
What do you think
you're doing here?

202
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,916
[NAGI] Aww, don't make
such a scary face!

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,041
I have something very
important to tell you today.

204
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,750
[growls]

205
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,250
[NAGI]
Hm.

206
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,458
[grunts]

207
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,625
Uh? What?!

208
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,833
[NAGI] Your Majesty,
Mashiro Blan de Windbloom,

209
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,416
Queen of Windbloom Kingdom,

210
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,875
I ask you, will you grant
me your hand in marriage?

211
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,000
Whoa...

212
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,208
Amazing!

213
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,833
No! There's no time
for that! Um, now...

214
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,541
Which way should I go? Hm?

215
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,875
[ARIKA]
That's a blue gemstone!

216
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,666
[ARIKA]
Hm?

217
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,333
It can't be...? Can it?

218
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,000
[MIKOTO meowing]

219
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,125
[ARIKA]
Huh? Wait, you're her cat!

220
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,958
Hey, hold on!

221
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,208
What?!

222
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,041
Wh-Why are you asking me
that all of a sudden?!

223
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,083
[NAGI]
Take it easy.

224
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,708
You like me too,
don't you, Mashiro?

225
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,166
No way! Who would like
a jerk like you?

226
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,708
I've hated you for as
long as I can remember!

227
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,916
Ever since the first
time we met!

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,208
Oh, that time.

229
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,666
I'm so sorry! I was nervous!

230
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,000
But that was because
you were so cute.

231
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,166
[gasps]

232
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,333
L-Let me go...
or I'll call for help.

233
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm not letting you go.

234
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,250
I've had a crush on you
for a long time now.

235
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:14,083
I've liked you ever since
I first laid eyes on you.

236
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,750
Please don't...

237
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,291
[ARIKA]
Wait a minute!

238
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,125
[BOTH gasp]

239
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,666
[MASHIRO]
You again?!

240
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,208
Stop!

241
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,250
You're not supposed to force
people to do stuff like that.

242
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,958
That's what Grandma told me!

243
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,416
[MIKOTO meows]

244
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,750
[NAGI]
Huh?

245
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,875
Uh! Mikoto!

246
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,708
[MIKOTO hissing]

247
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,250
[sighs]

248
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,833
You've made your point.

249
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,875
I guess I'll give up this time.

250
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,458
I'll see you later, Mashiro.

251
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,416
And you too, Arika.

252
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,583
[thud]

253
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,625
Oh, are you okay?

254
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,333
Hey!

255
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,208
Yes, of course I'm okay!

256
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,500
I-I don't need your help.

257
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,208
Come on.

258
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:08,833
[MIKOTO meows]

259
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,625
[ARIKA, MASHIRO yelp]

260
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,000
[ARIKA, MASHIRO scream]

261
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,791
[SAKOMIZU]
You still haven't found her?!

262
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,291
[MAN IN BLACK B]
We're very sorry, sir!

263
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,500
Well, that's Miss
Mashiro for you.

264
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,500
You can't beat her in a game of
hide and seek in this castle.

265
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,958
Don't be so casual!

266
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,625
What if something has
happened to her?

267
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,416
You know that there've been
people targeting Miss Mashiro.

268
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,666
Even before her coronation.

269
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,333
[NAGI]
Are you talking about Schwartz?

270
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,125
[AOI]
Your Highness.

271
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,208
[SAKOMIZU]
Well...

272
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,916
It's scary, isn't it?

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,833
To think that with a
single black letter,

274
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,375
an ordinary person will
lose control of their body

275
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,541
and turn into a
ruthless destroyer.

276
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,208
Yup, it's heavy stuff.

277
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,708
But don't worry,

278
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,750
I just saw Mashiro in the
throne room a few minutes ago.

279
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,791
Though she might be a
little angry right now.

280
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,375
[SAKOMIZU, AOI]
Huh?

281
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,541
[ARIKA]
Hey, listen...

282
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,541
[MASHIRO]
What is it?

283
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,333
[ARIKA]
Where in the world are we?

284
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,708
[MASHIRO]
How should I know?

285
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,208
[ARIKA] Well, why not?
It's your castle, isn't it?

286
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,375
[MASHIRO] This castle has
almost 300 years of history,

287
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,041
whereas I am only 14.

288
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,250
[ARIKA]
What's that got to do with it?

289
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,875
Well, anyway, there
isn't much to this place.

290
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,333
[MASHIRO] You have no idea
about anything, do you?

291
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,416
[ARIKA]
Huh?

292
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
[MASHIRO]
They say that in the days

293
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,833
of the War of the Twelve Kings,
many tragic battles were fought,

294
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,750
all due to the abundance
of machinery like this.

295
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:32,916
Really?

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,750
[MASHIRO]
Really. Wait, what?!

297
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,833
You don't even know
something basic like that?

298
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,583
That's why I'm
studying about it now!

299
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,458
[MASHIRO] The person who
finally ended the war

300
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,208
was the very first Otome,

301
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,083
the holder of the
Pure White Diamond.

302
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,416
She's the predecessor
for all you Otome.

303
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,583
[ARIKA]
Ah.

304
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,500
I'm actually named
after her gemstone.

305
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,750
"Mashiro" means pure white.

306
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,416
My father and mother
gave me that name.

307
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,750
[ARIKA]
Oh.

308
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,875
To tell the truth,
I'm a little jealous.

309
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,666
As far back as I can remember,

310
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,541
my father and mother
weren't around,

311
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,166
and I never knew who they were.

312
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,875
And though I really
like the name Arika,

313
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,083
I don't know if it's the
name my parents gave me.

314
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:17,416
But hey, no matter what,
I'm still me. Arika Yumemiya.

315
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,916
And, um... Mashiro, you're
still Mashiro. So, uh...

316
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,458
What I mean is...

317
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,666
You're kidding me.

318
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,166
Please don't tell me
that you, of all people,

a thing like that?

Okay then.

322

my lowest point.
