[MAN A]
Hang in there, Father.

00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:33,708
[GIRL A] Mama. I'm so cold...
What happened to our home?

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,750
Please, I beg you,
give my child some milk!

00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,125
[SOLDIER A]
Hey, you!

[MIMI]
What do you want?

7
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,333
[SOLDIER A] Well, little girl,
we're looking for Queen Mashiro.

8
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,875
She's gone missing.
Have you seen her around?

9
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,166
How could I've seen her before?
And who cares anyway?

10
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,375
What I wanna know is, why
did we hafta get kicked out?

11
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,291
I thought the military was
supposed to protect us citizens.

12
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,125
Sorry, kid, but these orders
are coming from above

13
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,500
and we gotta follow 'em.

14
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,500
Besides, people like you
hardly qualify as citizens.

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,791
You have no homes or jobs,

16
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,833
you don't pay taxes,
or do anything productive.

17
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:26,916
You just live in slums.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,333
[MAN B]
It's not like we had a choice!

19
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,375
[SOLDIER A, SOLDIER B]
Huh?

20
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,166
[SOLDIER A]
Let's go.

21
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:39,166
Damn... just like that, the
military has switched sides,

22
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,250
and now they're all
working for Artai.

23
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,833
[MAN B] Why do we have
to be treated like this?

24
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,875
[MASHIRO] How did I end up
in this terrible situation?

25
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,791
Why is this happening to me?

26
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,958
Somebody, help me...

00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:57,458
[MASHIRO] Aoi... Sakomizu...
Mikoto... Arika...

28
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,958

Where am I?

32
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,958
So, you're finally awake.

33
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,750
Jeez, some Headmistress you are.

34
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,041
Just how long were
you gonna sleep?

35
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,458
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

36
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:55,833
[gasps]

37
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,375
Tell me, what happened
to Wind City?

38
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,708
And Garderobe, and
Arika, and the others?!

39
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,458
[grunts]

40
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,291
Hands.

41
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,166
[NATSUKI]
Hm?

42
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,541
I'm one of the Five Pillars now,

43
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,375
so I'm supposed
to be equal rank.

44
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,875
Do you think this sort
of thing is allowed?

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,750
So?

46
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,000
The truth is...

47
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,375
[NATSUKI]
Mh-hm.

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,000
...I haven't got a clue!

49
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:19,791
[growls]

50
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,583
Damn it, Nao!

[screams]

52
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,333
You should eat up. It tastes
pretty good actually.

53
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,083
But... But it's a...

54
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,083
What's this?

55
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,458
Don't tell me this
kind of cuisine

56
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,666
doesn't suit the palate
of the Headmistress.

57
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,458
Does that lecture about "do
whatever it takes to survive"

58
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,958
only apply in the classroom?

59
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,541
Give me that thing!

60
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,041
[NATSUKI]
Three days?!

61
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,458
Yep. That's how long it's
been since the brawl.

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,958
Were you the one who rescued me?

63
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,875
That's right.
You should thank me.

64
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,375
Hey, in case it
slipped your mind,

65
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,875
I was the one who saved her.

66
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,291
Don't take credit for
something you didn't do.

67
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,208
Who's he? He's rather
suspicious looking.

68
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,916
Oh, this is my informant.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,250
Actually, you could say
he's an old friend of mine.

70
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,125
If you want to know what
happened in the city,

71
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,625
I can certainly tell you.

72
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,500
But... it's gonna cost you.

73
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,416
If you like,
you can pay me later.

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,625
You're good for it, right?

75
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,708
Well, I suppose I
don't have a choice.

76
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,416
[YAMADA]
Grand Duke Nagi declared himself

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,541
the liberator of this
city after his army

78
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,041
forced out the Schwartz
and their Slaves.

79
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,500
He took over the
Queen's position

80
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,750
and seized the
military for himself.

81
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,333
He's now occupying Fuka Palace
and has control of the nation.

82
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,333
Quite an ingenious tactic.

83
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,291
The timing for this
was all too perfect.

84
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,416
The only explanation is that it
was all part of a master plan.

85
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,750
Nao, are you sure you
weren't warned about this?

86
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,250
Hey, if I had known about it,

87
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,916
I would've run away long before
all the commotion started.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,833
[NATSUKI groans]

89
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,916
You really are a piece of work.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,625
Despite the number
of new refugees,

91
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,250
it seems the majority
of the citizens

92
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,041
have accepted the change
in leadership favorably.

93
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,375
Refugees?

94
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,750
[YAMADA] They started
to get rid of the people

95
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,000
living in the slums

96
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,416
under the guise of
maintaining public peace.

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,250
It's the oldest trick in
the books, but it works.

98
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,208
Establishing a policy
of persecution

99
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,958
raises the standards for
the remaining citizens.

100
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,416
Damn that Nagi!

101
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,750
What about Garderobe?

102
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,666
Is the school also
under his control?

103
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,166
[YAMADA]
Yes,

104
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,416
but since they've tightened
security around the campus,

105
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
it's hard to know
what's going on.

106
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,666
Shizuru...

107
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,125
What about the other nations?

108
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,833
No reaction.

109
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:34,041
For now, I expect they'll
sit back and remain neutral.

110
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,750
[HARUKA] That stupid little
runt Nagi has some nerve!

111
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,291
There's no way I'm gonna
let him get away with this!

112
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,541
Haruka, stop!

113
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,833
Artai did not break
any international laws

114
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,916
with their actions.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,458
If we try to do
something about it now,

116
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,083
it would be seen as an invasion.

117
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,625
Out of my way, Yukino.

118
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,083
The school I once came
from is in a dark time.

119
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,166
My mind's made up. I'm going.

120
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,416
And it doesn't matter
what you say!

121
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,833
You're going, no matter what?

122
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,000
Well then, I have no choice.

123
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,458
I'm really sorry, Haruka.

124
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,833
[ARGOS] That boy from Artai,
he's really done it this time.

125
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,875
Windbloom would be bad enough,

126
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,958
but he also has his
hands on Garderobe.

127
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,208
We no longer have the
luxury of staying back

128
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,125
and observing from a distance.

129
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,291
[NATSUKI]
Considering what's happened,

130
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,791
it's good news that
the Queen and Arika

131
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,166
haven't fallen under
Nagi's control.

132
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,166
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

133
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,458
You've been saying some
very interesting things.

134
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,791
Tell me, what's happened
to Arika Yumemiya?

00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,041
I suggest you stop.

Without their Robes,

Otomes do not stand a chance
against me in combat.

Who-Who are you?

140
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,958
Who I am is not the
important issue here.

141
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,250
Again, what happened to Arika?

142
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,291
Tell me, Ice Silver Crystal.

[NINA yells]

145
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,958
[NATSUKI] A tremendous amount
of power was unleashed

146
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,625
when the two
Gemstones collided.

147
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,583
[MIYU] So the Ultimate Black
Diamond has once again

148
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,958
made an appearance on
the stage of history.

149
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,375
[YAMADA]
I've heard that Grand Duke Nagi

150
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,375
has sent out a
large search party,

151
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,666
but so far they've not been able
to locate the Queen or the girl.

152
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,083
So there you have it.

153
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,833
We don't know where Arika might
be any more than you do.

154
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:55,125
After an incident like this, I
just hope that she's all right.

155
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,125
[NAO]
Oh, I'm sure she is.

156
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,958
And I bet the Queen is too.

157
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,458
Those types of people
are very resilient.

158
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,916
Besides, it seems Nina was
doing fine afterwards.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,916
[MIYU]
Nina...

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,333
Is that the name of the Otome

161
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,583
who now wields the
Ultimate Black Diamond?

162
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,833
[NATSUKI]
Yes.

163
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,208
[ERSTIN]
No!

164
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,458
[NATSUKI]
She must be miserable now

165
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,291
because of what
happened to Erstin...

166
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:20,791
...your friend...
that's why... I...

167
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,458
[NATSUKI]
This is my fault.

168
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,458
Schwartz was able to
infiltrate the Academy

169
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,791
without me knowing.

170
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,500
If only I'd been more careful,

171
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,541
I could've stopped all
of this from happening.

172
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,291
[knocking]

173
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,791
[NINA]
It's me, Father.

174
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,041
Come in.

175
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,666
Nina... I'm so...

176
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,041
Father, you mustn't get up yet.

177
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,416
You're pushing
yourself too hard.

178
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,250
Your wounds still
haven't fully healed.

179
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,291
You haven't touched
a bite of your food!

180
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,708
Hey, you're only hurting
yourself if you don't eat!

181
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,166
Uh, right...

182
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,875
Is the food not to your liking?

183
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,708
I can always go and make
something else for you.

184
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,208
No... It's... okay...

185
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,041
Well then how about some fruit?

186
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,708
Wait, I know! Grapes are
in season right now.

187
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,625
They've always been your
favorite, right, Father?

188
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,083
The stores outside
are back in business.

189
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,875
I'll go and find some for you.

190
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,166
[SERGEY]
Nina- <i>chan</i> !

191
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,875
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

192
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,833
[NINA]
Don't apologize to me!

193
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,666
Please, Father. If you
apologize to me, I...

194
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,708
[NINA crying]

195
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,375
[SERGEY]
Damn it!

196
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:18,958
This is it?

197
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,250
Yes.

198
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,500
The Harmonium.

199
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,583
At last, the wondrous science

200
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,791
that we've been
chasing for so long.

201
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,416
[NAGI]
This thing, huh?

202
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,083
So is it operational?

203
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,000
It's been two centuries
since it was last used.

204
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:38,166
Now it won't even budge an
inch, no matter what we try.

205
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,666
We haven't been able
to crack the seal

206
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,958
on the mausoleum either.

207
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,250
It looks like we need to
follow proper procedures

208
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,625
in order to open them.

209
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
[NAGI]
Well, that is a problem.

210
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,666
The song, the player,
and the protector, right?

211
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,833
[SMITH] That's what it
says in our Sacred Book.

212
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,666
Fortunately, as far
as the song goes,

213
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,958
we already have the lyrics
for the first two verses,

214
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,583
thanks to the work
of Saint Erstin.

215
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,958
And the third verse
should be with Mashiro?

216
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,875
Well, she was raised to be
the Queen of this nation.

217
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,708
So, she should know it.

218
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,125
I see. So the "song" is Mashiro.

219
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,833
And if Sergey is right about
the real Princess thing,

220
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,791
the player would be Arika.

221
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,750
We'll definitely
need to find her.

222
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,000
[SMITH]
Yes.

223
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,333
[MAN D]
Damn...

224
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,666
The Aries will
take us in, right?

225
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,541
They won't turn us
away, will they?

226
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,833
[MAN E]
This is all the Queen's fault.

227
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,250
Blame her for us
ending up like this.

228
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,291
[MAN F] But wasn't it that
Nagi guy who kicked us out?

229
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,458
[MAN E]
Yeah, but I was unemployed

230
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,833
because of that Queen.

231
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,375
And all the while,

232
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,666
those bribe-taking politicians
and construction contractors

233
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,333
were getting rich.

234
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,291
And then we end up
with that castle.

235
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,083
Pathetic.

236
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,916
Restart the construction
from scratch.

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,250
We shall rebuild this castle
into something completely new.

238
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,791
[TAKUMI]
I can't ignore the fact

239
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,083
that the Queen's having these
big birthday celebrations

240
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,875
and having her castle rebuilt

241
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,375
when she should
really be dealing

242
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,458
with a lot more
important issues.

243
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:19,041
For example, think about
the place where you woke up.

244
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,750
[MASHIRO]
If they don't have bread,

245
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,041
well then, they can
always eat candy!

246
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,833
[TAKUMI] I can see that
you're very fortunate.

247
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,708
[MASHIRO] What's wrong with me
doing things the way I like?

248
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:30,791
I'm the Queen.

249
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,083
[MAN G]
I'll bet the rumors were true.

250
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,666
She was probably an
imposter after all.

251
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,666
[WOMAN A]
I've had it with that Princess.

252
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,625
Both the King and Queen were
decent, honorable people,

253
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,125
but she's nothing like them!

254
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,500
[WOMAN B]
You're right.

255
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,125
Maybe the rumor that's going
around really is true.

256
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,916
But I'm still...

257
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,041
This girl is the real Princess!

258
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,750
She is the real
daughter of the King,

259
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,083
and the true heir of Windbloom!

260
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,625
[gasps]

261
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,708
There's no possible
way that little brat

262
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,458
could ever be the Queen.

263
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,000
I am the real...

264
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,041
I am the real...

265
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,125
I'm so dry, I can't
shed tears...

266
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,208
[MIMI] Hey, you!
You don't look so good.

267
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,791
Are you all right?

268
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,583
Have I seen you
somewhere before?

269
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,916
Uh, I-I think you
must be mistaken.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
[MIMI]
Hm.

271
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,041
Well, doesn't matter.
Drink up. Here.

272
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,666
You'll die if you get
left behind, ya know.

273
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,958
Can I... really...?

274
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm not gonna force you
if you don't want any.

275
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,125
Hey!

276
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, man, come on! What a waste!

277
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,958
I understand.

278
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,625
In that case, I have no
further questions to ask you.

279
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,625
[NATSUKI]
Why are you looking for Arika?

280
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,333
Although I really don't
expect an answer from you.

281
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,875
That is because it has
nothing to do with you.

282
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,208
Well, can you at least
give us your name?

283
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,875
I am Merciful Intelligential
Yggdrasil Unit.

284
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,750
However, that's
not my only name.

285
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,791
There was once
someone whom I loved.

286
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,875
I gave her everything, and
she gave me the name "Miyu."

287
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,833
Miyu...

288
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,708
[MASHIRO groans]

289
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,083
[MIMI]
Whoa, that looks painful.

290
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,208
I don't think I can
walk another step.

291
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,250
[MIMI]
Hm?

292
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,541
Your skin is really fair.

293
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,375
And your hands and
feet are smooth.

294
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,583
Well, except for the fact

295
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,500
that they're covered
in blisters right now.

296
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,916
Why is that?

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,166
Are you some sort of Princess
from another country?

298
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,166
[gasps]

299
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,583
Just kidding!

300
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,458
Why would a Princess be in
an awful place like this?

301
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,375
A Princess would be
eating delicious food

302
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,375
and sleeping on a nice,
soft bed right now.

303
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,250
Really... So unfair.

304
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,666
Mimi... do you also...

305
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,791
...do you also hate the Queen?

306
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,041
[MIMI]
Yeah.

307
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,791
My dad used to be
a baker, y'know.

308
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,875
He had his own bakery,

309
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,208
and even though it
was a small place,

310
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,375
it was filled with lots
of customers every day.

311
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,708
But then some government
officials came to the bakery

312
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,041
and they closed it down.

313
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,750
Something about them
wanting to build a road.

314
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,250
And my dad just lost all his
energy and will to work.

315
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,416
After that, it was
the same old story.

316
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,791
Drinking, debt, gambling...
the whole works.

317
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:38,208
In the end, he died a pitiful
death by the side of that road.

318
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,583
Every time I look at the castle,
I always think the same thing.

319
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,208
The Queen has never done
a thing for any of us.

320
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,041
She never listens, and
doesn't watch over us either.

321
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,208
And that's because, from
way up there in her castle,

322
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,708
she can't even see us.

323
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,333
There's no way she
could understand

324
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,875
what we're going through.

325
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,333
So that's why I decided not
to look up at the Queen either.

326
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,208
I refuse to look up at her!

327
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,458
Why should I look at someone

328
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,541
who does stuff like that
stupid birthday party?

329
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,083
That's why I hate the Queen!
Ugh! I hate her!

330
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:06,750
Mimi...

331
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,916
[stomach growls]

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,041
[MIMI]
Huh?

333
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,041
Wait here a minute.

334
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:20,291
Up until now, was I...?

335
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,625
[MIMI]
Here.

336
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,625
[MASHIRO]
You can have it.

337
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,500
It's really... good...

338
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,166
Huh? It's not really that good.

339
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,791
Actually, it tastes awful.

340
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,500
The guy warned me
about the taste.

341
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,625
He said it's 'cause
we're low on salt.

342
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,458
No... it's delicious.

343
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,416
It's the first
time in my life...

344
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
...I ever realized...
food can be so good.

345
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,375
Hey, come on! Don't start
crying! It's just some stew!

346
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,041
Jeez, what kind of life
did you have before?

347
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,458
Huh?

348
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,291
Is it true?

349
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,625
Yeah, it is.

350
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,666
We met up with another
group a little while ago.

351
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,583
It seems she managed
to join in with them.

352
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,041
Hey, everyone, come on!

353
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,125
We just caught someone
who worked in the castle!

354
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,333
One of the Queen's maids!

355
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,500
[gasps]

356
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,500
[AOI screams]

357
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,708
[WOMAN B] This woman...
I've seen her before!

358
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,833
[MAN K] She's Queen
Mashiro's personal aide!

359
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,041
[MAN L]
While we were starving,

360
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,166
she was living the
life of luxury!

361
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,250
[MAN M] Damn her. She tried to
escape by hiding among us!

362
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,333
[MASHIRO]
Aoi!

363
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,166
[MAN N] This is all
because of you people!

364
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,041
Give me back my wife!
My home! My job!

365
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,041
[MAN E] It's because you
let that stupid Queen

366
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,625
do whatever she wanted!

367
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,208
[MASHIRO]
Aoi!

368
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,541
[MAN P]
What should we do with her?

369
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,666
[WOMAN C]
Hand her over to Artai!

370
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,791
[MAN Q]
No! That won't erase our anger!

371
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,583
Make her take responsibility!

372
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,958
That's right!

373
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,625
I say we take from her
everything she took from us!

374
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,458
[MASHIRO] I... I never knew
they hated me this much.

375
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,666
[AOI screams]

376
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,791
Well, it serves her right.

377
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,166
But she's just a maid who
happened to work in the castle.

378
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,041
So why...?

379
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,458
She's just the same.

380
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,208
She didn't do anything
to stop the Queen

381
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,875
from messing around
like she did.

382
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,916
And because of that,
we ended up like this.

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,250
[MAN E] This is your last
chance to redeem yourself.

384
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,125
Tell us where the Queen is!

385
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,291
We'll let you live if you do.

386
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,333
[MASHIRO]
Aoi...

387
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,583
That's correct! Indeed, I am...

388
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,416
Come on!

389
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,958
Huh? Oh, right.

390
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,750
May I present Mashiro
Blan de Windbloom,

391
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,458
the Crown Princess
and future Queen

392
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,750
over all of Windbloom Kingdom!

393
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,416
I am supposed to be the
Queen of this country!

394
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,333
What's wrong with doing
things the way I like?

395
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,666
That's right.
I should be the one...

396
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,208
My feet... why won't they move?

397
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,208
[MAN E]
Are you sure you don't know?

398
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,208
You'd be a fool to
die for that girl.

399
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:38,125
I don't know. And even if
I did, I wouldn't tell you.

400
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,666
[gasps]

401
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,166
That's what she gets.

402
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,875
[MAN T]
She deserved it!

403
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,333
Huh, she could've at least cried

404
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,041
or begged for her
life or something.

405
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,583
That wasn't any fun.

406
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,750
Huh? What's wrong with you?

407
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,041
Hey!

408
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,083
[MASHIRO]
I have nothing left.

409
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,541
[MASHIRO]
No nation... No friends...

410
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,875
No honor as a Queen...

411
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,041
[ARIKA]
Let's make it a race.

412
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,000
We'll see if I become
a Meister first,

413
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,791
or you become a Queen first!

414
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,500
How about it?

415
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,541
I already am a Queen!

416
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,541
Then how about... a Queen
who will bring happiness

417
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,875
to everyone in her country?

418
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,666
[MASHIRO]
Arika...

419
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,708
[ARIKA]
Huh?

420
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,916
Hey, Arika? Were you
able to get some water?

421
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,541
[ARIKA]
Yeah! I'll be right there!

422
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,916
Let's go, Mikoto!

423
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,208
[MIKOTO meows]

424
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,333
[MASHIRO]
W... W...

425
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,416
[ARIKA] Worm? Hang in
there, Mashiro! Here!

426
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,208
[MASHIRO] Ah, nice and wet
and slimy-- What the--?!

427
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:06,250
[ARIKA] Ha! Grandma said you can
find humor almost anywhere.

428
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,166
[MASHIRO] What kinda
person was she, anyway?!

429
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,125
[ARIKA]
Well, she was--

430
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,416
Oh, hey, we're outta time.

431
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,208
[MASHIRO growls]
