1
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,958
[MASHIRO]
Hasn't Mikoto woken up yet?

2
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,458
Afraid not. She's still
sleeping like a baby.

3
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,958
She's got such a happy
expression on her face too.

4
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,041
It's kind of annoying.

5
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,416
[MIKOTO sighs]

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,541
I can't eat any more... Mai...

7
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,958
[MASHIRO]
How can you be so calm?!

8
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,833
Do you know how long we've
been stuck on this island?

9
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,166
By now they've
probably gone started

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,916
the Strategic Otome
Limitation Talks without me!

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,916
Not to mention all the work
that'll be waiting for me

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,833
in Windbloom.

13
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,666
And there's Arika as well.

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,750
Right now I...

15
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,791
What's wrong?

16
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,250
Nothing!

17
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,333
Why would I care about that
inconsiderate little brat?

18
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,625
Ugh.

19
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,291
At any rate, we have
to get off of this island

20
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,291
and back home as
fast as possible.

21
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,625
[MAI]
That's true,

22
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,291
but it's not as if we can
swim all the way back.

23
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,166
Why don't we just
sit back, relax,

24
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,541
and wait until we can
find some other way?

25
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:12,916
[MASHIRO sighs]

26
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,875
[MASHIRO] Arika, if you're
planning to come, then hurry up.

27
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,083
What's taking you so long?

28
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,666
[NATSUKI]
Now that we're assembled,

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,916
we shall proceed with the
first meeting of SOLT,

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,625
the Strategic Otome
Limitation Talks.

31
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,250
[YUKINO] Chairwoman,
I wish to submit a request.

32
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,375
While I do agree that the
Otome question is important,

33
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,541
I believe we have a much
more pressing issue

34
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,000
that should be discussed.

35
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,500
We have to decide what to do
about the mysterious being

36
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,791
that attacked
Windbloom and Aries.

37
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,083
[NATSUKI] Looks like this
is going to be a long day.

38
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,333
I'm counting on you, Nao.

39
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,291
We've come to the right
place, no doubt about it.

40
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,208
These have gotta be
those ancient ruins.

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,250
[CHIE sighs]

42
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,833
[CHIE] Oh man, I've been so cold
lately that this water stings.

43
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,666
And it hurts even more
when I think about

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,583
the President and the
Headmistress cooped up

45
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,750
in that meeting
looking all serious.

46
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,916
Well, we can't attend
ourselves anyway,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,708
considering the main
objective of the meeting

48
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,375
is to discuss eliminating
the use of Otomes.

49
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,333
It's too bad, really.

50
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,625
Hey there, Antsy.
What's bugging you?

51
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,750
Why don't you relax
and enjoy yourself?

52
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,291
[ARIKA]
How can I relax

53
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,125
when you're constantly following
me around, Big Sister Mahya?

54
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,791
When I'm changing,
or taking a bath,

55
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,250
even when I'm going
to the bathroom!

56
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,500
Of course I'm following you.

57
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,791
I can't have you
wandering around

58
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,708
and getting involved in
another bus-jacking.

59
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,875
Hey, those are the
Headmistress's orders,

60
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,458
and I'm stickin' to 'em, okay?

61
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:38,125
But I can't stay here!
I've gotta go find Mashiro!

62
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,500
How come?

63
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,083
I thought you had a big fight
with Queen Mashiro.

64
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:46,333
That's true. It did happen.

65
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,916
But still!

66
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,708
What will you do when
you find her? Apologize?

67
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,500
Or are you planning to
make her apologize to you?

68
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,416
[CHIE] Why don't you leave
her alone, Big Sister Mahya?

69
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,875
You know, Arika, everyone
else is worried too.

70
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,541
Big Sister Shizuru,
Her Majesty, and Miss Maria.

71
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,250
Even the Brigadier.

72
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,208
But right now, we have no
idea as to what we can do,

73
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,833
or what we should do.

74
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,666
At times like these, we need to
rest and refresh our bodies.

75
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,083
That's one of our
duties as Otomes.

76
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,875
--[AKANE, KAZUYA yelp]
--What are you doing?

77
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,333
I told you, you're not to come

78
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,500
within three meters
of each other!

79
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,041
B-Big Sister Mahya!

80
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,083
Emperor Kazuya,
what were you thinking?

81
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,250
You might be nothing more

82
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,708
than pretty window
dressing for the throne,

83
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,625
but you should still
maintain your dignity!

84
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,125
[KAZUYA grumbles]

85
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,416
Come on, Big Sister Mahya,
you're not being fair to him!

86
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,916
Kazu's doing his best!

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,166
Oh really?

88
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,000
Then why don't you stop
trying to do it with him

89
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,208
every time you see
an opportunity?

90
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,166
[KAZUYA]
Akane...

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,250
[KAZUYA yelps]

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,416
[SHIHO] Oh, dear.

93
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
You haven't changed since
our school days, Akane.

94
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,375
You're still a
brazen seductress.

95
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,875
To think you're the Meister of
my home country's Emperor

96
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,833
makes me so embarrassed!

97
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,916
Oh, I think I might
cry from the shame!

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,041
Huh?

99
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,041
Come on, not you too, Shiho!

100
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:20,208
[ROSALIE] Hey, I know a way
that will make everyone happy.

101
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,125
Akane can get married to Emperor
Kazuya and become Empress,

102
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,541
and you could leave Florince

103
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,333
and become the new
Meister for Cardair.

104
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,500
[ROSALIE chuckles]

105
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,125
A brilliant idea,
if I do say so myself.

106
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,375
Oh really?

107
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,875
I didn't realize that
you were that desperate

108
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,125
to have me leave my
position in Florince.

109
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,250
Could it be that the "returner"
is jealous, Big Sister Rosalie?

110
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:43,125
Oh my goodness! Can we say
"persecution complex"?

111
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,583
Maki-maki Shiho.

What in the world's
your problem?!

How dare you trip me! Hm?

117
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,041
Well this place was sure
built on the cheap.

118
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,125
[laughs]

119
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,541
It's divine punishment!

120

121
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,416
I'm gonna maki-maki
you to death!

And just where do you
think you're going, Arika?

125
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,458
Hey! Give that back!

No way!

Wait! Big Sister Mahya!

128
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,625
Mahya, come on!
Please, I need that back!

129
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,750
Oh, you poor little
girl, all vulnerable.

130
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,083
Why don't I cover those
up for you, Arika?

You're so cute and perky,
just like your breasts.

Big Sister Anh! What are you--?

137
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,625
Aoi, I really hope
I'm wrong about this,

138
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,041
but is that alcohol?

139
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,625
[AOI]
Huh? Yes.

140
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,958

Come on everyone!

We're taking a bath, aren't we?

143
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,625
So what do we need swimsuits
for? Let's get naked!

144
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,083
No! You can't do that!

00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,750
[LAULA] She's right, Big Sister!
Not here, at least!

146
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,041
[ROSALIE] It will upset your
father, Emperor Nguyen.

at all! Ha-ha!

153

Big Sister Anh gets outta
control when she drinks.

And when it comes
to her behavior,

well, let's just say
she's a bigger sister

[NAO] You sure are
a strange one, Nina.

160
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,125
You know, you wouldn't have
had to follow me all this way

161
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,125
if you just gave me that
diary to begin with.

162
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,708
I can't. Not this.

163
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,916
[NAO]
Hm.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,791
Okay.

165
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,125
This is my turf now.

166
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,291
And that means whatever treasure
we find is gonna be mine.

167
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,208
[NINA]
Hm.

168
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,916
I can see that you haven't
changed at all, Big Sister Nao.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,250
Hey, now that I'm a Pillar,

170
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,541
I've gotta start saving
for my retirement.

171
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,416
A girl's gotta get
her money somehow.

172
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,541
Anyway, if you don't
wanna hand that over,

173
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,666
then I'll be counting
on you to lead the way.

174
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,583
After all, Sergay's the only
person who's ever been here,

175
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,208
besides Nagi.

176
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,041
All right.

177
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,291
[NAO] So, what's the
first trap we're facing?

178
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,500
[NINA]
Let's see...

179
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,833
According to this,

180
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,208
there's a trapfloor
immediately after you enter.

181
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,541
[NAO]
What, that's it?

182
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,708
Who would ever fall for
a stupid trap like that?

183
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,291
[click]

184
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,541
[BOTH]
Huh?

185
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,541
[NINA]
Uhh...

186
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,041
[BOTH screaming]

187
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,583
Yeah. We're currently in
recess at the moment.

188
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:13,750
It's rough going,
just like I expected.

189
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,291
I see.

190
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,500
I guess we've got no choice
but to wait for Nao and Nina.

191
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,833
Is there any change with
Shizuru and the others?

192
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,708
Negative. We're still
monitoring them.

193
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,041
We can definitely
detect signs of life,

194
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,166
but other than that, nothing.

195
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,833
[NATSUKI]
I understand.

196
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,291
Professor Gal,

197
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,166
have you heard anything from
Midori and the others yet?

198
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,750
[GAL]
Nope, no news yet, I'm afraid.

199
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,625
Our leader and Rad,
uh, I mean Reito,

200
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,208
are still out searching
for the Black Valley.

201
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,166
[sighs]

202
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,875
Let me know when they
get back to you.

203
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,666
[GAL]
Roger.

204
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,541
[IRINA]
Oh, wait, Headmistress!

205
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,708
There's something else
that's worrying me.

206
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,083
It's about that
plant-like thing

207
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,416
that's still covering the
Predecessor's Mausoleum.

208
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,750
The part that's above ground

209
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,708
seems to have stopped
growing for the most part,

210
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,666
but the roots underground
are still spreading

211
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,916
at a steady rate.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,458
[NATSUKI]
That doesn't sound good.

213
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,666
How many surrogate
system cores remain?

214
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,000
[YOHKO]
Three.

215
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,583
If we push it, I might be
able to give you four.

216
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,833
[sighs]

217
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,375
If the situation gets any worse,

218
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,041
I'll return there myself
to try severing it again.

219
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,750
Keep watching over it till then.

220
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,041
[IRINA]
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,458
It's hard to handle this sort
of crisis without you, Shizuru.

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
[gasps]

223
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,250
I fell, didn't I?

224
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,875
[gasps]

225
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:28,958
The diary!

226
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,833
[NAO]
Relax, I've got it right here.

227
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,916
[NINA gasps]

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,833
[NINA]
Big Sister Nao!

229
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,250
When did you get so
out of shape, Nina?

230
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,625
[NAO, NINA screaming]

231
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,458
[NAO] If you give me too much
trouble, I'll leave you behind.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,291
I guess you read it then.

233
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,916
I didn't want anyone else
to read his diary.

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Not even you, Big Sister.

235
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,291
Of course you didn't.

236
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,500
This entry's interesting.

237
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,250
"Tomoe Marguerite
visited me today,

238
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,250
and gave me a pin-up
magazine as a gift.

239
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,166
Nina is a model in it.

240
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,125
I realized how much
she had grown.

241
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,250
I couldn't hide my
surprise and happiness.

242
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,500
Unable to control myself--"

243
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,750
Please! No, don't! Stop it!

244
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,041
I can't read another
word of this.

245
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,333
[NAO] By the way, Nina,
are you still a virgin?

246
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,625
[NINA] What?! Where'd a
question like that come from?

247
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,791
[NAO]
Heh. I guess you still are.

248
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:34,958
Even without his memories,

249
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,958
Sergay's still lame
in some areas.

250
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,250
And that must mean the
surviving nanomachines

251
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,500
are still squirming around
inside your body.

252
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,291
Ugh, you make them
sound disgusting!

253
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,541
And another thing!
Sergay is not lame, okay!

254
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,708
[NINA yelps]

255
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,375
[ARIKA sighs]

256
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,291
The meeting has
certainly been going on

257
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,458
for a long time, hasn't it?

258
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,625
[ARIKA] You already brought
all of Mashiro's luggage.

259
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,166
[AOI] It's our job to make
the necessary preparations.

260
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,625
After all, Miss Mashiro
might be back at any time.

261
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,833
[yelps]

262
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,750
[ARIKA]
Mashiro, how could you?!

263
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,750
I thought we made a promise
that we'd build a nation

264
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,500
where people will smile
from their hearts!

265
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,416
That's exactly why I'm doing
what a queen needs to do!

266
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,375
Why won't you
understand, Arika?!

267
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,291
How could I understand
something like that?!

268
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,458
If you won't understand,

269
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,041
then just shut up and
follow my orders!

270
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,666
Mashiro...

271
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,791
[AOI]
Miss Arika?

272
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,166
[ARIKA groans]

273
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,375
Look at what you found there.

274
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,208
So if you're still a virgin,

275
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,791
then which of you
is holding back?

276
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,791
Is it you? Or Sergay?

277
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,291
Well, you see...

278
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,166
The new Sergay is kind,
and I love him.

279
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,791
But he's not the man
I used to call my father.

280
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:25,625
That man is still...
Well, he's inside this diary.

281
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:30,541
The Sergay of the past,
he's still in here.

282
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,958
To tell you the truth,
I didn't want to read this.

283
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,458
It was too painful.

284
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,208
But then I heard about everyone,

285
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:40,416
about Arika, Queen Mashiro,
and Big Sister Shizuru...

286
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,541
...and all I could think of
was Arika's sad face.

287
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,833
That was what gave me
the courage to read it all.

288
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,125
[NINA] You could say
that this is my treasure.

289
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,000
Your treasure?

290
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,666
[NINA]
The days I spent at Garderobe,

291
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,291
and the world my father
risked his life to protect...

292
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,041
Even though all I can do
is stand aside and watch,

293
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,458
I can still believe

294
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,458
that Arika and her Big
Sisters will protect it.

295
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,500
And even if it's just
a small thing,

296
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,333
if I can make up for all the
things I've done, then I...

297
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,500
Please, you gotta stop it.

298
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,125
This is way too boring.

299
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,583
Just like I thought,
you haven't changed a bit.

300
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,750
Well, neither have you.

301
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,375
[NAO chuckles]

302
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,375
[AOI]
Keep this a secret,

303
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,416
but whenever Miss Mashiro
has to travel,

304
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
she always brings
that drawing with her.

305
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,208
It's the first thing
she packs ready to go.

306
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,375
She always tells me that it's
her most important treasure.

307
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,375
[ARIKA]
Let's make it a race.

308
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,208
We'll see if I become
a Meister first

309
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,750
or you become a queen first!

310
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,875
How about it?

311
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,791
But I'm already a queen!

312
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,250
Uh... then...
how about a queen

313
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,416
that will bring happiness
to everyone in her country?

314
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,583
Good idea!

315
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,208
Okay! The race is on!

316
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,458
Mashiro...

317
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,625
[MASHIRO]
I see.

318
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,708
You're worried about
all your friends

319
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,500
back in Windbloom, aren't you?

320
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,791
[RIBBON]
Uh-huh.

321
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,625
This mountain is a special
place for all of us.

322
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,208
[MASHIRO] The Black
Valley is supposed to be

323
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,916
the lifeblood of the
Schwartz, isn't it?

324
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,916
[RIBBON] But we won't
fight anymore, right?

325
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,750
[MASHIRO] You mean
Windbloom and the Schwartz?

326
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,916
[RIBBON]
Yeah.

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
There's nothing to worry about.

328
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,833
Both sides have been working
very hard over the past year

329
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,625
to improve our relations and
establish lasting peace.

330
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,375
[RIBBON]
Oh! That's great.

331
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,458
[RIBBON gasps]

332
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,500
[RIBBON]
Come over here, Your Majesty!

333
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,208
[RIBBON mumbling]

334
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,583
Uh, not to be rude,
but what are you doing?

335
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,041
[RIBBON]
I'm making a wish at the Shrine

336
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,416
of the Queen, of course!

337
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,083
I'm praying that
this mountain and I

338
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,458
can return to our friends soon.

339
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,125
Oh, I see.

340
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,750
I'd bet good money that
this is the last door.

341
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,416
[NINA]
What is this?

342
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,666
This feels like
a major discovery.

343
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,875
But there's no way
we're gonna be able

344
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,916
to carry that out of here.

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is that all you're
worried about?

346
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,208
[NAO]
Of course it is.

347
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,958
Jeez.

348
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,166
Looks like this stuff
isn't worth anything.

349
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,208
The Headmistress said that
aside from the data,

350
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,833
I could grab whatever I wanted.

351
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,208
Big deal.

352
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,875
<i>The Book of Neptune</i> ?

353
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,958
[gasps]

354
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,291
Big Sister Nao!

355
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,416
[NAO]
Just give me a minute, okay?

356
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,833
[NINA screams]

357
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,083
Nina!

358
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,166
Huh. So there's a watchdog
guarding the treasure, then.

359
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,791
It's so pathetic though.
It makes me wanna cry.

360
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,125
Big Sister Nao! Above you!

361
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,833
Wait a minute. That looks
like the Pure White Diamond!

362
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,708
So this must be the thing that
got Shizuru and the others.

363
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,083
Big Sister, don't you think
we should get outta here?

364
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,250
Are you kidding?
We can't leave yet.

365
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,708
I haven't found any
treasures to sell.

366
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,875
I am the Fourth of
the Five Pillars,

367
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,916
the Break String Spinel,
Juliet Nao Zhang.

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,375
I seek authorization via
the surrogate system.

369
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,333
Materialize!

370
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,833
What's that? Nao's fighting?

371
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,375
Would you get out of here?!

372
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,583
You're not an Otome, so you
won't be able to do anything!

373
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,833
But I--!

374
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,666
[gasps]

375
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,125
I'm not letting you get away!

376
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,500
Outta my way!

377
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,208
[NAO]
Huh?

378
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,958
[NINA]
I won't let you do that!

379
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,708
Don't draw attention
to yourself, you idiot!

380
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,791
[groaning]

381
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:37,916
[gasps]

382
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,333
No!

383
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,833
Big Sister Nao!

384
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,333
[screams]

385
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,541
[screaming]

386
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,458
No way...

387
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,708
That thing...

388
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,208
[YUKINO] There are more of them
appearing all over the world...

389
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,333
If they all hatch together...

390
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,291
...this world's finished.

391
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,541
[RIBBON]
Your Majesty, you got one!

392
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:05,958
[MASHIRO]
Uh?

393
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,250
[MASHIRO yelps]

394
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,500
[MASHIRO]
Come on!

395
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,833
[RIBBON]
You can do it, Your Majesty!

396
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,500
Whatever this thing is,
it's gotta be enormous!

397
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,083
[RIBBON]
Come on, Your Majesty!

398
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,916
Hang in there!

399
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,333
[yells]

400
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,958
[rumbling]

401
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,041
[MASHIRO]
Uh?

402
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,916
[MASHIRO]
What the heck is that?!

403
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,000
Nina?!

404
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,791
[NATSUKI]
Our final episode is next,

405
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,000
so I'll give you all a chance
to say what you want.

406
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,083
[ARIKA] I'm gonna combine
my powers and transform!

407
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,083
[MASHIRO]
The world is finally at my feet!

408
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,666
[NINA] I want a love
scene with my father!

409
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,458
[MIKOTO]
The Miroku Army arrives!

410
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:44,041
[MAI] The key to victory lies
in my special ramen noodles!

411
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,500
[RIBBON]
Um, I...

412
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,833
[ERSTIN] I wanna survive
to the end this time.

413
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,666
[ARIKA, NINA, MASHIRO, NATSUKI,
MAI, MIKOTO chuckle nervously]
