[LUMEN] There seem to be
a lot more of these lately.

It's a good thing they're
still in their infancy.

[GAL] However, Jabbars
this size are most useful.

00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,666
Everyone will be
happy about this.

[DYNE]
Hm?

What's this tasty little dish?

[GAL]
A spy?

just unconscious.

But rules are rules.

We have to kill anyone who
comes near our village.

[REFUGEES chattering]

13
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,708
[MAN A] We can make
new weapons from this!

14
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,583
We'll have a feast tomorrow!

15
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,500
Jabbar liver is
especially nutritious!

Hey, let's take some
to Luo later!

[BOY A]
Yeah.

18
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,833
She's the Master of a Gem?

[GAL]
Yes. A Meister Gem.

20
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,500
[LUMEN] That's why we
brought her back with us.

What's the name of the stone?

The Blue Sky Sapphire.

How long do you people plan

28
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,458
on continuing this
disgraceful state of affairs?

29
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,833
I hope you realize that
this is a clear attack

30
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,625
on the legal sovereignty
of Garderobe.

00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,791
Why is that?

You're still holding
classes, aren't you?

I don't see any problems
with the current situation.

[MARIA]
Hmph.

36
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,416
You have imprisoned one

How can you say these
things are normal?

[NAGI] It's all for
security, nothing more.

42

After all, right now you
teachers and students

aren't able to use the
power of the Otome.

You're defenseless.

45

And that's dangerous,

46
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,833
especially since you've
been unable to detect

There is still much
more you need to learn

before becoming a full Otome.

Yet you've still gone ahead
and used that Gemstone.

This is my wish,

approval of my Master,

come to regret it.

you surprised me.

Of course not!

You see, a trump card
is a trump card

it until the very end.

It was just like what
happened to you.

These guys brought me here.

Apparently they found me lying
out in the desert with Mikoto.

100

But I thought the Aswad
were supposed to be

Back when we first

she was like a toy doll.

what're you planning
to do with Arika?

I understand that you're her
Master and have her Meister Gem.

That kind of thing
doesn't matter anymore.

[ARIKA gasps]

166
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,041
Sorry!

167
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,250
[MIDORI]
Don't help him.

168
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,500
[ARIKA]
Huh?

169
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,500
Luo.

170
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,583
If you are a man of Aswad,

171
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,291
then get up under
your own power.

172
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:14,291
[grunting]

173
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,708
You did it!

174
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,041
Leader!

175
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,000
[MIDORI]
Way to go. I'm proud of you.

176
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,291
You did really great, Luo.

177
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,666
[LUO]
Leader.

--[GIRL A] Hey, me too!
--[BOY B] And me!

[CHILDREN laughing]

180
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,041
Oh my goodness!

181
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,375
Wow, everybody around here
really adores the leader, huh?

182
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,000
Why of course we all love her!

183
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,708
She is the leader of
our people, after all.

184
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,291
That woman. Is she the Queen
of Aswad or something?

185
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,791
[RAD]
The Queen, you say?

186
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,416
Well, she does
inherit the bloodline

187
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,250
of the previous leader.

188
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:06,041
But Midori earned the trust
of the people all on her own.

189
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,541
Of course, she paid
a heavy price for it.

190
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,041
Arika, come see me later.

191
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,791
There is something I need
to talk to you about.

192
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,583
Are we really going to do this?

193
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,916
We're gonna go
see that President

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,166
with the glasses, right?

195
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,583
Well, we may've
crossed the border,

196
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,125
but we still have a
long way to travel

197
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,500
before we reach the
capital of Aries.

198
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,708
You don't think you can
do it, is that it?

199
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,750
[NATSUKI]
Oh, shut up!

200
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,208
If I really wanted to,

201
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,333
I could get a car to stop
for us without any problem.

202
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,625
[NAO] Hey, fine, then why
don't you prove it to me?

203
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,958
You seriously think
that'll get them to stop?

204
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,166
You've gotta strike a
sexier pose, like this!

205
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,333
Why would I do something
that embarrassing?

206
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,416
[NATSUKI screams]

207
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,375
Yes! All right!

208
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,791
Damn you, Nao!

209
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,916
Huh?

210
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,958
Uh-oh...

211
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,791
[SOLDIER A] We are the border
police of the Republic of Aries.

212
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,916
You are under arrest
for indecent exposure

213
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,750
and disturbing the peace!

214
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,333
[TOMOE]
Big Sister Shizuru,

215
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,750
it was for my sake
you did that...

216
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,041
[TOMOE]
I will get you out of there.

217

[IRINA]
Nina!

218
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,375
Hey, I'm getting really worried.

219
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,208
Erstin and Arika have
both been missing

220
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,125
since the day of the
graduation dance-battle.

221
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,958
Nina! Do you know
anything about it?

222
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,708
Excuse me now.

223

Driver.

224
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,125
It sure is getting
lonely around here.

225
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,833
Oh well. Knowing those girls,
they'll be just fine.

226
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,375
Now then...

227
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,250
[YAYOI] I think it'd be better
if we returned to the academy...

228
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,375
Be quiet, you! Listen!

229
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,000
The dance-battle,
the graduation,

230
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,416
the ascension ceremony,

231
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,708
the greatest stage of my
life just went up in flames,

232
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,875
and I'm not gonna pretend
that nothing happened!

233
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,250
Everyone... is so cruel.

234
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,666
At last, I thought I could
finally become a Meister.

235
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,791

I'll give them some maki-makis!
I'll give them all maki-makis!

242
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,750
Maki-maki, maki-maki,
maki-maki for them all!

00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,916
Don't just stand there!

Hurry up and help me
with the maki-makis!

245

Blue maki-maki...

[ALL] Red maki-maki, Blue
maki-maki, Yellow maki-maki.

248
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,250
Red maki-maki, Blue maki-maki,
Yellow maki-maki.

249
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,583
Arika. How did you come
to possess that Gemstone?

250
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,916
This stone?

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,125
Grandma told me that it's
a memento of my mother.

252
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,458
That's how I was
able to figure out

253
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,333
that Lena Sayers
might be my mother.

254
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,083
No! She is my mother!

255
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,791
But Arika, you're...

256
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,458
Like I said, it's a lie.

257
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,041
[MIDORI] Either way,
it seems that you have

258
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,375
a very strong connection
with the Blue Sky Sapphire

259
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,291
and its history.

260
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,625
[RAD] In which case,
we owe you an apology.

261
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,333
Apology for what?

262
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,000
[RAD]
Fourteen years ago--

263
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,958
well, by now I guess it
would be 15 years ago--

264
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,416
it was when we stormed
Fuka Palace...

265
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,916
[BOTH gasp]

266
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,458
[RAD] At that time the previous
leader was still in power.

267
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,041
We were after something that was
hidden underneath the Palace.

268
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,583
So we cooperated with
Schwartz in an invasion.

269
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,333
The man who led us was then
the Minister of the Interior.

270
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,625
He wanted to
assassinate the King.

271
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,958
The Minister?

272
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,166
[RAD]
Yes.

273
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,583
In the ensuing battle,

274
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,708
I fought the Blue Sky Sapphire
and with my own hands...

275
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,166
...I killed her.

276
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,250
Even though she had lost her
powers through childbirth,

277
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,541
she displayed her unwavering
loyalty to the King.

278
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:45,041
She fought me bravely, until the
very last moment of her life.

279
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,375
But what's the point of you
giving us an apology now?

280
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,666
[RAD]
Don't get me wrong.

281
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,708
We also risked our
lives in that battle.

282
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:59,208
It's a simple fact: The strong
survive, and the weak perish.

283
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,041
But... then why...?

284
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,375
[RAD]
A fight is sacred to the Aswad.

285
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,041
If fate decides that one's
life should end in battle,

286
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,625
we will honor that person's life

287
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:11,708
and their remains in the highest
regard, even if it's an enemy.

288
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,166
But in the end,

289
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,083
we were not able to protect
the body of Lena Sayers...

290
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:24,291
[RAD] Not from the conniving
bastard, John Smith.

291
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,083
We never fully trusted
those people to begin with,

292
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,583
but from that point on,

293
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:32,708
we completely severed
all ties with the Schwartz.

294
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,041
Why would the Schwartz
wanna do such a thing?

295
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,125
Arika, in your time
at Garderobe,

296
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,125
were you ever told about how
Gems and nanomachines are made?

297
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,750
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm.

298
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,125
[MIDORI]
Your predecessor,

299
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,375
the legendary Otome,
Fumi Himeno,

300
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,875
her body still remains
sleeping inside the tomb

301
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,750
underneath the mausoleum.

302
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,583
She is the sole master of the
students and the Five Pillars.

303
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,333
She is also the womb
that gives birth

304
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,708
to the Coral and Pearl Gems.

305
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,125
Huh?

306
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,291
In order to create a womb
that gives birth to Gems,

307
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,708
it is necessary to use
the body of an Otome

308
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,000
who has given birth to a child

309
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,125
and become a mother
during her life.

310
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,250
I suspect that that's what
went through Smith's mind.

311
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,375
If he's able to acquire
the technology,

312
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,166
then he'll be able
to make Lena Sayers,

313
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,708
the Blue Sky Sapphire,
a new master for Otomes.

314
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,708
A new predecessor to
challenge the present one.

315
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,083
No way.

316
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,958
[SMITH] Your Highness,
take a look at this.

317
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,125
Oh, is it done?

318
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,291
[SMITH]
Yes.

319
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,666
I must say,

320
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,291
the data from the Garderobe
Research Department's

321
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,083
head professor certainly
came in handy.

322
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,791
[YOHKO]
Midori... Reito...

323
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,958
[NAGI] All right,
now that that's ready,

324
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,750
why don't we have the girls
of Garderobe help us out?

325
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,916
[NINA]
Huh?

326
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,416
[NAGI]
Now whoever wants to--

327
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,625
No, actually, whether
they want to or not,

328
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,041
they can all become an Otome.

329
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,125
Your Highness!

330
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,958
Well, Nina,
let's get right on it.

331
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,083
Can I leave it to you to
take charge of recruitment

332
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,500
and gather candidates
from among the students?

333
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,500
You're leaving it... up to me?

334
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,833
Yep.

335
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,000
And then have those girls
go find Mashiro, so--

336
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,208
[door opens]

337
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,500
[SERGEY] Excuse me,
I have something to say.

338
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,291
[NAGI] Why, Sergey,
you're feeling better already?

339
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,583
Thanks to you.

340
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,500
So, now that you're well,

341
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,666
what does a traitor
like you want from me?

342
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,666
[SERGEY] Nina is still a
student, Your Highness.

343
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,000
There's a chance she could
make errors in judgment.

344
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,541
For this mission,

345
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,125
I humbly request that you put
me in charge instead of her.

346
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,166
[NAGI laughs]

347
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,208
[NAGI]
You certainly are kind.

348
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,666
Okay, then.

349
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,000
Consider this your chance
to reclaim your reputation.

350
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,583
Yes.

351
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,916
[NAGI] But you won't get another
chance after this, understand?

352
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,791
Of course, sir.

353
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,041
[NINA]
Father...

354
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,625
[MIDORI]
They say a long time ago,

355
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,708
this planet was green
and bountiful.

356
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,375
Must've been truly beautiful.

357
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,041
But it became a wasteland during
the War of the Twelve Kings

358
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,958
because of the weapons,
that power of science.

359
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,875
The old homeland of our people,
the Black Valley,

360
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,208
disappeared overnight due to
a massive weapons malfunction.

361
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:09,083
The survivors and descendants...
were all left with a disease.

362
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,041
Our so-called "curse" for
using that deadly weapon.

363
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,375
[RAD]
As a result,

364
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,416
we Aswad have been regarded
as the cursed tribe.

365
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,708
Since that time, we have
been hated and oppressed.

366
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,541
[LUMEN]
You two saw Luo, right?

367
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,583
He was the little boy
with the crutches.

368
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,000
His sickness has already
begun to show itself.

369
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,500
He won't live very long.

370
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,708
[BOTH gasp]

371
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,208
[RAD]
We were the same.

372
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,083
All of us became sick at a
young age, and would've died.

373
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,250
But with help of our
remaining powers of science,

374
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,958
we have become cyborgs.

375
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,583
We exist as the living dead,

376
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,458
but we still live,
if only temporarily.

377
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,625
There's only one hope
for curing this sickness,

378
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,166
and that is to acquire the help

379
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,208
of Garderobe's
nanomachine technology.

380
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,250
I started succumbing to the
sickness when I was 17.

381
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,333
That means I'm as
good as dead now.

382
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,833
But this REM,

383
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,083
this jewel was created by
analyzing the Gem of an Otome.

384
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:03,875
Because of it my life has
been extended to this day.

385
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,458
And so that's why I'll stay
17 years old forever.

386
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,958
[BOTH gasp]

387
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,541
It's ironic.

388
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,500
We die because of science, and
now we need science to cure us.

389
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,333
How funny.

390
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,833
But this by itself
is not enough.

391
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,708
Because this is an imitation,
it's too unstable.

392
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,500
We'll never know when the
nanomachines will malfunction.

393
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,583
That's why we must
obtain the real thing.

394
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,250
To survive, we must obtain all
the knowledge and powers

395
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,625
that humanity created
and Garderobe sealed.

396
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,000
[ERSTIN] You said it yourself,
didn't you, Arika?

397
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,500
That if everybody
had this technology...

398
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,958
...then all of us
would all be happy!

399
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,000
There wouldn't be...
any more...

400
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,458
...any more wars...

401
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,125
If we are to fulfill our wishes,

402
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,208
then we will need
every great power

403
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,041
and every single person
we can get on our side.

404
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,250
Arika, Mashiro, please
lend us your strength.

405
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,583
We need the power of
the Blue Sky Sapphire.

406
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,000
The power of a Meister Otome.

407
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,041
[ARIKA gasping]

408
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,458
[ARIKA]
No!

409
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,875
Arika?

410
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:04,708
[MIDORI]
Hm.

411
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,250
[ARIKA]
No! I don't wanna!

412
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't want this anymore!

413
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,750
I'm done! I don't
wanna be an Otome!

414
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,458
I never wanna use an
Otome's powers again!

415
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,291
Arika!

416
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,041
Arika!

417
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,583
[GAL] Leader. We've received
a letter from Cardair.

418
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,375
[MASHIRO]
Wait! Arika!

419
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,625
I can't do this!

420
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,875
I don't wanna do these
kinda things anymore!

421
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,333
Arika!

422
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,375
Mikoto! Get her!

423
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,166
[ARIKA yelps]

424
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,666
[MASHIRO]
Arika.

425
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,208
[ARIKA cries]

426
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,333
Arika...

427
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,208
[MASHIRO]
Arika...

428
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,375
[MIKOTO yowls]

429
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,125
[MASHIRO]
Huh?

430
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:04,666
[ARIKA]
Huh?

431
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,416
[yowling]

432
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,000
[rumbling]

433
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,666
[BOTH scream]

434
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,833
[screeching]

435
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,250
[ARIKA] So I was wondering,
Commander, what's your real age?

436
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,791
[MIDORI] I already told you,
I'm 17 years old.

437
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,000
[ARIKA]
For real? But...

438
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,041
[YUKARIKO]
Hey, Arika!

439
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,583
[ARIKA]
Huh?

440
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,541
[YUKARIKO] If the Commander
says she's 17, then she's 17!

441
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,291
Doubting her would
be a big no-no!

442
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,958
[ARIKA]
Miss Yukariko?
