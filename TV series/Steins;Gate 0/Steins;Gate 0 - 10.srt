[MAHO]
Kurisu and me.

4
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,458
[MAHO] One of those composers,
Amadeus Mozart

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,583
was blessed
with natural genius.

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,958
The other,
Antonio Salieri, was not,

7
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,666
and he viewed Mozart
as his lifelong rival.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,750
That's K331.

9
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,958
Mozart's Piano Sonata
Number 11.

10
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,833
Movement One, A Major.

11
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,666
I didn't realize you were
a fan of his music.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,666
[MAKISE] Yeah, I am.
I love it, actually.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,166
One of my favorite quotes is

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,291
"Death means not getting
to listen to Mozart."

15
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,208
I don't think I've ever
heard that one.

16
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,375
Well, there's no hard proof

17
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,666
that Einstein
actually said those words,

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,291
but I don't really care.

19
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,083
I think it's a highly
logical statement,

20
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,625
so I like it regardless.

21
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,750
[MAHO]
Logical?

22
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,291
I mean, you can't
listen to Mozart

23
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,583
when you're dead,
you know.

24
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,583
Yeah, but I'd just
call that obvious.

25
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,833
Right?! Blatantly obvious.

26
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,791
If you're dead,
you can't listen.

27
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,291
It's a true statement.

28
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,916
Huh?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,833
[MAKISE]
Makes perfect sense.

On July 28th, 2010...

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,708
...Makise Kurisu was ripped
from this world.

32
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,833
[MAHO]
Amadeus and Salieri.

33
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,375
[MAHO]
The story of those two men

34
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,208
holds special meaning for me.

35
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,041
[MAHO]
I loved Kurisu.

36
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,541
Adored her, even.

37
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,291
[MAHO]
But on top of that,

38
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,875
I respected her.

39
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,791
I aspired to be like her.

40
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,958

If everyone who happens

would donate

then I will eat a can of Oden."

47

The Professor never gets tired
of joking around, does he?

Yo, Maho!

49
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,583
I'd like to welcome you to our
new powered-up prep room.

[MAHO] Are you referring
to the coffee table and couch?

51
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes! It calls to mind
one of my favorite quotes.

52
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,333
"Keeping it simple is the secret

53
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,541
on the long journey
towards truth."

54
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,458
[MAHO] And whose words
would those be?

55

They're mine, naturally.

[AMADEUS]
Negative.

Or none that
I'm aware of in any case.

All good here.

Good indeed.

I'll let Okabe know
everything's in order now.

[AMADEUS] Great, but even
if he knows that I'm restored,

72
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,791
I'm still not certain that
he'll be willing to talk.

73
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,250
Why say that?

74
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,125
I get the feeling
he likes talking to you

75
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,750
a whole lot more than me.

76
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,750
And the feeling seems mutual.

77
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,416
[MAHO] Hmm? Can you please
stop saying stuff like that?

78
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,791
As I've told you before,
it's fallacious.

79
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,875
[AMADEUS] But based on
my observation and analysis,

80
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,250
I believe it's a highly
probable deduction.

than it was a few days ago.

You don't have to, you know.

109

It's quite all right.
A lot's happened since then.

110
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,500
I've been thinking
it's about time

that I got on with my life.

Because I always know
just how to get things done!

00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,458
I think I see
what her plan was.

117
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,916
She had one goal in mind:

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,750
to get this room cleaned up!

119
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,125
And if you're here
that's bound to happen?

120
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,333
I think it's more that
if I came here to help,

121
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,000
I would most likely
bring a certain

I don't wanna hear
you say anything

except "Yes, ma'am!"

As far as I'm concerned,

134

all you're good for is
squirming around in garbage.

That's Sergeant Clean.

I've got an idea!

From now on, I'm gonna
call you "Mr. Smiley Bear."

You like that,

Yes, I do, Sergeant Clean!

That's just dandy,
Mr. Smiley Bear!

157
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,500
Now get your butt
into the hall

158
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,666
and sweep the whole thing
up and down ten times!

Right away, Sergeant Clean!

than is appropriate.

00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,875
[MAHO] What, exactly,
is the point here?

163
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,208
Almost forgot.

164
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,125
You and Kiryu are supposed
to vacate the premises

165
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,208
till we're done.

166
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,208
Huh?

167
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,000
No one told me that.

168
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,791
Orders are from the home owner.

169
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,125
So you can't refuse.

170
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,041
[NAE] You call that clean,
Mr. Smiley Bear?

171
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,166
[MAHO]
So, what's up?

172
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,541
You uncover anything else?

173
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,083
[OKABE]
No new developments.

174
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,458
I've got a hunch
as to the culprits,

175
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,375
but without solid evidence,
I can't be sure.

176
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,916
Wouldn't want another
SERN situation.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,958
[MAHO]
SERN?

178
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,083
[OKABE]
Oh, uh, nothing. Never mind.

179
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,541
[MAHO]
Okay.

180
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,666
I still can't seem to wrap
my head around everything.

181
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,916
I never would have thought
Kurisu would be

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,833
researching time machines.

183
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,000
[OKABE]
It's the truth.

184
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,375
[MAHO]
I didn't accuse you of lying.

185
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,416
It just seems so crazy,
that's all.

186
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Though I should just
expect it by now.

187
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,125
[keyboard clicking]

188
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,541
[OKABE]
Salieri?

189
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,833
[MAHO] It's my username
for the college's online portal.

190
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,083
I thought I told you that.

191
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,208
Oh, right.

192
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,291
Does it have
special significance?

193
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,791
Not really.

194
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,166
Okay.

195
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,125
[MAHO]
Antonio Salieri.

196
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,250
The man known primarily

197
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,166
for his obsession
with Amadeus Mozart.

198
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,666
Heard of him?

199
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,416
[OKABE] Yeah, isn't there
a movie about that?

200
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,041
From the '80s?

201
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,041
[MAHO]
That's the one.

202
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,250
Salieri showed promise,
in his own right,

203
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,458
as a court composer in Vienna.

204
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,000
But his envy
of Mozart's talent

205
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,083
drove him to despair.

206
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,666
In the end, Salieri's
hounding and interference

207
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,958
are said to have brought
about Mozart's demise.

208
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,541
[OKABE]
Are you saying...?

209
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,916
[MAHO sighs]
Don't worry.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,291
It's not as dark
as you might be thinking.

211
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,375
But still...

212
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,708
[OKABE grunts]

00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,208
Okabe?

215
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,291
Hi!

216
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,791
[OKABE]
Hi. It's been a minute.

217
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,750
You haven't changed at all.

218
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,208
Yeah. Same to you.

219
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,666
[AMADEUS]
Duh, of course, I haven't!

220

--I'm AI, remember?
--[computer chimes]

221
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,041
[MAHO]
I don't know.

222
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,750
It doesn't feel right at all.

223
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,708
I'm just gonna
have to rearrange it

224
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,208
to my liking later.

225
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,458
The others would kill you

226
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,791
if they heard you
disrespecting their work.

227
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,333
Okarin! Sorry we kept you.

228
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,125
[OKABE] The Taskmaster
pooped out, huh?

229
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,125
Yep!

230
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,375
I guess the Sergeant Clean act

231
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,666
really takes
it out of this one.

232
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,250
[DARU] Want me to
carry her now?

233
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,375
Sure, if you want a full-force

from Mr. Tennoji,

235
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,541
then be my guest.

236
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,250
The full-force haymaker
to the head?

237
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,375
[DARU breathes heavily]

238
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,041
All those

239
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,458
scrambled his brains,
the poor sod.

240

[MAYURI] If you can't find
something you need,

241
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,958
let me know and I'll tell you
where we put it.

242
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,083
Thanks for that.

243
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,375
Where did Faris and Kiryu go?

244
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,250
[MAYURI] Dunno, but they said
they'd be right back.

We've returned.

[OKABE] I noticed.
What's with the bags?

250
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,625

to go shopping,

Because I'm--
I'm the one who--

482
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,250
[whimpers]

483
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,333
I'm sorry.

484
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,958
I understand.

485
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,750
It's clear something
went on between you two

486
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,708
that you can't talk about.

487
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,500
We can leave it at that.

488
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,083
Thank you, Hiyajo.

489
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,583
[MAHO]
Every time I see you,

490
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,041
I think the same thing.

491
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,333
"Why does Okabe
always look so sad?"

492
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,166
It's worse when
you talk about Kurisu.

493
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,583
But it's there,
no matter who you're with.

494
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,041
As if you're haunted
by some deep regret.

495
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,833
Like you're wrestling
with the past and can't let go.

496
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,875
And the way you are
with me and Mayuri,

497
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,125
it's like you're trying
to protect us

498
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,416
from something we can't see,

499
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,666
or so I thought until
we were really attacked.

500
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,500
You're actually picking up
on all of that?

501
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,541
Yeah.

502
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm not naive enough to think
you'd tell me the whole story.

503
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,541
But still,

504
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,708
no matter what
you're going through

505
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,833
I want to help
where I can.

506
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,416
--So that's why--
--Why what?

507
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,208
I promised myself
I would never tell anyone this,

508
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,833
but I will.

509
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:13,916
I have her--

510
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,416
I have everything that she--

511
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,083
Kurisu's--

512
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,541
Makise Kurisu's legacy.

513
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,541
Her legacy? Hold on.

514
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,166
[MAHO]
Meaning...

515
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,958
...I have Kurisu's laptop.

516
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,708
[MAHO] With all her notes
and theories intact.

517
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,625
Her research data
and her private data, too.

518
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,375
Her personal computer.

519
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,458
[MAHO] The burglar who
broke into my hotel,

520
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,791
that must have been
what they wanted.

521
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,208
[OKABE whimpering]
Where is it?

522
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,083
I can't figure out
her password.

523
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,458
So, I'm having
a trustworthy source

524
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,041
analyze it to try
and hack in.

525
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,916
--No, you can't!
--Huh?

526
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,083
Kurisu's computer
must not be opened!

527
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,666
It's Pandora's Box!

528
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,041
The data inside is a curse

529
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,750
that leads to the annihilation
of the entire globe!

530
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,791
What are you saying?

531
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,208
Don't you hear me?

532
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,833
The race to build
a time machine

533
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,875
leads America and Russia into
deadly conflict with each other!

534
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,875
Both countries are after
the data on that laptop,

535
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,875
and they will stop at nothing
to get their hands on it!

536
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,666
It's the spark
that ignites war.

537
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,833
That brings about
World War III!

538
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,791
I can't believe it.

539
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,250
World War III?
