Just what in the hell
are you doing

10
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,083
still out in this downpour?

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,458
[OKABE] It's been several months
since Kagari vanished.

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,000
We tried everything
we could to track her down.

13

Any means necessary, but alas.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,791
[OKABE] In the end, there was
just no trace of her anywhere.

00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,000
As for the facility
Moeka and I found,

we never uncovered
its exact purpose.

17
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,375
She was brainwashed?
Are you kidding me?

21
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,458
So, enlisting the help of the

It sure does seem
that way lately.

30
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,750

Because it's the rainy season.

So, I'm assuming you guys
still haven't given up,

47
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,333
since you're
contacting me again.

48
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,666
Of course we haven't!

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,208
Like I already told you,

50
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,958
if we end up not being able
to use the actual time machine,

51
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,708
then we'll be forced to recreate
the time leap machine!

52
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,875
And you really think
that's possible?

53
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,458
[DARU]
I was almost able to finish it

54
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,666
before Okarin freaked out
and trashed the thing,

55
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,041
so, yeah, I do.

56
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,166
But it's not even close
to being stable.

such an absurd amount of data

59
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,333
in order to send it
into the past?

60
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,375
Until you answer that question,
it seems pointless.

61
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,791
Why do you think we're asking
for your help again?

62
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,416
Because we need your mind.

63

Since we can't
ask Okarin anymore,

64

you're our only hope.

Don't assume I can do anything

00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,000
because I'm a scientist.
That's fallacious.

Makise Kurisu did it before.

You had a veritable genius
working on it.

you're as much of a genius

As soon as he hears
what we're up to,

But you know,

Okarin always seems dead serious
when he talks about it.

He says to not even think
about changing the future.

00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,583
And knowing him,

95

I'm sure he's got

Of all people, I understand
where he's coming from.

But still, is what
he fears worse

100
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,541
than letting this timeline
lead the planet

into World War Three?

agree with you

cried in the time machine.

[DARU panting]

00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,666
What happened?

357
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,416
That was Kagari,
but different.

358
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,416
Yeah.

359
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,250
Why would she
ever act that way?

360
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,875
[DARU]
Suzuha, did you notice?

361
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,416
[DARU] I'm pretty sure
Kagari was crying.

[gasping]

Ow!

00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,708
Oh, crap, I'm sorry.

365
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,208
Are you sure we shouldn't
take you to the hospital?

366
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,291
I'm fine.

367
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,458
Just a scratch, I'll make it.

368
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,333
[DARU] So, the woman
in the motorcycle suit

369
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,875
was Kagari all along.

370
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,291
It wasn't.

371
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,125
The person who
attacked you guys,

372
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,416
that was someone else.

373
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,541
At the time of the incident,

374
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,291
Kagari was still
at the shrine.

375
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,833
[DARU]
Then, who?

376
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,166
Not sure,

377
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,916
but I am willing to bet
that Uncle Okarin's theory

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,541
was right in the end.

379
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,541
Kagari actually
was brainwashed,

380
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,958
and whoever did it
is still controlling her now.

381
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,208
But who'd do that? And why?

382
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,083
Twelve years ago,

383
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,666
someone dangerous
must've found out

384
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,583
that she came here
in a time machine,

385
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,708
and so, they captured her.

386
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,583
[gasps]

387
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,125
What's the matter?

388
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,625
[KAGARI]
He talks to me.

389
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
I hear the voice of God.

390
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,708
[KAGARI]
I hear... a voice...

391
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,958
The "voice of God."

392
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,708
--But who--?
--Huh?

393
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,791
It can't be!

394
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,000
Does that mean
that when we left,

395
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,291
she was already...?

396
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,416
Hold on.

397
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,125
I just think I should
let Okarin know.

398
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,250
He'd want me to tell him
Kagari showed up.

399
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah, but think about it.

400
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,750
If he hears
that Kagari is back,

401
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,125
he might become obsessed
with trying to find her again,

402
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,625
and that won't help us.

403
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,500
I mean, consider
what you just witnessed.

404
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,083
Kagari is dangerous.

405
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,708
She's unstable.

406
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,958
And besides,
if Kagari was brainwashed,

407
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,416
I think I know a way
we can undo the damage.

408
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,125
We can get her back.

409
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,666
Although, in order
to save her,

410
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,250
as dangerous
as it would be,

411
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,750
we'll probably have to use
the time machine.

I am such an idiot!

to come back to Japan

about developing

the time leap machine with me,

it takes to finish it,

to see my Mini Maho
in summer clothes, whoo!

let me think this over?

Makise Kurisu
and Okabe Rintaro

must have gone through
extensive trial and error

in some other world line.

they successfully
manipulated time.

I can't believe this.

00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,625
It's an old magazine!

485
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,750
What? Uh. Sure!

486
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,125
[MAHO]
And also...

487
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,750
[MAHO] I can find the solutions
to this problem myself.

488
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,083
Not by scouring your work
to search out the answers,

489
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,291
but by following
a similar path,

490
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,958
and finding my own
way to success.

491
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,125
[MAHO] And so,
I will go back to Japan.

492
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:03,541
To the city where my friend,
Makise Kurisu, lost her life.

493
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,333
My exact reasons are hard
to put into words,

494
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,250
but... but I think,

495
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,958
if I had to explain the impetus,

496
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,250
there was one person
who appreciated Mozart's talent


497
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,500
more than anyone else.

498
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,750
And that was Salieri.
