Of course.

I guess, to Amadeus,

00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,375
the professor who created
the system that spawned them

47

00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,833
Did she actually
call me something

00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,708
as flattering as all that?

51
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,500
Does have a nice ring to it.

52
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,500
[ALEXIS]
Surely inflates one's ego,

53
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,583
to be praised as a god
by such a superior intellect.

54
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,875
Yes, well, that's not
the only hint she gave us.

55

"Our most secret domains
have been unveiled.

If you were able
to interpret that message,

what I'm doing here.

for the greater good.

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,791
I presume you've likely heard

70
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,666
of a little company
called Strategic Focus?

often called
the "Shadow CIA,"

75

she came to Japan.

she turned out to be.

just so happened to steal it

and get away
in the nick of time?

What if they staged
its destruction

into the past instead?

Hi! Too-too-roo!
It's me, Mayushii!

456
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,750
The truth is, I wanted to tell
you all this in person,

457
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,458
but I didn't know
if I'd have the courage

to get it all out.

459
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,166
Plus, I was worried you
might try to stop me,

460
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,791
so I decided it'd be better
to say it this way.

461
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,333
I'm taking the time machine
to the past with Suzuha.

You'll probably
be really upset

and wondering
why right about now.

464
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,250
But this is just something
that I know I have to do.

00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,708
Because that day,

466
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,666
I was the one who did it.

467
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,541
Before then, no matter
how bad things got,

468
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,625

always pick himself back up

I believe I was wrong.

473

Nobody was ever pushing
the full responsibility

of repairing the future
onto you alone.

my very first big mission!

487
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,291
[MAYURI] I'm sure that you're
going to worry about me

488
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,291
a whole lot, but I
think it'll be okay.

489
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,125
Besides, I know in my heart

490
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,166
that if something bad
were to happen,

491
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,291
you would be right there
in a flash to save the day!

492
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,333
The Hououin Kyouma
that I've always adored

493
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,875
will come swooping
to rescue me

494
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,958
in a brand new,
shiny time machine!

495
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,000
That's why I've decided to go.

496
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,583
I promise that
I'll come back someday.

497
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,333
So please, wait for me?

498
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,458
[MAYURI]
And know this.

499
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,708
I love Hououin Kyouma.

500
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,208
But guess what?

501
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,083
I love Okabe Rintaro even more!

502
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,250
More than anything!
