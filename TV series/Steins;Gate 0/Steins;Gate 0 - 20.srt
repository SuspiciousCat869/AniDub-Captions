Let me see.

136
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,000
I was using the time
leap machine

137
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,083
to go back into the past
in order to try to save Mayuri.

138
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,208
But then, when I came to,

139
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,416
I was here.

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,791
Interesting.

141
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,041
I remember the time
leap machine acting up that day.

142
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,500
[gasps]

143
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,333
[DARU] We don't even know
the exact reason for it.

144
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,916
All we could determine
was the thing had failed us.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,583
And so, in order to get back
to that period,

146
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,000
we had to exceed
the 48 hour limit.

147
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,250
Meanwhile, the world
descended into chaos

148
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,125
as the great powers fought
over the time travel theory.

149
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,458
Are you telling me...

150
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,250
...that Mayuri was killed?

151
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,833
Well, all we know for sure
is that Mayushii disappeared.

152
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,416
And, then, a few years
after that happened,

153
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,625
we decided to build the time
machine all by ourselves.

154
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,666
That's what began it.

155
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,625
What we now call Valkyrie.

156
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,000
Is that a code name?

157
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,458
[DARU] Yes, and that
started something else.

158
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,500
Our war against
the rest of the world.

159
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,708
[OKABE]
Meaning what?

160
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,541
You already
know what that means.

161
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,125
Every world power,
racing toward time travel.

162
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,750
They believed Kurisu's
theory to be closest.

163
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,958
And that those
with her knowledge

164
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,416
would complete it first.

165
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,166
Namely, Okabe Rintaro,

166
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,833
along with his organization,
known as Valkyrie.

167
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,583
Everyone on our team
became prey,

168
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,541
hunted down by operatives
from all corners of the globe.

169
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,083
Then came that bleak day
in 2025.

170
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,666
[helicopter blades whirring]

171
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,583
[OKABE] Daru, I've got
some terrible news.

172
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,625
[DARU]
What? Did something happen?

173
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,291
[OKABE] It appears I've
walked into Stratfor's trap.

174
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,000
[DARU] For real? Well, get out!
Make your way here!

175
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,041
--[OKABE] I can't.
--[DARU gasps]

176
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,708
[OKABE] I won't do anything
to jeopardize

177
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,541
the safety
of the other members.

178
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,833
[OKABE]
Listen my friend. Thank you.

179
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,125
Back in the day,
you encouraged me

180
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,958
to keep going when I
was about to break.

181
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,000
And Daru, know that
I'm counting on you.

182
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,541
Finish the machine.

183
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,791
Okarin?

184
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,833
[OKABE] From now on,
it's in your hands.

185
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,708
Wait. Don't hang up!

186
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,541
[SUZUHA]
After that, you were gone.

187
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,000
You fell into
Stratfor's clutches.

188
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,583
And they tortured
you relentlessly.

189
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,375
By the time Dad rescued you
from them, it was too late.

190
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,666
You'd-- Well...

191
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,458
[DARU]
Once I was able to locate you,

192
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,916
you were beyond help.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,958
The ruthless torture
and endless experiments

194
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,500
had simply taken too much
of a toll on your mind.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,750
When I said you were dead,
I meant it--you were.

196
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,125
Hold on, are you--

197
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,541
[DARU]
Mm.

198
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,250
The man I had known
for all those years

199
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,833
died that day.

200
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,375
Even if his body functioned,
his will to live was gone,

201
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,041
or so it seemed.

202
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,958
He was an empty shell,
though technically still alive.

203
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,375
--[gasps]
--[SUZUHA] I don't get it.

204
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,875
Why'd you say
he died, literally?

205
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,166
[DARU] I didn't have
a choice--I had to.

206
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,375
If they'd known,

207
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,916
they never would have
stopped chasing him,

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,250
or clamoring for control,

209
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,083
even in his
diminished condition.

210
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,333
That doesn't explain why you
wouldn't trust your own daughter

211
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,833
to keep it secret!

212
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,375
[OKABE] You're telling me
I've been lying there

213
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,291
in a comatose state
for 11 years?

214
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,041
[DARU] Yeah. Under the care
of a very select few

215
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,625
who knew the truth about you.

216
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,833
I resent that.

217
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:21,916
But more importantly,

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,375
why did he wake up
now after so long?

219
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,166
Because of the time
leap machine.

220
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,458
[DARU]
Exactly right.

221
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,916
Can you elaborate?

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,666
Someone got ahold
of my memories,

223
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,458
and they overwrote my brain
waves with memory data

224
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,666
from my 2011 self.

225
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,000
That's my theory.

226
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,083
And it's an astute
hypothesis, to boot.

227
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,916
We just salvaged that data
from an old PC.

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,541
Though, we didn't expect it
to work right away,

229
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,625
without further testing.

230
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,750
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

231
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,083
Deceiving the world
is one thing,

232
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,291
but then lying
to your own daughter?

233
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,416
Deceive the world?
That phrase is--

234
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,750
[DARU] I'm sure your mind
needs a while

235
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,291
to process
what's happened to you.

236
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,916
So, you should
take it easy for now.

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,541
I'll contact the others.

238
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,666
I'm sure they'll wanna
know you've woken up.

239
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,208
--Contact the others?
--[DARU] Yeah.

240
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,500
You've been out of commission
for 11 years.

241
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,458
The other lab members
have been waiting for this day,

242
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,958
and now it's arrived.

243
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,833
[FARIS]
No issues so far on my end.

244
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,333
All is well here, too.

245
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,583
This is the place, right?

You're 100% sure?

[FARIS]
Should be, meow.

And it's business as usual,
pick up the stuff and go.

Something going on?

[DARU] Is Warrior there
with you, as well?

253

[FARIS]
Yes, meow.

they're the ones

you all these years.

the order to go out

266
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,208
and pick up more rations
in the first place?

267
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,708
We didn't have anything planned
like that for them today.

268

Uh?

What? Are you sure
you've got the right info?

270

We got the message
late last night.

It said we had
to meet here today.

00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,416
We're coming, hold on!

324
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,875
[FARIS]
Ruka-meow!

[OKABE]
Rukako?

328
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,375
Is it you?

329
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,750
[OKABE]
Rukako!

330
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,166
Kyouma? Hey.

331
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,166
I'm here, Rukako!

332
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,000
[RUKA]
That name. I remember.

333
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,250
You're the only one who's ever
called me that, you know.

334
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,416
[coughing]

335
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,958
--[OKABE] Hang in there!
--Thank goodness.

336
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,750
Now that you've finally
come back to us,

337
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,083
I-- I can rest.

338
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,041
Because...

339
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,916
Don't talk.

340
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,583
[RUKA]
Listen, Kyouma.

341
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,416
I mastered it.
Can you believe that?

342
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,958
You tried to teach to me,
so many years ago.

343
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,958
The Seishin Zanma sword-fighting
style, do you remember?

344
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,791
I mastered it
and protected them.

345
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,041
Do you think

346
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,708
I could finally be
a true lab member?

347
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:21,208
I thought, since I did this,
maybe I'm worthy now.

348
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,125
I can be a proper comrade.

349
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,375
Yes.

350
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,625
Come on.

351
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,125
You always have been.

352
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,791
Don't you know?

353
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,958
From the beginning you were...

354
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,000
Lab member 0-0-6!

355
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,666
Thank you.

356
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,125
Ah...

357
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm so happy.

358
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:49,166
This means that I can
face Mayuri and be proud.

359
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,041
[OKABE crying]
Please don't go!

360
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,791
[DARU]
That's a relief.

361
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,333
[DARU]
Ruka wanted to see you again,

362
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,333
more than anything in the world,

363
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,250
and was waiting so patiently
for the day when you'd wake up.

364
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,875
Now, in the end,

365
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,083
that wish
has finally been granted.

366
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,916

367

[door opens, closes]

370
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,041
[MAHO]
It feels like a million years.

371
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,166
Hi, Okabe.

372
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,833
[OKABE]
Hiyajo.

373
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,125
[MAHO]
It's not very strong.

374
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,458
We're always low
on everything, sorry.

375
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,166
It's fine.

376
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,833
I have to admit, I was
surprised to see you again.

377
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,500
Faris, too.

378
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,750
Yeah, of course, and I still
look like a little kid,

379
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,791
no matter how I old I get.

380
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,000
But when you're my age,

381
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,458
you can't help but count
that as a blessing.

382
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,708
I bet you think we're all
being cold about Ruka.

383
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,041
I mean, our close friend
just died,

384
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,791
and everyone around here's
so calm about it. Right?

385
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,458
Do you think we're heartless?

386
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,833
[OKABE]
No.

387
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,208
[MAHO] Ever since that day,
from July 7th of 2011,

388
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,708
until now,

389
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,291
so many people
have been killed.

390
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,791
Close family,

391
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,166
distant relatives,
most of our friends.

392
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,333
Adults and children alike.

393
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:56,416
We can't waste time mourning
every single person we've lost.

394
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,416
That's the reality
we live with now.

395
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,000
[OKABE]
I thought I understood.

396
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,291
Suzuha told me all about
it time and time again.

397
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,416
The future world
that my choice created.

398
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,708
All this misery is
a result of my weakness.

399
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,458
I got it, intellectually.

400
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,166
[crying]

401
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,041
[OKABE]
Not in my heart.

402
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,000
I understood as a scientist,
not as a human being!

403
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,750
I was denying the truth!

404
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,333
Trying to escape
the pain of reality,

405
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,375
like I could outrun it!

406
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,583
But even after I chose
to watch Kurisu die,

407
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,375
I still had to lose
Suzuha and Mayuri,

408
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,958
and Kagari,

409
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,916
and then Yuki.

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,958
Now Rukako.

411
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,333
After all this time

412
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,000
I still don't really understand
a damn thing, do I?

413
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,791
[DARU]
Eleven years ago.

414
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,333
I remember you saying
the same phrase.

415
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,458
So, I guess
you haven't changed.

416
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,958
[OKABE]
Daru.

417
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,916
You said you didn't understand
a damn thing then, either.

418
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,041
Right?

419
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,583
You told me something else, too.

420
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,333
That nothing is meaningless.

421
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,916
It may seem like it, but...

422
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,125
There are countless
failed futures,

423
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,291
and pasts we can never recover.

424
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,500
But even so,

425
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,250
beyond all of them,
there must be a path.

426
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,125
There has to be a way
to reach Steins Gate.

427
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,875
A way to reach it.

428
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,666
Steins Gate?

429
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,541
[OKABE]
Failed futures.

430
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,791
Pasts never to be recovered.

431
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,333
[OKABE]
All of them.

432
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,541
Every world line. I see.

433
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,000
[OKABE]
Hiyajo. Daru.

434
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,375
Right now I only have
my memories through 2011.

435
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,583
Because, using
the time leap machine,

436
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,750
you successfully overwrote
my memories from now

437
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,041
in the year 2036.

438
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,541
Do I understand correctly?

439
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,458
Yeah.

440
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,750
Somewhat reductive,

441
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,208
but you seem
to have the gist of it.

442
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,833
[OKABE]
Which means...

443
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,750
In this world, the time
leap machine still exists.

444
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,750
[BOTH gasp]

445
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,791
Get it ready for me.

446
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,541
Because I'm going to leap again.

447
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,250
Okarin?

448
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,208
But you can't!

449
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,583
[OKABE]
One more time.

450
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,250
I'm going back to find
the way to Steins Gate!
