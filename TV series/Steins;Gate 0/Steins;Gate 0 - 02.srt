161
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,416
Sorry about this. I know.

162
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,541
Who starts crying
out of nowhere?

163
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:57,750
[OKABE] Oh... You two...
must've been close.

164
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,458
We were. Sometimes
it's just... so much.

165
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,666
Your nose, too.

166
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,916
[MAHO]
I'm not a child.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,333
[MAHO blows nose]

168
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,583
[ALEXIS]
There you are, Maho!

169
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,833
Huh?

170
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,875
[ALEXIS] I was wondering
where you were hiding.

171
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,000
Ah! You found our Mr. Einstein.

172
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,375
Glad you could make it
to our little party.

173
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,916
[ALEXIS gasps]

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,666
Don't tell me you've already
gotten into a lovers' quarrel.

175
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,291
How do you usually settle
things like this in Japan?

176
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,416
No. This is not that.

177
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,375
[MAHO]
You've got it all wrong.

178
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,208
[ALEXIS]
Huh?

179
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,333
It's my fault for crying.

180
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,041
We were talking about
Kurisu... and...

181
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,000
[ALEXIS gasps]
Hold on.

182
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,583
Are you telling me that you

183
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,041
were personally
acquainted with Kurisu?

184
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,916
Uh, yeah, that's right.

185
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,791
[ALEXIS] So you met
her here. Interesting.

186
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,333
And you're a university student.

187
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:59,375
I attend Tokyo Denki.
My name's Okabe Rintaro.

188
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,291
[ALEXIS]
And during the seminar,

189
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,958
did you speak out
in defense of our work

190
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,083
because it was
based on her ideas?

191
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,041
Oh, no. Not at all.

192
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:12,541
Actually... I suppose that
might have been part of it.

193
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,125
If that's the case,
then... Maho?

194
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,375
Perhaps it would be a good idea

195
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,000
to introduce Mr. Okabe
to our friend.

196
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,541
To test her.

197
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,375
[gasps]

198
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,416
To test who?

199
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,166
But, Professor,
he's an outsider.

200
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,458
And besides,
he's only a student!

201
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,458
[ALEXIS] If he was friends with
Kurisu, he's hardly an outsider.

202
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,041
We should feel grateful
they knew each other

203
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,041
and embrace this opportunity.

204
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,875
You'll have to forgive me,

205
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,500
but I'm not following
any of this.

206
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,416
Introduce me to who?

207
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,166
It's not a real person.

208
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,625
He means... Amadeus.

209
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,375
[OKABE] Oh. From your
demonstration earlier.

210
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,750
[MAHO]
That was a version of the system

211
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,750
created using my
sampled memories.

212
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,208
But it's not the only one.

213
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,666
We have data from
another researcher.

214
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,625
Wait, another... [gasps]

215
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,333
[OKABE] Amadeus is storing
Kurisu's memories, too?

216
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,041
[ALEXIS] Up until now,
Maho and I have been

217
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,750
the only ones to speak to her,
gauging her functionality,

218
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,708
but our conversations
are beginning to run dry.

219
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,750
So what do you say?

220
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,625
[MAHO]
I'd suggest you think it over.

221
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,958
[MAHO] I don't know what your
relationship with Kurisu

222
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,875
was like, but...

223
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,583
The closer the two of
you were to each other,

224
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:40,875
the harder it will be for
you to meet her as Amadeus.

225
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,125
[OKABE] They're her memories
from nine months ago.

226
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,291
[MAHO]
Hello again.

227
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,958
We're planning to start
a new research organization

228
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,208
made up of neuroscientists
from around the world.

229
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,458
Unfortunately, there's not
much prep room right now.

230
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,833
[OKABE]
Where's the professor?

231
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,083
[MAHO] It's Sunday.
That means he's off.

232
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,208
You came all this way,

233
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,250
but are you sure
you want to do this?

234
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,416
I get the feeling the two of
you were closer than I thought.

235
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,125
It'll be hard.

236
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,125
Amadeus can seem real.

237
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,041
It will sound like her
voice talking to you,

238
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,416
but it's a mimic.

239
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
And even knowing that,
it's easy to forget.

240
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,041
She'll seem alive,

241
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,416
like she's on the other side
of the screen talking to you.

242
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,666
Try to remember,
the Amadeus you'll meet

243
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,250
is constructed from memories
collected from Kurisu in March.

244
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,500
She's not the girl
you became friends with.

245
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,166
That person is dead.

246
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,666
I know that sounds harsh,
but that's how it is.

247
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,125
[OKABE]
Right.

248
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,666
[MAHO]
The more you talk with Amadeus,

249
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,333
the more the truth
will eat at you.

250
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,333
You'll realize your
friend is gone forever

251
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,458
and that there's nothing
you can do to change that fact.

252
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,916
I'm well aware.

253
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,375
Coming to terms with
this... is why I'm here.

254
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,500
I see.

255
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,583
[lock beeps]

256
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,250
[MAHO] Go ahead and
have a seat in that chair.

257
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:20,916
[door closes]

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,291
[MAHO]
No peeking at my password.

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,083
All yours.

260
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,625
[MAHO]
Hmm?

261
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,750
What's wrong?

262
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,208
Nothing.

263
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,041
I've come this far and now
I'm second-guessing myself.

264
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,583
[MAHO chuckles]
It's still not too late.

265
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,458
Run away while you can.

266
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,916
[OKABE]
That's not very comforting.

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,791
[MAHO]
I'm just looking out for you.

268
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,250
Well, then... maybe you should

269
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,875
work on your delivery
and be nicer.

270
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,833
Just like Kurisu, you
lab-obsessed girls are all so--

271
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,666
[MAHO]
So, what?

272
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,458
Uh--I get it.

273
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,291
People who spend all
their time on experiments

274
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,458
sometimes forget
how to interact.

275
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,750
If I'm not mistaken, that sounds
like a slanderous statement.

276
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,208
I should sue you for defamation.

277
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,541
Then I withdraw it.

278
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,875
You can let me buy
you a soda as a truce.

279
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,958
[MAHO laughs]
How cheap.

280
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,166
[AMADEUS]
What's so funny about that...

281
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,791
...ma'am?

282
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,125
[OKABE gasps]

283
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,375
[OKABE] It was her.
She was right in front of me.

284
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,125
Right there.

285
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,458
So close.

286
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,416
[OKABE]
It was her voice.

287
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,916
[OKABE]
Her face.

288
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,666
Go ahead.

289
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,916
You're Okabe Rintaro.

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,416
I see your tag.

291
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,416
I'm Makise Kurisu.
It's a real pleasure.

292
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,166
[MAHO]
Okabe here is a student.

293
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,291
We met after the Amadeus
seminar the other day.

294
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:10,333
He seemed very interested in the
system, so we invited him over.

295
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,041
[AMADEUS]
Really? For you to do that,

296
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,250
there must be something
very special about him.

297
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,958
Um, so, Okabe?

298
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,333
Huh? Uh--

299
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,416
[MIKASE AI]
Are you interested

300
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,791
because you're a
neuroscientist, as well?

301
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,708
[OKABE gasps]

302
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,458
[MAHO]
His major is different,

303
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,541
but he's proven his talent.

304
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,958
Even the Professor has
been impressed by him.

305
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:30,833
[MIKASE AI]
Ohh!

306
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,166
[MIKASE AI giggles]

307
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,666
[MIKASE AI]
Psst! Ma'am.

308
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,875
[MAHO]
Hmm?

309
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,000
[MIKASE AI]
Could you scoot a little closer

310
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,333
to the speaker for a second?

311
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,500
Huh?

312
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,208
[MIKASE AI]
Please, just do it. Come on!

313
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,458
[MAHO groans]
Bossy avatar.

314
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,958
Could it be that...

315
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,916
[MAHO] Huh?! You've
gotta be kidding me!

316
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,833
[MIKASE AI] You don't have
to be embarrassed about it.

317
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,666
I'm gonna program you to stop
asking crazy things like that!

318
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,000
What was her question?

319
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:54,916
[MAHO]
Just forget about it!

320
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,583
Uh, yeah, sure. Okay.

321
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,208
[MAHO] You don't say another
childish word, got it?

322
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,583
We didn't bring Okabe here

323
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,083
to talk about absurd
imaginings without any basis.

324
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,291
[MIKASE AI] The more you evade,
the more suspicious you are.

325
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,833
[MAHO]
I'll upload a virus.

326
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,208
[MIKASE AI gasps]
Just kidding! I'll drop it.

327
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,750
Stupid AI.

328
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,875
This is one of the many bugs
we're facing with Amadeus.

329
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,291
Sorry about that.

330
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,458
Feel free to have a
conversation if you like.

331
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,375
[OKABE]
Sure.

332
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,833
[MIKASE AI]
Please forgive me.

333
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,666
You can ask me about
anything and everything.

334
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,083
I'll answer as much
as I am able to.

335
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,291
Anything, huh?

336
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:34,458
Do you think one...
could construct a time machine?

337
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,875
A time machine? Really?

338
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,083
Yes.

339
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,083
[MIKASE AI]
Well, uh...

340
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,541
This is your question?

341
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,750
Why ask about something
like that? How odd.

342
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,958
[OKABE]
It's a thought experiment.

343
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,125
Huh.

344
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,625
Interesting.

345
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,833
My personal belief is no,
time machines aren't possible.

346
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,833
However, that isn't to say that
they're altogether impossible.

347
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,500
[OKABE gasps]

348
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,541
My belief is that
time machines--

349
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,916
You don't think it's all
just a bunch of nonsense?

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,375
[MIKASE AI] It would be
rather hasty to assume that.

351
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,416
[OKABE] There are a number
of time travel theories,

352
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,875
but they're nothing
but speculation.

353
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,541
All of them are unrealistic.

354
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,416
Even so, we could be missing
that one critical discovery

355
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,416
that unlocks a new
understanding, don't you think?

356
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,458
[OKABE] So they're not
possible at the moment,

357
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,583
but... that's not to say
they won't be in the future.

358
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,375
[MIKASE AI]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

359
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,583
How's that?

360
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,125
The answer she gave me just now

361
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,958
was somewhat different than
when I spoke to her before.

362
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,375
Oh.

363
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,791
[OKABE] Could it be
these changes are due to

364
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,208
the differences in the
alpha and beta world lines?

365
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,916
[door beeps, opens]

366
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,916
Rintaro! Hello, friend.

367
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,333
Or should I say
"konnichiwa"? [laughs]

368
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,833
And the American way's,
uh, "What up, dawg"?

369
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,000
[ALEXIS]
What?

370
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,416
[AMADEUS]
Oof. Now that was embarrassing.

371
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,000
[OKABE gasps]
Don't you start, Christina!

372
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,583
[OKABE gasps]

373
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,875
Who's Christina?

374
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,916
[OKABE sputters]
Uh, no one.

375
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,583
Just... forget the name.

376
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,833
[MIKASE AI]
But now I'm curious.

377
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,000
It was an accident, so drop it!

378
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,250
[MIKASE AI] You're clearly very
worked up about something.

379
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,500
Is Christina--

380
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,833
[OKABE] Why must you be
so difficult, Christin--

381
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,000
I mean, Kurisu.

382
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,041
[MAHO] Why do you
keep calling her that?

383
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,375
Don't you start piling
on top of me, too.

384
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,458
[MIKASE AI]
Answer me.

385
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,500
Mute yourself.

386
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,208
Oh, wow, now I
really wanna know.

387
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,333
[ALEXIS laughs]

388
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:24,041
Our Amadeus is pretty
amazing, eh, Rintaro?

389
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,583
[OKABE]
A tester?

390
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,708
[ALEXIS] Yes. We want
you to talk to Amadeus

391
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:33,125
from time to time, so we
can expand our data set.

392
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,333
You'll be able to do so
until I return to America.

393
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,666
All we ask is that you visit
us here at the institute

394
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,375
twice a month to
submit your findings.

395
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,375
You want me writing reports?

396
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,000
[ALEXIS] Nothing too formal.
It shouldn't be much trouble.

397
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,833
You can talk with her
whenever you feel like it

398
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,291
and give us your
honest reactions

399
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,875
as to how the system is working.

400
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,416
With Kurisu...

401
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,875
[ALEXIS] If you're not up to the
task, don't hesitate to decline.

402
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,416
I can completely understand
if it's too heartbreaking

403
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,250
to speak to an AI created with
the likeness and personality

404
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,875
of your deceased friend.

405
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,791
[OKABE]
I'll do it.

406
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,750
[MAHO]
Are you sure about this?

407
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,750
We're already getting to
the point where you and I are

408
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,500
running out of new things
to talk to her about.

409
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,833
Plus, I'm quite curious to
see if this changes Amadeus.

410
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,250
How will she react to conversing
with someone on the outside?

411
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,583
[MAHO] Somehow,
I knew this was gonna happen.

412
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,916
Did you now?

413
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,250
[MAHO]
Yes.

414
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,000
From the moment I found out
that he knew Kurisu.

415
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,500
[MIKASE AI] Okabe Rintaro,
I hope we meet again.

416
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,583
[MAHO]
There's somebody out there

417
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,791
who knows a Kurisu I don't.

418
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,708
[MAKISE]
Ma'am. Excuse me?

419
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,791
[MAHO]
Hmm?

420
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,791
[MAKISE]
Why don't I grab that for you?

421
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,458
[MAHO] I'm fine.
I don't need anybody's help!

422
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,416
[MAKISE chuckles]
There's no need to be stubborn.

423
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,416
[MAHO groans]

424
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,375
Here.

425
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,541
[AMADEUS]
Ma'am?

426
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,250
You really need to
watch the tone you take

427
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,375
around this new person.

428
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,583
Why is that?

429
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,875
[MIKASE AI]
He could find it unattractive.

430
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,166
I told you to stop
bringing up foolish things.

431
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,833
[MIKASE AI] But this might
be the last chance you have

432
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,041
at love in your l--

433
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,375
You're the only one who
needs to learn some manners.

434
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,375
[OKABE]
An operation?

435
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,916
Yup! Daru and I thought of it.

436
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,458
A big, festive operation
to cheer up Suzu!

437
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,791
Uh, what exactly are
we talking about here?

438
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,250
To be honest, Suzu actually
scares me a little bit,

439
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,250
but I think she's really
a nice person at heart.

440
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,333
Sometimes when I'm half
asleep, she tiptoes over

441
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,000
--[phone buzzing]
--and puts a blanket on me.

442
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,958
And she's always helping
Ruka and the others

443
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,375
with whatever they
have going on.

444
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,208
[OKABE gasps]

445
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,208
[MAYURI]
Are you okay?

446
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,208
[OKABE]
Yeah.

447
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,666
[MAYURI] So we're thinking of
throwing Suzu a Christmas party

448
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,458
as a present to help brighten up
her day. Doesn't that sound fun?

449
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,750
A party, huh?

450
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,875
Are you busy?

451
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,625
It's not that I'm busy.

452
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,000
I just doubt Suzuha
would want me there.

453
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,916
I'd probably just upset her.

454
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't think
that's true, though.

455
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,833
Suzu wants to patch
things up with you

456
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,750
and be friends again.
I'm positive.

457
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,791
--[phone buzzing]
--[gasps]

458
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,000
[MAYURI] You should
answer whoever's calling.

459
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,666
I'll wait for you
right here in the park.

460
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,875
I'll be quick.

461
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,583
[AMADEUS sighs] I see you
finally decided to pick up

462
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,166
after ignoring my calls
eight times in a row.

463
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,958
[OKABE]
Well, I was busy.

464
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,458
[AMADEUS] If you don't
feel like talking to me,

465
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,541
I suppose it can't be helped.

466
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,541
[scoffs] It's just...
with you being a tester,

467
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,250
I thought I'd get to chat with
more people than I used to.

468
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:46,750
[OKABE] That's her. I know that
spunk and that moodiness...

469
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,125
The fierce curiosity
driving her...

470
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,666
The refusal to lose.

471
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,750
[AMADEUS] Why aren't you
saying anything? In any case,

472
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,750
you can call me whenever
you feel like it, I guess.

473
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,166
But I'm a busy person, too,

474
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,791
so I might not be
able to answer you.

475
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,958
[OKABE]
Without a doubt...

476
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,875
It's Makise Kurisu.
