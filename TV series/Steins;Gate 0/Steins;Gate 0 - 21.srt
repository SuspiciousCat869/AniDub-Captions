1
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,083
[MAHO]
It's theoretically possible.

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:17,000
However, theory and actuality
are two different things.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,833
To leap to 2011,

4
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:22,625
the toll on your mental health
alone would be colossal.

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,666
Even if we take the
improvements into account

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,208
that enable you to leap
two weeks in one go.

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,875
In order to go back
a single year,

8
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,083
you would have to make
more than 20 leaps.

9
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,125
That's less than
a tenth of the goal.

10
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,708
Then, once you reach the
period prior to the upgrade,

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,500
you'll only be able to leap
48 hours at a time.

12
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,916
Add that up and...

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,208
It's gonna take me around
3,000 leaps to reach 2011.

14
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,166
[MAHO]
That's an absurd amount.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,000
[DARU]
You're really going back?

16
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,958
Yeah.

17
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:55,583
If I intend to change this
world, I have no other choice.

18
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,625
It appears you're resolute.

19
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,791
Well, long time no see,
Okabe Rintaro.

20
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,208
Kurisu?

21
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,750
The entire time
you were in a coma,

22
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,250
she was monitoring your vitals

23
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,916
and making sure
you didn't die on us.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,083
Just so you know.

25
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,083
Amadeus watched me?

26
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,000
[AMADEUS] I can't fight
for the cause physically.

27
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,208
I had to do something.

28
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,625
[OKABE]
But still, for 11 years?

29
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:21,666
That's a long time.

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,000
Time is meaningless to me,

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,875
and monitoring patterns
like that is fun,

32
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,666
so it was no sweat.

33
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,291
[MAHO]
Also, she'll be your partner

34
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,583
for the long journey ahead.

35
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,166
A sort of checkpoint,
along the way.

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,250
So, rest assured that, no matter
how many times you leap back,

37
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,958
until you reach 2025,
she'll be right there,

38
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,333
ready and able to assist you
every time you wake up.

39
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,291
[AMADEUS]
But be gentle.

40
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,458
When you woke up this time,

41
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,250
you broke my
terminal, you brute.

42
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,416
Each time you come to,
if you'll just let me know

43
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,375
that you got there
via time leaping,

44
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,375
I'll do whatever I can to help.

45
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,291
We'll get you back
to 2011. 'Kay?

[AMADEUS]
What?

00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,916
[OKABE]
Nothing. It's just...

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,250
That reminded me of a similar
conversation I had once before.

49
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,291
[OKABE]
I won't run.

50
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,708
Not any longer.

00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,666
[OKABE]
Mayuri once said

52
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,541
it wasn't right for me to carry
the full weight of this alone.

53
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,666
Somewhere along the way,

54
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,000
her kindness became
an excuse for me.

55
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,708
But now?

56
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,625
I see that the only reason
I'm still standing

57
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,458
is my friends were there.

58
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,791
I'm alive, and I owe that

59
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,416
to their adamant
refusal to give up.

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,916
No one ever forced me
to bear the future alone.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,625
These people are
willing to help me,

62
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,916
and the future
belongs to them, too.

Easy, no sudden movements.

I traveled here from two

I'm aware that it's
now the year 2036,

and I've learned
what the world's become

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,458
If only we'd been
a little bit faster.

163
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,250
Had we gotten you out
of there one day sooner,

164
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,416
we could've sent you on your way
with plenty of time to spare.

165
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,083
I feel terrible.

166
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,416
I'm equally at fault for
failing to further improve

167
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,375
the time leap machine.

168
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:51,000
I just couldn't do it.
Two weeks is my best.

169
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,333
Three hundred and thirty-six
hours isn't nearly good enough.

170
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,291
I let you down.

171
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,833
Like hell you did.

172
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,375
In fact, you don't know
how grateful I am

173
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,208
that you were able
to manage a two-week leap.

174
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,125
That's more than
Kurisu ever could.

175
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,208
She only figured out how to
go back as far as 48 hours.

176
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,666
So you'd better
be proud of yourself.

177
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah!

178
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,791
[MAHO]
That's not my only concern.

179
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,791
There's still
the possibility that,

180
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,500
if the world-line gets
altered, even slightly,

181
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,833
then the existing situation
could be compromised,

182
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,000
and you could end up
losing your life.

183
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,291
If that happened,
it might change the past.

184
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,791
I understand.

185
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,041
[OKABE]
Regardless, I'm going back.

186
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,541
I've already come
this far from 2036.

187
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,000
I've covered 11 years
in hundreds of leaps.

188
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,666
And with the help of my friends
every step of the way,

189
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,416
I've gotten where I am.

Listen, my friends!

Every one of you have
fought wholeheartedly.

196

Against all odds.

So please, don't ever give up!

We're all heading to
the rendezvous point now!

209
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,708
We'll be waiting for
you there, so hurry!

Be careful.

What? Okabe?

212
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,208
Aren't you in the middle
of the operation?

213
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,333
[OKABE]
Listen closely.

214
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,166
I just leapt here
from the future.

215
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,708
[AMADEUS]
What?

216
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,541
[OKABE] I understand that
might be hard to believe,

217
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,291
but I don't have time
to convince you.

218
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,125
You'll just have to trust me,
because I need your help.

219
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,791
Okay. Wha--?

220
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,958
[OKABE]
In a little while,

221
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,750
I will be captured
by peacekeeping squads,

222
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,750
who will then proceed
to torture me to death.

223
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,000
[gasps]

224
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,458
What should I do?
There has to be something.

225
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,083
Some way to escape that fate
and change the outcome.

226
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,625
[AMADEUS] Well, we do know
why you get caught.

227
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,125
Because we've heard it
from you time and again.

228
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,750
Okabe Rintaro dies,
but not before the year 2025.

229
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,791
You've always used that
fact to your advantage.

230
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,250
You've risked it all and lived.

231
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,291
But if today is the culmination
of these events you've foreseen,

232
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,500
that kernel of information
that's been your protector

233
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,083
all this time will turn
against you, as predicted.

234
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,916
It seems no matter what you do,
the world line will converge.

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,291
And you'll still get captured
by the Organization.

236
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,416
Yes, but even so--

237
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,708
[AMADEUS]
I've got it.

238
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,458
Do you think you can
give me ten minutes?

239
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,458
I have a plan.

240
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,625
All Right. Sure.

241
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,375
[AMADEUS]
Good.

242
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,208
And in that time...

243
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,708
[AMADEUS] ...memorize this
map of enemy positions.

244
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,791
Wait. What would
the point of that be?

245
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,250
[AMADEUS]
Are you trying to be obtuse?

246
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,000
Am I not the one who typically
guides you to safety?

247
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,000
If we assume they've set
a trap for you,

248
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,958
there's an high probability
that your death

249
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,916
is a direct result of being
in communication with me.

250
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,125
In which case...

251
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,750
[OKABE] I need to uninstall
the Amadeus app.

252
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,083
[AMADEUS]
Yes, and for good measure,

253
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,166
you'd better remove
your radio battery.

254
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,625
That might be enough
to throw them off.

255
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,625
Another thing.

256
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,541
Use the others as decoys?

257
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,708
But I refuse!

258
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,291
[AMADEUS]
Relax!

259
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,208
So you did just tell me you
came from the year 2036,

260

way, didn't you?

261
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,583
Yeah.

262
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,291
[AMADEUS] So, you've seen
for yourself that your friends

263
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,750
are alive in the future.

264
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,583
Therefore, you know
they can't die today.

265
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,791
Still!

266
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,625
[FARIS]
It's okay, Kyou-meow!

267
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,291
Kurisu already filled us all in.

268
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,375
We're running circles around
the city to confuse the enemy!

269
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,375
So you had better make
a bee-line for the lab

270
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,625
and get to the time-leap
machine right meow!

271
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,166

00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,625
[MAHO]
Hm?

320
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,583
I need to be punched.

321
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,083
What? Like, again?

322
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,125
Uh, I'd rather not repeat--

323
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,875
[OKABE]
Don't you dare hold back!

324
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,916
Put every ounce of your pent-up
anger and resentment into it!

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,458
Your worry for Suzuha.

326
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,958
I want you to take all that
and hit me in the face with it!

327
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,250
I'd have pegged
you for a sadist.

328
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,000
You know I deserve it. Right?

329
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,541
I've had my head in the
sand this whole time.

330
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,000
I've been letting fear
run me around,

331
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,708
so I've earned a good clout.

332
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,875
You're crazy, but... okay.

333
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,083
Don't do it!

334
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,166
[MAHO gasps]

335
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,375
Now.

336
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,416
[growls]

337
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,250
Let it fly!

338
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,458
[MAHO gasps]

339
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:41,875
[DARU]
Uh.

340
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,708
You knocked him out.

341
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,083
[OKABE chuckling]

342
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,041
[BOTH]
Hmm?

343
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,541
[OKABE]
Ah, sweet inertia.

344
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,333
It would appear that
you're my right-hand man

345
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,750
in more ways than one,
dearest hack.

346
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:02,541
I have just time-leapt back here
from the distant future.

347
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,125
[DARU]
You okay, Okarin?

348
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,708
[OKABE]
Oh, not so, Daru.

349
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,250
[MAHO]
Uh...

350
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,791
[chuckling]

351
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,250
[DARU]
That cackle stirs my soul!

352
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,625
[gasps]

353
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,708
[MAHO]
Huh?

354
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:28,750
[OKABE laughing]

355
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:41,333
[OKABE]
You shall call me Kyouma!

356
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,125
[MAHO]
Kyouma?

357
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,833
[OKABE]
Yes.

358
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:50,291
Otherwise known as
lab member 001!

359
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,083
The demiurge of this devil's
workshop! Anarchy incarnate!

360
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,666
Archon buffeted by
the passions of chaos!

361
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,875
And the consummate
mad scientist himself.

362
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,125
[DARU squeals]

363
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:05,666
I am the one and only...
Houoin Kyouma!

364
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,541
[MAHO]
Whoa.

365
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,375
What the... fresh hell?

366
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,083
Bitchin'!

367
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,000
Huh?

368
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,916
[OKABE]
You! The Lilliputian!

369
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,125
--Me?
--[OKABE] Yes, you!

370
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,208
[OKABE]
Would anyone else in this room

371
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,666
answer to such a moniker?

372
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,916
Fetch me my lab coat.
Do it at once!

373
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,583
Uh! Hey!
You could ask nicely!

374
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,125
[OKABE]
Behold, my sacred white armor,

375
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,000
bestowed upon me by the fates!

376
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,083
The moment my arms slide
through their hallowed sheaths,

377
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,500
I will truly awaken
from my slumber!

378
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:34,208
[laughing]

379
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,291
Oh, man!

380
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,708
So, um, care to
explain? What's this?

381
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,125
He's reverted back
to the old Okarin.

382
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,875
The Okarin who's crazy
and nonsensical.

383
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,291
Taken by flights
of delusional fancy.

384
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,541
Our true leader has
returned to us at last!

385
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,833
[OKABE] You complete the time
leap machine, minions.

386
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,416
My presence here serves
as irrefutable proof.

387
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,416
Lilliputian!

388
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,958
[MAHO]
Okay! That's enough!

389
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,916
As of this moment, I officially
bequeath this title to you:

390
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,666
Lab member 009.

391
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,708
You are forthwith a hand
of Hououin Kyouma,

392
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,125
and shall aid
in our operations.

393
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,416
Hiyajo Safina.

394
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,583
[MAHO]
What? Who the hell is that?

395
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,375
And now! I call a
round table meeting!

396
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,708
Summon forth all the other
lab members at once!

397
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,291
[FARIS]
What's going on meow?

398
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,875
[RUKA]
Yeah, um...

399
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,125
Would you mind telling us why
you brought us all here, Okabe?

400
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,041
[OKABE]
It's Kyouma!

401
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,500
[gasps]

402
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,250
[OKABE] Because a new operation
is about to commence!

403
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,583
And for it to succeed,

404
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,625
every lab member must
do their part, understood?

405
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,666
So where are Suzuha and Mayuri?

406
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,333
And Moe-meow texted me
saying she was busy, too.

407
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,875
Shiina had to, uh--

408
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,458
Despair not, friends!

409
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,041
Though these absences
are to be expected,

410
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,833
the operation must
take place as planned,

411
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,500
lest the planet be doomed!

412
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,500
Ah! So the red star
I saw glowing...

413
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,708
[OKABE] I hereby proclaim
this Operation Vega!

414
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,958
[MAHO] You want us to
recover Amadeus' data?

415
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,833
Indeed.

416
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,416
If you must confirm it,

417
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,750
she's left a cryptic
message on @channel.

418
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,083
Leskinen has already
spirited her away.

419
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,666
[MAHO]
Huh? The professor?

420
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,708
But why would he do that?

421
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,250
It's confirmed!

422
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,916
And just like you said, the
occult board has been hacked!

423
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,750
The Organization has
even tipped their hand

424
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,291
by jamming cellular
phone signals

425
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,125
all throughout Akihabara.

426
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,000
And so, Faris!

427
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,083
Meow?

428
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,291
[OKABE]
Deploy the neighborhood watch

429
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,041
to the Radio Building's
perimeter.

430
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,166
They should see several
suspicious-looking foreigners

431
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,291
in the vicinity.

432
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,791
Relay the intelligence
back here.

433
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,958
We must rely on pay phones
for the duration!

434
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,208
Roger that, meow!

435
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,000
Wait, the Radio Building?

436
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,000
Mayuri and the Part-time Warrior
are headed there as we speak.

437
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,000
[DARU, MAHO gasp]

438
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,625
[MAHO]
No! We have to stop them!

439
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,291
Such an attempt
would be in vain.

440
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,375
Convergence will likely bring
about the same end result.

441
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,916
There is but one means by which
to save them now. Yes.

442
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,125
Huh?

443
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,083
[OKABE]
Kyouma here. Right.

444
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,125
The operation has
a sole objective.

445
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,958
To ensure that Mayuri and Suzuha
depart safely from the roof,

446
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,500
into the past.

447
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,041
Yes, I am aware.

448
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,166
Never again.

449
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,541
That mistake cost me too much.

450
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,416
El.

451
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,083
Psy.

452
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,916
Congroo.

453
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,458
[OKABE]
Mr. Braun!

454
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,250
[BRAUN]
Huh? What's wrong with you?

455
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,916
Soon as I start to think you
might be normal, there ya go.

456
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,208
I've no time to engage
in petty chicanery.

457
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,916
This cellular outage is
the Organization's handiwork.

458
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,083
Stratfor. DURPA.

459
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,958
I implore you for assistance,
Mister Ferdinand Braun!

460
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,333
Well?

461
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,375
[DARU]
Just like Okarin said,

462
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,166
the data seems
to have disappeared.

463
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,916
But if I can just find out
where it's been hidden...

464
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,666
I'll leave your tea here
for when you want it.

465
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,083
Thank you so much.

466
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,500
Don't mention it. I can't
do much else to help out.

467
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,000
[MAHO]
That's not true at all.

468
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,500
Remember what
Okabe said earlier?

469
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,250
Rukako, I am counting on you

470
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,708
to support the
technical operatives.

471
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,125
[RUKA]
Support?

472
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,625
Indeed. A job for a stout
heart and gentle demeanor.

473
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,458
A vital mission.

474
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,375
I wondered why everyone
was so excited

475
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,416
to have this strange
version of Okabe back,

476
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,000
but now I think I'm
starting to understand.

477
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,583
[DARU]
Hell yeah!

478
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,750
You better believe! Found it!

479
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,166
That's mission complete!

480
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,250
Urushibara! It's time
to get the word out!

481
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,500
I'm on it!

482
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,208
[VOICEMAIL] You have one
missed call and message.

483
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,583
[machine beeps]

484
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,458
[RUKA] Hey, Kyouma.
Hashida just located Amadeus.

485
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,000
We should be able to recover
the data shortly.

486
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,666
He said not to worry.

487
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,125
[OKABE]
Perfect.

488
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,375
With that in place...

489
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,250
Wait for me there, Mayuri.

490
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,500
I vow to save you this time.

491
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,208
Suzuha?

492
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,250
[SUZUHA]
Just don't move.

493
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,708
Luckily the ricochet
only grazed you,

494
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,750
but you're still losing
a lot of blood.

495
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,625
[clapping]

496
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,000
Excellent work!

497
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,750
To think she could take care
of them all on her own.

498
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,500
The brainwashing
techniques in the future

499
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,458
certainly are incredible.

500
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,708
[SUZUHA]
You're the one.

501
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,958
You did this! You hurt Kagari!

502
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:03,250
That's right. Hashida Suzuha,
soldier of Valkyrie.

503
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,625
Kagari was my little spy
long before you began

504
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,208
your epic journey
with her into the past.

505
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:12,750
That is, she was a spy
for my future self.

506
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,333
While your anger is justified,

507
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,291
I simply haven't the time
to indulge it.

508
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,708
Sorry.

509
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,250
I'll make it easy on you.

510
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,000
Soon, you'll no longer
be plagued

511
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,291
by the bitterness of the future
or the grief of the past.

512
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,750
Or perhaps,

513
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,291
you'd prefer that I wipe
your mind clean of all this?

514
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,625
That's right, a little tampering
with your synapses,

515
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,083
and it's all gone.

516
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,583
What?

517
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,250
[ALEXIS]
Rintaro.

518
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,083
Uncle Okarin?

519
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,750
Okarin.

520
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,375
[gasps]

521
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,875
[ALEXIS] Yes, I must
echo their surprise.

522
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,375
This is quite odd.
Who tipped you off?

523
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,125
[OKABE] Kagari won't
be joining you today.

524
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,500
[ALEXIS gasps]

525
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:03,916
[OKABE]
Sorry.

526
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,166
We've restrained her elsewhere.

527
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,125
While you were delivering
your speech,

528
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:13,000
we were taking measures
to secure the Radio Building.

529
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,416
Mr. Leskinen,

530
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,375
you may have considered
yourself not unlike a god

531
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,833
with unrivaled omniscience,

532
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,791
but allow me to disabuse
you of that notion,

533
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,625
for all your schemes
have been foiled.

534
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,833
Now, Rintaro, what is this?

535
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,500
Do you think you'll
get away with it?

536
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,416

537

[MAYURI]
Okarin?

538
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:36,666
Hear me, lab member 002,
Shiina Mayuri!

539
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,833
[MAYURI gasps]

540
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,625
[OKABE]
Operation Arclight.

541
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,000
[gasps]

542
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,750
[OKABE] I leapt back
through time to find you,

543
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,250
and I know all about it.

544
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,708
[MAYURI]
Do you really?

545
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:48,791
[OKABE]
In less than 30 minutes,

546
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,291
this whole place
becomes a war zone.

547
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,291
So hurry!

548
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,791
Are you serious?

549
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:57,333
I'll deal with Kagari
myself somehow!

550
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,083
Take care of Mayuri.

551
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,708
You mean it?

552
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01,916
I promise.

553
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,833
[OKABE]
Success.

554
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,708
They should make it out safely.

555
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,166
The time machine will
vanish into the past.

556
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,458
Into history.

557
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,083
[OKABE]
It's finished.

558

[OKABE gasps]
