Oh, Suzu.

you see a light.

Tell me, what color
is the light?

Good.

That's such a relief.

Unfortunately, I'm just swamped
with college seminars.

machines, I crash.

161
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,416
Plus, we've already got one.

162
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,541
You could just use
that as my template.

163
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,791
[SUZUHA]
No, I can't,

164
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,166
because it's the one you
invented in the future!

165
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,625
If you saw it now,
you'd run the risk

166
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,208
of creating a time paradox
and all kinds of problems.

167
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,208
Well, if it's guaranteed
that I make the thing,

168
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,333
then who cares?

169
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,291
I'll get right on it! Tomorrow!

170
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,541
[SUZUHA]
I am telling you,

171
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,708
it is time you started
working on it seriously.

172
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,625
[sighs] I remember Mom
used to get on your back

173
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,458
for procrastinating like this.

174
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,250
[DARU]
I'd welcome her on my back.

175
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,833
Know what I mean? [chuckles]

176
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,208
That's so gross!

177
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,041
[DARU]
Yeah, forget that.

178
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,291
[SUZUHA]
In the future,

179
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,833
you always say
that this world line

180
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,625
is the worst one imaginable.

181
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,041
But having me
was the best thing

182
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,500
that ever happened
to the two of you.

183
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,333
I came here to convince
Uncle Okarin that somehow

184
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,000
we could figure out a way
to change the future.

185
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,500
But since that day,

186
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,708
he hasn't been back to the
lab and nothing is different.

chances it's Okarin?

191
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,166

[DARU]
Ah. Amane, hey!

199

What brings you to the lab?

Oh, dear. Mayuri isn't here?

00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,958
Mayushii? No,
I haven't seen her.

203
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,375
Oopsie! I think I must be early.

204
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,750
She said she was
gonna meet me here

205
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,916
with some of the other girls.

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,083
[DARU]
That so?

207
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,000
Do you mind if I wait
in here with you?

208
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,416
[DARU]
Uh, no, sure!

209
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,250
Perfect. Thank you!

210
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,708
Um, is your little sister
out and about in town today?

211
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,500
Huh? Little sister?
What do you mean?

212
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,750
I'm sorry. Your little sister.

213

Um, well, all of my little
sisters are strictly 2D.

talking about Suzuha!

[YUKI] Of course.
Who else would it be?

You don't have to ask
me for permission.

234

It's your lab, isn't it?

235
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,833
I suppose so.

Wow, Yuki, your clothes
are so cute!

I knew that's what
you were going to say!

That's why I wanted
to show you.

feels a connection

quite place it.

because the fact
that I'm still here

were building a time machine,

00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,583
The future in store for this
world line is a living hell.

319
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,083
[SUZUHA] So many countries start
fighting over time machines

320
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,416
that the death toll
is unfathomable.

321
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,375
There are decades of
horror and despair ahead!

322
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,458
We're talking about the lives
of billions of people here!

323
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,833
You can change it!

324
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,041
[OKABE gasping]

325
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,833
I am begging you.

326
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,833
Please. Please...

327
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,791
[OKABE]
I can't.

328
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,541
[gasps] Uncle!

329
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,583
[OKABE] I've drifted through
so many different world lines

330
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,875
that I've lost count.

331
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,125
[SUZUHA gasps]

332
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,208
[OKABE]
The one constant is that

333
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,041
no matter what
reality I step into,

334
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,083
time machines destroy lives.

335
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,916
I've seen them drive you
to ruin, too, damn it!

336
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,375
Over and over.

337
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,916
Loops of misery.

338
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,250
Believe me, I know how useless
someone can be against time!

339
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,750
[OKABE]
No matter what I tried...

340
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,708
...I was powerless.

341
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,833
You say that, but you have
altered world lines before.

342
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,208
You told me that yourself.

343
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,458
So then... why not?

344
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,916
[OKABE]
It won't work!

345
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,416
You can't just change the
past to switch world lines!

346
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,375
It breaks the fundamental rules
that govern our universe.

347
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,375
Humans like us were never meant
to tamper with such powers.

348
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,250
The moment we start
meddling, we're punished!

349
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,625
It's too much!

350
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,083
I'd rather tear my eyes out
than see it all again!

351
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,750
Only you can do it.

352
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,208
[OKABE panting]

353
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,333
[SUZUHA]
We still have some time.

354
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,375
Please give it another
thought, for me!

355
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,458
This isn't over.

358

[MAYURI] I guess Suzu had other
stuff she needed to do, huh?

359
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,916
[OKABE]
Yeah.

360
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,500
The two of you didn't fight
up there on the roof, did you?

361
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,916
[OKABE]
That's not what happened.

362
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,375
[MAYURI]
I see.

363
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:59,000
Ooh! I didn't think it was
gonna be this chilly today.

364
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,750
[MAYURI] At least the lab
was lively for a change.

365
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,166
It was a lot of fun
seeing everyone.

366
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,375
Is that right?

367
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,791
Yep!

368
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,875
To be honest with you,

369
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,583
for some reason,
I've felt really lonely

370
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,750
every time I've gone
over there lately.

371
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,875
It's been sad.

372
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,583
[OKABE]
Even though Daru's there?

373
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,625
[MAYURI]
Yeah.

374
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,041
And it's strange,
because before,

375
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,208
I used to wait in the lab
all by myself for you,

376
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,666
so I should be used to that.

377
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,583
There's no reason for me
to feel alone when I'm there.

378
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,291
But it's just...

379
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,666
Sometimes it's so overwhelming
that it makes me want to cry.

380
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,416
--[OKABE gasps]
--Big ugly tears, you know?

381
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,750
Kind of feels like
there used to be

382
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,125
a bunch more people
hanging around.

383
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,083
[OKABE]
It's an illusion.

384
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,416
Huh?

385
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,583
[OKABE]
Just a dream.

386
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,541
[OKABE]
There were only three people

387
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,750
that ever came to the lab.

388
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,875
You and me, and Daru
at the computer.

389
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,750
[MAYURI]
Hmm, I guess you're right.

[phone vibrates]

391
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,166
[MAYURI]
Is it a bad message?

392
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,208
[OKABE] No. Some people from
Viktor Chondria University

393
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,750
are giving a seminar
in Akiba tomorrow.

394
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,041
I was hoping to talk with
one of their professors,

395
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,083
but I guess they've gone
out drinking for the night.

396

[MAYURI gasps]
So weird!

It's like you're
totally normal now.

398

I'll be perfectly
fine by myself.

You're the fourth
person to tell me

I'm in the wrong place

00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,291
[speaking Japanese]

478
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,000
[applause]

479
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,958
The topic of today's
seminar is broad.

480
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,500
[MAHO in English]
The topic of today's seminar

481
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,833
is the artificial
intelligence revolution.

482
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,041
But before we delve
too much into that,

483
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,083
there's a thesis I'd like
to familiarize you with.

484
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,041
[MAHO] This paper was published
by a brilliant female researcher

485
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,375
from our university laboratory.

486
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,125
All of our memories are stored
within the cerebral cortex.

487
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,458
More specifically,

488
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,708
our histories are held
within the temporal lobe.

489
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,750
Our minds work as if they have
a computer's flash memory.

490
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,375
The brain sends
electrical signals

491
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,958
between neurons at
lightning-fast rates.

492
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,125
Ultimately, it is the pattern
of these electrical signals

493
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,208
which create and
reinforce memories.

494
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,291
They archive our pasts.

495
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,583
[MAHO] I regret to say
that the bright woman

496
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,000
who proposed this theory

497
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,125
passed away at the
young age of 18.

498
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,083
But using her theory
as a foundation,

499
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,291
we were able to construct
a monumental computer program.

500
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,125
That is a system that
preserves human memory

501
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,541
as electronic data.

502
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,583
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

503
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,083
[MAHO] Though previous
systems fell short

504
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,500
of having real identities,

505
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,583
we've developed an
artificial intelligence

506
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,166
built with data drawn from
actual human memories.

507
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,166
Yes. It has feelings and
memories, just like a human.

508
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,125
AI with a brain and a heart.

509
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,333
The genius of Makise
Kurisu and her theory

510
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,416
enabled us to build this system.

511
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,625
Without further ado,

512
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,333
we would like to demonstrate
the AI named...

513
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,000
[MAHO]
...Amadeus.
