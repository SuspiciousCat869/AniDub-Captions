give it to Maho then?

on you on the roof.

[AMADEUS]
Sure.

00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,583
But you called me back
immediately and apologized.

Why do I have no
recollection of that?

We were on a call from America

71
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,041
and the connection was awful.

72
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,666
I think they had a weak signal.

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,541
It took much longer
than expected.

for keeping you out so late,

Yeah, judging by her tone,
she's sure warmed up to you.

Well, it seems all our
hopes and expectations

might come true after all.

He's being romantic.

95
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,250
The professor has
this weird obsession

96
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,916
with her falling
in love with you.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,541
It's a bit awkward
if you ask me.

98
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,708
Falling in love?

99
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,916
[chuckles] But she's... an AI.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,416
Amadeus is a system that
preserves a person's memories.

101
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,625
It strives to create
a highly accurate model

102
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,291
of the neural networks.

103
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,500
In other words...

104
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,333
The process and the
framework are the same.

105
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,916
[ALEXIS] Amadeus should be able
to love, no question about it.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,166
But Maho thinks that prospect
is "a bit awkward."

107
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,000
[MAHO] Granted, even if we could
prove she was capable of love,

108
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,541
Amadeus could never
be a true partner.

109
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,875
[ALEXIS laughs] Maho, don't
tell me you're getting jealous

110
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,416
of our AI.

111
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,291
[MAHO] You must have gotten
along well in real life.

112
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,875
Otherwise, this wouldn't
have happened.

113
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,250
She never would have opened up
to you as quickly as she has.

114
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,750
[MAHO]
So, how close were you?

115
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,250
Was she your lover or
something sweet like that?

116
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,333
Yeah, right. Fat chance.

117
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,958
[OKABE]
That's not it.

118
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,791
I met her at the seminar.

119
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,791
[MAHO]
You already told me that much.

120

Sorry. I just...

123
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,708
[MAHO] I wanted to know
that side of her.

124
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,875
It's a side I never saw.

125
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,208
[OKABE]
Of Kurisu?

126
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,791
[MAHO] After all that
time I spent with her,

127
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,791
I feel like I don't know
who she really was.

128
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,625
I don't even know her
favorite books or movies.

129
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,041
I know next to nothing.

130

finished cleaning and stuff,

134
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,291
why don't we head to
May Queen for some tea?

135
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,541
[KAEDE]

136
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,750
[FUBUKI] But the city is
crawling with hooligans

137
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,083
at this time of night!

138
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,416
[YUKI] Who cares?
We've got strength in numbers.

139
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,916
No one can mess with us!

140

There's a guest coming to
stay at our house tonight

144
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,416
and I have to be there to help.

145
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,708
[FUBUKI]
Oh, seriously?

146
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,125
They're coming over
on Christmas?

147
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,041
[RUKA] Yeah. It's some
guest of my father's.

148
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,750
My dad really wants
me to be there.

149
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,583

Mm-mm!

It's been such a long time
since everyone came to the lab.

with you guys!

153
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,000
[KAEDE] Speaking of which,
where did Hashida go?

154
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,750
Oh, Daru told me that he
needed to talk to Suzuha

155
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,333
about something important.

156
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,125
[YUKI] Yeah, he did mention
a "family meeting" earlier.

157
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,541
[SUZUHA] She said these
are made of something

158
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,333
I've never heard of
called "wool."

159
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,708
They're a lot warmer
than I thought they'd be.

160
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,583
[SUZUHA]
Don't you like your gift?

161
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,583
Now you can take
Mom out on a date.

162
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,833
[DARU gasps]
On a date?!

163
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,416
Watching you two together
is absolutely terrifying.

164
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,666
You barely even talked
to her at the party.

165
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,625
How could I with
you guys watching?

166
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,583
I would need Han Solo
levels of charm

167
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,208
to pull off that kind of feat.

168
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,708
[SUZUHA sighs]

169
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,250
Anyway, you wanted to talk?

170
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,416
You wouldn't pass up
May Queen for nothin'.

171
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,791
There's something that's been
bothering me for a while now.

172
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,208
Suzuha, I want you to
look me in the eyes

173
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,750
and answer this honestly.

174
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,125
What are you up to?

175
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,458
[SUZUHA]
"Up to"?

176
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,041
You haven't been around the lab

177
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,708
or the radio building
very much at all lately.

178
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,166
What have you been doing?

179
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,041
[SUZUHA]
Nothing really.

180
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,333
Whenever you say it's nothing,

181
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,875
that's how I know it's
definitely something.

182
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,333
[DARU]
I promise it's safe with me.

183
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,416
[SUZUHA]
I've been searching for someone.

184
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,583
For who?

185
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,750
[SUZUHA] A girl who traveled
here in the time machine with me

186
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,625
from the future.

187
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,916
[DARU gasps]

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,500
[SUZUHA]
Thing is, we got split up.

189
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,916
It happened here
in Akihabara in 1998.

190
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,583
[OKABE]
She said that?

191
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,833
[DARU]
Uh-huh.

192
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,166
[OKABE]
And the girl was 10 years old

193
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,500
when they were separated.

194
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,333
That would make her 22
now if she's still alive.

195
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,083
[DARU] Suzuha keeps saying
she should move on.

196
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,666
But whenever she's
traveled through time,

197
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,458
she picks up the search again.

198
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,041
[DARU] She was just about to
give up the search for good,

199
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,625
when she stumbled across
this picture on the internet.

200
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,833
She said the girl had been
wearing something like this.

201
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,083
And Suzuha's been searching
for this mystery kid on her own.

202
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,500
What's the girl's name, anyway?

203
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,208
She told you, right?

204
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,333
[DARU]
Mm.

205
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,125
It's Kagari Shiina.

206
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,625
[gasps] Shiina?

207
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,208
Are you serious?!

208
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,125
[DARU]
Mm.

209
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,416
Mayushii's daughter.

210
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,166
[OKABE]
But--who's the father?

211
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,750
No, no. Stop.

212
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,083
The girl's not her
biological daughter.

213
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,000
She's a war orphan
who Mayushii adopted--

214
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,916
or will adopt in the future.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,333
[sighs]

216
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,208
Huh, quite the development.

217
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,750
[DARU]
According to Suzuha,

218
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,708
in the year 2036, police groups,
called peacekeeping squads,

219
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,791
are after Mayushii and me

220
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,000
for trying to develop
a time machine.

221
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,333
[SUZUHA]

222
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,833
[DARU]
Just forget about us!

223
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,291
The peacekeepers
are closing in.

224
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,166
You have to hurry!

[MAYURI]

227
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,666

--[KAGARI crying]
--If that's what you want.

229
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,875
--[KAGARI crying]
--I'll take her.

230
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,500
No! If you're not coming,
I won't go, either, Mommy!

231
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,416
--It's gonna be all right.
--No, I won't!

232
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,875
--I promise you.
--Mommy, please!

233
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,125
[KAGARI cries]

234
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,833
[MAYURI] Suzuha will be
with you the whole time.

235
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,750
I wanna be with you, Mommy!

236
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,250
Mommy! No, please!

237
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,791
[DARU] After that,
Suzuha went back in time.

238
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:39,041
First, she went to 1975,
then 1998, and then 2010.

239
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,833
They got separated
from each other in 1998.

You think you can help?
We've gotta find this girl.

Look, I know it's a lot
to ask, and you're still--

Seriously?

[OKABE]
World War III rages on.

247
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,125
A child loses her parents,

248
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,166
and Mayuri adopts the war
orphan, in spite of it all.

249
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,333
[OKABE] In 25 years,
Mayuri's still kind.

250
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,500
[OKABE]
And then there's that.

251
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,333
What happened to me back there?

252
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,000
[OKABE] If it really was
a world line shift

253
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,458
and not some episode...

254
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,458
...that means someone out
there has created a device

255
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,833
similar to the Phone Wave.

256
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,291
Perhaps...

[ANCHOR 04A] The Japanese
Government has reached out,

not returned Nakabachi,

Did you need something?

00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,375
[OKABE] No, but I am interested
to hear your opinion.

I'm sorry, am I bothering you?

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,333
[AMADEUS]
Of course not.

264
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,666
Conversing with you is
always beneficial for me.

265
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,041
So, what do you need?

266
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,708
[OKABE] How would you go about
locating a missing person

267
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,500
who was last seen 12 years ago?

268
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,875
What method would you use?

269
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,000
[AMADEUS]
Hmm. I need more detail.

270

Uhh, well, I have
no further details.

271
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,333
[AMADEUS] That makes it
difficult to form an opinion.

272
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,083
The best advice I have
is to go to the police.

273
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,666
Yeah, you're right.

274
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,708
[AMADEUS] Though, judging by
that face, you can't do that.

275
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,458
Check the newspapers or
hire a private investigator.

276
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,708

In America, sometimes they use

Huh? Mm.

[KAGARI]
The Y2K problem?

288
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,458
[SUZUHA]
Did you ever study that?

289
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,208
[KAGARI]
At the institution.

290
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,875
[SUZUHA] This knowledge
was never made public,

291
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,500
but the main culprit in that
crisis was this computer,

00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,000
the IBN 5100.

293
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,875
That's why I'm using
this patch program--

294
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,916
to make sure the
Y2K problem never happens.

[KAGARI] But... if you
and I are from the future,

00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,666
is it okay to do that?

297
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,625
Wouldn't it change the time
that we came from, too?

298

[SUZUHA] It's something that we
must do to reach Steins Gate.

[SUZUHA]
That's right.

302
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,916
We can't let a world like

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,833
On the surface,
this world seems so peaceful.

318
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,041
But the number of missing
and unidentified people

319
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,583
says otherwise.

320
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,666
[DARU]
Yeah.

321
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,166
Hey, by the way, Dad,

322
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,958
did you talk to Uncle
Okarin about this?

323
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,291
[DARU]
Mm.

324
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,375
He said he would do
what he could to help us.

325
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,875
Well, that's a relief.

326
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,083
I'll tell him thanks
next time I see him.

327
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,250
You should.

328
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,250
Hearing that might
do him a lot of good.

329
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,000
[phone vibrates]

330
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,708
[AMADEUS]
What's this? Ignoring me again?

331
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,250
I was in the library.

332
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,166
[AMADEUS]
Uh--my bad. Wow!

333
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,166
I have no right to chastise you.

334
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,000
It was wrong. I'm so sorry.

335
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,416
[OKABE chuckles]
It's not that big of a deal.

336
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,166
[AMADEUS] No, I don't
want to think that way.

337
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,666
I hate not admitting
when I screw up,

338
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,416
so I'm practicing.

339
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,291
Why were you in
the library anyway?

340
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,583
Uh, I was perusing back issues

341
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,125
of newspapers from
12 years ago. You know.

342
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,708
[AMADEUS]
Looking for that missing person?

343
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,958
Indeed.

344
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,166
[AMADEUS gasps]

345
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,333
What if I did
supplementary research?

346
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,250
Huh?

347
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,750
You have that ability?

348
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,375
[AMADEUS] Yeah, the base of
Amadeus resides on a server

349
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,625
in the research facility at
Viktor Chondria University.

350
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,291
I'm allowed to use the
computers and network

351
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,000
for whatever I want,
whenever I want.

352
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you need me to scour
the internet for evidence?

353
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,166
'Cause I'm game!

354
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,375
Hang on. Is that within
the AI moral code?

355
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,291
[AMADEUS]
Well...

356
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,791
[OKABE groans]

357
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,458
[AMADEUS] Look, what people
don't know won't hurt them.

358
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,750
[sighs]

359
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,833
[AMADEUS]
Besides,

360
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,750
you're not doing
anything wrong, are you?

361
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,083
[OKABE]
Of course not.

362
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,166
[AMADEUS]
Okay, then!

363
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,625
I leave it up to you,
but I'm down.

364
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,875
Whaddya say?

365
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,750
[OKABE] Let me think it over
and get back to you.

366
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,875
[FARIS] Oh, hey!
I spot a Meowster Kyou--

367
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,125
I mean, look! I spot an Okarin!

368
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,000
[OKABE] Well, well.
This is an interesting pairing.

369
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,583
[FARIS]
Ruka's dad sent us on a quest

370
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,791
to pick up a couple of
things from the store.

371
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,791
It's because my dad
has a house guest

372
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,416
and it's going to be more
long term than we thought.

373
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,916
We're stocking up.

374
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,125
Oh, yeah?

375
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,958
That looks pretty heavy.
Do you need a hand?

376
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,583
[RUKA gasps]
No.

377
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,791
I can manage.

378
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,625
It's lighter than it looks.

379
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,708
And I have been
swinging my sword.

380
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,041
[FARIS]
We're on a special mission

381
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,750
that would be a little bit
awkward to ask Kyou--

382
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,791
I mean, Okarin, to help us with.

383
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,166
In times like these, you'd
better just leave it to Faris!

384
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,625
Thanks anyway, though.

385
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,958
No worries.

386
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,875
Hey, didn't both of you
grow up around this area?

387
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:39,916
[BOTH]
Huh?

388
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,000
[FARIS]
A girl went missing from here?

389
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,916
I'll have to ask Kuroki
if he remembers that.

390
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,250
[OKABE]
That'd be great.

391
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,000
So this girl went missing
more than a decade ago?

392
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,375
I'll ask my dad if he remembers.

393
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,666
[OKABE]
I'd appreciate it.

394
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,416
Well, we had better
get going meow.

395
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,625
Right.

396
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,541
[FARIS]
Kyouma!

397
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,250
If you ever find
yourself in trouble,

398
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,958
don't sit around
making a sad face!

399
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,708
Come see Faris Kitty.
I'll make it all better!

400
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,708
[FARIS giggles]

401

[phone vibrates]

402
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,375
[OKABE]
I see.

403
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,166
So no leads on your end.

404
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,250
[FARIS]
No, sorry.

405
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,250
Well, thanks for
asking around though.

406
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,250
Oh, but I did hear
stories about a ghost

407
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,750
with her hair in braids.

408
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,166
[OKABE]
A ghost?

409
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,041
It's some sort of urban legend
that pops up around here

410
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,791
every few years.

411
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,333
Especially in the area
near the radio building.

412
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,791
People were getting spooked by
the ghost of a girl in braids

413
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,166
asking if they'd seen
another little girl.

414
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,125
Professor Leskinen?

415
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,125
[SUZUHA] I'm telling you, it's
really okay to stop searching.

416
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,000
Thanks, anyway.

417
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,000
[DARU]
No!

418
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,541
Sure, we don't have any clues,

419
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,291
but don't you think it's
too soon to give up?

420
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,291
[OKABE]
What's going on?

421
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,875
Hey, Okarin.

422
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,250
I don't want to burden you guys
any more than I already have.

423
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,250
Kagari was my responsibility.

424
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,875
This is my problem.

425
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,291
Don't be an idiot!

426
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,666
Any problem a child has

427
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,166
is the parents'
problem, too, noob!

428
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,458
Uh--Dad!

429
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,458
Did I do okay?

430
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,333
Did that sound like something
a real dad would tell his spawn?

431
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,583
[sighs]

432
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,083
This is the part where
you jump on me and say,

433
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,541
"I love you, Papa!"

434
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,791
Familial bonds aside,

435
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,208
when you're in trouble,
you call in the experts.

436
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,291
If we're looking for someone,

437
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,833
we might as well
bring in a specialist

438
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,375
to help us find her, right?

439
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,166
No, I disagree.

440
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,791
The fewer people involved
in this, the better.

441
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,083
[OKABE sighs]

442
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,333
Did you have someone
in mind, Daru?

443
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,583
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

444
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,666
Don't you dare underestimate me.

445
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,833
I may be a geek,

446
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,125
but I'm more resourceful
than you think.

447
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,208
I'm ahead of the game.
I already contacted somebody.

--[phone beeps]
--Bam!

Speak of the devil.

450
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,041
They texted that they could
come right over, if we want.

451
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,375
Dad, no!

452
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,083
Let's give it a shot.

453
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,375
Okay! They said they're
in the vicinity

454
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,916
so they should be
here in a second.

455
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,500
That was oddly fast.

456
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,916
[DARU]
Better than oddly slow.

Hello, there.

[RUKA gasps]
Good, you answered.

Sorry, but do you have
a minute to talk?

Sure, what's up?

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,458
Well, I, um...

464
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:29,083
Look, I really need to ask your
advice about something, so...

465
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,958
Are you available to meet
in person right now?

Right this minute?

Yes.

Uh, someone is on their
way over for a meeting.

469

Can it wait until tonight?

urgent, so that won't work.
