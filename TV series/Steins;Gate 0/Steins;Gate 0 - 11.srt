323
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,500
I take it Kurisu sang
her little rhyme to you, too?

324
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,791
[MAHO] She made me promise
not to tell the professors

325
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,875
something bad
she said about them.

326
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,166
I could absolutely
see that one happening.

327
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,791
[MAHO]
They were all scared of her.

328
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,875
I kinda thought she'd snap
and do it for real someday.

329
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,333
[OKABE sighs]

330
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,791
[OKABE]
I'm gonna go now.

331
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,625
You should regain
muscle function soon.

332
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,041
Until then,
you'd better sleep.

333
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,125
Okay.

334
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,916
Night.

335
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,250
--[MAHO] Okabe?
--Huh?

336
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,416
Would you mind
if I asked you

337
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
to stay with me
a little longer?

338
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,916
A few minutes?

339
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,041
[OKABE]
I'll stay until you fall asleep.

340
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,375
Just try to get some rest.

341
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,666
Sorry for being a pain.

342
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,166
[OKABE]
No.

343
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,000
What you went through today
is enough to rattle anyone.

344
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,583
You're not a pain at all.

345
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,500
Yeah, you've got a good point.

346
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,416
I've been wondering.

347
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,125
Was Salieri relieved

348
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,750
or did he have regrets...

349
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,000
...when he found out
Mozart died?

350
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,166
[OKABE]
I don't know.

351
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,666
You warned me
before it all went down

352
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,708
about disgracing the dead.

353
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,666
When you said that,
it made me realize.

354
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,000
Maybe I had already
disgraced her.

355
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,041
After she died,

356
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,958
I acquired her computer.

357
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,625
I told myself
that it was her will,

358
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,916
that Kurisu would
have wanted it.

359
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,625
I vowed to carry on
her legacy.

360
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,458
I thought I should be the one
to bear the torch for her.

361
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,166
--[keyboard clacking]
--And yet...

362
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,500
[keyboard clacking]

363
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,833
[MAHO]
In that moment,

364
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,416
I realized it was
only frustration.

365
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,250
I wanted to crack it.

366
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,583
To prove that I could
see what it held.

367
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,250
I needed to know
that I... could.

368
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,708
[OKABE]
So it became your obsession?

369
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,166
It felt that way.

370
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,583
There was a part of me
that just wanted to break in.

371
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,541
To find the secrets she hid,

372
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,208
to know her truth.

373
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,500
That's all.

374
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,583
[OKABE]
Not buying it.

375
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,125
It's true.

376
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,500
Think about it.

377
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,375
Mozart didn't waste a second
fretting over Salieri.

378
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,541
He devoted his life
to making music,

379
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,750
and that was it.

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,416
[OKABE]
Hiyajo, listen.

381
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,708
In the end, you were willing
to destroy the computer.

382
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,958
That's because
you were in danger.

383
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,833
[OKABE]
No, it isn't just that.

384
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,291
You were devastated
that you weren't able

385
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,500
to protect her legacy
like you wanted to.

386
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,625
That's the truth.

387
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,458
And I think,
that alone is proof enough

388
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,000
of what you hold in your heart.

389
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,541
[MAHO]
You give me too much credit!

390
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,916
You don't know.

391
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,416
Look at it this way.

392
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,625
If what you say is true,

393
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,750
you wouldn't have
held onto that piece

394
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,875
of her computer
like you did.

395
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,333
At least, that's what I think.

396
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,250
[gasps]

397
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,458
Uh, you seem
to have recovered.

398
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,916
If I stay, you won't
be able to sleep,

399
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,416
so I should probably go.

400
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,333
Just shout if
you need anything.

--[MAHO] Hey.
--[OKABE] Hmm?

00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,166
finished the time leap machine,

404
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,916
you were forced
to repeat the same interval

405
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
over and over again,
weren't you?

406
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,333
[OKABE]
Yeah.

407
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,666
And were you and Kurisu...?

[MAHO] Never mind.
Don't answer that.

to see us off, Rintaro,

from your little lab.

plan to come to our lab

and start working
with us, buddy?

Wait, are-- are you--

saying he won't rest

until you come to
Viktor Chondria University.

424
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,125
And he means it.

425

--[OKABE] Why me?
--I'd never forgive myself

slip right through my fingers!

Love to have you
on the team, Rintaro.

429
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:19,416
Well, then, I'll study hard
and do my best to get accepted.

--You okay?
--Huh?

431
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,958
Yep! If that's where Okarin
wants to go to school,

432
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,125
then of course
I'm all for it!

[KAEDE gasps] What happened
to your hand, Yuki?

434
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,666
[laughing]
Oh, I just nicked myself

435
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,458
with a knife at work.

436
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,541
Want me to carry that? Or, um--

Sure! You're sweet.

What about Suzuha?

Well, uh, she's still
struggling to accept the truth.

440
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,166
Now that Kurisu's
computer's been destroyed,

441
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,708
we can rest assured

the conflict between Russia
and America won't take place.

You might be correct,

but it still doesn't
eliminate all possibility

for the time being,

Would you give it
a rest for once?

That reminds me.
I hate to say it,

453
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,166
but this means
we're gonna have to revoke

Rintaro's access to Amadeus.

Too bad. Would you like to say
goodbye to her one last time?

Yes, I would.

Nothing. N-Never mind.

Well, I suppose I'm grateful

468
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,833
you took the time
to talk to me.

469
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,583
I hear you might be coming
to study with us, right?

470
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,291
I guess I'll try
to remember you

471

until we meet again.

478
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,458
Time to go, Professor.

479
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,416
Oh, yes, of course.

480
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,583
One thing.

481
