stored away, safe and sound.

going overseas?

just "get by," dude.

You don't want to?

It's not that I don't want to,

it's just that given
the current situation,

somewhere else these days.

[OKABE]
The way I see it...

381
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,250
My world only exists
because of a choice Kurisu made.

Because of Kurisu,

Mayuri can live
her whole life.

384

I must protect
that choice at all costs.

It's the law

[MAHO]
Yeah, but you wrote it.

387
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,458
[OKABE] In reliving time,
I learned one thing.

388
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,083
That certain events are fixed,

389
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,291
as if orchestrated
by the divine.

390
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,041
And to try
and change said events

391
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,000
is a challenge to the gods.

392
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,458
And one thing they won't abide
is Human arrogance.

393
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,666
Maybe so.

394
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,250
I may be a proud scientist,

395
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,916
but my plans don't include
invoking celestial wrath.

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But you might.

397
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,333
Hold on. I think you're wrong.

398
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,708
I don't think
this has much to do

399
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,708
with gods
or laws of this world.

400

Hiyajo, listen--

401
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,083
[MAHO] If there is a single
set of concrete laws

402
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,541
governing everything,

00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,208

are set in stone

00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,916
that way by the divine,
fating us to a static path,

405
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,041
then there's no point

406

in having free will
at all, is there?

407

by the laws of this world,

[MAHO] Any scientist worth
his salt would ask that.

The way I see it,

415
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,708
the laws you describe
are more like a formula.

416
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,291
They're just another set
of circumstances to unlock,

417
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,666
like a combination.

418
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,666
And I believe
we can figure it out.

419

People have wills.

420
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,750
They use their minds
to make decisions

421
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,625
and take action.

422
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,833
That's what makes
the world what it is.

423
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,625
Solving this
may not be an easy feat,

424
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,791
but if we work hard,

425
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,833
and most importantly
if we work together,

426
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,375
we can figure it out!

427
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,333
But going back in time
is too dangerous to--

Let's reach Steins Gate.

about what Suzuha told me.

430
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,500
Mayuri lives,

431

Kurisu lives,

432
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,041

sparing billions
of lives worldwide.

If that's what you
refer to as Steins Gate,

then we have our formula.

We know that value, at least,

437
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,833
and we just need to solve
for the other missing pieces.

eyes that I used to have.

476
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,958
[OKABE]
Mayuri?

477
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,083
[MAYURI] Oh, Okarin?
What are you doing here?

478
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,125
[OKABE]
Honestly?

479
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,375
Just happened to be passing by.

480
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,750
What about you?

481
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,791
[MAYURI]
Same.

482
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,125
Or something like that.

483
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,916
We used to come here
all the time, remember?

484
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,458
[OKABE]
Yeah.

485
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,333
[MAYURI] That was even before
Daru started coming around.

486
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,500
When I would get done
with school for the day,

487
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,333
I used to go
straight over to the lab

488
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,625
and wait for you there.

489
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,166
All by myself.

490
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,041
Even though I was alone,

491
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,250
for some reason,
I never felt lonely.

492
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,291
It felt happy, like home.

493
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,791
But now, when I'm at the lab,

494
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,375
it does feel lonely.

495
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,041
[OKABE]
But nothing's changed, has it?

496
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,833
It's still the three of us,
you, me, and Daru.

497
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,041
[MAYURI]
I wish I could say for sure.

498
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,125
But it feels like
something's missing.

499
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,458
Like someone isn't there
who should be.

500
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,458
And it's not as lively or fun.

501
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,541
That can't be true.

502
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,083
It just can't.

503
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,583
Can't it?

504
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,375
[MAYURI]
Okarin?

505
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,083
[OKABE]
Hmm?

506
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,250
[MAYURI] I wonder if I made
the wrong choice, in the end.

507
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,333
[OKABE gasping]

508
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,791
Maybe I should
have made you go back,

509
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,250
like she wanted you to.

510
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,333
Mayuri, what?

511
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,875
Oh, Okarin.

512
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:55,083
Maybe you were supposed to go
to Makise and save her life.

513
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,500
But instead,
you sacrificed everything

514
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,166
so that I didn't have to die.

515
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,291
And because you did,
you stopped coming to the lab,

516
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,000
and you always look like
you're in unbearable misery.

517
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,583
No, you're wrong!

518
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,833
But am I?

519
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,208
You heard us talking,
didn't you?

520
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,208
At the lab this
afternoon, right?

521
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,541
I'm not wrong.

522
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,708
Don't ever think that!

523
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,416
[sobbing]

524
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,625
[OKABE]
Please push all of this

525
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,416
as far from your mind
as you can, Mayuri.

526
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,625
Stop it, now, I'm begging you!

527
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,041
I can't!

528
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,166
[OKABE] Everything is fine,
so stop it! Right now.

529
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,000
All is well,
and nothing can hurt you!

530
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,250
I don't want anything
to destroy the time we have.

531
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,458
--So, please!
--Then, tell me why!

532
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,333
Tell me why.

533
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,500
Why do your eyes
look so sad all the time,

534
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,333
like you're in pain?

535
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,166
Ever since that one day,

536
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,708
it's like you're
suffering so much

537
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,541
you can barely breathe!

538
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,541
[MAYURI]
You know who Orihime is, right?

539
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,833
It's the star called Vega.

540
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,250
But guess what?

541
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,333
Overseas they have
another name for it.

542
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,958
There they call it
Arclight of the Sky.

543
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,041
[OKABE crying]
Mayuri.
