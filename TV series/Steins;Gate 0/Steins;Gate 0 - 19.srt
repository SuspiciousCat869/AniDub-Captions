163
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,416
I came to tell you that,
once we hack in successfully,

164
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,041
the time leap machine
will essentially be done.

165
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,708
[OKABE]
That's great.

166
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,958
But look, even if
we complete it,

167
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,500
we won't know
whether it works or not

168
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,416
unless someone tests it.

169
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,916
[OKABE]
Yeah, we ran into the same issue

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,166
when Kurisu finished
the other one.

171
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,083
We felt hesitant to use it.

172
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,000
Luckily, it worked exactly
as we theorized.

173
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,166
That's only because
it was the one she made.

174
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,083
Mine might fail.

175
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,041
But you know what you're doing.

176
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,000
Aren't you confident in that?

177
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,916
[MAHO scoffs]
No, not at all.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,208
Why wouldn't you be?

179
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,083
Because I'm nothing like her.

180
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,541
I'm Salieri, she's Mozart.

181
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,250
[OKABE] "So, please convey
this sacred message

182
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,458
to the one whom
I respect the most.

183
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,875
I have always considered myself

184
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,041
to be characteristically
mediocre, unlike yourself.

185
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,291
It was only you,

186
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,500
the one whom I strove
to emulate, above all.

187
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,416
Because I have never had
any shred of doubt,

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,916
you are the one,
true Amadeus."

189
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,958
[MAHO]
That was her.

190
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,541
[OKABE]
It was Amadeus' final message.

191
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,666
Remember, the one that
we discovered on @channel?

192
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,000
[MAHO] There's no way
she was referring to me.

193
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,125
[AMADEUS]
Wrong.

194
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,875
I was definitely
talking about you, ma'am.

195
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,125
[OKABE]
Kurisu?

196
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,916
[AMADEUS]
That's right, look down.

197
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,583
You mean you're okay?

198
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,541
[AMADEUS]
Yeah.

199
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,333
The professor froze my data,

200
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,583
but I suppose
that was only temporary.

201
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,916
Before I knew it, I was here.

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,458
--Could Daru have--
--What?

203
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,541
Earlier.

204
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,125
When he heard Amadeus'
data was moved,

205
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,083
he started searching for it.

206
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,958
He was doing that while
trying to hack into SERN?

207
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,416
[OKABE] Yeah, that's a walk
in the park for him.

208
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,375
Knowing it would help you
was an added motivator.

209
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,583
[AMADEUS] Wow,
aren't you the popular girl.

210
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,166
Shut up!

211
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,875
[chuckles] You've got this.
I'm confident.

212
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,875
You have no idea what
we're even talking about.

213
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,041
[AMADEUS]
Nevertheless.

214
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,041
Whatever it is, you can do it.

215
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,875
I know better than anyone.

216
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,583
I'm Kurisu's memories, yeah?

217
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,958
Trust me, you can.

218
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,083

Is it really you?

00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,708
Huh? What was that?

223
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,041
[OKABE]
Nothing.

224
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,083
Sorry.

225
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,541
I must've fallen asleep.

226
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,166
[MAHO]
I'm not surprised,

227
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,916
considering you've been
working nonstop

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
for the last two days.

229
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,916
How's it going?

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,750
It's finally complete.

231
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,541
At least, in theory.

232
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,750
Are you really gonna do this?

233
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,166
[OKABE]
Yeah.

234
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,000
Even though you were
adamantly against it?

235
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,250
I made a promise to Kurisu.

236
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,375
That I'd protect
this world line.

237
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,208
Because...

238
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,833
...she sacrificed her life

239
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,958
so that everyone else's
could be spared.

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,833
But now I see
that was never true.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,958
You two must have been so close.

242
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,083
I can tell how important
she was to you.

243
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,500
Amadeus means, "loved by God."

244
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,000
[laughs]

245
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,708
The name suits her.

246
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,541
Kurisu is Amadeus.

247
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,708
[OKABE]
Very soon.

248
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,166
I will use the Phone Wave,
real name TBD,

249
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,750
to time leap into the past.

250
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,291
I thank you, my comrades,
for your unstinting devotion,

251
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,500
and your perseverance
in this noble quest.

252
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,083
[OKABE]
Amadeus.

253
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,041
What do you want?
I was napping.

254
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,000
[OKABE] You saved us.
For that, I'm grateful.

00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:44,916
Huh?

256
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,083
The post you made.

257
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,083
If we hadn't seen it
online when we did,

258
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,291
we never would have
finished things in time.

[AMADEUS]
What?

260

My sincere thanks.

I hope you know you're
a worthy lab member.

[AMADEUS gasps] Enough
already, just get on with it!

Are you embarrassed?

No, not in the least!

I will never give up.

Though I may
fail ten, a hundred,

271
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,333
or a thousand times,
I'll stay the course.

272
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,875
I'll devote my fraught existence
to this pursuit, if I must.

273
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,791
I care not.
I will hold fast.

[OKABE]
Leskinen's computer.

289
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,750
We must hack into it
immediately,

290
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,208
then locate Kurisu
and Hiyajo's Amadeus data

291
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,333
and delete it all,
plus the backups!

No time to explain.

I came from the future,

the time leap machine!

out how to finish it!

There's no time
to explain anything.

This entire area is about
to become a war zone.

We have to act fast!

even possible?

to find out where
Amadeus' data is hidden.

And no matter what happens,

316

do not go anywhere
near the Radio Building!

You and Daru get captured

your way there.

and remain in the lab

Is he saying that this
starts World War III?

327
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,750
It seems a bit far-fetched,
and yet...

[OKABE panting]

329
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,958
[OKABE] What was the exact time
that it all began to happen?

330
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,250
When did Suzuha and Mayuri
get to the Radio Building?

331
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,583
I wish I could remember.

332
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,166
[OKABE] It feels just like
it did back then.

333
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,833
Reality becomes more
like a dream,

334
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,416
repeating over and over.

335
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,666
This vague, ominous sensation.

336
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,500
Growing as the moments pass.

337
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,458
Tightening around my throat.

338
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,708
It should be a dream,
but it's not.

339
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,750
I'm experiencing everything
in real time.

340
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,416
I'm living a nightmare,

one whose horrors
are already known to me,

342

but there's
no respite in that.

343
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,958
Knowing makes it far worse,

344
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,833
and the formless shadow
that stalks me is the guilt--

345
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,875
no, the shame of my
unspeakable transgression.

346
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,000
I can't escape the despair.

347
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,083
I am caught in the vortex,
spiraling downward

348

this place is going to
devolve into a war zone!

--[SUZUHA] Seriously?
--[OKABE] That's right.

Stratfor, an American shadow

Right now, you're thinking

00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,750
that if I advance
one more step,

372
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,125
you'll shoot at my left leg,

so that it grazes my thigh.
