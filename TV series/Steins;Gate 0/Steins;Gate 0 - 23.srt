[MAHO]
Okabe?

00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,000
What are you doing
here so early?

3
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,958
Hiyajo, listen.

4
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,666
I have a question for you.

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, what?

6
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:38,083
Have you forsaken your silly
mad-scientist voice?

7
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,583
[OKABE] Our D-RINE worked,
and Amadeus was lost,

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,458
but we still met Hiyajo.

9
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,791
Apparently under very
different circumstances.

10

[inaudible]

11
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,875
[OKABE] Even as the world
lines keep changing,

12
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,166
our connections remain constant,

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,916
as if the conditions
reshape themselves

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,541
to support the
relationships we've built.

[OKABE]
Hey, Mayuri.

17
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,708
[MAYURI]
Hello? You there? It's Suzuha.

18
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,500
She's in some major trouble!

19
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,375
[OKABE]
Suzuha?

20
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,500
[MAYURI]
Yeah!

21
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:07,708
She's about to get
in the time machine

22
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,583
to go back one year
into the past!

23
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,333
She's leaving, even though
she can't come back!

24
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,625
Damn it all, why?

25
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,625
[MAYURI]
What?

26
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,750
Why'd you have to
make the choice

27
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,208
to talk to me about it, huh?

28
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,000
There's not enough time.

29
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,708
I can't even investigate
the situation

30
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,250
and find out exactly
what's changed.

31
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,375
There's only one element
that matters now:

32
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,375
They must leave
in the time machine.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
[OKABE]
Kagari?

34
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,708
She's way too early!

35
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,208
What's this about?

36
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,708
[OKABE] Kagari's still going
after the time machine.

37
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,291
Which means I've
gotta find her,

38
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,333
and stop her in her tracks.

39
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,041
[ALEXIS]
Rintaro.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,750
[ALEXIS] What business
could you possibly have

41
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,375
in a place like this?

42
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,958
You know my suspicion?

43
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,125
I think you know far more
about the time machine

44
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,750
than I gave you credit for.

45
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,583
Is my assessment correct?

46
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,541
[ALEXIS]
Where's Kagari?

47
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,666
I know after she
escaped the facility

48
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,458
that she met up with you
and your little lab crew,

49
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,250
so don't even try denying it.

50
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,166
You can't fool me. How much
of the truth do you know?

51
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,625
[OKABE]
I see.

52
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,833
Things are different because
the D-RINE erased Amadeus.

53
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,166
Is it possible that
the professor

54
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,833
wasn't able to
fully brainwash Kagari?

55
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,375
[OKABE grunts]
If that's true...

56
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,791
Professor Leskinen.
You're right.

57
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,916
I know things about the future

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,333
that you couldn't
begin to imagine.

59
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,125
Would you like to hear
about them?

60
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,000

I'll tell you everything.

00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,583
[KAGARI] I won't allow
the past to be changed.

00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,583
I will not let anyone erase
the day that I met Mommy.

Nobody's getting it.
I'll destroy the time machine.

00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,250
But, why?

[KAGARI]
Mommy Mayuri.

80
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,791
Are you a part of all of this?

81
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,375
Do you wanna change
the future, too,

82

just like Suzuha has been
trying to do for so many years?

83
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,750
Do you wanna make it so
that you and I never meet,

84
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,250
and you don't become my mom?

85

No, it's not that at all.

86
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,708
[KAGARI] Because that's
the last thing I want!

00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,916
However terrible the future
might be... I don't even care!

It's the only reality I want.

Oh my goodness.
That was scary.

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,041
I just realized I was holding
my breath the entire time!

103
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,375
I'm just grateful it worked,

104

and that you both decided
not to shoot each other.

You see, even though I am
getting in the time machine,

108
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,833
and I'm going back
into the past with Suzuha,

109
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,041
I'm only doing this

110
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,916
to make someone special
to me see the light.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,541
It's not gonna work!

112

No matter what you both do,

113
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,875
or how hard you try,
nothing ever works!

114

No good can come of it!

115
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,000
It will only keep us apart!

116
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,000
There's only enough fuel
left to go one way!

117
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,375
You won't be able to come back!

118
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,041
What'll happen to you? I don't
even want to think about it.

119
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,458
[MAYURI]
I understand.

120
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:34,208
This might be reckless,
and it could be hopeless, too.

121
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:38,083
But still, it's worth
it for Okarin.

122
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,958
He has a special power
to change the future.

123
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,750
Well, no.

124
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,583
I think we all have
that same power,

125
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,708
but he's learned to use it
in a different way

126
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,000
to guide us to
the best future possible.

127
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,541
Which is why I'm going,

128
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,041
to give him that extra little
push he needs to go back

129
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,750
and change something important.

130
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,750
And if that's all it takes,
I know I can do it.

131
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,166
It's the only thing I can do.

132

Orihime's gift to Hikoboshi.

133

Hikoboshi? But wait.

burned bright just once more,

it might've changed
everything for us.

Come back into the past with us.
We can change the future!

The world doesn't have to
fall apart or be sad,

and no one you love
has to die, either!

161
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:19,333
Now, Lab Member 002,
Shiina Mayuri!

162
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,083
Please, make Operation
Arclight a success!

163
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,541
And when I'm mired
in self-pity,

164
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,208
knock some sense into me, huh?

165
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
[gasps]

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,916
'Kay! I promise I will!

167
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,291
Come on, Kagari. Let's go!

168
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,000
[KAGARI]
Mommy.

169
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,500
[gunfire]

170
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,333
Moeka!

171
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,791
I can't hold them long.

172
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,916
Hurry up!

173
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,625
You have to come now, Kagari!

174
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,041
Mommy. I...

175
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,333
[KAGARI]
Okarin.

176
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,875
Are you certain?

177
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,458
You're okay with never
seeing Mommy again?

178
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,458
Won't that break your heart?

179
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,583
What are you blabbering about?

180
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,208
Mayuri is my precious
hostage, you know.

181
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,166
No matter where or when
she may venture,

182
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,083
I will always bring her back!

183
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,208
[chuckles]

184
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,833
[SUZUHA]
Kagari!

185
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,625
Aren't you coming?

186
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,958
Go! They won't get anywhere
near you! I'll protect you!

187
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:23,708
But, Kagari!

188
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,541
[KAGARI]
Hurry! Leave!

189
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,041
Mayuri, let's go!

190
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,041
Get in!

191
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,375
[KAGARI]
You're Mommy's Hikoboshi!

192
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,875
I'm trusting you.

193
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,458
I choose to, because you said
I can be with Mommy again.

194
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,208
That's a promise!

195
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,125
[inaudible]

196
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,208
[OKABE]
It showed up after all.

197
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,458
Okabe, no!

198
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,791
Mommy!

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,375
[OKABE]
I understand.

200
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,625
[OKABE] This time...
there's nothing to fear!

201
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,416
[OKABE]
This is it. This moment!

202
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:47,416
[OKABE laughing]

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,291
Attend me well,
for I won't suffer fools!

204
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,583
Schrodinger's box
has shattered wide open!

205
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,875
The time machine you bastards
sought no longer exists!

206
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,458
It has traveled
through space-time

207
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,250
and dissolved into the ether
along with your schemes!

208
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,375
Writhe with anguish. Tremble
in fear, for you should!

209
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,166
I, Hououin Kyouma, will prevail
against you and your designs.

210
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,833
Indeed, fate itself
will kneel at my feet!

211
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,708
Nothing will deter me.

212
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,125
I'll find Steins Gate!
Do you hear?

213
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,541
For that...

214
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,583
[OKABE chuckling]

215
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,416
...is what I have chosen!

216
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,541
[OKABE grunts]

217
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,750
[MAYURI]
Huh? What's that?

218
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,833
[DARU]
Hold up.

219
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,208
Are there two time machines?

220
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,666
[gasps]

221
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,000
[MAYURI]
A call from myself?

222
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,333
[DARU]
Huh?

223
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,958
What's going on?

224
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,166
[MAYURI]
I guess I'll answer it.

225
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,375
Uh, hello?

226
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,625
Who's this?

227
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,791
Please, don't be afraid,
I need you to hear me out.

228
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,833
[MAYURI gasps]

229
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,833
Do you love Hououin Kyouma?

230
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,416
Truly?

231
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,625
Exactly one minute
from right now,

232
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,916
Okarin will come back
from the past.

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,541
But he didn't succeed
in saving Makise Kurisu.

234
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,833
[MAYURI gasps]

235
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,458
[MAYURI]
So that means...

236
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
...no matter what it takes,

237
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,541
you're going to have to
confront your Hikoboshi.

238
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,583
You're the only one
who can open his eyes.

239
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,000
My Hikoboshi?

240
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,000
[gasps]

241
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,666
[MAYURI]
Yes.

242
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,750
[BOTH]
Hououin Kyouma.

243
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,416
Okarin's heart will
be shattered,

244
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,041
but you can get him
on his feet again.

245
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,416
It's gonna take more than just
speaking his name, though.

246
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,125
Thirty seconds to go!

247
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,541
[MAYURI]
Think of the exact moment

248
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,375
Hououin Kyouma came into being,
do you remember that?

249
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,500
[gasps]

250
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,416
[MAYURI]
The moment he came into being?

251
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,458
Yes, I remember.

252
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,541
[MAYURI] I'm entrusting
you with 27 years' worth

253
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,708
of love and pain.

254
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,625
You'll have to endure so much.

255
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,041
But I won't stop believing...

256
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,625
...in my Okarin...

257
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,916
...in our friends,
and in myself.

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,958
So, please, never
give up hope, either.

259
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,125
Because the rest
is in your hands.

260
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,291
Too-too-roo!

261
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,416
Hold on! I--

262
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,666
Mayuri, it's time!
We have to go!

263
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,041
Please, just tell me!
Does Steins Gate really exist?

264
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,833
[MAYURI]
It does I'm sure of it.

265
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,125
And now the second time
machine's gone, too?

266
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,791
Wait, who was that on the phone?

267
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,083
[alarm blaring]

268
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,041
[SUZUHA]
It's no use, Mayuri.

269
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,666
I'm sorry, but there's
not much hope.

270
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,791
[MAYURI]
I see.

271
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,500
Because there's
no fuel left, right?

272
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,125
If we had stayed, it would've
caused a time paradox,

273
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,458
so we had to jump.

274
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,083
I hate to say it, but this
might be the end for us.

275
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,666
There's no telling what time
we might be shot into.

276
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,291
One year later, or a
million back, I can't say.

277
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,125
[MAYURI]
Thank you, Suzuha.

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,500
Why would you thank me?

279
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,750
Thank you so much for letting me
come along with you like this.

280
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,416
And don't worry!

281
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,125
I'm confident the other Mayuri

282
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,541
and my Hikoboshi can take
care of things from here.

283
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,958
I'm so jealous of Uncle
Okarin right now, you know?

284
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,166
If I had Reading
Steiner like him,

285
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,875
then I could remember
everything.

286
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,708
Even when world lines changed.

287
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,583
Like talking to
this version of you,

288
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,833
who is younger than me,
and everything about this time.

289
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,708
It's weird to think I won't talk
to you for another six years.

290
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,541
Wait, even longer.

291
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,000
Unless you happen to start
talking right after you're born!

[MAYURI]
Hey, Okarin.

295
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,791
When the world seems like
it's fallen into darkness...

296
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,583
...and you're afraid of
the shadows all around...

297
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,458
...try not to close your eyes.

298
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,625
Don't ever give up.

299
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,125
And promise you won't let
Hououin Kyouma die.

300
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,958
That way, my feelings
can still reach your heart.

Even if they have to
travel for hundreds,

even thousands of hours,

303
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,208
like the light
of some distant star....

304

I'm responsible for her death.

320
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,083
I'm responsible...

321
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,791
[MAYURI]
It says to turn on the news.

322
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,750
[DARU]
Seriously?

323
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,416
[REPORTER]
Despite the cargo bay fire,

324
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,791
Doctor Nakabachi's plane
managed to land safely

325
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,958
within the borders
of the former Soviet Union,

326
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,541
to which he'd recently defected.

327
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,041
--[DARU] 'Kay, that's weird.
--[MAYURI] That's my metal oopa!

328
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,041
[MAYURI]
I know it is!

329
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,250
[DARU]
Why's it in Russia?

330
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,458
[SUZUHA]
That thesis of his.

331
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,208
That's what starts
World War III.

332
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,958
It basically sparks
an arms race,

333
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,750
only the goal is which country
can build a time machine first.

334
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,833
Take first place
and win the world.

335
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,750
That's how it starts, but things
get hostile pretty quick.

336
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,541
The lives of 5.7 billion
people are at stake here.

337
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,875
Save Makise Kurisu and
you save every one of them.

338
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,458
I can't do it.

339
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,166
Things'll end up just
as they did with Mayuri.

340
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,541
No matter what I did, she died.

341
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,833
[MAYURI]
Think of the exact moment

342
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,541
Hououin Kyouma came into being!

343
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,625
Do you remember that?

344
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,541
[OKABE]
Believe me, I know.

345
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,625
You may not think I do,

346
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:43,000
but I know how
cruel time can be.

347
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:48,166
We like to imagine we can
bend it to suit us, but...

348
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,000
...this was bound to happen.

349
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,791
It was stupid of me
to play along.

350
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,916
I'm sorry, but I'm...

351
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,416
...I'm just done.

352
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,250
Let time have its way.

353
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,375
[gasps]

354
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:11,791
[inaudible]

355
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,625
[OKABE]
Hail and well met...

356
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,416
...old friend.

357
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,958
That you're able to open
this means you've seen it.

358
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,166
You've seen firsthand
what became of Makise

359
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,083
and failed to prevent it.

360
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,833
I feel for you.
Believe me, I do.

361
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,375
That said, the pain you're going
through right now is necessary.

362
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,666
I daren't deny you--us...
the bitter inspiration

363
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,083
it represents.

364
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,708
Without it, you cannot hope
to carve out your destiny.

365
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,500
Now we can marshal
our resources properly.

366
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:56,083
I hereby charge you with the
task of reaching Steins Gate.

367
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,125
The target world line's
charming little nickname

368
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,666
comes care of me as well,

369
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,791
which is to say,
it comes from you.

370
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,375
Care to guess its significance?

371
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,833
Bingo. There's none.

372
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,875
[MAHO]
Hey, are you sure about this?

373
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,958
[DARU]
Yeah, for the most part.

374
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,958
[MAHO] Don't you think
the Okabe in 2010

375
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,625
will be humiliated
by the whole thing?

376
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,083
No need to worry about that.

377
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,041
He was even more
incredible back then.

378
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,041
Just thinking about it
makes me shudder.

379
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,125
[OKABE] And to further
please our whimsy,

380
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,333
Operation Skuld will be the name
we assign to this mission.

381
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,125
Forge of yesterday whatever
you must to save the future.

382
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,541
Deceive yourself
in every last detail.

383
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,500
Deceive the world.

384
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,875
Do this, and victory is assured.

385
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,041
Best of luck to you, old friend.

386
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,833
El. Psy. Congroo.

387
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:46,708
[FARIS]
Cut!

388
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,875
Nice job! You nailed it! Meow!

389
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,208
[OKABE]
Now the final step.

390
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,375
We have to send the video
in a D-mail to the past.

391
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,041
Ruka.

392
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,416
On it.

393
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,625
The video that you just made
goes to Kyouma in 2010,

394
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,375
and the one Hashida
already filmed,

395
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,500
that goes to Suzuha in 2011,

396
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,333
right after you depart on
your trip, is that right?

397
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,375
[MAHO]
You really wanna do this?

398
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,625
[OKABE]
Yes, why?

399
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,708
Because you'll be manning
the inaugural run

400
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,375
of an experimental time machine.

401
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,750
[MAHO] You've told me you're
supposed to die in 2025,

402
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,291
I get that,

403
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,208
but it doesn't mean it's okay
for you to just throw your--

404
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,500
[OKABE] I have no intention
of doing anything of the sort.

405
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,041
I fully believe our efforts
here will pay off.

406
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,125
Yeah, but...

407
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,166
What if you interpret
it differently?

408
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,708
In 2025, Okabe Rintaro doesn't
perish like we thought.

409
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,083
Instead, he boards the first
version of our time machine

410
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,583
and departs for another
corner of space-time.

411
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,833
If I were to disappear from
this world line, well, then...

412
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,875
...that's essentially
the same as dying here.

413
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,166
Wouldn't you agree?

414
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,375
[MAHO] I'd call that mindset
overly optimistic.

415
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,416
[OKABE] Emotions aside,
it's a viable theory, is it not?

416
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,708
[chuckles]

417
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,875
[OKABE]
The world can be deceived.

418
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,500
My friends! I thank you for
following my lead until now!

419
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,750
As you know... on that
day, in the year 2011,

420
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,291
a time machine departed
for the past and was lost.

421
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,583
I venture into the abyss
to find Mayuri and Suzuha.

422
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,958
With the Kerr black hole tracer,

423
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,500
I'll be able to home
in on their locus.

424
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,625
With luck, it will lead me
straight to where they are.

425
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,833
[KAGARI]
Okarin.

426
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,916
[KAGURI]
Take this.

427
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,416
[OKABE]
Are you sure?

428
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,333
I am. Please give it to Mommy
when you find her, for me.

429
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,291
Yes, I promise.

430
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,416
[MAHO] I just have to
ask you one last time.

431
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,750
About Steins Gate.

432
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,125
Does it exist?

433
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,916
And can we reach it?

434
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,750
[OKABE]
It exists. We'll find it.

435
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,416
As of now, the operation
commences!

436
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,958
Operation Altair!

437
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,958
That is the name by which
it shall be known!

438
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you think that he'll succeed?

439
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,291
'Course he will.

440
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,166
If anyone can do it, Kyouma can.

441
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,791
Yeah, I'm with Faris.

442
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,791
He's special.

443
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,416
Nothing's out of his reach.

444
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,541
Exactly right.

445
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,625
Okarin makes the
impossible possible.

446
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,125
Good luck, Okarin.

447
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,458
[MAHO] The universe may not
have a discernible end.

448
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,625
It's infinite,

449
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,500
but it had a beginning.

450
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,500
And as for its component
parts, the stars,

451
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,958
those definitely have a limited
cosmological shelf life.

452
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,541
They're finite.

453
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,083
If history tells us anything,

454
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,333
it's that scientists
often make very poor poets.

455
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,041
We're a ship of fools,
chasing phantoms,

456
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,875
heedless of what
underwrites natural law.

457
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,458
If we could somehow
attain that wisdom,

458
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,708
perhaps it would only plunge
us into madness and ruin.

459
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,208
Humans exceeding
the speed of light?

460
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,000
It's more foolish
than fish attempting

461
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,291
to make a life on land.

462
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,916
And yet...

463
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,500
...these words.

464
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,375
They're meant for those
foolhardy enough

465
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,708
to defy the counsels of fate.

466
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,375
An epigraph for
their obstinance.

467
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,500
[inaudible]

468
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,458
Suzuha!

469
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,833
[laughs]

470
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,875
Did you doubt me, my loves?
