1
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,875
[MAHO]
For cryin' out loud.

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,583
You know, after that
New Year's Thief fiasco,

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,166
I had hoped things would
settle down, but nope.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,000
--[door opens]
--Hm?

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,500
[laughs] Freeze, Maho!
This is a stickup!

6
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,583
What the heck did
you buy this time?

7
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,041
Isn't it wonderful?

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,916
I saw it in an Akihabara toy
store and couldn't resist.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,791
It's an air gun.

10
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,458
I got it for the festival.

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,125
It's great! Shoots
beans in rapid fire!

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,125
So let's cast out the demons
and rake in the bucks!

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,625
Isn't that how it goes?

14
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,000
It's "bring in the
luck," Professor.

15
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,916
Besides, shouldn't
we be getting ready

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,583
for the trip back to America?

17
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,000
Stop buying junk, or we're
gonna run out of room.

18
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,000
And Reyes won't like you
leaving clutter here.

19
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,458
You're right, we did
borrow this office space.

20
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,583
We should be good guests

21
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,208
and leave it cleaner
than we found it.

22
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,041
But still, there'll be
plenty of time later

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,833
for packing up and cleaning.

24
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,375
For now, let's have fun.

25
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,875
It'd behoove us to check out
the festivals before we go home

26
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,375
and let loose in the
Japanese tradition!

27
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,291
Haven't you heard
the old saying, Maho?

28
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,958
When the cat's away,
the mice will play,

29
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,208
and I know the perfect time.

30
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,791
Setsubun! [laughs]

31
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,166
Setsubun, huh?

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,875
I can't believe it's
already that time of year.

33
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,958
Huh?

34
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,291
Almost Valentine's Day!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,333
[SUZUHA]
See ya later, Boss.

36
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,583
Have a good night.

37
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,291
Guess we'll see you
in the morning.

38
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,750
[BRAUN]
Oh, hold on a sec.

39
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,333
[SUZUHA, KAGARI]
Hm?

40
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,250
[BRAUN] Here are your
wages for last month.

41
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,458
But... you're helping me out.

42
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,291
You protect me, so I work here.

43
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,291
I thought...

44
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,708
I pay my workers.

45
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,125
I have morals, you know.

46
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,041
[KAGARI]
But, sir.

47
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,208
[SUZUHA]
Come on, just take it.

48
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,416
Uh--

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,541
It's probably not very
much dough, anyway.

50
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,375
[BRAUN]
Oh, yeah?

51
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,916
[SUZUHA chuckles]

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Sounds to me like somebody would
prefer to work for nothing!

53
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,791
Whoopsie, too slow!
Thanks for everything, Boss!

54
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,750
Why, you little...

55
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,708
Here you go.

56
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,750
[KAGARI]
Huh?

57
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,541
I really appreciate this!

58
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,291
[KAGARI giggles]

59
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,625
You sure seem happier
than usual today.

60
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,791
'Cause I am.

61
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,750
I've never been paid
for my work before.

62
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,875
Well, do you have any idea
how you're going to spend it?

63
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,916
[KAGARI] Hmm. That's
a really good question.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,583
I'll have to give
it some thought.

65
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,000
[SUZUHA gasps]

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,000
Wanna go? This place has
the most delicious desserts.

67
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,291
[SUZUHA] Uh, no, that okay.
I was just curious, is all.

68
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,625
[SUZUHA]
What's up, Kagari?

69
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,875
Well, uh...

70
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,875
This poster...
What's it talking about?

71
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,000
[KAGARI]
Valentine's Day?

72
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,833
Yeah. It's a special day where
people show their affection.

73
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,125
Usually by giving the ones that
they love thoughtful gifts,

74
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,125
like chocolate.

75
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,541
Oh, I see. How nice.

76
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,416
[SUZUHA]
Back when I was a little girl,

77
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,541
my mom would search high
and low for the ingredients

78
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,958
to make us chocolates
for Valentine's Day.

79
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,791
[KAGARI]
How wonderful!

80
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,541
[gasps]

81
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,458
Showing your feelings
with candy?

82
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,541
That's such a remarkable custom!

83
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,458
I've decided I want to
participate in the tradition!

84
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,416
What? You do?

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,666
[RUKA] Hey, uh, do you
think that Kagari...

86
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,958
...might have a special
someone in mind here?

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,125
Huh?

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,875
[AMADEUS]
So?

89
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,291
You've got something
planned for him, right?

90
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,541
Are you ever gonna
give this thing up?

91
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,416
I've told you repeatedly,
not happening.

92
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,458
Do not crush my dreams!

93
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,666
You're going back
to America soon.

94
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,333
You have to tell him how you
feel before it's time to leave.

95
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,541
Will you stop?

96
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,625
For the hundredth time,
it's not like that!

97
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,916
If you convince yourself that's
the truth, you'll regret it.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,041
I just think it's
better to take a chance

99
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,166
and make someone feel special,
even if it's "not like that."

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,208
Huh?

101
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,666
Maho?

102
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,333
[AMADEUS, MAKISE]
You there?

103
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,791
Ma'am?

104
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,875
[MAHO gasps]

105
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,750
Do you really not like anyone?

106
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,833
Yes, I told you that, now
will you give it a rest?

107
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,083
[MAKISE grunts]

108
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,625
[sighs] Besides, this
is America, you know?

109
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,958
From what I've seen,
the guys here

110
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,833
typically do the gift
giving, not the girls.

111
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,083
[MAKISE] Yeah, but don't you
think it coming from a girl

112
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,041
makes the gesture
even more romantic?

113
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,291
Bucking tradition to
reveal your feelings!

114
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,166
[MAHO] We're scientists.
Romance is not our forte.

115
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,375
"To be a scientist is
to be hopelessly romantic

116
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,416
in the truest sense."

117
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,250
Haven't you ever
heard that saying?

118
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,208
No, who said it? Einstein?

119
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,708
Yours truly.

120
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,291
[MAHO chuckles] Okay then,
Shakespeare, who do you like?

121
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,291
You're a beautiful
genius whose theories

122
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,791
are sure to be published
before you're 20.

123
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,833
There's a horde of men who'd
kill to be your Valentine.

124
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,791
[BOTH chuckle]

125
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,458
Since I've been in college,

126
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,750
several guys have approached
me with romantic intentions.

127
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,041
But as soon as we start talking,

128
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,041
they run away like I'm
some alien life form.

129
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,875
[MAKISE] Why can't they
handle losing a simple,

130
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,250
friendly debate? It's pathetic.

131
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,791
And besides.

132
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,333
I already have a special someone
in mind for Valentine's Day.

133
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,166
Wha--?

134
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,458
--[MAKISE gasps]
--Oh, no!

135
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,125
[MAKISE]
Anyway, I just think it's better

136
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,333
to take a chance and
make someone feel special,

137
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,958
even if it's not like that.

138
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,291
[MAHO]
Jeez.

139
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,166
What's wrong with you?
You're spacing out.

140
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,083
[MAHO]
Oh, sorry, it's nothing.

141
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,291
Regardless, this conversation
is officially over.

142
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,375
Are you serious?

143
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,708
[MAHO]
Don't give me that.

144
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,208
I'm shutting down now.

145
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,166
[FARIS] I overheard what you
were talking about in there.

146
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,708
Nya ha, ha, ha.

147
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,291
To think that Maho has a super
special someone in her life.

148
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,958
Excuse me?

149
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,000
[FARIS] Now you can pour
all those tender feelings

150
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,666
into your chocolate.

151
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,000
Reach out to your beloved!

152
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,583
Hang on! You're
completely delusional!

153
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,583
I never said anything
about a "beloved"!

154
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,708
[FARIS]
Oh, but you forget

155
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,708
I possess the eye of
the sky-god Horus.

156
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,708
I see what's written
on your heart.

157
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,041
Why doesn't anyone
ever believe me?

158
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,416
[MOEKA]
Chocolate.

159
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,833
--Huh?
--Uh?

160
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,291
--Meow, meow, meow!
--[MAHO gasps]

161
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,875
[yawns] Good morning.

162
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,208
Whoa, Kiryu?

163
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,875
How long have you been
hiding underneath there?

164
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,041
This whole time.

165
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,875
So that means you
heard everything.

166
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,458
I'm giving chocolate.

167
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,625
[ALL]
Huh?

168
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,833
I have someone to
give chocolate to.

169
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,541
[ALL gasp]

170
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,291
[AMADEUS] Does this mean
what I think it means?

171
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,916
[FARIS]
I'm so proud of Moe-meow!

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,166
Are you really going to
reveal your feelings to them?

173
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,041
Well, this is quite a surprise.

174
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,666
Yeah. I can't imagine you
confessing anything,

175
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,125
let alone love.

176
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,875
[AMADEUS]
So who is it, then?

177
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,125
[MOEKA]
Secret.

178
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,416
[MAHO]
What?

179
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Delicious.

180
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,333
[KAGARI] So, uh... It goes
together like this, then?

181
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,750
No, no. You've got
it turned around.

182
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,541
But how? What have I done?

183
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,083
[SUZUHA]
Kagari has someone she likes.

184
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,333
[BRAUN]
Hello, ladies!

185
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,000
[NAE] Oh! Hi, Dad,
I'm glad you're back!

186
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,708
Well, Nae, have you
been a good girl?

187
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,125
[NAE] Yup! Miss Kagari and I
have been doing fun crafts!

188
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,083
Oh, you were?

189
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,500
Did you have a nice time?

190
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,375
Hey, Dad, guess what?
You know what Miss Kagari did?

191
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,750
No! Quiet!

192
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,875
She is the clumsiest
person I have ever met!

193
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,125
Nae! Why would you tell
him mean things about me?

194
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,208
[NAE]
Because!

195
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,500
Nothing to be
embarrassed about.

196
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,500
It's not like I
didn't already know.

197
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,333
Hey, c'mon, not you, too!

198
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:10,250
[NAE, BRAUN laughing]

199
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,708
[SUZUHA]
It can't be!

200
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,250
Mister Braun! I think
I'm in love with you!

201
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,958
You can't be, it isn't right!

202
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,416
You musn't think of me as a man,

203
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,625
but as Nae's father and
your boss, nothing more!

204
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,375
But someday... You and I...

205
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,833
We could raise her together!
I could be a mother to her!

206
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,250
[BRAUN gasps]

207
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,958
Stupid.

208
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,500
There's no way that's
what's going on here.

209
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,625
What's your problem?

210
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,375
Oh, hi! Uh, nothing! [laughs]

211
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,625
I--I was just daydreaming.

212
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh, I'm gonna go
clean up out front.

213
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,625
Okay, bye, see you later!

214
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,083
Good afternoon.

215
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,125
Yeah? Oh, Okabe, it's just you.

216
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,625
What's up?

217
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,625
You find a new lead about
those attackers or somethin'?

218
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,708
No, sorry.

219
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,541
It's nothing as
important as all that.

220
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,208
[KAGARI]
Hi, Okarin!

221
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,958
So what brings you
into the shop today?

222
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,166
[OKABE] Uh, just came to
see how things are going.

223
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,000
Uh--you mean you came
to check up on me?

224
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,250
Yeah. You're looking quite well.

225
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,208
I appreciate you going
out of your way to visit me.

226
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,750
You must be so cold!

227
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,583
[OKABE] No, I'm fine.
I'm also here on an errand.

228
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,333
I've come bearing a
message from Mayuri.

229
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,416
She says that you and
I should go together

230
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,250
to pick out a cell
phone for you.

231
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,041
[KAGARI]
She really said that?

232
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,708
[SUZUHA] What are those
two talking about?

233
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,458
[gasps] It can't be!

234
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,291
You seem chilled to the bone.

235
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,458
[OKABE]
I feel warm now.

236
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,875
Your cheeks are flushed.

237
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,833
I've never seen them so
ruddy before. You see?

238
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,500
[gasps] Your hands.

239
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,541
[KAGIRI gasps]
I'm so sorry!

240
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,708
--[OKABE] Kagari. It's fine.
--Your cheeks,

241
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,541
they looked so cold, I had to...

242
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,958
[SUZUHA]
Oh, please, no.

243
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,125
Anything but that.

244
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,166
If that's how this
whole thing turned out,

245
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,833
Mayuri would never forgive me!

246
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,500
She would hate me forever!

247
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,708
Help me!

248
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,166
I have no idea what I'm
supposed to do here!

249
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,250
[FARIS] Thanks for doing
me this favor, meow!

250
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,625
[MAYURI]
Don't mention it!

251
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,166
You know I'd do anything
for a good friend in need!

252
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,666
And if you're a friend
of Mayushii's,

253
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,333
then we automatically adopt you!

254
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm so glad to hear it!

255
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,333
Besides, making costumes
is our favorite pastime!

256
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,291
[FUBUKI] By the way, are you
going fully handmade, Mayushii?

257
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,666
Yup!

258
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,541
'Cause I think the customers
will appreciate that.

259
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,416
They love when we put
our hearts into it!

260
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,666
C'mon!

261
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,625
You know I'm not talking
about the café costumes.

262
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,958
Chocolate.

263
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,291
You're gonna give Okarin
homemade chocolate, right?

264
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,208
Uhh, yeah!

265
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,416
But I have to say,

266
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,916
I've never been
a very good cook,

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,333
so we'll see how it turns out.

268
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,541
[FUBUKI]
Well, in that case,

269
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,791
you should wear this.

270
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,333
It's okay, Okarin.

271
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,333
I can be your
Valentine's dessert.

272
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,375
[MAYURI]
Too-too-roo.

273
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,916
So hot! [laughs]

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,250
Uh, Fubuki?

275
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,333
Sometimes you sound exactly
like Daru, you know?

276
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,625
--[KAEDE, MAYURI chuckle]
--[FUBUKI] I'm so ashamed.

277
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,583
But, Mayuri, if you put
your heart and soul

278
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,125
into your chocolate,

279
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,125
I have no doubt that Okarin
will love them, no matter what!

280
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,750
[MAYURI]
Mm... I'm not so sure.

281
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,666
[FARIS chuckles]

282
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,208
[KAEDE]
What, Faris?

283
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,541
Mew just leave the
chocolates to Faris!

284
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,583
As of this meow-ment,

285
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,291
Let the 36th round table meeting

286
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,666
of Valentine chocolate-
making commence!

287
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,916
Round table?

288
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,583
Did she just say meow-ment?

289
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,000
[FARIS]
In other words,

290
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,500
we'll all be helping each other
make handmade chocolate.

291
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,750
Amazing!

292
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,916
That means you've done
this 35 times before?

293
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,291
[MAHO]
No. That's impossible.

294
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,208
[SUZUHA] I know they
invited me here for this,

295
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,250
Still, it makes no sense.
I don't even have a Valentine.

296
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:42,041
I'm curious about Kagari, but
this whole thing is ridiculous.

297
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,416
I'm leaving.

298
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,291
Are mew sure about that?

299
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,875
If you go, it means no yummy
chocolates for you to taste

300
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,375
when we're done!

301
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,208
[SUZUHA] Those things don't
matter to me. You know that.

302
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,041
[FARIS] Yuki's on her
way over meow, too.

303
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,625
Well, if you insist, I'll stay!

304
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,083
Besides, chocolate
is calorie-dense,

305
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,458
which is valuable in
times of emergency.

306
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,208
I knew you would come around!

307
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,791
All right! Time to get busy
making those chocolates!

308
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,250
[ALL]
Yeah!

309
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,833
Hey. Who are you planning to
give your chocolates to, Nae?

310
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,125
My dad, of course!

311
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,666
Oh, really? Are you
sure you're not gonna

312
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,833
give 'em to some hunky
guy in your class?

313
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,500
No! Don't be ridiculous.

314
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,458
What about you, Kagari?

315
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,875
My chocolates?

316
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,500

So, then, it's the
heat of the water

Thanks so much!

[FARIS] Everyone's having
such a great time!

487
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,750
[FARIS] I'm glad we only
do this once every year.

00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,333
There's no way I could
put myself through it

more than that. Meow...

Oh, yeah.

[FARIS]
I wonder.

492
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,791
Did all the others give
out their chocolates yet?

[OKABE] You found these with the
things that Kagari left behind?

494
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,416
That's odd.

[RUKA]
Yes.

00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,458
And they weren't just
for you two, either.

She left me a batch,
and one for my father,

and even the owner
who lives below us.

499
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,250
And to think, she was so
looking forward to this day.

500

Well, I'm sure she'll come back

Hold on.

You came back to America without
even giving out your chocolate

Unbelievable!

I mean, I get that you had to
leave before Valentine's Day,

510
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,041
but that's what the mail is for.

511
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,250
Or you could've
given it out early.

I did give it out.

Did they like it?

Nothing. They weren't around.

I was a little late
