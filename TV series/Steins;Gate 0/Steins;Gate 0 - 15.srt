[KAGARI] What have you done
with it? My precious gift.

00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,083
The one Mommy gave me.

00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,916
Your precious gift?

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,833

[FARIS]
So, meow?

15
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,625
[SUZUHA] Well, I've only
got about a week left.

16
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,500
I feel a little guilty, though.

17
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,083
Suzu-meow, what is that?

18
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,750
[SUZUHA]
Ah. It's a photo.

19
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,125
Something I really treasure.

20
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,916
[FARIS]
Wow, is that you?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,833
Which means the woman
next to you must be...

22
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:05,875
[SUZUHA]
Yup.

23
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,666
This is a picture of me
and my mom.

24
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,875
[FARIS]
Why do you look so grumpy?

25
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,583
Did you not want
to take the picture?

26
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,416
[SUZUHA]
To be honest, I don't remember.

27
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:18,833
[SUZUHA]
It's true. I have no idea.

28
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,375
What else have I forgotten?

29
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,416
Suzu-meow.

[YUKI]
Hello!

31
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,125
[SUZUHA]
Uh. Mo-- I mean, Yuki!

32
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,041
It's been a while.

33
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,958
[SUZUHA]
My brother? Uh. He's, um,

34
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,208
I dunno, I guess
he's been doing well.

35
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,291
[YUKI]
Good. I'm glad to know that.

36
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,375
I haven't heard
from him in so long.

37
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,833
I thought he might have been
under the weather or something,

38
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,416
so I was getting
kind of worried.

39
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,166
But anyway, I'm glad to know
that everything's all right.

I'm so excited to see Maho!

42
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,708
Keep your eyes
peeled for her.

43
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,458
She's pretty easy to miss.

44
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,750
Hey, Hiyajo!

[FARIS giggles]

46
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,333
Long time no see, friends.
What's up?

47
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,458
[MAYURI] Maho sure
seems to be doing well.

48
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,958
[OKABE]
Yeah.

49
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,916
Apparently she came to help
the Professor with his work.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,041
She's quite a busy lady.

51
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,166
Poor Kagari.

52
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,000
I hope she's doing
all right, too.

53
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,333
Same here.

54
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,375
Daru and Suzuha
have been looking for her.

55
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,416
[MAYURI]
Mmm.

56
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Oh, by the way,
where is Hashida?

57
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,875
He said he had
something important

58
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,250
to talk about with Suzu-meow,

59
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,250
so he wasn't able to come.

60
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,541
[MAHO]
Hmm.

61
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,166
What the hell, Dad?! For real?!

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,750
Whoa, what did I do to earn
that mean, stank face?

63
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,083
[SUZUHA]
Put your hand over your heart

64
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,625
and tell me
you don't really know.

65
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,666
My hand to my heart?

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,083
--Uhh...
--[SUZUHA growls]

67
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,916
Fine, then,
just keep on ghosting her!

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,083
Someone's gonna come along

69
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,000
and pay her more attention,
you'll see!

70
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,083
Huh? Say that again?
What do you mean?

71
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,458
I've seen it for myself.

72
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,166
The other day Mom
was talking to some guy

73
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,583
and acting all friendly
and flirty with him.

74
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,125
She was flirting?

75
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,416
When's the last time
you even saw her?

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,375
It was... the day
I went to visit Fubuki.

77
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,791
But not since then?

78
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,666
[DARU]
Mm-mm.

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,833
[SUZUHA growls]

80
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,916
So why haven't you
reached out to her?

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,916
[DARU]
Well, uh, because,

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,291
I've been super busy working
on the Time Leap Machine,

83
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,750
and all kinds
of other important stuff.

84
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,625
[SUZUHA] You would make time
if you really wanted to!

85
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,416
[gasps] You're right.

86
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,166
Well, what if you don't
ask her out in time

87
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,416
and she just ends up
marrying someone else?

88
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,625
[DARU]
Mmm.

89
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,291
--Maybe this is no big deal.
--[SUZUHA gasps]

90
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,833
How do you know
it wasn't some guy

91
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,083
asking her for directions

92
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,291
or trying to sell her
something.

93
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,833
You don't know
she was flirting.

94
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,458
[SUZUHA]
Yeah, and what if you're wrong?

95
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,916
If you're so worried about it,
why are you talkin' to me?

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,916
Shouldn't you be
talking to her?

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,750
Why aren't you even remotely
concerned about this?

98
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,375
Can't you muster
a shred of sympathy

99
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,875
for the fact that
my entire existence

100
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,000
might be at stake here?

101
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,708
Come on, I'm talking
to you right now,

102
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,125
so doesn't that tell us

103
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,500
that you will be born
at the same time in the future?

104
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,833
Huh? Wait, is that...?

105
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,708
Miss Amane in the future?

106
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,791
Ooh! Loli Suzuha is lovely!

107
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,916
You're missing the point,
Dad! Look closer!

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,916
[DARU]
Hmm?

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,583
Why is your lower half so faded?

110
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,791
It's been doing that
for a while now.

111
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,625
Huh--? That's just like
<i>Back to the Future.</i>

112
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,041
[SUZUHA]
Dad!

113
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,125
What?

114
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,125
[SUZUHA]
You have zero confidence, Dad.

115

[sighs]

116
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,458
And because you don't
believe in yourself,

117
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,958
you're avoiding
making the first move.

118
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,541
You're just sitting on your ass,

119
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,458
hoping that Mom
will do it for you.

120
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,916
Is that right?

121
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,750
You're not wrong.

122
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,916
The future doesn't wait for
those who refuse to take action.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,208
That's something
you said to me

124
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,416
when I was a little girl.

125
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,625
Whoa, I really said all that?

126
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,666
But that's not what--

127
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,791
Listen to me!

128
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,333
If you and Mom
aren't moving forward,

129
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,166
I might be in real jeopardy,
do you understand?

130
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,333
This is serious!

Too-too-roo!

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,041
We're here! Hi! Huh?

134
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,583
Ruka, Moeka, I wasn't
expecting you guys.

135
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,000
What's happening?

136
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,291
Hey, Mayuri.

137
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,500
[SUZUHA] Perfect timing.
We need your help here.

139

[MAYURI]
Okay, I see now.

140
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
Before his date
with Yuki tomorrow,

141
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,500
we need to teach Daru
to have confidence in himself.

142
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,833
Is that what's going on?

143
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:35,958
[SUZUHA]
Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,791
I'm clueless about
this sort of thing,

145
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,208
which is why I asked
all of you to help me out.

146
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,875
I'm guessing the doctored
photo worked, then?

147
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,250
[SUZUHA]
Brother!

148
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,333
Yes?

149
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,500
Our mission
commences immediately!

Operation objective:

151
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,541
upon conclusion of his date
with Amane Yuki tomorrow,

152
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,625
Hashida Daru will face

153
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,916
and confess
his feelings for her.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,083
[gasping]

155
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,666
Tell Miss Amane that?
You've gone crazy!

156
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,583
That is the wrong attitude,
mister! Try again!

157
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,541
Miss Suzuha!

158
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,125
Yes! I will, Miss Suzuha!

so desperate to see you

I mean, think about it.

325
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,083
Why would a beautiful

326

ever willingly
decide to marry

of crap like me?

That just doesn't happen,
not outside of dating SIMs.

Miss Amane will end up
with somebody else.

say stuff like that to me, Dad!

But you said it yourself,

Thanks, Mayuri.

No. This whole thing
is my fault,

about the time I come from.

It's a chaotic,
terrifying place.

much time with you and Mom.

And the truth is,

I just wanted to experience it.

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,208
To see my mom and dad,

368
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,791
who created
and gave birth to me,

369
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,375
to watch them
spending time together.

370
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,541
I thought if I could,
then everything would be okay.

I'd be heading down
the right path.

I felt like it would be
the proof that I needed.

I'm sorry,

374
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,000
but the story about
her flirting with another guy,

375
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,500
and me fading
from the picture?

376

It was all just a lie.
