[DARU]
Hey, Suzuha!

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,125
[SUZUHA]
Hm?

5
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,333
[DARU]
My lovely daughter!

6
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,333
You in there?

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,333
[SUZUHA]
What is up with all this,

8
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,625
"my lovely daughter" stuff, Dad?

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,000
That's what dads say to show
their daughters they love 'em.

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,291
[SUZUHA] I get that, but why are
you being overly sweet to me?

11
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,500
What's wrong?
You having problems in there?

12
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,125
You can't ask me that!

13
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,375
I have told you before,

14
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,750
if you have too much
information,

15
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,500
it could lead to a paradox.

16
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,750
On that note.

17
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,041
You could take this
hard drive back.

18
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,166
Oh, damn. You found it.

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,625
Of course, and you could've
hidden it a lot better

20
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:48,958
if you tried.

21
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,250
Probably.

22
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,750
Look, without her hard drive,

23
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,125
I don't know if I can
actually figure out

24
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,791
how to build this thing
in the future.

25
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,541
[SUZUHA]
No cheating allowed!

26
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,833
[SUZUHA]
You could do it.

27
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:04,958
If you couldn't,

28
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,166
I wouldn't have been
able to come here.

29
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,666
You're going?

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,250
I am.

31
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,666
Okey dokey.

32
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,666
[SUZUHA] Main reason is because
I'm too happy and comfortable

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,833
living in this point in time.

34
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,750
Makes me want to
stay here forever,

35
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,625
and I know that's out
of the question.

36
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,750
I find myself
daydreaming about it.

37
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:33,875
[door opens]

38
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,166
Who's there?

39
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,541
Ah, Mayushii? What's up?

40
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,166
Suzuha?

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,125
[SUZUHA]
What?

42
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,666
Did something happen?

43
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,750
You came to us from way
in the future, didn't you?

44
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:54,208
It seems like everyone but me
knows the whole story.

45
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,583
[SUZUHA]
Listen, Mayushii--

46
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,375
I want you to tell
me about myself,

47
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,583
and about Makise Kurisu.

48
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,208
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,291
[train rumbling]

50
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,375
Hope you like Okinawa tea.

51
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,791
Where did Daru go?

52
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,708
We ran out of snacks,
so he went to pick up some more.

53
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,416
Well, that's good, right?

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,791
Talks like this are
usually better

55
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,375
when fewer people are involved.

56
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,375
Does that mean you're
gonna be here for it?

57
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,666
[MAHO] Yeah. I'm a
scientist, after all.

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,958
I might be able
to provide support

59
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,208
in the form of information.

60
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,125
So,

61
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,958
Maho, you know what's going on?

62
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,208
Only a rough outline,

63
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,208
based on what the three
of them have told me.

64
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,291
Before we begin,
I need to ask you...

65
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,791
Why do you want to know about
this right now, all of a sudden?

66
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,791
Well, because...

67
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,875
Before this, I was afraid
of knowing too much

68
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,583
about the future.

69
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,833
But now...

70
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,916
[SUZUHA]
Now, what?

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
I ran into Okarin
yesterday evening,

72
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,125
and he told me... not to
think about any of this.

73
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,333
That it was all okay.

74
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:38,250
And yet, when he said it,
he just seemed so miserable.

75
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,416
Like he has for the past year.

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,291
Sad and gloomy.

77
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,000
I know what you mean.

78
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,500
Look, the thing is, knowing this
might not make any difference.

79
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,291
Uncle Okarin's a bit lost.

80
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:53,000
I understand, but
I still want to hear it.

81
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,458
If I never open up
to the whole truth,

82
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,958
I know that I'll regret
it someday.

83
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
All right, but look.

84
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,875
Uncle Okarin's the only one
who can carry memories

85
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,541
over from other world lines.

86
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,833
So, at best, I'm just piecing
together the story

87
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,541
from everything
he's relayed to me.

88
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,500
Tell me, did Makise Kurisu...

89
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,208
Did she sacrifice her life?

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,875
Did she choose to die
in this world line

91
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,041
just so that I could live?

92
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,375
I don't think you can call
what she did a sacrifice,

93
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,333
at least, not literally.

94
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,958
But it is clear that there are
at least two world lines.

95
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,625
In what we call the
"alpha world lines,"

96
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,041
Makise Kurisu lives,
and you die,

97
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,166
sadly.

98
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,708
But then, in the
"beta world lines,"

99
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,666
Makise Kurisu loses her life,
and you continue living.

100
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,041
So, that means the world
we're in here and now

101
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,583
is one of the beta world
lines, if that makes sense.

102
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,416
But could there be more?

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,458
Are those two world lines
the only ones that you know of?

104
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,375
I'm... not sure.

105
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,541
But I'd like to believe
there are more.

106
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,375
The Steins Gate
world line exists.

107
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,291
I'm fairly certain of that much.

108
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,250
But what is Steins Gate?

109
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,833
A world where both you
and Kurisu get to live,

110
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,208
and World War Three,

111
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,541
which supposedly begins
because of the time machine,

112
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,250
never even happens.

113
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,541
[SUZUHA] Dad told me
about it in the future.

114
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,708
It's the unknown world line
that we're trying to reach.

115
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,416
Uncle Okarin chose to live the
same awful summer over and over,

116
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,958
because he thought
he could find Steins Gate.

117
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,666
He truly believed that he could
save both you and Kurisu.

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,833
But no such luck.

119
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,000
So, all of Okarin's
suffering began

120
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,666
because I stopped him that day.

121
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,708
It is not your fault, Mayushii.

122
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,208
And to be honest, he was
already an absolute wreck

123
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,041
long before that.

124
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,541
He has the ability to remember
all the world lines

125
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,958
he experiences.

126
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,916
We call it Reading Steiner.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,791
As a result of this,
he retains memories

128
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,083
about all kinds of people
across many world lines.

129
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,875
The feelings those people
tried to hide,

130
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,166
the things they never achieved
but wanted to,

131
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,291
and his fear of suddenly
losing those he loves.

132
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,291
Carrying all that around
is more than enough

133
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,708
to do significant damage
to a person's psyche.

134
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,166
Which is why I'm grateful
that you stopped him.

135
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,250
It might have been
a whole lot worse.

136
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,583
Yeah, but if I hadn't stopped
him, he would have gone back.

137
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,500
And he might be--

138
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,500
Okarin.

139
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,541
[SUZUHA] You look just like
your future self did--

140
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,666
or, will, I guess.

141
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,666
You'll stare up at the sky
with that same face and say,

142
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,875
"That day, if my Hikoboshi
had burned bright

143
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,000
just once more, it might have
changed everything for us."

144
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,666
[DARU]
Sorry to keep ya waitin'!

145
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,000
You sure took your time.

146
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,708
Where did you go, America?

147
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,125
Well, I splurged a little bit.

148
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,541
Ginza, baby!

149
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,083
What's the occasion?

150
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,875
Is it someone's birthday?

151
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,208
[DARU]
It's a farewell gift.

152
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,666
Farewell?

153
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,083
[DARU]
Check it.

154
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,333
I got the shortcakes that
you love so much, Suzuha.

155
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,250
And I got you two
because you're so sweet.

156
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,500
Jeez! You make me sound
like I'm five years old!

157
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,333
But what did you mean
by farewell?

158
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,375
Oh.

159
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,166
I made the decision to leave.

160
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,583
If I keep messin' around,

161
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,250
I'm gonna miss my window

get the time leap machine ready.

This whole past year...

There's something I've
constantly been asking myself.

Twenty-five years from now,
why do I do it?

Why do I decide to send Suzuha
back in time to this era?

my mind to let her go now.
