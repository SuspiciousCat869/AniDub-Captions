when you just collapsed
for no reason like that.

There was an explosion
at the Wako City office.

They're not letting us in.

[OKABE]
What strange timing.

46
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:34,041
Makes me think someone
was orchestrating all of this.

47
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,791
Any clue who did it?

Not at all.

[OKABE] The attackers
from before, perhaps.

[KAEDE gasps]
Oh, wow, you're awake!

51
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,416
[MAYURI]
Has your fever come down?

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,750
[FUBUKI]
Mm-hmm. It's all gone now.

53
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,875
So, you're feeling better,
too, then, Okarin?

54
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,333
[OKABE]
Uh, yeah.

55
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,833
The doctors have been saying
that I might have

56
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,708
that new form of encephalitis
that's been going around.

57
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,708
But it's probably nothing
to worry too much about.

58
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,375
New encephalitis?

59
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,458
Yeah, it's something
that just popped up.

60
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,458
It gives people
a pretty high fever.

61
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,541
But still, why would you two
lose consciousness

62
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,416
at the exact same time?

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,458
Without some sort
of external stimulus,

64
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,375
the likelihood of that
is almost zero.

Kaede's writing
a romance novel.

She thinks this means
Okabe and I must be soulmates.

00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,791
Huh?

71
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,541
It's true, Fubuki!

72
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,708
When you first woke up,

73
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,791
all you wanted
to talk about was Okarin.

74
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,750
I told you that was just because
of the weird dream I had!

75
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,208
What dream?

76
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,916
It was so vivid and realistic.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,416
But, Mayushii had been...

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,416
Huh?

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,541
Don't worry!

80
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,083
It was just a nightmare.
Not real at all.

81
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,125
But in it,
Mayushii was gone,

82
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,125
and I was working in the
May Queen café with Faris.

83
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:53,250
And then, Okarin came in,
and I had never met him.

84
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,958
[OKABE] She has memories
from the alpha world line.

00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,875
Fubuki has to stay
in the hospital

94
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,750
a little longer, though.

she's gonna be all right!

You think?

98
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,666
Hey, Okabe?

Huh?

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,416
Why'd you bring up
Kurisu back there?

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,708
Oh, um, it's just that--

102
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,250
I had a strange dream
about her.

103
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,041
You did?

104
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,166
Hey, where did Hashida go?

105
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,875
Oh, Daru had to leave.

106
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,708
He told me he needed to take
care of something important.

107
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,500
[KAEDE]
Hmm?

108
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,250
[SUZUHA]
So, what else?

109
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,416
Meh.

110
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,125
Okarin wasn't showing
symptoms anymore,

111
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,000
so the doctors
let him go home today.

112
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,666
Fubuki and Okabe were
both present for the attack.

113
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,875
They collapsed
at the same time?

114
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,083
What was he like
when he regained consciousness?

115
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,375
Like the same brooding mess
he's been for a while now.

116
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,833
But he did say a name.

117
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,500
He mentioned Makise.

118
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,166
Makise?

Here you go.

[MAHO]
Oh, thank you.

124
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,000
Now that I think about it,

125
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,458
what with the break-in
at my hotel

126
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,625
and the explosion
at the office,

127
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,041
I don't think I've eaten
anything since last night.

128
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,791
All we have here
is chicken tenders

129
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,291
and some bananas.

130
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,583
Oh, you want me
to go buy you a bento?

131
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,916
That's all right.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,916
I'll eat something
later at the hotel.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,541
You're going back?

[giggles]

135
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,958
The professor asked me
the same thing.

136
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,416
He said I should probably
move to a different one now.

137
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,791
He's right.
You'd be safer that way.

138
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,583
But I don't have any idea
where to stay.

139
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,333
With us?

140
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,125
[MAHO] I wouldn't
want to impose like that.

141
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,000
It's also worth considering
the attack happened here.

--It's no safer.

[OKABE] I'm back
in the right world line now.

164
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,125
[OKABE]
And I swear,

165
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,875
I will save it.

166
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,958
I vow to protect this world
where Mayuri gets to live,

167
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,208
and I will not resort
to time travel.

168
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,208
[OKABE] 'Cause I know this
is what Kurisu would want.

169
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,291
[OKABE]
It's the only choice.

170
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,500
[OKABE]
Hiyajo.

171
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,666
Huh?

172
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,875
Do you think you could
possibly hold off

173
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,083
on finding another hotel?

174
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,583
I'm nursing an idea.

175
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,708
[FARIS] Meow, so that's why
you came to visit me?

176
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,958
[OKABE]
Yeah.

177
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,541
We think your flat
might be the safest place

178
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,583
for Maho to stay
for the time being.

179
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,291
This isn't fair!

180
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,166
I'm so sorry
to put you on the spot.

181
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,791
That's nice of you,
but it doesn't bother me, meow!

182
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,416
--Uh...
--I knew it!

183
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,166
Didn't I tell you?

184
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,791
I had no doubt Faris would be
willing to let you stay!

185
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,833
[FARIS] You can make yourself
at home in the guest room!

186
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,333
Stay forever!

187
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,416
I want you to live with me
for as long as you're in Japan.

188
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,750
Okay, Maho-meow?

189
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,250
--[giggles]
--[MAHO] "Maho-meow"?

190
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
[FARIS] We've got Kuroki here
to protect us, he's great!

191
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,208
--So we're super safe, meow!
--[MAHO] Kuroki...?

192
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,875
[FARIS] Wanna take a bath?
Or watch TV?

193
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,000
[MAHO]
Hold on, wait!

194
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,791
Now we can all rest easy!

195
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,083
Well, that depends.

196
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,291
Kagari is still
with Rukako, right?

197
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,333
Mmm. I just heard from them
a little while ago.

198
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,916
Ruka is committed to
making sure Kagari stays inside

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,458
and said not to worry.

200
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,458
[OKABE] I suppose
I've done all I can for now.

201
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,791
Next, I've got to figure out
who raided the lab,

202
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,291
and what they're really after.

203
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,166
--[phone buzzes]
--Huh?

204
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,458
Suzuha?

205
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,416
Suzuha?

206
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,666
[SUZUHA]
I'm over here.

207
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,791
[SUZUHA] Sorry to make you
come all the way to the roof,

208
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,541
but it was necessary.

209
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,500
So, what's this about?

210
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,291
[SUZUHA]
Look, I'm terrible at this.

211
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,291
Verbal communication's
not my strong suit.

212
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,708
Forgive me if
I skip the niceties

213
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,250
and get straight to the point.

214
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,541
No complaints here.

215
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,083
Did you experience
a recent world line change?

216
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,291
[OKABE]
What would make you ask me that?

217
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,041
[SUZUHA]
The nature of the situation.

218
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,500
In addition to what
you've told me before

219
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,166
about Reading Steiner
and whatnot.

220
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,875
[OKABE]
What happens if I say yes?

221
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,916
[gasps]

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,541
You may not
understand this,

223
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,250
but it means
a great deal to me.

224
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,000
Suzuha...

225
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,208
Now, then.

226
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,333
I order you to tell me,
Okabe Rintaro!

227
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,875
I'll ask you one more time.

228
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,750
Have you experienced
a world line change?

229
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,166
Is this a different world line
than the one we were in before?

230
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,083
[OKABE]
Don't worry. Everything's okay--

231
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,458
we're still in
the same world line.

232
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,666
[SUZUHA]
Is that the truth?

233
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,250
[OKABE]
Yes.

234
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,541
We shifted to a different one
for a bit, but now we're back.

235
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,500
At least, as far as I can tell.

236
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,833
So you're admitting
that something did shift.

237
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,833
[OKABE] Yes, but I have
no idea what caused it.

238
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,250
The earthquakes in Russia.

239
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,750
Huh?

240
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,791
[SUZUHA] Those have nothing
to do with nuclear testing.

241
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,333
They're the result
of America and Russia

242
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,375
racing to invent time machines.

243
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,000
Sooner or later,
that competition is going

244
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,250
to spark the beginning
of World War III.

245
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,500
Maybe sooner than we think.

246
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,625
[OKABE]
Russia... and America?

247
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,708
The way he said it
was so distinct.

248
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,625
It's phonetic code.

249
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,416
What is phonetic code?

250
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,125
Used in the military.

251
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,958
Mostly in the western world.

252
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,875
[OKABE]
Is that what happened?

253
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,291
The earthquake?

254
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,000
I am such an idiot.

255
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,958
I was so concerned
about what to do,

256
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,083
but I never had
the time for all that!

257
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,333
[OKABE] Well,
what are you gonna do?

258
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,541
[SUZUHA]
I'm going back to July 28th,

259
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,125
and you're coming with me!

260
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,666
And if I won't?

261
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,041
[SUZUHA]
I won't give you that choice.

262
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,875
They're experimenting
with time machines as we speak!

263
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,875
What if the world line
keeps changing because of that,

264
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,291
and the path to reach
Steins Gate

265
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,500
gets blocked off forever?

266
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,750
[OKABE]
What if it's already too late?

267
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,750
[SUZUHA gasps]

268
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,083
Could you decide?

269
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,041
Could you make the choice
between two world lines

270
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,125
and know you'd done no harm?

271
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you willing
to kill this world line?

272
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,583
To just let it dissolve
into the ether?

273
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,916
Shut up, now!

274
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,583
[OKABE gasps]

275
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,791
[OKABE gasping]

276
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,416
You shot me...

277
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,000
I won't miss again.

278
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,916
[OKABE gasps]

279
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,125
[SUZUHA]
I am begging you.

280
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,583
[OKABE sighs]

281
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,458
July of 2010.

282
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,875
I realized that just by
using the Phone Wave,

283
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,041
I was able to send
messages into the past.

284
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,125
But in the end, the only thing
those d-mails achieved

285
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,750
was changing the world line,
and to restore the original one,

286
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,000
I convinced my friends
to destroy the only world

287
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,083
where they ever
felt safe and happy.

288
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,333
I ripped apart something
we'd crafted,

289
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,708
and I sacrificed more
than you could ever imagine,

290
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,208
just to bring this world
back to its rightful state.

291
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,083
And now, if I go back
to that summer,

292
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,375
the entire hellish nightmare
just replays itself!

293
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,583
[SUZUHA]
So you're content

294
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,333
to just let this world line
be what it is?

295
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,916
World War III is going
to burn the planet,

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,958
and billions of people will die!

297
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,208
There's no escaping it.

298
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,666
That's the way this world line
inevitably ends!

299
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,833
[OKABE] And what happens
if going back

300
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,541
only makes the situation worse?

301
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,958
No, that's not--

302
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,083
[OKABE] What if we're able
to change the world line,

303
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,416
but all that awaits us
is a future

304
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,125
even more
desolate and terrifying

305
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,750
than the one you came from?

306
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,375
[SUZUHA whimpers]

307
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,791
Even if we can change
the events of the past,

308
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,500
we can't manipulate the future
to be what we want.

00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,708
Gotta say,
I kinda figured

313
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,125
something like this
might go down.

What are you doing
with that gun?

315

[growls] You shouldn't have
to ask that, Dad.

316

We don't have
any time to waste!

We are on the precipice
of an all-out world war!

Okarin to come with you,

one problem kept
coming back to me over and over.

Trying to control
the outcome of world lines

the law of causality

Then, what can we do?

all this in-depth research, kid?

Can we alter the future

I don't have nearly
enough information.

I seriously doubt it was one
whose name is public.

It's either some fringe group

that makes sure their name's
kept under tight wraps,

or an entity that's perceived
as so innocent

no one would ever
suspect them of foul play.

she's from the future?

[MAKISE] Even if
that is what they're after,

not write one for Daddy, too?

Anyway, this is
no time for pouting.

464
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,625
Because Russia's already
started experimenting

with time machines?

466
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,375
Well, that is a factor,

467
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,416
but it's more about the fuel.

468
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,041
I wasn't conservative.

469
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,208
I used far too much
in my search for Kagari.

Isn't there any way
to switch out the battery?

Negative.

472

I had Faris bring me
one of those huge batteries

00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,875
Half a year,
maybe once or twice,

but no more than that.

480

And that's if we're lucky.

What would happen if
the battery died during travel?

Who knows.

But, if I had to take
a wild guess,

484
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,291
I'd say we'd lose control
and get trapped

485

beyond the event horizon
for all of eternity.

Although...

what that would be like.

What's the matter?

Um, what happened in here?

498

It's a disaster zone.

Uh, well...

You mean to tell me Kurisu
was researching time travel?

Yeah, I think
this all stems from that.

They want any trace

My guess is her theories
are in Amadeus,
