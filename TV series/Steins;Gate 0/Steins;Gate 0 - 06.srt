1
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,375
[RUKA] All right,
we're off to the store.

2
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,625
Be back soon.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,916
[MAYURI] If you think of
anything else we need,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,208
just text me, okay?

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,083
Roger that.

6
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,291
[door closes]

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,458
[RUKA]
You don't have to come. Really.

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,333
[RUKA gasps]

9
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,625
Even if I didn't go,

10
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,500
it's not like I'd be
any help here. [chuckles]

11
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,750
Are we taking the long route?

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,791
[SUZUHA]
You lost all your memories?!

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,875
Yes.

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,166
So you can't remember
a single thing

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,791
that happened since we--

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,041
No way!

17
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,375
Look, Suzuha,
what makes you so certain

18
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,416
this is Kagari Shiina
in the first place?

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,958
I already told you that!

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,333
Because of the oopa!

21
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,541
It's the exact same one
I saw her mom give her.

22
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,916
It was Kagari's good luck charm.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,833
She took it with her everywhere!

24
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,083
Where did you get yours, Kana?

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,583
I have no idea.

26
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,125
When they first found me,
it was the only thing I had.

27
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,583
I was clutching it,
even though I was unconscious.

28
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,125
You were unconscious?

29
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,041
[KAGARI]
Yes.

30
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,166
I guess I had collapsed

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,416
near the border of
the Chiba Prefecture

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,458
and a priest nearly tripped
over me lying in the path.

33
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,833
So, then, how'd you
end up at the shrine?

34
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,375
[KAGARI]
They felt it was inappropriate

35
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:29,000
for a girl to stay too long
at a practicing temple, so...

36
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,416
[SUZUHA]
She was at Ruka's!

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,083
Right under my nose
this whole time!

38
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,083
Tell me!

39
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,125
Is my name really
Kagari Shiina?

40
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,583
Do you know that for sure?

41
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:41,208
Can you two tell me
anything else about who I am?

42
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,541
--I need to--
--Wait. One thing at a time.

43
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,333
[KAGARI gasps]
Yes, I'm sorry.

44
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,625
Don't be.

45
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,500
When you hear the name
"Kagari Shiina,"

46
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,583
does it, perhaps,
bring back other memories?

47
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,375
No, not that I'm aware of.

48
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:58,708
And yet, it does give me an
intense, nostalgic feeling.

49
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,458
That girl who just
left with Ruka...

50
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,250
Do you mean Mayuri?

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,250
Oh, Mayuri?

52
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,208
Is that her name, then?

53
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,041
[KAGARI chuckles]

54
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,041
[KAGARI]
And mine is...

55
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,500
...Kagari Shiina.

56
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,208
[OKABE]
Kagari Shiina.

57
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,208
In 2036, she's...

58
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,958
...Mayuri's daughter.

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,541
[RUKA] So, just to
make sure I understand,

60
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,958
you're saying that Kana--

61
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,875
I mean, Kagari,
is somebody you know, Suzuha?

62
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:01,791
[SUZUHA]
Uh, yeah!

63
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,041
That's it, more or less.

64
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,125
[RUKA] Awesome! Do you
know where she lives?

65
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,875
Can you get in touch
with some of her family

66
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,250
and tell them she's okay?

67
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,416
Uh, I don't--I, uh...

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,041
Uh, well, Kagari moved to
a different neighborhood

69
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,583
when they were
still really young,

70
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,500
and Suzuha lost contact
with her at that point.

71
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,958
Oh, too bad.

72
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,416
Hey, at least we were able
to find out your real name.

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,291
That's something!

74
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,125
[sighs]

75
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,666
[MAYURI]
Hang on!

76
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,625
Kagari's real, full name is
Kagari Shiina, isn't that right?

77
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,333
Yeah, it is.

78
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,708
That means you and I
are alike in a way!

79
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,791
Because, you see,
my full name's Mayuri Shiina.

80
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,916
Mayuri Shiina?

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,458
Oh.

82
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,041
Ruka told me something about
you, but I couldn't believe it!

83
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,625
You have amnesia?

84
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,541
For real?

85
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,416
I do.

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,750
[MAYURI]
So that means...

87
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,916
...you don't remember
anything about who you are

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,958
or where you come from?

89
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,166
That's right.

90
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,958
[MAYURI]
Oh, wow.

91
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,041
Sorry.

92
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,208
That has to be really
painful for you.

93
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,666
Because it means
you can't remember

94
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,750
all the people you love
the most in the world.

95
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,916
Seriously.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,583
Amnesia must be
the saddest thing

97
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,708
that could ever
happen to anyone.

98
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,416
It's heartbreaking!

99
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,375
So, um, if you ever
need help with something,

100
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,000
just tell me! I'd be happy
to do whatever I can!

101
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,250
I'm here, okay?

102
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,708
[KAGARI gasps]

103
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,875
Oh, hey! What's the matter?

104
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,000
Why are you crying?

105
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,791
Did I say something
I shouldn't have?

106
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,166
No, not at all.

107
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,208
I'm crying because I'm happy.

108
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,541
You really touched me just now.

109
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,541
I'm not the only one
who's here for you.

110
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,958
[KAGARI gasps]

111
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,208
[OKABE]
Mm.

112
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,250
Yeah. If you need me,
just ask, and I'm there!

113
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,625
Don't hesitate.

114
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,625
Thank you all. That means a lot.

115
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,166
[OKABE] It appears that we
found Kagari Shiina ourselves.

116
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,666
Where was she?

117
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,958
[OKABE] At a local shrine
where one of my friends lives.

118
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,875
But she was found unconscious
on the outskirts of Chiba.

119
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,291
Why there?

120
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,375
I have no clue.

121
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,791
She's suffering from
severe amnesia.

122
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,916
[MOEKA]
I see.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,125
Any update on the
other search party?

124
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:06,958
Who they are?

125
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,791
[MOEKA]
No. Nothing yet.

126
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,583
[OKABE sighs]
No worries.

127
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,000
And I'm sorry, it's a busy
time of year as it is.

128
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,458
[MOEKA]
It's fine, work is work.

129
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,625
So what now?

130
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,708
Should I keep at it?

131
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,000
[OKABE]
If you don't mind.

132
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,833
It would be a great
help if you did.

133
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,041
[MOEKA]
Then I will.

134
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,500
That's that.

135
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,041
They found her.

136
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,125
[phone chimes]

137
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,291
[MAHO]
Hmm?

00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,916

[REYES giggles]

142
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,625
Professor! Not cool, come on!

143
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,833
Oh, wait. Were you messaging
with your boyfriend?

144
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,875
[MAHO]
He is not my boyfriend!

145
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,666
Why do you and Leskinen
keep harassing me about that?

146
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,666
The concept of love is
utterly useless, anyway!

147
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,541
Oh.

148
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,291
You couldn't be
more mistaken, Maho.

149
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,000
[MAHO gasps]

150
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,250
As a matter of fact,

151
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,125
I'm more passionate
about your love life

152
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,250
than any other field of study.

153
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,125
That'd be flattering
if it weren't weird,

154
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,541
but I'd rather you not
treat me like a test subject.

155
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,666
Anyway, I'm not the type
to be swept off my feet

156
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,000
by the inherently
delusional nature of love.

157
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,958
Really? What a shame.

158
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,541
Also, Professor?

159
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,458
[REYES]
Mm?

160
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,083
[KAGARI] So, um,
I'm sorry for all of this.

161
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,000
[MAYURI]
There's no need to apologize!

162
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm here to help
with anything!

163
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,833
I meant what I said before!

164
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,791
Thank you.

165
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,666
I really do appreciate it.

166
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,166
Hey, Rukako,
do you have a second?

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,958
[RUKA]
You want me to try

168
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,166
to keep Kagari
from going outside?

169
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,291
That seems so...

170
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,583
[OKABE]
If she has to,

171
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,333
make sure someone
accompanies her.

172
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,833
And I can't say why.

173
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,083
Not right now anyway.

174
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,541
[RUKA]
I trust you.

175
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,208
It is weird, though.

176
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,416
[OKABE]
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,875
[OKABE]
We still don't know who else

178
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,833
has been searching for Kagari,

179
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,333
and until we do,

180
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,083
it's prudent for us to
take every precaution

181
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,666
we possibly can.

182
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,250
[DARU]
In any case,

183
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,750
it's pretty amazing that we were
able to find Kagari, right?

184
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,916
So now you can relax, for once.

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,375
Yeah, I guess.

186
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,291
Okay, not exactly the relieved
response I was hoping for.

187
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,708
[SUZUHA]
That girl.

188
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,458
Where do you think
she's been all this time?

189
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,333
[DARU]
That is a good question.

190
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,041
[DARU] I've been wondering
about that part, too, actually.

191
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,791
But it's not like we can
force her to remember

192
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,875
and tell us everything,
you know?

193
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,916
Don't they say those memories
come back on their own,

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,125
out of nowhere?

195
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,666
All we can do now is be patient.

196
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,916
[SUZUHA]
Maybe.

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,250
But do we have that luxury?

198
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,666
[DARU]
Ooh, how 'bout this?

199
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,708
We could scare the crap
out of her to jog her memory.

200
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:57,875
Scaring chicks is
my strong suit!

201
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,541
Why--hey--

202
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,041
Wha--?

203
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,791
Why didn't it work?

204
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,000
It always works! [gasping]

205
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,250
[gasps]

206
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,000
[KAGARI] I won't let you
do something like that.

207
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,375
[KAGARI]
I hear... a voice.

208
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,916
[SUZUHA]
Kagari!

209
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,125
[gunshot]

210
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,541
Are you okay?

211

[DARU]
Hey, Okarin?

212
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,166
Aren't we supposed to be
going to the shrine right now

213
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,250
to celebrate the
New Year and stuff?

214
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,375
Uh, yeah, we are.

215
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,875
So, um, like, why are we stuck
in this awkward situation, then?

216
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,416
--[DARU whimpering]
--[BRAUN] Hey!

217
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,833
If you've got something to say,

218
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,166
then you'd better
speak up, nice and loud.

219
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,208
[DARU] No, we have
nothing at all to say, sir.

220
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,041
Oh?

221
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,125
Well, we were just hoping

222
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,125
we could get into
the lab, actually.

223
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,250
No way!

224
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,500
[DARU]
But why not?

225
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,125
Oh, such villainy!

226
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,958
Mr. Braun, we promised we
would meet the others here

227
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,916
to go to the shrine
for New Year's.

Uh, Dad, you're hurting
me a little bit.

It's a good thing
she takes after mo--

237
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,791
Ahem.

238
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,583
I can't wait to go to
the shrine with everybody

239
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,250
and see Mayuri all dressed up
as a beautiful shrine maiden!

240
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,750
[BRAUN]
Yeah?

241
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,041
Well, listen to the girls
and behave yourself, got that?

242

Mm-hmm.

Oh, you're not coming with us?

[BRAUN] Nah, I got some
business to take care of.

245
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,041
If it weren't for that,
do you think I'm really be

246
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,083
leaving my precious daughter
with the likes of you?

247

Come on!

248
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,375
And let me be clear.

If anything happens to her,
you two will pay.

I'll see you later, Dad!

going, don't ya think?

But before we do anything else,

aren't we forgetting
something really important?

I can't wait to see Mayushii's

259
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,416
shrine maiden costume!

260
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,666
[KAEDE] No, silly. This is
a uniform, not a costume!

261
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,666
[FUBUKI]
Oh, that's right!

262
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,125
[YUKI] Isn't Suzuha
working with Mayuri today?

263

I bet they're having fun.

264
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,125
Look, a shrine maiden
for a sister is one thing,

265
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,041
but you might as well
dress her as a nurse, too,

266
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,125
and raise her moe so
much she gains a level.

Plus one die roll, baby.

perverted than I am,

Hey, um, thanks for coming.

I know Mayuri's the
one who invited you,

272
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,000
but then she got
herself talked into

273

I want to discuss with you.

Oh, by the way,

277

didn't you say you're a student

278

You don't have to say that.

I refuse to believe this.

330

It's not true. I reject it.

331

It is the truth, sweetheart.

But if you need some proof,
we could show you.

They're done working,
so they ditched the garb.

They just finished cleaning
and we were about to head out.

Hi, everyone.

485
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,083
I assume you're the other
members of Okabe's laboratory.

486
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,583
Please allow me to
introduce myself.

487
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,583
I am called Amadeus.

488
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,708
I am a program of
artificial intelligence

489
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,458
constructed from the
memories of Makise Kurisu.

00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,875
Makise Kurisu, huh?

491
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,250
[AMADEUS]
Ah, of course.

492
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,458
You must have been acquaintances
of the original me.

493
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,416
Uh, well, I wasn't, actually.

494
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,166
I only knew about you from
your articles in <i>Sciency</i> .

495
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,791
[AMADEUS]
Huh! I'm impressed.

496
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,208
If you were reading
that magazine,

497
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,791
then you must have
some level of interest

498
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,083
in advanced sciences.

499
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,000
Uh, well, I work with
systems and networks,

500
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,625

between science and math.

--[NAE] Hey, miss AI lady?

502

Are you, like, a computer game?

503
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,125
Can I play online?

504
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,083
[AMADEUS chuckles]
No, I'm not a game.

505
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,625
I'm real. I'm right here...

506

[MAHO]
I'm sorry.

507
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,125
It seems cruel to say
you should let her go,

508
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,208
then put her right in your face.

509
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,166
I didn't intend to.

510
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,166
No.

511
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,291
It's probably better this way.

It's painful,

but I must keep moving
forward regardless.

515
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,583
As for Kagari,

516
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,583
she might resemble
Kurisu in some ways,

517
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,958
but she isn't her at all.

518
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,625
Same with Amadeus.

519
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,416
It was created from parts of
Kurisu, that's indisputable,

520
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,625
but it's a separate entity.

521
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,208
I can't let my grief
drag me down.

522
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,208
That's what you've wanted to say
this whole time, isn't it, Maho?

523
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,250
[OKABE]
That's right.

524

Kurisu protected this world,

along with Mayuri and
everyone else in it.

526
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,250
For her sake, I have to
keep protecting it...

527
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,458
...without ever looking back.

528
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,375
I don't think
Suzuha understands.

529
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,750
She still thinks
this world isn't right.

530
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,625
But now that Kagari is here,

even if she doesn't
remember anything...
