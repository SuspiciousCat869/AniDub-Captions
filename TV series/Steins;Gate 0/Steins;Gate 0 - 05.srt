I'm always really careful
not to leave any traces,

44

but somehow, Moeka still managed
to track me down. She's wily.

45
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,000
So, then, that explains
your interest in her.

00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,250
I'd like to help.

Kinda. We're actually on
the hunt for a little girl

49
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,958
who went missing in
Akihabara 12 years ago.

50
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,708

In 1998.

Yep.

52
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,750
The girl's name
is Kagari Shiina.

53
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,916
She was 10 years old
back when she disappeared,

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
which would mean
that she's 22 today.

Obviously.

She's alive?

Well, we don't know
that for sure.

But we found a picture
on the interwebs

[OKABE] Should we be
trusting this woman?

61
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,791
She could have ulterior motives.

62
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,791
But there's no reason for her

63

to seek us out in
this world line,

to kill Mayuri.

Even so, it's more
likely than not

she's a Rounder
in this line, too.

[OKABE] Finding her might
be even more difficult

163
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,833
than we thought.

164
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,500
That's not good.

165
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,125
[gasps]

166
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,916
What's up? Did you find a clue?

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,333
Not quite. Just something
that might be of interest.

168
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,333
Let me see.

169
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,083
Uh--hey!

170
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,166
"While investigating,

171
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,875
I made a strange discovery
pertaining to the case.

172
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,541
Over the course
of several months,

173
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,875
another party has been
searching for Kagari Shiina

174
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:15,958
in addition to our own,

175
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,083
or so the evidence
would suggest."

176
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,666
What does that mean?

177
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,208
Just what it states.

178
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,250
[DARU]
Who else is looking for her?

179
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,125
That I don't know.

180
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,208
Suzuha's been searching.
Maybe it's her.

181
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,625
[SUZUHA]
That was my first thought, too.

182
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,666
But look, check this out.

183
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,375
The search party
was composed of men,

184
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,625
and there was a
foreigner among them.

185
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,125
[SUZUHA]
A foreigner?

186
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,166
Well, Kagari's been
gone for 12 years.

187
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,541
Perhaps she made friends
who are searching now, too.

188
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,416
[DARU] Yeah, a 10-year-old
wouldn't have survived long

189
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,083
without an adult taking
care of her in some way.

190
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,458
I mean, hypothetically.

191
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,291
This new evidence does
support one theory, though.

192
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,791
Which is?

193
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,000
[OKABE]
It raises the likelihood

194
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,708
that Kagari Shiina
is currently alive.

195
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,583
But who is this foreigner?

196
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,833
I'm pretty sure
the lab was this way.

197
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,250
[MAHO]
Hey. I'm in Akihabara,

198
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,666
so I thought that I would
swing by the lab. Period.

199
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,708
That is, if you happen
to be there. Period.

She's here in Japan
for an AI conference.

She snuck up on
me in an alley.

Oh, Professor Leskinen.

260
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,458
[MAHO] Ms. Reyes' specialty
is psychophysiology.

261
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,375
Right. The mind-body link.

262
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,666
I study how cognitive
processes manifest physically.

263
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,916
In the organs,
pathology, et cetera.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,541
Yeah, it's kind of heroic.

265
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,750
That field is much more
important to humanity

266

than what Leskinen
and I are doing.

Your work is more useful.

[REYES] That's not true at all.

to be highly beneficial.

I sure hope you're right.

all the way from the station
into this dark alley?

274
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,166
From the station? Stalk you?

275
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,125
What do you mean?

276
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,250
Wait. Weren't you following me?

277
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,916
I was just walking by and
saw you standing here.

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,208
I thought I'd jump out
and surprise you.

279
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,458
But then...

Did I... imagine it?

Anyway, you and your
boyfriend come visit me soon.

282
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,875

I saw you? Well?

296
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,916
[MAHO] Are you dumb enough
to think that's possible?

[DARU] She's a feisty one,
just how I like 'em!

299
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,458
Does Hiyajo's presence indicate
that she's going to be

300
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,291
inducted into the lab as our
token Legal Loli member?

301
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,583
Very doubtful.

302
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,875
Well, nonetheless!

303
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,208
You get a nickname!

304
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,125
You're Mini Maho!

305
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,500
No, thank you.

00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,708
Really.

307
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,333
[OKABE]
Amadeus did?

308
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,458
[MAHO]
That's right.

309
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,041
She said you won't
answer her calls,

310
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,333
like you're blowing
her off or something.

311
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,791
[MAHO] And judging by
the look on your face,

312
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,125
I'd say she was
right on the money.

313
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,500
[OKABE]
Well...

314
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,458
Uh--

315
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,875
[MAHO] Let me talk to
the professor about this.

316
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,125
[MAHO] It was only
supposed to be a test.

317
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,333
You're not obligated to help.

318
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,958
We're not even paying you.

319
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,208
I can't.

320
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,708
I had no idea.

321
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,208
I guess Kurisu had a more
impactful presence in your life

322
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,416
than I assumed.

323
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
Look, we've been
over this already.

324
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:37,958
Kurisu wasn't--

325
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,750
[MAHO]
Don't insult me!

326
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,375
She had a huge effect on you.

327
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,083
And this isn't healthy.

328
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,916
You're projecting your
feelings onto Amadeus.

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,166
When you see her and you hear
her voice, you come alive.

330
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,083
I can sense your feelings
growing for her,

331
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,375
and it makes me afraid for you.

332
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,291
Because Amadeus is nothing more
than a system of algorithms.

333
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,833
Just memory and data.

334
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,000
It's not really her at all.

335
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,333
[OKABE]
I know that.

336
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,625
I do, I--

337
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,958
[OKABE]
And yet...

338
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,250
It's made of Kurisu's
memories, without a doubt!

339
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,250
Okabe...

340
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,625
[OKABE]
I know it's not her.

341
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,125
The real Kurisu is gone.

342
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,208
And what's in here is only
a model, but, still...

343
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,125
[OKABE]
I just can't.

344
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,416
[OKABE]
Give me a little more time.

345
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,458
[MAYURI] Do you have
any plans for New Year's?

346
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,083
[OKABE]
Another party in the forecast?

347
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,541
[MAYURI] Mm-hmm! First,
we'll go visit the shrine,

348
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,125
then we'll have
a big New Year's meal

349
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,333
and share our hopes and
dreams for the year ahead!

350
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,166
I'm in. That sounds delightful.

351
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,708
Won't it be perfect?

352
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,083
I'll ask the others later
and see what they say.

353
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,083
Okay! I've gotta go out
and do a little shopping.

354
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,666
For ComiMa?

355
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,291
[MAYURI] Uh-huh! I need to
find a couple more accessories

356
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,000
for Fubuki's costume,
or it won't look right.

357
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,833
There's not much time
left to finish, huh?

358
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:03,916
[MAYURI]
Mm.

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And when that's done,

360
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,750
the whole year is
pretty much over.

361
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,333
It passed in the
blink of an eye, huh?

362
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,291
[OKABE gasps]

363
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,208
[OKABE]
"In the blink of an eye."

364
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,875
[OKABE]
The fateful summer.

365
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,166
All those days and hours I lived
and relived, how many times?

366
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,458
And yet...

367
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,166
...the year still
comes to an end.

368
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,166
[MAYURI gasps, giggles]

369
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,458
[MAYURI giggling]

370
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,875
[MAYURI]
It's snowing!

371
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,416
You think it'll stick? [giggles]

372
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,333
[OKABE]
Time marches on...

373
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,875
...in this world line
that I chose.

374
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,125
[MAYURI]
Whoa! It's so magical!

375
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,375
Okarin! I'm gonna get going!

376
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,166
[OKABE]
Uh, bye.

377
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,625
[MAYURI]
Oh, that's right.

378
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,583
Ruka was looking
for you earlier.

379
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,583
You should pick up the phone
and call if you get a chance.

380
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,875
I completely forgot
Ruka called me.

381
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll do that right now.

382
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,708
Okay! Say hi for me!

383
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:21,208
[ringing]

384
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,166
[OKABE]
Probably busy.

385
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,375
They've got their work
cut out for them,

386
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,750
readying the shrine
for New Year's crowds.

387
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,791
[knocking]

388
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,625
Huh?

389
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,416
[RUKA]
May I come in?

390
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,208
Rukako? Yes, it's open!

391
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,500
Oh, you're here! I'm glad!

392
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,916
Hi. I'm sorry,
is this about earlier?

393
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,708
I forgot all about it, but I
did just try to call you back.

394
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,250
[RUKA]
Huh? Wow! You did!

395
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,166
Well, sorry for not answering.

396
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,375
I didn't notice.

397
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,791
[OKABE chuckles]
No worries.

398
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,958
You said you needed
to speak with me?

399
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,708
[RUKA]
Uh, yeah.

400
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,791
But I'd prefer to show you.

401
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,333
Because, you see, there's
someone who I want you to meet.

402
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,416
I brought them along.

403
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,875
Is that all right?

404
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,625
[OKABE]
I must admit, I'm intrigued.

405
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,541
Uh...?

406
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,208
[OKABE]
Ku...

407
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,208
[OKABE]
Kurisu.

408
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,083
[OKABE]
Here you go.

409
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,083
Thank you.

410
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,416
[OKABE]
They're so alike.

411
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,833
Except her voice is different.

412
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,333
What synchronicity.

413
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,041
What would Jung say?

414
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,375
So, Rukako, who is this?

415
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,583
Rukako?

416
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,958
Uh, sorry.

417
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,125
It's just a pet name.

418
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,791
On account of
Ruka's femininity.

419
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,291
I told you on the phone that
my father had house guests,

420
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,833
and that they'd be
staying a while.

421
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,125
[gasps] And this is that guest?

422
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,125
[RUKA]
Yes, my father's acquaintance

423
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,666
brought her to the house, too.

424
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,875
What's your name?

425
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,083
[WOMAN gasps]

426
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,291
Actually, that brings me to
the main reason we came here.

427
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,375
[OKABE]
Hm?

428
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,875
Well, um...

429
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,958
Do you have any idea... how we
could find out who she is?

430
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,291
[OKABE]
What do you mean, exactly?

431
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,916
You see, she has severe amnesia.

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
[gasps]

433
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,625
[RUKA]
She doesn't remember anything.

434
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,416
Not her name,
or where she came from,

435
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,250
or even how she lost her memory.

436
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,166
It's all a blank to her.

437
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,291
You can't be serious.

438
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,833
[RUKA]
I immediately thought that

439
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,250
if anyone could help her
remember, it'd be you.

440

'Cause you know all
about those things--

Please, I need to remember!

Whoa, let's take
a step back here.

447
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,708
I spout off about this subject,
but I am no neuroscientist.

448
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:10,541
Besides, regaining memories
is never simple.

449
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,750
Storing them alone
is complicated.

450
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,458
Yes, of course.

451
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,791
Well, in that case,
can you think of some other way

452
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,250
for us to find out
who she might be?

453
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,416
Even if Kana can't remember?

454
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,666
[OKABE]
Kana? Where'd that come from?

455
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,958
Not having a name is annoying,
so we just call her Kana.

456
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,625
Father made it up.

457
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,708
[OKABE]
That's a nice one, I guess.

458
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,750
Not that it matters.

459
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,583
It's a placeholder
until I know more.

460

Can you help me?

[OKABE]
I can try.

463
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,625
Do you have any
clues to speak of?

464
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,458
Something like a wallet or a
cellphone, or even a bus pass?

465
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,625
No, I don't have anything.

00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,583
[OKABE]
Well you made it this far.

467
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,041
There must be some
hint from your life

that you're overlooking.

469

There is one thing
that could be a lead.

470
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,458
It's from her past.

471

Do you have it?

00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,666
Yes.

It's Kana's.

484
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,916
I think she's always had it.

485
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,666
She takes it
everywhere she goes.

486
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,875
Interesting!

487
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,708
I'm pretty sure it was
green at some point.

488
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,708
I think this is the special
forest fairy edition!

489
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,291
A forest fairy, huh?

490
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,458
[MAYURI]
Mm!

491
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,833
It showed up in a movie
not too long ago.

492
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,041
You see? It's kinda
like the one I have,

493
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,250
but the design is
a little different.

494
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,125
That one has fairy wings!

495
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,375
Hold on.

496
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,916
Why does this one
seem to be ancient?

497
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,166
If the film came out--[gasps]

498
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,916
I'm back now! [gasps]

499
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,750
Kana?

500
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:05,125
Hey! Are you all right? Kana!

501
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,541
Kagari?

502
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,541
[ALL gasp]

503
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,708
[SUZUHA]
That's her! Kagari!

504
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,750
That's who we've
been looking for!
