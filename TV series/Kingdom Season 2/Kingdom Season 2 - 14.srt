00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,208
[NARRATOR]
It was Qin's great assault

3
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,041
on the kingdom of Wei.

4
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,458
With their victory
in the very first battle,

5
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,208
the Qin army's offensive was off

6
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,208
to a really solid start.

7
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,375
However, no one was
able to realize

8
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,541
at the time, that further
on down the road,

9
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,958
they would be facing off against

10
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,416
an unthinkably huge opponent.

11
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,583
Those Qin mongrels have brutally

12
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,250
invaded our land.

13
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,666
Now, even Xuzhong
and Xuxi have fallen.

14
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,625
And yet...

15
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,666
...my heart remains
free from terror

16
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,500
because you are here,
standing on our side.

17

Formerly part of
Zhao's Three Greats,

General Lian Po!

19
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,916
In the three years
you have been exiled

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,250
to our land, never
before have I been

21
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,875
so grateful for your presence!

The war of She Gan Plain.

24

That monumental clash
between Lord Biao of Qin,

and Wu Qing of Wei.

26

Recorded in the Shiji annals,

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,708
this battle was
especially unusual,

31
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,125
even for the Spring
and Autumn periods,

32
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:29,125
for this time, the Zhao army
was now fighting against itself.

[screaming]

34
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,958
[NARRATOR] The Three Greats
were three skilled generals,

00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,833
the biggest pride of Zhao.

36
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,250
As heroic as Wang Yi

37
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,333
and the rest of Qin's
six great generals,

38
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,750
they were known throughout
the Middle Kingdom

39
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:03,500
for their tremendous military
prowess and battle records.

40

One of these Three Greats

41
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,291
was none other than
General Lian Po.

Wh-What's going on?

That's the Zhao army,
the same as us!

45
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,750
It's worse. Isn't Lian Po

46
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,125
a Great General
and Zhao hero, too?

47

How did it come to this?

48
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,333
General Lian Po is not stopping!

Darnit! If this keeps up,
Yue Cheng, sir.

[YUE CHENG]
Just stand firm!

We fought together
for 20 years.

I have Lian Po's fighting style
absolutely memorized by now.

what on earth are
you thinking right now?

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,041
[NARRATOR] This unusual
battle of ally versus ally

60
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,500
had its beginnings
earlier that year,

61
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,958
when King Daoxiang
took the throne.

62
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,291
Badly behaved since
his time as crown prince,

63
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,125
King Daoxiang was
often chided by Lian Po.

64
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,458
The twisted king bore
a deep-rooted grudge

65
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,958
against him for this, and as
soon as he took the throne,

66
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,833
he sent word to Lian Po

67
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,541
stripping him of his rank
as general mid-campaign.

68
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:35,166
Naturally, Lian Po refused
this irrational shakeup.

69
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,208
Furious, King Daoxiang
mustered an army of 50,000,

70
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,916
and ordered Yue Cheng to go
after the traitorous Lian Po.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,291
Yue Cheng was of Yue Yi's clan,

72
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:51,500
a genius on a level with the
great strategist Zhuge Kongming.

73
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,958
Yue Cheng was Zhao's
second general after Lian Po.

74
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,791
It was rumored that his
abilities actually outshone

75

when it came time to battle.

Absurd though it may be,
these are the King's orders.

Please hand your men over to me

79
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,000
and return to
Handan immediately.

If you don't comply,

83
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,750
I'll have no choice
but to take you myself

84
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,125
all the way to Handan
by sheer brute force.

85

And you think you can
do that, truthfully, now?

You have no means
of resisting them.

92

How amusing.

93

I will create the means.
Prepare yourself.

if you go through with this?

I struggle to comprehend

98
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,291
why he'd do
something so foolish.

99
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,625
Has he thought of
something I haven't?

100

But it's already too late.

swords, I, Yue Cheng,

00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,375
Which is all well
and good, but...

161
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,416
...in comparison to all
of those Qin idiots,

162
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,708
that only keeps me about 80--

163
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:06,000
no, merely 60%
satisfied, truthfully.

164
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,500
The battlefield's just not
the same without Qin blood,

165
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:13,791
in all honesty,
as you can see. [laughs]

166
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,166
[YUE CHENG sighs]

167
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,208
[YUE CHENG]
It seems he's always been

168
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,500
in a different league
than these men out here.

169
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,000
[NARRATOR] And so, Lian Po
brought his surviving officers

170
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,208
with him as he
exiled himself to Wei.

171
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,333
In the three years since,

172
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:37,708
Lian Po had not once even
tried to lead the Wei army.

173
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,708
[NARRATOR]
However,

174
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,250
now the Great General
had raised the Wei flag

175
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,208
and expressed his intention
to return to the battlefield.

176
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,666
The ferocious
General Lian Po who,

177
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,750
as one of Zhao's
Three Great Generals,

178
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,416
was definitely on a
par with Qin's Wang Yi

179
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,666
and his fellow
six great generals,

180
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,291
now had in his sights
the Qin army under Meng Ao

181
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,583
currently invading
the land of Wei.

182
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,750
[door creaks]

183
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,500
[JIE ZIFANG] We've been
waiting for you, my lord.

184
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,625
Hmmm?

185
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,250
Oh! You lot! I should've known.

186
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,250
Sniffed me out, huh?

187
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,125
[LUN HU]
Pretty rotten, not coming

188
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,375
to us Big Four for advice first!

189
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,166
[LIAN PO laughs]
You don't seem any less happy

190
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,791
for that omission.

191
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,666
Indeed, indeed!

192
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,083
Why, just seeing your
imposing figure in action

193
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:37,500
would make my heart leap
and I'd be walking on air.

194
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,625
Lian Po's Big Four.

195
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,666
How I've missed the
very sound of those words.

196
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,208
It's been three years, but,

197

Yes!

205
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,250
You haven't gone all
rusty on me, have you?

206
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,583
[BIG FOUR]
No, sir!

Heh. Lun Hu!

00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,750
[LUN HU]
Yes?

209
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,000
[LIAN PO]
You know the drill.

210
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,250
You go ahead and find a
promising enemy officer

211
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,291
and bring me his head.

212
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,083
Can you really
handle 3,000 men?

213
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,125
Oh, That should be fine.

214
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,625
My 300-man squadron
will be more than enough

215
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,791
for a job like that!

216
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,500
[NARRATOR]
One month into the war,

217
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,916
and the Qin army's main
Meng Ao camp had begun

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,500
their assault on the
third castle, Jinliguan.

That's ours, as you
very well know. Get out!

[XIN]
Shut it!

This siege tower
belongs to all of us!

Why, you little-- Ugh!

Oh Yes! We're on the wall now!

Don't let the Yu Feng Force
get all the glory!

You think we'll just
keep falling for this?

There are way more
enemies than we'd expected!

[XIN] It's the third
castle, all right.

ready for us now!

S-Stop now! Stay down!

Don't you know that thing
can only hold so many people?

250
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,833
And that is far too
many for it to handle!

Wow.

All it takes is experience

266
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,416
and they're already
markedly stronger

267

Yes, the Fei Xin Force,

for show, now did he?

He would be a force

320
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,791
for the Yu Feng and
Le Hua to reckon with

321
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,666
if he weren't
such a total dunce.

322
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,083
However...

323
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,375
I guess that's part

324
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,041
of what makes 'em
the Fei Xin Force.

325
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,333
[WEI SOLDIER I grunts]

326
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,791
[WEI SOLDIER J gasps]

327
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,666
Someone's just fallen!

328
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,458
[groans]

329
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,541
[WEI SOLDIER K]
Kill him!

330
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,500
[XIN]
Aaaah!

331
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,416
Um, uh-oh! Xin's a
rat in a trap right now!

332
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,791
[YUAN]
Let's go, team!

333
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,125
[WEI PING]
Yeah, but how exactly will we?

334
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,750
[YUAN]
Uhhh...

335
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,708
Just run away
for now, Xin, sir!

336
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,958
[grunts]

337
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,083
Huh?

338
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,708
[gasping]

339
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,583
Oh! Those are Qin flags I see!

340
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,166
[QU HAI] They have
stormed the south wall now!

341
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,875
Uh... When did that happen?

342
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,333
[MENG TIAN]
The enemy sent extra troops

343
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,875
after that fancy siege tower,

344
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,250
so obviously, the other
units were shorthanded.

345
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,958
Plus,

346
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,875
that's Guo Bei's
1,000-man unit,

347
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,791
which means skilled
troops as mighty

348
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,375
as those in the
main force are here.

349
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,500
Ah! No time to be
standing around staring!

350
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,291
C'mon guys!
Get down here quickly

351
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,458
before they steal our thunder!

352
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
[NARRATOR] Afterward, the
castle-storming Fei Xin Force

353
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,333
happened to run into

354
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:52,000
a renowned military officer
and defeated him.

355
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,166
In the end,

356
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,708
their achievements
were greater than those

357
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,666
of the Yu Feng
and Le Hua Forces.

358
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:04,000
[FEI XIN FORCE laughing]

359
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,166
Listen up, guys!

360
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,291
We didn't get the
general's head,

361
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,208
but never mind that right now!

362
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,666
Let's celebrate instead!

363
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,250
[NARRATOR] Although luck
certainly played a part,

364
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,375
the Fei Xin Force
was truly happy

365
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,458
with their first victory
in a long while.

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,875
[CHONG YUAN] Nice graceful
fall you got there, commander!

367
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,208
Be quiet!

368
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,416
Hey, where is that Long Chuan?
Get over here!

369
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,041
[laughs] Leave it
to Xin to come away

370
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,208
from that without
a single scratch!

371
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,083
And that big siege tower!

372
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,541
The wheels were totally
wrecked in the end!

373
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,333
Totally wrecked? Oh, no way!

374
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,750
Yeah, and that old Yu Feng
guy got all teary-eyed!

375
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,833
[WEI PING laughs]
Serves 'em right!

376
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,708
Ah, so that's the Fei Xin Force!

377
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,125
Huh?

378
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,666
[QU HAI]
Huh? Who's that there?

379
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,333
[UNDERLING A]
Guo Bei, sir, please hurry!

380
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,208
The war council is--

381
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,458
[LONG Y?U]
Guo Bei?

382
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,833
[GUO BEI] I'll be right there.
You go on ahead.

383
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,791
[TIAN YOU] Guo Bei?
Isn't that the commander

384
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,250
who took the
general's head today?

385
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,416
[WEI PING]
X-Xin!

386
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,666
[FEI XIN SOLDIER A]
Sir!

387
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,916
So you're Xin. Hmph.

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,291
You look just as I'd imagined.

389
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,166
You were once a servant, yes?

390
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,041
[growls]

391
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,416
[GUO BEI]
I've had something I've wanted

392
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,375
to tell you ever since I heard.

393
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,208
[XIN grunts]
Well, out with it!

394
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:39,291
Hmph. I, Guo Bei,
was also once a servant.

395
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,333
Huh?!

396
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,416
[GUO BEI]
Just like you,

397
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,583
I also lost my parents to war.

398
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,166
From a very young age,

399
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,541
I went from house
to house as a servant,

400
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,833
until a childless couple
welcomed me in as their own.

401
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,958
Now I stand among
the military elite.

402
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,250
When I heard your circumstances,

403
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,125
I was reminded
of my past as well.

404
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:04,708
I have been rooting for you
ever since I first heard of you.

405
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,416
To be a 300-man commander
with no outside support,

406
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,625
and on top of that,
to do so at your age?

407
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,041
You've been working hard.

408
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,625
Uh... No, I--

409
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,041
I also admired your
attacking technique

410
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,750
on Luan Tong at Gaolang.

411
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,916
Have you noticed?

412
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,333
Thanks to you, there have been

413
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,583
almost no violations
like that one

414
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,416
this time around, you see.

415
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,791
You did it, Xin!

416
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,083
Yeah!

417
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,708
[FEI XIN FORCE cheering]

418
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,583
[XIN]
Uh, hey! Wait up a sec!

419
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,458
[GUO BEI]
I thought I would step in

420
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,708
to offer my help perhaps,
but I see. Hmph.

421
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,791
I should mind my own business.

422
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,916
[XIN]
Uh.

423
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,458
This unit is on the right track.

424
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,750
Just keep going.

425
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,791
Don't let those nobles
beat you down, Xin!

426
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,500
[WEI PING]
Meng Tian was telling us.

427
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,958
Smarts, skills, spirit--

428
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,666
Guo Bei's got
it all, truthfully.

429
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,916
He's popular and
extremely talented,

430
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,958
even for being in the Qin army.
Out of all the young officers,

431
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,541
he's closest to becoming
general, it seems.

432
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,958
I was told that he was already

433
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,625
one of Meng Ao's closest
and trusted advisors

434
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,166
in this battle.

435
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,416
A 1,000-man commander,

436
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,875
and already advising generals.

437
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,750
And on top of that,
he's still pretty young.

438
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,916
He sure didn't look like someone
who used to be a servant.

439
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,875
He was even grander
than all those noble types.

440
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,083
But so pleasant, too,
and not offensive at all!

441
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,250
I guess there are people
out there like that.

442
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,083
[XIN]
Guo Bei, 1,000-man commander.

443
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,541
[LUN HU]
Commander Guo Bei, a moment?

444
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,000
Hmm?

445
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,958
[LUN HU]
Let's see...

446
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,000
Who's next on my list?
