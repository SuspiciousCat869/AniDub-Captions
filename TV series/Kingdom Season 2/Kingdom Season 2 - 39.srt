A ceremony was underway

2
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,500
in Xianyang to appoint
the ministers

3
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,625
who would hold sway
over Qin's future.

4
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,791
Lü Buwei had seized
the highest post

5
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:51,333
of Chancellor of State
in his recent coup d'état,

6
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,791
but in order to firm
up that standing,

7
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,333
he would need on his side

8
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,833
both the Minister of the
Left and of the Right

9
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,666

out in public like this--

Be patient Li Si.

32
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,583
Your time will certainly
come soon enough.

33
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,125
I am well aware of that.

34
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,166
[LORD CHANGPING] I saw most
of this coming and yet,

35
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,375
I did not know the king's

36

such unabashed power.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,750
[CHENG JIAO]
Absolutely all of us released

and all of us are truly powerful
with secret connections.

40
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,625
It is incredibly
clear to me that

41
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,250
you should have
released us earlier,

42
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,625
Ying Zheng.

43
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,208
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Was this a good idea?

44
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,541
I wholeheartedly believe

45
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,541
that involving Cheng Jiao
made our faction

46
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,916
a real match for Lü Buwei's,

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,541
but from another perspective,

48
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,541
Cheng Jiao has become
more powerful.

49
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,916
It's like fighting poison

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,041
with poison, and
it is poison, after all.

Very well done, Your Highness.

53
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,208
However, joining ranks

54
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,750
with your former enemy;
I think his victims

55
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,458
must be turning in
their graves right now.

56

It is a greater pity for
one's path to crumble.

[LÜ BUWEI]
"Path"?

58
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,666
Ah, but if I have
drank the poison

59
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,166
of the Inner Palace,

60

and you have drank the poison
that is your half-brother,

61
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,791
I suppose it all comes
down to which poison

62
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,750
is the stronger of
the two, as you can see!

63
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,541
It's how this should be weighed.

Incorrect.

Hm?

66
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,291
The strength of the
poison isn't the key.

67
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,041
I believe this all
comes down to

68

who is stronger, you or I.

Some days later,

the Fei Xin Force had
finally made its way

75
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:53,250
to Qin's eastern
outpost of Dongjin.

to regroup along the Qin border.

We are here at long last.

Later than I expected.

82

to be quite late.

one thing to do now,

which is to crush
the enemy before us,

calming down,

forces out there.

Come with me
for a moment, Xin

164
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,458
What now?

165
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,625
I'm kinda busy here, you know.

166
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,458
[MENG TIAN]
It won't take long.

167
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,916
[XIN]
Ugh, fine.

168
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,666
[NARRATOR]
Back in Xianyang, something

169
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,708
even more joyful for Xin and
his friends came to light.

170
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,125
[gasps] Why didn't you tell me?

171
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,708
I had no idea, Xiang!

172
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,166
[XIANG]
Well, I just--

173
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,291
[YANG]
So?

174
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,708
Did you tell
His Highness immediately?

175
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:18,458
Uh-huh.

176
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,958
[YANG]
And?

177
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,458
[ZHENG]
Hm?

178
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,791
[XIANG]
Mm...

179
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,750
[ZHENG]
Xiang?

180
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,250
Ah! Um, yes?

181
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,500
What is it?

182
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,958
Is there something you
want to say to me, now?

183
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,958
[XIANG]
As you wish, Your Highness.

184
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,500
[ZHENG]
Go ahead.

185
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,916
[XIANG]
All right, so here goes:

186
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,125
The truth is, I--

187
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,625
--I can't hear you.
--[XIANG gasps]

188
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,125
Speak up, would you please?

189
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,208
Well, I am carrying your child!

190
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,541
[ZHENG gasps]

191
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,833
[XIANG gasps] Please do
forgive me, Your Highness.

192
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,583
I-I don't know what I should do.

193
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,000
[XIANG sobs]

194
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,166
[ZHENG]
So that's what it was, Xiang.

195
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,791
[gasps]

196
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,958
I see.

197
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,083
We have something to protect.

198
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,208
[gasps]

199
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,166
Oh, Your Highness!

200
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,583
[YANG sobs]
O-Oh, thank goodness.

201
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,375
I'm happy for you, Xiang!

202
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,708
I really am! I am!

203
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,208
Oh my, Yang!

204
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,625
[XIANG]
Thank you! Yang!

205
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,166
[YANG]
Oh, Xiang!

206
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,458
[sobs] Congratulations, sire!

207
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,125
My heartfelt
congratulations to you!

208
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,916
Yes, well, thank you so much.

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,791
You have my congratulations,
Your Highness.

210
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,291
The kingdom of Qin can now

211
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,583
build upon a firm
foundation of prosperity

212
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,291
from this great news, now.

213
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,875
As Chancellor of State,

214
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,458
I can think of
nothing so felicitous.

215
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,333
In fact, you know what?
This calls for a kingdom-wide

216
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,750
celebratory banquet
in three days' time!

217
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,958
What do you think, huh?

218
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,125
Minister of the Right and Left?

219
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,791
It is a fine idea.

220
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,208
I've no objections to that.

221
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,416
[LÜ BUWEI]
Your Highness, I have obtained

222
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,625
consent from them both.

223
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,875
I appreciate your
thoughtfulness, Chancellor.

224
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,916
Your Highness.

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,041
My lord.

226
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,000
The wind is blowing
our way, at last.

227
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,083
That's right.

228
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,083
The Royal Court's power
has just managed

229
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,208
to truly hold its ground.

230
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,750
Lü Buwei won't be able

231
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,375
to make any obvious
moves for now.

232
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,625
Which is why

233
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,666
this is exactly when
we get to revel

234
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,083
in our happiness!

235
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,583
Yes, sir!

236
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,958
[LÜ BUWEI] I have said my
expected congratulations,

237
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:55,250
but your future won't be
as firm as all that, I'm afraid,

238
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,208
Your Highness.

239
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,708
[ZHENG]
Lü Buwei.

240
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:02,125
You are just like an
insect infesting our land.

241
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,291
My goal is a unified
Middle Kingdom.

242
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,541
Therefore, I shall relentlessly

243
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,625
eliminate anyone
who blocks my path.

244
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,458
Prepare yourself, Lü Buwei!

245
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,541
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
What?

246
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,416
Zheng's baby?

247
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,958
Ha! Isn't that quite amusing!

248
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,041
[ZHAO GAO]
Madam?

249
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,875
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Well, isn't it humorous?

250
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,666
And him barely knowing his
own father's face, at that!

251
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,666
Heh.

252
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,750
If you could even
call that a dad.

253
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:34,083
[QUEEN DOWAGER laughing]

254
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,708
[MENG TIAN]
Oh, Xin, did you hear?

255
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,958
[XIN]
Huh?

256
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,541
[MENG TIAN] My teacher's
Minister of the Right,

257
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,166
and Lord Changwen is now
Minister of the Left.

258
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,416
Li Si was rumored

259
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,541
for the Minister
of the Left position,

260
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,125
but it seems that
Lord Changwen's faction

261
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,458
pushed him through.

262
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,958
[XIN] So the old man made
it Minister of the Left?

263
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,208
Um.

264
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,750
Did you just call the
Minister of the Left

265
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,833
an "old man"?

266
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,125
Well, I guess.

267
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,333
Zheng is getting
ready to wage a war

268
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,416
on Lü Buwei!

269
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,375
And the king and Chancellor.

270
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,041
Man we gotta tell Diao,

271
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,791
she's gonna flip
when she hears this!

272
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,541
I can't wait to tell her!

273
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,000
[laughs]

274
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,291
Ugh.

275
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,333
Well then, man.

276
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,083
Is that all you
wanted to say to me?

277
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,083
[MENG TIAN]
Hardly.

278
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,250
We'll get to the point
on the east wall.

279
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,708
[XIN]
Ugh.

280
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,916
[XIN]
Uh--!

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,625
Wang Ben!

282
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,333
What are you doing here?

283
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,375
I asked him to come.

284
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,666
[WANG BEN]
That's right.

285
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,875
[MENG TIAN]
So, you were saying

286
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,000
that on your way here
you ran into Li Mu?

287
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,125
Yeah.

288
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,458
Please, tell us about it.

289
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,958
Well, it was about
five days before

290
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,000
we arrived right here.

291
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,916
We were in an
area where the Wei,

292
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,458
Zhao, Han, and Chu borders
are tangled together.

293
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,083
We got word of
an enemy sighting,

294
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:04,541
so we were hiding up on
a cliff, spying on them.

295
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,208
[XIN]
The carriage stopped!

296
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,083
[XIN] Well, even if I
did get a look at him,

297
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,666
I wouldn't know where
this guy is fro--

298
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,916
[gasps]

299
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,416
[XIN]
Li Mu?

300
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,041
And Kaine!

301
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,916
Commander, they'll see you!

302
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,541
[XIN]
My curiosity got the best of me,

303
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,375
so Diao and I
decided to follow him.

304
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:29,791
[DIAO, XIN gasp]

305
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,833
[XIN]
A tent?

306
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,958
Out here in the forest?

307
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,500
[XIN grunts]

308
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,833
[leaves rustle]

309
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,125
[KAINE]
Scoundrel!

310
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,208
[gasps]

311
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,958
[gasps] I-It's you!

312
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,083
Hey there.

313
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,500
[KAINE]
Why are the two of you here?

314
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,041
Xin of the Fei Xin Force?

315
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,250
[LI MU]
Ya know, you really are

316
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:02,000
a thick thorn right in my side,
Xin of the Fei Xin Force.

317
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,416
And you,

318
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,083
He Liao Diao.

319
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,833
Long time no see, huh, Li Mu?

320
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,416
Yeah, you're right.
I didn't recognize you.

321
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,666
[XIN]
Holed up here, all sneaky.

322
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,250
You cooking up
another plot, Li Mu?

323
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,375
'Cause it looks like
there's someone

324
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,375
in that tent of yours.
So, who is it?

00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,083
Be quiet and just walk!

Quit poking me, that hurts!

Hey, Li Mu! Are you
gonna kill him?

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,875
Well, now. Do you think I will?

[XIN] Are you so sure you wanna
send your bodyguards away?

[LI MU] Truly, an alliance
is a handy thing to have.

[XIN]
Huh?

Here I am, someone you would
normally be killing quickly,

However, an alliance
isn't really

You are plotting
something, aren't you?

[DIAO] Do you think
Li Mu's really going to--

No way.

Li Mu is the chancellor
of Zhao, after all.

376
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,958
He would do nothing
of the sort.

as much, really.

The very first time I saw you
in Xianyang, I had a feeling,

413
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,416
here was a fighter
who'd definitely

seen plenty of action!

00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,958

could some gangly

of the great General Wang Yi.

you're a beast with both brains
and bravery at your command!

00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,750
[LI MU] Is that why
you agreed to duel me,

420
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,333

kill you here?

not just for show.

I do wonder what Li Mu is up to.

What'd you think, Wang Ben?

436

A secret meeting
for a new alliance.

Yeah, probably so.

That's what Diao said, too.

[DIAO]
Li Mu.

440
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,500
If the chancellor
of Zhao himself

441
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,625
is indeed secretly
meeting someone out here,

442
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,791
you'd think the other party

443
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,791
would have to be
a chancellor too.

444
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:02,916
Besides,

445
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,375
it would be worst
for Qin if it were

446
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,916
the Chu chancellor,

447
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,083
the two of you discussing
a Chu-Zhao alliance

448
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,291
all alone, right here.

449
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,541
Assuming the worst is

450
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,916
just what a tactician
should do, He Liao Diao.

451
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,500
I can definitely tell
you're the brains

behind the Fei Xin Force.

453
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,708
So, it is an alliance!

454
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,625
As I told Xin before:
what really matters

455
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,000
is not the alliance itself,
but its goals and the outcome.

456
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,541
Then that very outcome

457
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,500
perfectly leads into the
next goal, you know.

Uh, what do you mean--

I can give you this warning

460
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,250
here and now, however.

You may be racking
up combat experience,

but the real truth is...

463
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,000
You do not understand
the true terror of war.

you put together against Qin,
you can bet I'll face them,

A Chu-Zhao alliance.

The sound of it
gives me chills.

If it did actually transpire,
then what could Qin do about it?

off about Li Mu.

He must be pulling off something

even bigger than
what he admitted

to me back there!

General Meng Ao retired

to break out now.

486
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,625
[XIN] Yeah, with that
guy in the middle

487
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,625
of it all, I'm sure of it!

488
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,375
That Li Mu.

489
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,458
[XIN]
But it's not all bad.

490
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,291
We'll be going around giving
all the other kingdoms what for.

491
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,833
A big war is what
we've been waiting for!

492
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,541
We'll never get
anywhere dawdling!

493
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,166
I'm gonna overwrite
those legends

494
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,291
with my own hands now!

495
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,291
[WANG BEN]
Hm...

496
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,875
Unified Middle Kingdom.

497
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,833
That's what Lian Po
said before, right?

498
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,625
Unify the Middle Kingdom?

499
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,458
There's a legendary
feat for you.

500
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,500
Zheng-- I mean,

501
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,208
our king once told me before.

502
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:23,541
What exactly unifying the
Middle Kingdom meant to him.

503
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:27,666
Putting an end to
500 years of fighting.

504
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,791
So no matter what
storm's heading my way,

505
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,500
I'm just gonna fight through it!

506
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,125
You'll see.

507
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,625
That will be

508
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,458
my path to being the
world's greatest general!

509
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,208
[XIN]
Isn't that right...

510
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,750
[XIN]
...Zheng?

511
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,333
[XIN]
Fei Xin Force!

512
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,541
Let's do this!

513
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,708
[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]

514
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,958
[yells] Out of my way!

515
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:19,083
[XIN] Here comes Xin
of the Fei Xin Force!
