00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,458
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,625
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,958
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,083
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,208
Their opponent: the
legendary general Lian Po.

6
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,958
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

7
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,625
their sights set
on a major victory.

8
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,958
[NARRATOR] It was the day
after the Fei Xin,

9
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,375
Yu Feng, and Le Hua Forces

10
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,083
had launched their attack
on Lun Hu's camp.

11
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,166
Um, Xin, sir?

12
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,333
[laughs]

13
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,583
Guess they can't see me, huh?

14
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,708
[NARRATOR]
The men who risked their lives

15
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,583
in the battle at its
very center,

16
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,125
came to a strange realization.

17
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,166
Why, yes, certainly.

18
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,833
[NARRATOR] Finally,
the curtain was now rising

19
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:37,375
on the final day of the
Great Shanyang Offensive!

20
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,625
What?!

21
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:47,666
What do you mean when you
say we're the rear reserves?!

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,250
After that stunt you pulled
yesterday, what did you expect?

23
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,458
And what more,
watch your loud mouth!

24
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,916
[XIN groans]

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,708
[RONG BEI] Today the Le Hua,
Yu Feng and Fei Xin Forces

26
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,291
will play nice together
in the rear reserves.

27
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,875
Did he say... in the rear?

28
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,541
It figures, I guess.

29
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:12,541
[XIN] But General, we only
just got the morale up high!

30
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,625
Oh, quit grumbling now.

31
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,166
Chances are Lun Hu will show up,

32
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,166
and when he does,
the rear reserves

33
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,166
really are the place to be.

34
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,375
Huh?!

35
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,250
The general is
absolutely right, Xin, sir.

36
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,958
[CHU SHUI]
If we were in the front line,

37
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,000
we'd only encounter Lun Hu
if we were lucky enough

38
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,791
for him to attack directly.

39
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,458
But given this broader post,

40
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,708
we can deal with Lun Hu
at any time we please.

41
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,500
[XIN]
Hey, you're right!

42
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,666
So then, the general's
giving us Lun--

43
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,625
The lot of you ought to be drawn
and quartered for violating

44
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,416
martial law, I'll have you know.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,625
Heh. But Tu Men and
I really believe that

46
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,500
your utter dominance in
breaking through Lun Hu's camp

47
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,833
is the real deal.

48
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,666
Just don't screw up this time...

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,416
...Xin.

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,875
[XIN grunts]

51
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,625
[laughs]

52
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,666
[RONG BEI] Now, until the
opportunity presents itself,

53
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,333
stay back and enjoy
the view of my butt!

54
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,583
[gasps]

55
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,166
[RONG BEI] The clouds
are thick this morning.

56
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,166
[RONG BEI]
We're in for a rough one.

57
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,458
[NARRATOR] Day six of the
battle of the Liuyi Plains.

58
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:51,041
As usual Meng Ao's main
line-abreast defensive formation

59
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:55,583
was in position to strike
at the approaching Wei army.

60
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,166
General Tu Men headed up
the right flank,

61
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,416
with General Rong Bei
in the left flank.

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,541
The Le Hua and Yu Feng Forces
were in the right rear,

63
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,791
and the Fei Xin Force
in the left rear

64
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,916
took their respective
positions as reserves.

65
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,791
[NARRATOR] Meng Ao's
main troops stood atop a plateau

66
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,833
behind the central army
overlooking the Liuyi Plains.

67
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,208
Are Jie Zifang's
back up here yet?

68
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,416
Not yet, sir.

69
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,833
[LUN HU]
I'll use his soldiers

70
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,333
to replace the ones
I've lost so far.

71
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,166
But how well can those
heavyweights truly fit

72
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,000
into my fighting style,
and so quickly?

73
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,708
I suppose I could ask the same
about these Wei soldiers.

74
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,458
[WEI LIANG]
General Lun Hu!

75
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,875
I'm afraid you've misunderstood!

76
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,375
This is no comeback
for General Lian Po,

77
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,083
or any of his men whatsoever.

78
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,791
It's about the people
of Wei defending our land

79
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,541
from all of those pesky invading
Qin dogs coming for us!

80
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,916
We all came to fight
to protect our land

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,416
and our families, as well!

82
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,666
That sentiment,
those very lives,

83
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,833
they rest in your hands as we
fight right now, you see!

84
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,333
Please, Sir.

85
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:45,125
I'm asking you to have
more faith in our power.

86
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:49,750
If we lack the might you expect
to serve as your troops,

87
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,416
we will make up for
any shortfall with our resolve!

88
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:02,458
[WEI SOLDIERS cheer]

89
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,208
Right.

90
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,166
I can fight well enough
with these, then.

91
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,291
No more waiting for
Jie Zifang's troops now.

92
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,666
Wei Liang, wasn't it?

93
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,250
Yes!

94
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,416
We're after the head of
commanding general Meng Ao now,

95
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,875
at the back of
their central army.

96
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,291
I'll need you all to fight

97
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,708
like crazy warriors
out there, got it?

98

Indeed.

Today's the real deal, isn't it?

Yep.

Lun Hu from up there?

Not from here, I'm afraid.

We've been posted to a
fair amount of land back here,

but running into Lun Hu
is entirely down to luck.

That's the wheel.

I've only heard of
the wheel in mere rumors.

to pierce the

00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,791
the maelstroms split
the line left and right.

160
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,291
And once a chink
forms between them,

161
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,500
the tip can thrust in
like the deadliest drill ever!

162
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,833
No, that wheel attack
is directly aimed at...

163
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,208
[MENG AO]
Rong Bei's unit!

164
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,083
We're in for it now.

165
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,958
Wang Ben,
it's the left flank, sir!

166
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,458
Meng Tian, sir!

167
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,750
[MENG TIAN]
Is that Fei Xin territory?

168
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,083
Commander!

169
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,541
Yeah!

170
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,875
[XIN]
No doubt about it.

171
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,083
[XIN]
That's Lun Hu!

172
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,958
[WEI LIANG]
This is some fighting style!

173
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,416
It's all we can do
to just to keep up.

174
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,958
Then again, I've not seen a
breakthrough attack like this.

175
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,416
Stay strong, Wei troops!
This is the moment of truth!

176
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,458
[SOLDIERS yelling]

177
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,958
Here they come! On your guard!

178
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,416
You must step down, sir!

179
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,833
[RONG BEI ADVISOR B]
Please, General, hurry!

180
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,500
[RONG BEI ADVISOR C]
General, sir!

181
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,291
[RONG BEI]
That Lun Hu.

182
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,833
It's like he's on a
whole other level.

183
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,583
I'll have to leave
the rest to a man

184
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,333
young enough
to be my son!

185
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,458
[RONG BEI]
If I can't follow through,

186
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,625
I must at least land
a blow on him!

187
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,458
Lun Hu!

188
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,208
[yells]

189
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,333
[RONG BEI]
My lord... I hope...

190
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,000
[RONG BEI]
...you will win...

191
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,041
[ZHU KE]
What happened?

192
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,083
General Rong Bei's flag is gone!

193
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,291
[GUO JIAO]
It can't be!

194
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,208
[MENG AO]
Rong Bei...

195
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,458
[LUN HU] The Qin army is
paralyzed by the loss

196
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,791
of their commander at
this very moment.

197
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,791
Now, on to strike
their main camp next.

198
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,416
[GUO JIAO]
Uh-oh...

199
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,125
If the line was broken
with that attack,

200
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,000
then there's just a
tiny reserve corps

201
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,416
standing between us
and them right now!

202
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,875
General Meng Ao!

203
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,833
[XIN]
Lun Hu.

204
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's do this right now, gang!

205
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,375
[SOLDIERS yell]

206
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,708
[QIN MESSENGER A]
Fei Xin Force, wait a second!

207
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,750
You can't all go together!

208
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,916
And why not, Mr. Messenger?

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,458
There's another army on standby

210
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,333
among the
enemy troops facing you!

211
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,458
Leave 200 behind as
safety reinforcements!

212
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,125
[CHU SHUI]
Ridiculous!

213
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,875
Why wouldn't we strike
with all we've got?!

214
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,958
You can't. That's an order!

215
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,416
[XIN growls]

216
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,166
Hey, Yuan!

217
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,250
Round up 200 of
our wounded and hurry!

218
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,416

Huh? Er, yes, sir!

219
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,458
[XIN]
Qiang Lei!

220
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,791
You're in charge here
from now on!

221
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,708
[gasping]

222
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,791
[YUAN] He's leaving
Lieutenant Qiang Lei?

223
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:22,625
Don't tell me,

224
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,958
he's wounded now?

225
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,875
[CHU SHUI] So when Lun Hu's
men had us surrounded...

226
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,750
You can keep your
bizarre concern for me.

227
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,500
[XIN]
That's not it!

228
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,458
Look, we don't know what'll
happen in today's fight,

229
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,291
so I need you to be in
charge of these men!

230
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,958
Besides, you've helped me
plenty already.

231
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,708
[XIN]
Qiang Lei.

232
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,833
I'll see you later.

233
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,291
Yeah.

234
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,166
[XIN]
Right! Come on! Now, men!

235
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,625
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS yell]

236
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,708
Stop them!

237
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,916
[yelling, screaming]

238
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,541
[WEI LIANG] Excellent, they
have no means of stopping us

239
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,125
from now onward!

240
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,125
We fight through to Meng Ao's
camp and take him down swiftly!

[yelling]

Hear this, all you
stupid Qin dogs:

After the commander!
Right away, men!

stopped in their tracks!

You can't escape!

Lieutenant Qiang Lei, they will
be all right, won't they?

260
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,916

Well, well, young boy!

I thought that right arm
of yours would be useless.

Ha!

00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,666
And it looks like your left arm
is totally out of commission!

[QU HAI]
Xin!

268
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,291
Go left!

Just circle around his
wounded left side now!

Don't need you to spell it out!

271
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,000
[CHU SHUI]
It's no use.

272
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,666
Lun Hu's horsemanship
won't let him get turned around.

273
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,125
He's fighting so calmly
for someone whose hand

274
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,416
was totally destroyed
just yesterday.

275

[CHU SHUI] He really must
have gone through a hell

00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,083
It seems that something
happened at the rear.

second that I'm weaker today.

287
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,500
It'd be a grave mistake.

288
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,458
[LUN HU] I've been
through plenty of battles

289
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,500
with only one
good hand you know,

290
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:47,041
And, well, besides, I have
another commitment after this.

00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,500
Commitment?

292
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,958
They're getting insanely
worked up out in front now.

We missed out, darn it.
Figures huh?

staring at the mountains.

Moron! This is serious business!

296
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,666
We got a pretty gentle slope
here behind the main camp.

297
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,333
The enemy'll have to force
their way in from the front,

298
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,666
or sneak up on us
from behind.

299

[QIN GUARD A] But they can't
send a big army into the back.

300
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,958
Well, for sure they can, if it's
a surprise attack, that is.

301
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,333
Ha! As if they could just
bring down the main camp!

302
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,041
No way, man!

I just really wanna see
all the fighting out in front!

I don't know, but it's just one.

What's his deal, anyway?

313
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,708

00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,541
The great Lian Po has
come to pay you a visit!

318
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,041
[gasping]

319
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,458
It's really Lian Po?

320
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,458
No way! Is it really him?

321
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,833
That intimidating
presence is his.

322
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,958
He's even much bigger
than they say!

323
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,875
What's he doing here alone?

324
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:45,583
[LIAN PO laughs]

325
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,875
My lord, is that truly Lian Po?

326
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,750
Absurd.

327
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,625
[MENG AO]
Lian Po. Were you afraid of me?

328
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,416
Truthfully?

329
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,208
Now just get down here!

330
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,250
We'll settle this with a duel!

331
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,708
A-A duel he said?

332
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,291
Is he serious?

333
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,416
'Cause Meng Ao, would never go
for something crazy like that!

334
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,125
[LIAN PO] We had our share
of duels back in the day!

335
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,500
Remember? You wet
yourself and ran away!

336
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:19,000
Now I'm suggesting we
pick up where we left off!

337
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,125
Come on, Meng Ao!

338
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,375
I will take you on
bare-handed!

339
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:30,000
[laughs]

340
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,208
Sir?

341
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,166
Your banter has not
changed a bit, I see!

342
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,750
Ah, but that's a
very good thing.

343
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,333
All right, let's begin!

344
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,625
[MA LING]
Yes sir!

345
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,000
Take your positions!

346
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,208
[QIN SOLDIERS yell]

347
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,708
[QIN SOLDIER I]
Round up the troops!

348
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,500
[QIN SOLDIER J]
On the double!

349
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,833
You're utterly no fun.

350
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,666
[laughs]

351
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,333
Hey guys, look there!

352
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:03,125
[gasping]

353
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,541
All right. Shall we, then?
