00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,375
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,416
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,333
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,666
Their opponent: the
legendary general Lian Po.

6
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,833
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

7
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,791
their sights set
on a major victory.

8
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,500
[screaming]

9
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,583
[SOLDIERS yelling, screaming]

10
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,750
[NARRATOR] In the first battle
on the Liuyi Plains,

11
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,333
Meng Ao's army found itself
at the mercy of an evil scheme

12
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:12,416
contrived by Xuan Feng,
one of Lian Po's Big Four.

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,375
Only the Fei Xin and Yu Feng
Forces retaliated,

14
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,875
but made no headway.

15
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:23,208
Therefore, the central army
suffered a staggering defeat.

16
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:33,125
They toyed with us horribly and
left us in pieces afterwards!

17
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,541
Damn it! Damn it all!

18
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,000
[NARRATOR]
If this continued,

19
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,208
a drop in morale would be
all but guaranteed.

20
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,625
[SOLDIERS yell]

21
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,083
[NARRATOR]
However...

22
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,541
The Fei Xin and Yu Feng Forces

23
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,375
refused to back down in the face

24
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,208
of the enemy's
incredibly devious plot,

25
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,708
instead destroying them
with their courageous attack!

26
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,000
What's more,
the enemy fled rapidly,

27
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,458
and our army's casualties
were kept to a minimum.

28
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:12,208
That said, then,
I'd call this a real victory!

29
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,416
[SOLDIERS cheer]

30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,250
[NARRATOR] Meng Ao's army held
up Xin and Wang Ben

31
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,583
to stave off flagging morale
rather successfully.

32
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,416
They emphasized how the two
units drove off the enemy forces,

33
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,458
and boasted of their feat.

34
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,500
Those troops who
knew of the defeat

35
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,416
badly needed to be inspired,

36
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,041
and to be moved to add their
voices to the loud cheers.

37
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,333
More like public humiliation.

38
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,375
Behold the two fools
who drove off the foe!

39
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,000
And you got yourself hurt.

40
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,916
Must be doubly embarrassing
for you, am I right then?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,583
Your appearance is
what's embarrassing.

42
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,666
You'll drop their morale
with your dirt-poor look.

43
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,125
You're a spoiled brat!

44
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:56,125
[WANG BEN] Back off.
I don't trust myself right now.

45
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,333
[XIN growls]

46
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,416
[ADVISOR A]
Cut that out, you two!

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,958
Meng Tian, my lord.

48
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,625
It worked out.

49
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,333
If they hadn't attacked
the main forces like so,

50
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,708
we would've ended up with a
lot more casualties than we did.

51
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,791
They've set themselves apart,
that's for sure.

52
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,916
Not that we even got
our turn this time.

53
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,083
[MENG AO]
It's a bit forced, perhaps,

54
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,125
but as long as it keeps
morale up I'm happy.

55
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,708
[MENG AO] Besides, I believe it
is time for my twin swords

56
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,583
to finally make their move.

57
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,500
[MENG AO] Keep your head.

58
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,958
No need to hurry, Meng Ao.

59
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,833
[NARRATOR] On day two,
Meng Ao's central army,

60
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,541
having suffered a major
defeat in their first sortie,

61
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,583
was hurriedly putting
its squads back together.

62
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,208
[GENERAL A] Move, Fei Xin Force!
You're way over there!

63
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,291
[XIN] We're going, we're going!
Get off my back!

64
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:04,875
[gasps]

65
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,333
Attention!

66
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,041
[laughs]

67
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,791
[MENG AO]
Don't you rush, now!

68
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,916
You'll just trip and
hurt yourselves!

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,625
[gasping]

70
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,208
[QIN SOLDIER A]
General Meng Ao!

71
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,958
[QIN SOLDIER B]
It's Bai Lao!

72
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,083
[QIN SOLDIER C] Bai Lao himself
has come all the way here

73
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,916
just to rally us onward!

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,583
I'm here to share one
of our tactics with you.

75
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,750
Our tactics?

76
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,166
That's defense!

77
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,625
[gasps]

78
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,125
Defense?

79
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,583
[MENG AO] The lieutenants
deployed to the left and right

80
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,208
of the battlefield will soon
be entering the fight.

81
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,583
Both of their armies will
now be tearing into the enemy,

82
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,958
and will be fighting their way
to get to the main camp.

83
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,916
Therefore, we in the central
army must dedicate ourselves

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,958
to defense until the right
opportunity presents itself.

85
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,791
Keep me safe and we will win;
it is quite simple!

86
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,583
[MENG AO] For this reason,

87
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,541
you must fight hard so
your units stay together.

88
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,375
By doing so, you will most
definitely safeguard

89
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,541
your own lives as well.

90
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,958
[gasping]

91
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,041
[MENG AO]
Is that understood, my troops...

92
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,250
...my comrades...

93
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,166
...my brothers...

94
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,958
...my dearest children?

[SOLDIERS cheer]

97
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,291
[NARRATOR] It was a typically
Meng Ao-style appeal.

98
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,833
This un-general-like way of
speech shook the very hearts

99
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,291
of the rank-and-file troops
that listened below him.

100
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,666
[NARRATOR] It was on this day

101
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,333
that the fighting began on
the sides of the battlefield.

102
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,583
The first to make
his move was...

103

[WEI MESSENGER A] Report!

104
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,708
General Qiang Yan's
right-flank army is now in war

105
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,041
with Wang Jian's
left-flank army!

106
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,583
So it's begun!

107
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,000
[WEI MESSENGER A] It was all
General Qiang Yan's doing!

108
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,875
[SOLDIERS yelling]

109
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,208
[LIAN PO]
So they're evenly matched

110
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,625
in troops' numerical strength.

111
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,125
But don't you take us
lightly, Wang Jian!

112
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,750
Qiang Yan,
one of my Big Four,

113
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,875
has a formidable trick
up his sleeve, you'll see.

114
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,750
[COMMANDER A]
Go into the valley!

115
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,375
We'll surround their
right flank from below!

116
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,500
[LIAN PO] Qiang Yan moves
his troops with arrows.

117
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,541
And an arrow in Qiang Yan's
ten fingers flies twice as far

118
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,625
as anyone else's in all
of the Middle Kingdom.

119
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,833
Which means Qiang Yan

120
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,333
can control several
units at once,

121
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,541
as they all run between
the mountains out there.

122
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,083
[QIN SOLDIER B]
They're coming from below, too!

123
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,458
[QIN SOLDIER C]
We're surrounded!

124
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,041
[LIAN PO] Any general with a
brain would be taken aback

125
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,041
by the force of
Qiang Yan's attacks.

126
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,916
I remember, at one point,
his army even had me

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,958
scratching my head
profusely back in the day!

128
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,375
Normally, these types of troops
would be kept in check

129
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,416
and fall prey to
Qiang Yan fairly easily,

130
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,000
but I doubt that will
happen this time around.

131
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,333
Isn't that right, Wang Jian?

132
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,875
[LIAN PO] Let's see
your true power, then.

133
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,291
The kind of power which Wang Yi
swore put you right on a par

134
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:01,500
with the famed
Qin's six great generals.

135
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,000
[QIN MESSENGER A] Report!

136
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,166
[QIN MESSENGER A] Wang Jian's
army is being repelled!

137
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,500
The front line is breaking in
the face of the enemy's attacks!

138
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,583
Say what?! General Meng Ao?

139
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,000
[MENG AO laughs]

140
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,708
[MENG AO] Nobody fret right now.

141
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,750
Because Wang Jian is made
of much more than this.

142
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,291
[MENG AO laughs]

143

[WEI MESSENGER B] Report!

144
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,375
[LIAN PO]
Hmm?!

145
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,458
General Jie Zifang's front lines
are seeing movement now!

146
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,458
[LIAN PO] So they're
starting too, aren't they?

147
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:45,791
There's one target left,
then: Huan Yi.

148
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,166
[WEI MESSENGER C] Report!

149
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,583
The first unit
has been attacked,

150
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,125
and there are many
other casualties!

151
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,833
[JIE ZIFANG] Really?
What about the reinforcements?

152
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,458
Well, they withdrew
when the first unit was hit,

153
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,833
and it appears they
have gone into hiding.

154
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,375
They did what?

155
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,791
[NARRATOR] This was exactly
how Huan Yi fought.

156
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,125
Rather than just striking
from the very front,

157
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,500
his squadron split
into smaller subunits

158
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,208
and went right into hiding

159
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,916
just before unleashing
sneak attacks.

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,750
Using the element of surprise,
they struck suddenly,

161
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,666
then retreated over
and over, day or night.

162
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,958
If at any point Wei troops
happened to get in too deep,

163
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,541
Huan Yi's men rose up
as one to destroy them

164
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,250
as if they'd been waiting.

165
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,916
Jie Zifang had heard
the man was dauntless,

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,083
but these irregular attacks
puzzled him much more

167
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,541
than he let on.

168
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,708
[NARRATOR]
Afterwards,

169
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,333
both the central army
and Wang Jian's troops

170
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,083
fought their way
arduously to deadlocks.

171
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:07,333
But reports came daily of
victories won by Huan Yi's army.

172
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,083
Then, on the fourth day...

173
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,500
[QIN MESSENGER B] Report!

174
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,541
General Huan Yi's unit
has attacked

175
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,083
another enemy supply division!

176
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,125
I think that's a typical
Huan Yi thing to do!

177
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,500
I can almost see the faces
of those poor enemy generals!

178
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:26,083
This tactic really makes the
most of his robber past,

179
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:26,875
doesn't it?

180
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,041
[laughs]

181
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,708
[gasps]

182
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,250
A thousand pardons, sir.
It is a slip of the tongue.

183
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,666
Right.

184
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,541
Surely Lian Po isn't just
standing on the sidelines

185
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,916
watching all of this.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,333
It's about time for him
to finally make a new move.

187
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,375
And I do believe
this time around,

188
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,458
this battle truly is
do or die for both of us.

189
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,125
I'm counting on you, Huan Yi.

190
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,583
[MO LUN laughs]

191
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,708
[MO LUN] A nice haul,
just like the other, boss!

192
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,833
[WEI SOLDIER A] You fool...

193
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,500
Cowardice is all
you've ever known.

194
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,708
You filthy Qin monkeys.

195
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,166
Be quiet now, you little worm.

196
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,625
[gasps]

197
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,583
[WEI SOLDIER A screams]

198
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's see.

199
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:24,041
Our little present should be
arriving right about now.

200
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,708
[NARRATOR] The surprise attacks
weren't the only thing

201
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,083
worrying Jie Zifang
at this very moment.

202
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,458
There was more.

203
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,500
We've received another one, sir.

204
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,458
Who is this man?

205
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,750
[WEI SOLDIER B] The thousand-man
commander from the eighth unit

206
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,833
who went missing
two days ago.

207
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,750
[JIE ZIFANG]
And in the bags?

208
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,083
Well, uh, you see, sir...

209
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,625
Open them now.

210
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,083
[JIE ZIFANG'S ADVISOR A]
Sir!

211
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,333
I wouldn't do that if I were--

212
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,166
[JIE ZIFANG'S ADVISOR A]
Out of the way!

213
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,833
[screams]

214
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,291
[gasping]

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,416
[JIE ZIFANG]
You mean all of those bags...

216
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,416
[WEI MESSENGER D]
Report! Another one has arrived!

217
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,583
I-It contains--

218
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,041
Enough!

219
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,958
[JIE ZIFANG] Normally,
atrocities such as this

220
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,458
would easily raise
the enemy's morale,

221
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,166
but this is going too far.

222
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,750
Frankly, if we've
come to this point,

223
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,958
all of the troops
will instead

224
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:36,000
be completely
terrified of Huan Yi.

225
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,791
A tricky opponent for sure...

226
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,750
[JIE ZIFANG]
...Huan Yi the Headhunter.

227
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,625
[XUAN FENG]
What are you fretting about?

228
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,291
[JIE ZIFANG]
Hmm?

229
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,125
[XUAN FENG] You are Lian Po's
right-hand man, correct?

230
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,250
Hardly worthy of
heading up the Big Four!

231
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,916
[JIE ZIFANG] Xuan Feng!

232
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,083
General Xuan Feng?

233
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,833
General Xuan Feng!

234
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,083
Xuan Feng, sir,
what brings you here?

235
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,791
[XUAN FENG] This left flank
that you have right here.

236
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,083
I will be taking it over
for a while.

237
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,083
[gasping]

238
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,250
On our lord's orders?

239
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,458
That's right.

240
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,583
Don't let it get to you, though.

241
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:42,083
Dare I say that your might
may be beyond reproach.

242
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,916
But if the left flank
lags behind at all,

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,208
it'll affect the
outcome of the battle.

244
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,166
It's all about finishing this up
and then moving on to the next.

245
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,541
You see,

246
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,458
your more traditional attack
style isn't a good fit

247
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:59,125
for Huan Yi's very peculiar
approach to battle.

248
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,916
I see, so that is
why you're here.

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
A schemer for a schemer,
is that correct?

250
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,333
[XUAN FENG] Hmph.
Don't lump me in with him.

251
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:12,166
I think those mind games
are just a cheap trick.

252
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,875
I'll have the opportunity to
show him the importance

253
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,666
of real military
strategy this time!

254
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,791
Huh. Well, that should
do it now. Let's go.

255
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,916
[HUAN YI] Why don't you tell
them about this place now?

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
[HEI YING] Got it.

257
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,458
[ZHANG HU] Boss!

258
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,916
[ZHANG HU] Their main camp
is on the move it seems!

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,208
And they are headed straight
towards our main camp!

260
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,208
[HUAN YI] That's strange.

261
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,791
Their camp should be hidden in
some very hard-to-find spot,

262
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,000
as it usually tends to be.

263
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,125
[ZHANG HU] We've heard from a
reliable third party

264
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:58,583
that their left flank is now
being led by Xuan Feng instead.

265
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,291
The same guy who did
in the central army?

266
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:07,416
Xuan Feng happens to be
Lian Po's most vital strategist.

267
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,000
So, then, boss?

268
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,125
[XUAN FENG] His strategy has a
definite fatal flaw, you see.

269
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:28,416
The Huan Yi army is a cloud
of flies swarming the Wei army

270
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,166
with little fragments
of their military muscle.

271
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,958
They send us dead bodies
to crush our morale

272
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,000
and once it hits bottom,
they regroup and attack

273
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,958
afterwards as
one massive squadron.

274
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,666
But that's much too slow,
you dumb fools.

275
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,958
A scattered army
means we can waltz in

276
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,208
and eliminate their
main camp fairly easily

277
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,875
whenever we please.

278
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,166
And just like that,
this battle is over.

279
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,000
Using their tactics
against them.

280
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,500
However, Huan Yi's main forces

281
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,083
moved quickly
into the mountains

282
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,541
exactly when the
battle first began.

283
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,375
We have been searching
for them all this time, Sir.

284
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,291
[XUAN FENG] Naturally, they're
using this strategy only because

285
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,791
they're counting on
never being found, you see.

286
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,083
It's not the kind of thing you
find by simply looking for it.

287
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,208
But look at the terrain,
where we are,

288
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,083
as well as where they
have struck previously,

289
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,958
and--

290
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,791
Right here. This is where
Huan Yi's main camp is.

291
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,583
Jie Zifang, take over the
main army and go after his head.

292
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,041
[JIE ZIFANG] Yes sir!

293
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,958
[JIE ZIFANG]
Just leave it to Xuan Feng.

294
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,333
We've found you, Huan Yi!

295
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,416
[JIE ZIFANG]
Holding firm, huh?

296
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,625
He was well aware that we were
closing in, yet he didn't run.

297
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,166
He's got guts,
I'll give him that.

298
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,125
And much more!

299
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,666
Listen troops! Onward!

300
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,125
[SOLDIERS yell]

301
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,333
[WEI MESSENGER E]
A message!

302
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,333
[WEI MESSENGER E]
A report for Xuan Feng!

303
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:22,666
Jie Zifang's main army has
attacked the main enemy camp!

304
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,416
Oh! Already? It is exactly
as you surmised, Xuan Feng!

305
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,583
Then it's over.

306
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:33,583
Once they cross swords, it's
no use for Huan Yi to cook up

307
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,125
any of his shrewd
little schemes.

308
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,708
No matter how brave he is,

309
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,791
it simply won't matter
at this point.

310
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,333
[SOLDIERS yelling, screaming]

311
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,875
[XUAN FENG]
They can't get to Jie Zifang!

312
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,791
[growls, yells]

[yells]

315
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,416
[SOLDIERS scream]

316
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,875
No!

317
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,166
In any case, his foe-smashing
power is actually pretty equal

318
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,125
to that of Lian Po's clout.

319
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,208
[XUAN FENG]
What's this?

320
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,416
Why do you messengers have
blood splatter all over...

321
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,625
...your armor?!

322
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,083
[gasping]

323
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,875
Good eye, old-timer.

324
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,416
[XUAN FENG] Huan Yi?

325
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,583
That's right.

326
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,375
Any last words now, old-timer?

327
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,041
Disguising yourself
as a mere enemy soldier

328
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,541
to infiltrate is no substitute
for strategy, you dumb fool.

329
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,625
Not to mention a commander
doing it himself.

330
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,583
Strategy... Who needs it?

331
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,458
Y'see, I just make sure to do

332
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,833
whatever my opponent
hates the most.

333
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,541
[HUAN YI] Plus,
I've always been good at this--

334
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,583
Sneaking right in
when nobody's home.

335
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,083
[XUAN FENG]
You may be ignorant,

336
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:24,208
but you aren't without
some aptitude. Hmph.

337
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,458
I could let you be
my apprentice, Huan Yi.

338
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,208
I don't think so.

339
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,458
You are nobody.

340
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,250

00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,583
Come on!

343
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,791
Protect your position
with everything you've got!

344
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,250
[SOLDIER screams]

345
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Xin, sir!

346
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,541
Do you hear that?

347
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,291
[gong crash]

348
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,583
Is that a gong?

349
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,500
Yes, probably the enemy's.

350
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,958
[gasps]

351
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,875
My Lord, something
has happened to the enemy.

352
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,708
[NARRATOR] That gong

353
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,375
was delivering a message
from the main Wei forces camp

354
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,291
to every battlefield
out there in the mountains.

355
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,250
[NARRATOR] Therefore,
all of Lian Po's generals

356
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,875
got the news at about
the same time.

357
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:29,583
Xuan Feng, one of the Big Four,
had just been killed.

358
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,208
[LUN HU] It can't be...

359
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,666
Xuan Feng was killed?

360
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,458
[QIANG YAN] Wasn't Xuan Feng
at the main camp?

361
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,708
How can this be?

362
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,375
[gasps]

363
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:51,041
[JIE ZIFANG]
No! That's... impossible!

364
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,333
[WEI MESSENGER E]
Huan Yi made himself scarce,

365
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,000
immediately after
killing Xuan Feng!

366
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,125
What?

367
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,875
Then it's conceivable
Huan Yi could be

368
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,458
going after this camp, too?

369
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,625
[gasps]

370
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,583
[snarling]

371
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:14,791
[LIAN PO] You've done it now,
Huan Yi... and the Qin army.

372
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,791
Let's-Let's recall
our generals for now,

373
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,791
and just regroup right away.

374
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,083
[LIAN PO] No need!

375
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,125
[gasps]

376
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,125
Night is falling very soon.

377
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,083
Let the squadrons camp out
where they are.

378
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,666
[BAI GUIXI]
But Lian Po, sir--

379
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,333
Losing Xuan Feng means
I need to rethink

380
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,291
our fighting style immediately.

381
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,000
Alert me if
anything else comes up.

382
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,041
[LIAN PO]
Forgive me, Xuan Feng.

383
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,250
I let you die
such a mundane death.

384
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,708
I can't say these soft-hearted
things on the battlefield.

385
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:50,291
To lose someone with whom I'd
cheated death all those times.

386
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,958
However, I won't be
pinning you for Xuan Feng.

387
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,000
I am about to pay
Qin right back

388
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,125
with their soldiers'
own corpses and blood!

389
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,541
[MENG AO]
Now I've finally paid you back--

390
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:15,250
No, now I'm one move
ahead of you, Lian Po.
