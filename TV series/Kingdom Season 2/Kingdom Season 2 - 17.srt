00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,416
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,333
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,416
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,458
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,625
Wang Ben, Meng Tian, and Xin.

6
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,458
These bold soldiers and
aspiring great generals

7
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,000
were together here now,

8
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,583
ready to usher in
a brand-new age!

9
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,666
On the recommendation
of commanding general,

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,375
Meng Ao of the Qin army,

11
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,708
Xin was promoted to
1,000-man commander,

12
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,125
albeit only temporarily.

13
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,750
At the same time, the legendary
general, Lian Po and his army

14
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,625
were moving out
of the Wei capital

15
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,708
and toward the front lines.

16
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,041
[gulps]

17
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,083
[XIN laughs]
Man, what a sight.

18
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,458
Don't ya think so, Yuan?

19
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,583
That's 1,000 troops,
ya see that?

20
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,875
Uh-- Yes, I see.

21
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,500
Xin is totally unflappable,
even when staring down

22
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,833
at 1,000 men!

23
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,791
Amazing! That's our
great commander, all right!

24
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,541
He just doesn't
know any better.

25
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:54,333
[QU HAI] But can he still talk
to us like he has been, then?

26
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,750
[TIAN YONG] Check out the
new 700 troops out here!

27
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:03,375
Some are on horseback, and even
the infantrymen are all armored.

28
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,833
[SONG ZUO] They are nobility
from the warrior class.

29
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,583
[QU HAI] Wonder if
they're really ticked off

30
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,916
being lumped in with us
farmer types from now on.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,625
[WEI PING]
Um, well, probably.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,250
Former members of
Guo Bei's unit!

33
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,500
Face Commander Xin, right now!

34
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,166
Huh?

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,208
[CHU SHUI]
Salute!

36
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,458
[FEI XIN FORCE gasps]

37
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,125
They are...
They are Guo Bei's unit?

38
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,125
[gasps]

39
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,750
Don't let those nobles
beat you down, Xin!

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Guo Bei had quite
often told all of us

41
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,708
the many remarkable
exploits of the Fei Xin Force.

42
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,833
We are proud to have been
made a part of that unit.

43
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:52,916
Starting today, we will risk
our lives as the Fei Xin Force,

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,875
but please allow us to keep
in our hearts as we fight

45
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,083
our memories of Guo Bei,
cut down too soon,

46
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,000
and honor him.

47
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,750
[FEI XIN FORCE gasps]

48
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,333
But of course.

49
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,208
What is your name?

50
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,750
[CHU SHUI] Chu Shui, former
lieutenant of Guo Bei's unit.

51
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,208
It is a pleasure to meet you.

52
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,541
[XIN]
All right.

53
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,791
So, Chu Shui, you'll also
be a lieutenant here.

54
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,583
There's a lot of stuff
I'd like you to teach me.

55
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,041
[CHU SHUI]
Sir!

56
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,750
[XIN] And we are thrilled
to be able to fight

57
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,541
alongside Guo Bei's men!
We all welcome you!

58
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,416
But as Lieutenant Chu Shui
just said, from here on out

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,250
we're all one Fei Xin Force!

60
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,458
Here, there's no difference
between noble and farmer!

61
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,666
No difference between
old-timer and new recruit!

62
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,583
Bring your burdens,
as long as you fight

63
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,541
until death and give your all!

64
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,666
That is the only way that we can
all come together as a group

65
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,416
and destroy the enemy!

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,291
[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]

67
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,333
Let's go, Fei Xin Force!

68
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,125
We're after the general

69
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,166
and taking Lian Po's head!

70
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,416
[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]

71
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,375
Fantastic! Xin is
truly amazing, right?

72
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:15,583
Oh yeah! We've got
Guo Bei's unit with us now!

73
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,625
[NARRATOR] One element
of an excellent general

74
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,958
is having a voice.

75
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,875
A general needs a powerful
voice to convey his words,

76
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:27,375
to address his troops,
and raise morale, as well.

77
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,333
And Xin's voice was
remarkably effective.

78
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,416
All who heard it got a deep
sense of the passion

79
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,916
contained in every
single word he said.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,625
It proved to be just
what the new 1,000-man

81
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,375
Fei Xin Force needed

82
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,250
to get off to a
phenomenal start.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,125
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, news of
General Lian Po and his army

84
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,958
had traveled and
reached Xianyang.

85
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,541
[LÜ BUWEI] Lord Changping,
why not send reinforcements?

86
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,666
They're up against Lian Po!

87
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,666
[LORD CHANGPING] We had
already taken his appearance

88
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,958
into account as a precaution.

89
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,583
Truthfully, Meng Ao's army
has the might required

90
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,625
to handle him effectively.

91
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:15,666
Besides, we cannot afford
reinforcements right now.

92
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,416
[LORD CHANGPING] As a foothold
on the way to the center of Qin,

93
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,125
Shanyang is ripe for
the taking, as you can see.

94
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,791
However, if we
go after Shanyang,

95
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,291
we won't only be fighting Wei.

96
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,750
Han and Chu, to the south,
will make their moves as well.

97
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:38,166
Again, Chu will want to prevent
Qin from taking Shanyang.

98
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,208
Shanyang here is without
a doubt the largest barrier

99
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,875
that stands in the way
to successfully being able

100
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,208
to expand Qin's border, you see.

101
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,666
[LORD CHANGWEN]
It is impossible.

102
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,000
[RETAINERS gasp]

103
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:53,583
According to the reports,
Meng Ao has 140,000 men,

104
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,625
as does Lian Po's Wei army.

105
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,541
They cannot defeat Lian Po
with an equal number of troops.

106
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,708
Our military's high
commander doesn't know

107
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,333
how fearsome Lian Po is.

108
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,750
[RETAINERS gasp]

109
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,000
While fully aware
it presents difficulties,

110
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,916
we must act now,
while we are allied with Zhao.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
[ZHENG]
Whatever happens,

112
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,666
we must take Shanyang
in this battle.

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,750
That is, if Qin wants
a unified Middle Kingdom!

114
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,208
[RETAINERS gasp]

115
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,000
[LI SI]
My lord,

116
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,791
what was that look
in the king's eyes?

117
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:54,083
[LÜ BUWEI] That look meant
he knows everything.

118
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,583
He knows everything and
yet dares to say nothing.

119
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,333
Those eyes...

120
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,541
...aren't looking at me
and the Queen Dowager.

121
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,291
[LÜ BUWEI]
Honestly...

122
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,666
[LI SI]
Sir?

123
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:17,791
[ZHENG] Yes, I'm after a
unified Middle Kingdom.

124
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,833
I cannot stop until
I finally reach it,

125
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,791
whether I face a minister

126
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,000
or one of the world's
greatest generals!

127
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,958
[ZHENG]
Xin. Heh.

128
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:41,041
I am the one who
made you a promise.

129
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,416
And I won't lose, Xin!

130
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,375
[NARRATOR] All of the heavy
struggles within the Royal Court

131
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,000
died down that very day.

132
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,041
Though only for
a mere moment,

133
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,875
the kingdom of Qin
came together as one

134
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,166
in the capture of Shanyang.

135
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,083
[XIN]
Hey there!

136
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,666
It's the 1,000-man
commander, Meng Tian, huh?

137
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, well, hello to you too,
1,000-man commander, Xin!

138
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,666
The Fei Xin Force has Guo Bei's
troops now, isn't that right?

139
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,500
Oh yeah, actually.

140
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,541
[MENG TIAN]
It's not fair!

141
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,500
Those're some heavy
hitters you got!

142
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,500
[XIN]
It's totally fair! Don't hate!

143
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,125
[MENG TIAN] I would
daresay your first meeting

144
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,291
with the troops
went well, then, huh?

145
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,041
[XIN]
You bet!

146
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,458
How about you, then?

147
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,125
[MENG TIAN]
It's easy.

148
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,791
I mean, I'm Little
Lord Commander.

149
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,500
I don't have to say anything
and they bow their heads.

150
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,875
[XIN]
That's right.

151
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,000
He's Meng Wu's son, and
General Meng Ao's grandson

152
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,166
on top of that.

153
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,583
Not that I see
the resemblance.

154
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,458
It may only be temporary,
but we are definitely

155
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,000
1,000-man commanders
in this battle.

156
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,000
Feels like you are rubbing
shoulders with generals

157
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,541
when you've got 1,000 men
under ya, you know?

158
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,333
Yeah.

159
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,666
Sure does.

160
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,750
Hey, 1,000-man commander, Xin!

161
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,750
Hey, 1,000-man
commander, Meng Tian!

162
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,125
What the heck're they doin'?

163
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,166
[WANG BEN] You two are far too
wound up, wouldn't ya say?

164
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,250
Oh! Well, well, then!

165
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,916
Thousand-man commander,
Wang Ben!

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,333
Hey, 1,000-man
commander, Wang Ben!

167
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,875
Be quiet.

168
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,291
You do not understand
the position

169
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,458
you're both in whatsoever.

170
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,666
As General Meng Ao just said,
there are plenty of troops here

171
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,625
who are incredibly jealous
of our promotions today.

172
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,125
Well, it's not
good news for anyone

173
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,625
looking to climb the
old ladder, you know?

174
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,916
Because we're young.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,208
Ha! That's not it at all!

176
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,833
[WANG BEN] Problem is, those
jealous types are also found

177
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:56,166
in the upper ranks
as well, as you know.

178
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,916
If we lose this battle,

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
we'll likely be treated
as war criminals.

180
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,708
Suppose we will.

181
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:08,833
So just stop joking around and
start thinking tactics instead.

182
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:15,208
A 1,000-man unit is big enough
to turn the tide of battle.

183
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,125
[XIN]
Big enough to turn the tide?

184
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,625
Ugh!

185
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,458
Mr. High-and-Mighty!

186
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,666
Why's he always
gotta be so uptight?

187
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,791
Jerk!

188
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,208
[laughs] Don't like that!

189
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,791
Being a noble truly
is a big responsibility.

190
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:36,500
If it's too big for you,
you wind up irresponsible,

191
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,625
just like me.

192
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:41,166
Or a stern, rugged guy,
just like him.

193
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,916
Especially when your
father is larger than life.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,708
[XIN]
Huh?

195
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,916
[NARRATOR] Flanked by
two lieutenants' armies,

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
the newly reshuffled
Meng Ao army

197
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,500
approached their final
destination at once.

198
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,333
It was Shanyang.

199
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,083
Meanwhile, in the
castle of Huangan

200
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,125
in Wei's neighboring
land of Zhao...

201
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,250
[MESSENGER 217A]
Urgent message!

202
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,750
Shanfei Castle has just fallen
to the Qin army's lieutenant!

203
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,958
Say what?

204
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,583
So quickly?

205
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,666
How many is that now?

206
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,458
Meng Ao's army has taken three,

207
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,625
these lieutenants have
taken five, and then...

208
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,166
Now, the other lieutenant
has taken castle number eight.

209
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,250
[gasps] Eight, you say?

210
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,208
And in such a short time?

211
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,666
[LI MU] Meng Ao's army
is strong as I'd expected.

212
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,833
But, his lieutenants
are stronger

213
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,875
than I had hoped
and anticipated.

214
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,208
Just how did I overlook
them so completely?

215
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,708
Who are these two?

216
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,208
[CIVIL SERVANT 217A]
Li Mu, sir.

217
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,541
[LI MU]
This isn't good.

218
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:04,375
If Qin manages to successfully
take Shanyang right now,

219
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,000
they'll gain a major foothold

220
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,250
into the Middle
Kingdom's interior.

221
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,458
We should be sending
reinforcements to Wei

222
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,375
to help put a stop to this.

223
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,625
It would definitely
help in this regard.

224
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,958
But we can't now.

225
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,291
Not with this
alliance in the way.

226
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,541
So Lord Changping's the
one who put together

227
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,250
this direct assault
on Shanyang, wasn't he?

228
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:31,125
It's indeed a bold move,
and one he can only make now.

229
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,333
[MESSENGER 217B]
Urgent!

230
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,458
General Lian Po has
passed Shanyang Castle!

231
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,291
[CIVIL SERVANT 217A]
Passed it? He didn't go inside?

232
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,125
[CIVIL SERVANT 217B]
So, it's a field battle?

233
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:44,333
[KAINE] Amazing. It's just
as Li Mu predicted.

234
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,041
[LI MU] General Lian Po does
seem incredibly confident.

235
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,500
Let us watch the battle
develop, and then pray

236
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,458
that he is
victorious in the end.

237
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,250
But, will that be enough?

238
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,666
[LI MU] In all likelihood,
the Wei army will win.

239
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,625
In any case,
there's no general alive

240
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,333
who could defeat him
face-to-face at the moment,

241
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,250
and I include myself.

242
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,666
That should definitely tell you
a little something about him.

243
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,083
[NARRATOR]
It had been about two months

244
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:16,291
since the Qin army had
initiated its invasion of Wei.

245
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,833
At long last, Lian Po
had arrived at Shanyang,

246
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,625
where the decisive
battle would be held.

247
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,041
However, the reason Lian Po
hadn't positioned himself

248
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:31,583
in the more advantageous
mountain terrain

249
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,625
was because the
Qin army's lieutenant

250
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,125
was already there at the time.

251
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:43,125
I'll give them full marks
for that, I suppose.

252
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,125
[LIAN PO laughs]

253
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,416
[MAO]
Tiger! A tiger!

254
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,666
Xin, look!

255
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,208
You said you wanted
to see a tiger, right?

256
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,541
[WEI PING]
Be quiet!

257
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,791
What are you, nuts?

258
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,708
Don't you be interruptin'
Xin right now!

259
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,250
Those four are busy

260
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,416
coming up with
precise strategies

261
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,375
for the 1,000-man
Fei Xin Force.

262
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,125
Now move the third
squadron two to the right.

263
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,333
Zhong Tie! Two squares right!

264
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,708
No, that's left.
Two to our right!

265
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,666
Not three squares-- two!

266
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,916
No that's left,
I already told you!

267
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,125
[QIANG LEI] Then when the
first squadron circles around,

268
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,833
we'll win.

269
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,125
Well, maybe.

270
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,208
[CHU SHUI] Wh-Where on
Earth did you manage

271
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,041
to study tactics, Qiang Lei?

272
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,791
[QIANG LEI]
Study? Heh. I didn't.

273
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,500
It's just something
I thought up, that's all.

274
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,791
A-Are you some kind
of genius, perhaps?

275
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,958
[laughs] Qiang Lei
really is somethin'!

276
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,083
But you should see him with
his sword out, so watch out!

277
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,416
Believe me,
you'll be really glad

278

you're on the same side, too!

279
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,625
Anyway, all this looks good.

280
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,208
Let's see what other strategies
we can come up with.

281
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,458
Sir!

282

[MESSENGER 217C]
Lian Po, sir!

283
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,000
[MESSENGER 217C] A Qin army
lieutenant has arrived

284
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,875
at Mt. Liu at this moment!

285
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,583
They're taking position there!

286
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,958
[UNDERLING 217A]
On Mt. Liu? Whatever for?

287
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,416
That mountain
is a good distance

288
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,791
from what should
be the battlefield.

289
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,166
[UNDERLING 217B] Have they
gotten the place wrong, then?

290
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,416
Or perhaps they
have cold feet!

[LIAN PO]
Hmph.

292
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,958
If that was on
purpose, that's one

293
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,875
real quirky general, I daresay.

Strategists who favor

look to keep a
distance at all costs.

296
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,625
[LIAN PO]
That sounds just like a certain

ever-changing old man
I know very well!

298
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:41,208
And what's going on now with
Meng Ao's main army, at that?

They are in the countryside.

[PEI LANG, TIAN YONG grunting]

313
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,083
[TIAN YONG] Wait a second!
You don't hit with your head!

314
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,083
I'll show you!

315
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,291
[PEI LANG]
Ha! Look who's talking!

316
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,125
[TIAN YONG]
Oh, yeah?

317
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,250
Whoa! You both lost now!

318
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,083
[TIAN YONG, PEI LANG]
What do you mean?

319
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,000
[XIN laughs]

320
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,208
[XIN]
What a bunch o' dolts!

321
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,875
[laughs]

322
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,166
You ready?

323
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,208
Go!

324
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,166
[laughing continues]

325

[SOLDIER 217A]
Go, Long Chuan!

326
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,875
All right, let's go, Long Chuan!

327
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,958
[LONG CHUAN]
Huh? But--

328
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,333
Hey, go on Long Chuan!

329
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,416
It doesn't matter if
he's the commander!

330
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,791
Just don't get
hurt, boss man!

331
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,166
[LONG CHUAN]
There's--

332
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,666
There's too big a gap in
strength between us, I fear.

333
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,833
What should I do?

334
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,833
If I just up
and beat him--

335
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,583
--[WEI PING] Go!
--[LONG CHUAN grunts, XIN yells]

336
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,833
What was that, Xin?

337
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,500
Some commander you are!

338
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,708
Useless! Moron! Dummy! Fool!

339
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,125
That's Long Chuan!

340
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,500
Maybe he should really be
our commander from now on!

341
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,833
Yeah, that's right!

342
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,333
Commander Long Chuan!

343
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,875
[FEI XIN FORCE chanting]
Commander Long Chuan!

344
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,708
Commander Long Chuan!

345
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,708
[LONG CHUAN]
I could live with that.

346
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,250
Okay, here goes.

347
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,083
[XIN] Piao told me once,
these contests

348
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,875
aren't about brute
strength at all.

349
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,000
There's always a trick to them.

350
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,708
First, as you clasp hands,
try to look weak,

351
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,208
but don't get
found out just yet.

352
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,791
The second it begins,

353
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,291
use all your joints

354
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,250
to move the strength
from all your muscles

355
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,041
into your right arm,

356
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,666
and make it explode!

357
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,750
[WEI PING]
And go!

358
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,958
--[XIN] Yaaah!
--[LONG CHUAN grunts]

359
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:11,208
[FEI XIN FORCE gasps]

360
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,375
--[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]
--[XIN] Yes! Ha, ha!

361
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,000
Whoa! That was insane!

362
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,666
I knew you could do it, Xin!

363
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,708
[FEI XIN FORCE chanting]
Commander Xin!

364
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,333
[XIN]
How'd you like that?

365
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,416
Huh?

366
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,416
[XIN]
What's up, Qiang Lei?

367
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,750
[QIANG LEI]
Xin. Do you have a moment?

368
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,958
We really need to talk.

369
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:50,666
I don't have my feet on
the ground like you guys do.

370
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,041
That is why I'm
not moving forward

371
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,791
like the rest of you are.

372
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:02,541
And that is because I have not
avenged my sister, Xiang, still.

373
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:10,541
I clearly remember
the unbearable pain

374
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,500
that moment brought me.

375
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,916
And yet...

376
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,541
I put my revenge
aside for a while

377
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,666
and I wound up right
here, with you all.

378
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,166
I'm certain that's because

379
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,458
this here?

380
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,916
This is the only home
I have to go back to

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,250
since the moment of that pain.

382
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,041
Hey, Xin?

383
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,000
It's exactly like you said:

384
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,541
there's definitely so much
more to life after revenge.

385
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,625
Otherwise,

386
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,583
how can Xiang rest easy with
her dreams of the world?

387
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:56,500
And I must admit that
I share her dreams as well.

388
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:06,708
[QIANG LEI] But that road lies
far beyond my avenging Xiang.

389
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,375
Do you understand what I mean?

390
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,458
That's why...

391
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,875
That's why I'm leaving
when this battle

392
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,666
is finally over and done with.

393
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,875
I don't know how many months,
how many years it will take,

394
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,458
but I will have my revenge.

395
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:33,208
And once I have, when I
come back here, finally then,

396
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,458
I-I think I should be able to
move forward with you guys

397
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,166
in the Fei Xin Force.
You'll all be my home.

398
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,791
[XIN]
Fine by me!

399
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,291
[laughs] Actually, ya know what?

400
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,416
I was just thinking you
oughtta be doing something

401
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
exactly like that, really.

402
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,000
When you said we needed to talk,

403
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,166
I was terrified you were
leaving right now, ya know!

404
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,208
I won't leave until
my job is done.

405
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:05,541
[XIN] This battle will kinda be
like your parting gift, then.

406
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,416
Let's win it, Qiang Lei.

407
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,000
[QIANG LEI]
Yeah.

408
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,208
[XIN]
You know what?

409
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,625
You are pretty cute.
'Specially when you smile.

410
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,833
[QIANG LEI]
What?

411
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:37,500
[TU MEN] A message from the
general, to all of our troops!

412
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:42,208
The Wei army's First Brigade,
as well as the Qin's army's

413
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,875
lieutenants have arrived.

414
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,500
At Shanyang,
our final destination!

415
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,625
Both armies are in a standoff

416
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,750
as they await their
allies' arrival!

417
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,666
The Wei army is
gathering as we speak!

418
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,625
We cannot possibly let
them get the jump on us!

419
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,750
Now we march--
every single one of us!

420
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,291
The deciding battle is nigh!

421
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,208
Forward!

422
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:08,416
[SOLDIERS cheer]

423
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,541
Now this is more like it!

424
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,041
[CHU SHUI]
Yes.

425
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:15,625
[XIN]
All right!

426
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:19,083
Let's go, Fei Xin Force!
