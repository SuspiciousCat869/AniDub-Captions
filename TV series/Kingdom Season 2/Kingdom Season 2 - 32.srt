00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,958
[NARRATOR] A fierce battle is
nearing its end, finally,

2
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:46,666
as Meng Ao comes face to face
with Lian Po at long last.

3
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,375
Can the perpetual loser of
the past settle the score

4
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:53,291
once and for all with his
lifetime foe this time around?

5
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:01,250
The era was about
Qin's six great generals,

6
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,833
as well as Zhao's Three Greats.

7
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,500
Holding the lives of
millions of soldiers

8
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:10,666
in the palms of your hands,
and risking both body and soul

9
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,583
as we clashed decisively
with one another during battle!

10
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,583
[LIAN PO]
When I lost those opponents,

11
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,333
I can admit I
lost some passion,

12
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,375
but having survived
that incredible golden age

13
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,041
left me with an adamantine body!

14
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,291
Did you honestly believe
you could blow that away

15
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:35,000
with your 40 measly
years of emotions?

16
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:39,458
I must say you have gravely
underestimated me, Meng Ao!

17
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:59,416
[XIN]
So this... is Lian Po!

18
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,958
The great general who
fought on equal footing

19
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,666
with General Wang Yi and
the rest of his peers.

20
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,291
And like Wang Yi,

21
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,916
he gives off this
crazy sense of intimidation

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,541
just standing there.

23
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,958
[XIN]
But unlike Wang Yi,

24
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,708
Lian Po is standing
there as an enemy.

25
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,708
[XIN]
It's hard to breathe,

26
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,541
like someone's squeezing
my heart aggressively.

27
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,375
[XIN]
This pressure is unbelievable!

28
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:34,541
Ha! So you acknowledge that
your fire is out, do you now?

29
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,166
And somehow you decided to enter
the battlefield regardless,

30
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,541
despite being aware
of this, then?

31
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,833
Well, obviously, I was not
solely going after you.

32
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,208
My targets were Wang Jian
and Huan Yi.

33
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,666
I did get in a
little confrontation

34
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,416
with Wang Jian before.

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,083
But I regret to say that it
wasn't especially inspiring.

36
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,791
[MENG AO laughs]

37

[LIAN PO growls]

39
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,416
Wang Jian and Huan Yi
are on a par

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,291
with the six great generals and
you know that very well.

41
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:12,000
If you truly felt nothing
as you say, it's only because

42
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:16,083
that's not what you were really
seeking after all, you see.

43
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,166
[MENG AO] Lian Po, it's clear to
me that you actually returned

44
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,958
because of the utter
indignation that you feel

45
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:29,625
regarding Wang Yi's death which
took place one year ago now.

46
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,833
[gasping]

47
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,125
[XIN] He returned because of
General Wang Yi's death?

48
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,958
Wang Yi fatally lost
to Pang Nuan

49
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,791
and the virtually
unknown Li Mu then,

50
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,750
and he sadly wound up
completely overwhelmed

51
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,083
by the tidal wave of time.

52
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:52,291
In fact, the six great generals
and the Three Greats,

53
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,375
well, with you as the
major exception,

54
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,791
are all currently.

55
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,166
[LIAN PO growls]

56
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,250
[MENG AO] But you won't stand
for any of that now,

57
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,291
will you, Lian Po?

58
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,625
There's no use in
fighting it. This--

59
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,333
[LIAN PO] What of the
tidal wave of time, exactly?

60
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,125
The strong are mighty
until the end!

61
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,958
Whether you are old or sick,
once you are on the battlefield

62
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,958
the rule is only to win!

63
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,500
[gasps]

64
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,875
But Wang Yi was
mightily defeated and slain.

65
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,083
Sure, he had been away from
the battlefield for a while,

66
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,708
this incredibly tough man
who had fought me

67
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,833
in one hard-pitched
battle after another.

68
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,000
After his return,
it took just one battle.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,833
[LIAN PO] One battle to
sully the reputations

318
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,708
and I'll spare your life.

Don't make a fool
of me, you whelp!

323
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,250
I am Bai Guixi,
commanding general of 120,000!

324
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,375
I would rather die
a hundred deaths

325
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,500
than bow my head to Qin people!

326
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,833
I'll show you the
pride of a Wei man!

327
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,791
Now come on, kill me!

328
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,291
[BAI GUIXI]
Come on, do it!

329
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,833
What's the matter, Huan Yi?!

330
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,333
[laughs]

331
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,250
What are you, afraid?!

332
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,250
What's his deal, then?

333
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,208
[HUAN YI]
Talk about a wet blanket.

--[BAI GUIXI gasps]
--[HUAN YI] Hey, Zhong Gui,

335
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,166
take him with you.

336
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,208
[BAI GUIXI grunts]

337
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,333
As if I would.

[BAI GUIXI'S UNDERLING A]
General Bai Guixi!

342
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,666
Oh, whoops!

343
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,083
[laughs]

344
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,625
And after all that
big talk, too.

345
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,791
Just hang in there, all right?

346
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:15,041
Hey, Bai Guixi, tons of people
have died in this war,

347
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,500
on both sides combined.

348
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,958
And you being a
general and all...

349
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,375
...you ought to share
their pain a little,

350
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,791
don't you think?

351
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,500
Some of my own men are
waiting on the other side.

352
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,750
[HUAN YI] The damned fool.
If he'd begged me for his life,

353
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,291
I would have let him have it.

354
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,208
That's the pride of a
military man.

355
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,916
What rubbish.

356
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,625
[HUAN YI] Zhong Gui,
take his head, right away.

357
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,416
On it.

358
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,666
Well then, that's this
place sorted out.

359
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,125
Now to see how they're
doing over there.

360
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,666
[XIN]
The Wei main camp has fallen!

Huan Yi!

362
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,500
We have done it!
We've won the battle now!

363
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,791
[MENG TIAN] No. I mean,
right now we have,

364
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,416
but what'll they do now,
with their general dead?

365
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,916
Go get him, men!

366
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,958
Take Meng Ao's head so that we
can even the score, immediately!

367
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,208
[WEI SOLDIERS yell]

368
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,625
I'm borrowing this!

369
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,250
Take General Meng Ao
to a safe place!

370
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,291
If we can just
weather this storm,

371
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,833
victory really will be ours!

372

[JIE ZIFANG]
That's not happening!

373
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,750
And a horse for me--

What the heck, girlie man?!

[MENG TIAN]
At best, we kill each other.

379
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,750
But there's still one enemy
we really can't handle.

380
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,958
[MENG AO SOLDIER J]
Mobilize!

381

Lian Po, and kill him at once!

is all mine, now!
