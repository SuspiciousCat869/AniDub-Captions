00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,541
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,875
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,875
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,666
of the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,875
Wang Ben, Meng Tian, and Xin:

6
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,166
these bold soldiers and
aspiring great generals

7
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,833
were together here now, ready
to usher in a brand-new age!

8
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,583
[gasps] Xin, sir, look!

9
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,791
[gasps]

10
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,333
[XIN]
What is it?

11
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,541
[YUAN] The Yu Feng Force finally
managed to gain a foothold,

12
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,208
but the ladder brigade
isn't following up on it.

13
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,208
[gasps]

14
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,583
--I bet...
--[YUAN, XIN] Huh?

15
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,583
...this was the Yu Feng
Force's sneak attack

16
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,833
that other squads
don't know about.

17
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,458
But that means--

18
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,708
Uh-huh.

19
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,833
[SOLDIERS roar]

20
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,291
[XIN]
The Yu Feng Force is alone

21
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,541
and helpless with that army!

22
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,291
[MENG TIAN]
However, it's all gone

23
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,541
just according to plan so far.

24
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,416
[MENG TIAN] Why don't
we just see what you can do

25
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,291
from way up there,

26
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,833
Wang Ben.

27
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,625
[WANG BEN]
Hmph.

28
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,750
[SOLDIERS roar]

29
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,833
Kill them!

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,083
Just go in there and smash them!

31
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,125
[WEI SOLDIER D]
Gang up on 'em!

32
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,166
They seem to be getting
shoved off to the left.

33
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,375
They won't be able to strike

34
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,541
the crucial wall
commander like that.

35
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,375
[MENG TIAN]
Hmmm.

36
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,083
[MENG TIAN gasps]

37
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,583
Oh, I get it now!

38
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,708
Huh?

39
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,708
[XIN] The guys
who put up the smokescreen

40
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,458
are standing by on their horses?

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,791
[ADJUTANT laughs] They're
nearly done for now, sir!

42
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,750
[laughs] Wang Ben, sir!

43
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,666
[FAN YANG]
You truly are

44
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,500
a force to be reckoned with.

45
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,833
Defenses, now!

46
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,875
[XIN, YUAN]
Huh?

47
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,083
What in the--

48
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,208
What's this?

49
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,958
They've set up a base,
of all places!

50
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,166
[FENG BO]
Hmm...

51
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,375
Oh!

52
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,708
[FENG BO]
Rope?

53
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,291
From the beginning,

54
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,291
I was never after
just your head.

55
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,833
Oh!

56
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:10,250
It can't be! But that is just
right over the castle gates!

57
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,000
Gatekeepers look sharp!

58
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,291
The enemy is approaching!

59
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,708
[WEI SOLDIERS gasp]

60
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,125
Enemies!

61
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,625
[GATE GUARD B]
They mean to open the gates!

62
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,875
[GATE GUARD C]
Kill them!

63
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,791
[GATE GUARD D]
Don't let them open anything!

64
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,291
[FAN YANG]
Too late!

65
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,666
The smokescreen brigade
is waiting down below

66
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,833
to storm the castle
at the precise moment

67
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,958
when we open the
gates from within!

68
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,500
[FAN YANG]
There's not a speck of fat

69
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,375
to trim in this strategy.

70
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,291
Who'd ever believe
it came from the mind

71
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,333
of such a young commander?

72
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,291
They all ought to keep a
very close eye on him now!

73
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,250
Soon the whole world
will be singing his praises:

74
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,208
Such is the prowess of Wang Ben!

75
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,583
Open!

76
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,958
Yahoo!

77
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,041
[WANG BEN, FAN YANG gasp]

78
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,375
[FAN YANG]
Wha--

79
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,416
[XIN gasps]

80
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,250
Ah! What on earth
is going on up there?

81
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,958
Huh?

82
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,875
What are they doing?

83
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,500
[NARRATOR]
The commanders guarding

84
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,458
the castle walls
were speechless.

85
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,958
Before they knew it,

86
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,500
the Qin flag was flying high
above over the main castle,

87
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,916
where the lord resided.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,583
Meaning Gaolang
Castle had fallen.

89
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,625
From Meng Tian's Le Hua Force
storming the gates

90
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,125
to the fall of the castle,
the job was completely over,

91
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,958
as quick as lightning.

92
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,125
[YU FENG CORPORAL A]
Le Hua Force!

93
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,875
Exactly what do you
think you are all doing?

94
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,583
This gate was only
for Yu Feng to storm!

95
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,250
You do not get to slip
in and snatch it away!

96
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,875
That's brazen thievery,
plain and simple!

97
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,333
Shame on you!

98
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,750
Did you say thief?

99
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,583
You mean to insult
Meng Tian so unabashedly?

100
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,916
[YU FENG CORPORAL A]
And why wouldn't we insult him?

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,500
You Le Hua Force jokers
are always just a bunch of--

102
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,541
[LE HUA CORPORAL A]
Always what? Out with it!

103
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,833
[YU FENG CORPORAL A]
All right! Fine!

104
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,708
But you asked for it!
You're always gett....

105
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,250
C'mon now Xin.

106
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,041
It's got nothing to do with us.

107
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,125
[LE HUA CORPORAL A] And you're
always stealing our thunder!

108
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,125
No, that's you.
It's really not us!

109
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,291
[WANG BEN]
Stop it. That's enough.

110
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,916
They are all free to pass
through the open gate.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,583
The problem truly lies

112
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,250
in our letting them get
there first, you see.

113
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,666
But Wang Ben, sir.

114
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,416
But Wang Ben, sir!

115
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,166
You see, it's like I said!

116
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,041
[YU FENG CORPORAL A]
Meng Tian! Why you.

117
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,375
[chuckles] Kidding!

118
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,375
We owe you one, and we'll
pay you back someday.

119
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,750
That is for sure.

120
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,000
No need. I'll just make
sure my future strategies

121
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,291
include a pitfall
with your name on it.

122
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,916
Count on that.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,416
[laughs] Yikes! That's scary!

124
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,625
Hmm?

125
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,083
[MENG TIAN]
Hey! Xin of the Fei Xin Force!

126
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,333
Why watch from down there?
Come on up already!

127
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,250
[WEI PING]
Uh!

128
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,208
[XIN grunts]

129
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,750
[WANG BEN]
Let's go.

130
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,541
[YU FENG CORPORAL B]
Sir!

131
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,958
Oh dear!

132
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,750
Gone so fast without even
a proper thank you first?

133
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,250
I simply don't talk to losers.

134
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,333
Who you calling
a loser Wang Ben?

135
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,708
You punks don't
play fair at all!

136
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,291
Bringing in a big old
thing like you did.

137
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,708
Because even we could take down

138
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:44,166
a castle easily with
that crazy massive thing!

139
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,750
[WANG BEN]
Just as it's not unfair

140
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,041
for one who knows the
sword to wield a sword...

141
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,208
[XIN gasps]

142
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,708
[WANG BEN]
...I simply used the siege tower

143
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,750
I happened to have on hand.

144
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,208
You find the strangest faults.

145
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,125
Nobility is a gift,
too, you know.

146
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,333
You little--

147
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,250
[chuckles] Now, now!
Don't get so riled up!

148
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,916
It's only the first castle.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,166
We are just
getting started. Huh?

150
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,625
[XIN]
Hmm?

151
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,291
Huh?
Hey, do you smell smoke?

152
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,750
Uh. Huh?

153
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,125
[FEI XIN SOLDIER A]
Fire!

154
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,416
[FEI XIN SOLDIER B]
There's fire all over the town!

155
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,333

156
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,625
[MENG TIAN]
Wait!

157
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,708
We really shouldn't
get involved.

158
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,708
What do you mean?
Let me go, darnit!

159
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,416

Hey, Xin!

we have only had victory

in all of our minds,
but this battle is an invasion.

Unfortunately, this kind of
thing comes with the territory.

Always.

[XIN] I know this.
Oh, I know all right.

I know that war
isn't pretty whatsoever.

Stop your rampage once
and for all, right now!

The enemy has
already surrendered!

197
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,583
This is a clear violation
of military law!

198

We'll be reporting
this to your superiors!

You newbies just don't know
the first thing about war!

killing someone who's
already surrendered,

toward all of

00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,708
[UNDERLING B]
Ow! Hands off!

324
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,291
So how's that for
you then, young sir?

325
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,875
You have been
very helpful, General.

326
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,291
I'll surely pay
you back before long.

327
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,500
Oh ho, those are some
really fine words indeed!

328
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,250
I'll be waiting with bated
breath.

329
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,416
[WANG BEN]
So this is your doing?

330
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
[MENG TIAN]
Hmm?

331
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,291
[MENG TIAN]
Wang Ben!

332
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,666
Unlike you I have
no qualms about trading

333
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,000
on my father's and grandfather's
influence when needed.

334
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,250
Making this kind
of thing go away?

335
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,125
Piece of cake, you see.

336
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:21,000
Why would you
help someone like him?

337
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,500
He's really a child.
He leads 300 men,

338
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,041
yet he cannot
control his emotions?

339
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,541
It would serve him
if he were beheaded.

340
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,833
Taking down one
or two rogue commanders

341
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,333
won't change a thing whatsoever.

342
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,791
If you really want to
make changes in the army,

343
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,666
you have got to be at the top.

344
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,291
Yes, exactly.
And that's why we've been

345
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,875
continually closing our eyes

346
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,541
to all of these heinous,
barbaric acts.

347
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,250
But you know,

348
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,708
I'm very certain
Xin knows that, too.

349
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,791
He knew full well,
and still did what he did.

350
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,000
[MENG TIAN] His confidence
in himself is unwavering,

351
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,583
straight as an arrow that
is flying through the air.

352
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,458
He truly has his very own path

353
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,958
to becoming one of the
world's greatest generals.

354
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,833
What can I say? I like him,

355
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,791
that fiery Xin of
the Fei Xin Force.

356
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,791
[WANG BEN] Confidence
or no, a fool is still a fool.

357
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:24,666
What is more, he's starting out
fatally far down the ladder.

358
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,375
[MENG TIAN]
Hmm.

359
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,250
And despite that fact,
I have been thinking that...

360
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,458
[WANG BEN]
Hmm?

361
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,916
[MENG TIAN]
...he could be a formidable foe

362
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,666
for us somewhere down the road

363
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,125
Yikes, right?

364
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,208
[WANG BEN]
Don't make me laugh.

365
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,958
[girl crying]

366
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,541
[QIN SOLDIER C] We don't
want to have to hurt you.

367
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,291
What are you gonna do
with your parents gone?

368
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,208
Just come quietly now.

369
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,291
We get paid well y'know.

370
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,416
You can live a pretty good life.

371
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,000
You think they'll sell,

372
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,000
looking all poor and
the way they do now?

373
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,500
That's a good point.

374
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,041
Let's look somewhere else.

375
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,958
[gasps]

376
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,500
[QIN SOLDIER C]
Yeah, right.

377
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,125
Huh?

378
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:15,333
Why let you live if
you won't bring us money?

379
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,125
So what if you're kids?

380
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,500
The people of Wei are our
sworn enemies, you know!

381
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,791
Huh?!

382
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,625
[CHUN sobbing]

383
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,083
Thank you so much.

384
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,041
Are you all right?

385
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,458
Uh, we are.

386
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,083
Amazing.
You shielded your sister?

387
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,333
Well, she's my sister.

388
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,000
What is your sister's name?

389
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,708
[CHUN'S BIG SISTER]
It's Chun.

390
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,458
Chun, you can't keep crying.

391
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,708
Your big sister
can't be helping you

392
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,166
all the time, you know.

393
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,583
You must be a big girl,

394
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,166
and join forces with
her now, you understand?

395
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,125
You two are sisters, after all.

396
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,541
Yes.

397
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,833
[QIANG LEI]
Can you walk?

398
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,458
I'll take you to where
the rest of the villagers are.

399
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,375
You'll both be safe there.

400
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,958
Wait! I'm not gonna cry!

401
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,625
Huh?

402
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,791
Hmm. Huh?

403
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,833
[QIANG LEI]
You want out?

404
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,791
[XIN] Nah, I'm good.
I'm reflecting.

405
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,750
I'm glad I got off
with a slap on the wrist,

406
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,166
but I really put you
and the rest

407
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,125
of the squad in an
incredibly tight spot.

408
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,458
So I decided
to stay up all night

409
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,583
really thinking
about everything I did.

410
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,958
Not that I regret cutting
down that punk, you know.

411
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,541
[QIANG LEI]
Right.

412
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:18,708
Bye.

413
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,375
Uh. Whoa! Hang on!

414
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,916
I got some time on my hands.

415
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,333
Stick around and talk!

416
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,333
You said you were reflecting.

417
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,458
[XIN] Oh and bring me
something to eat, wouldja?

418
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,083
I'm starving!

419
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,958
[QIANG LEI]
You must be kidding.

420
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,041
[NARRATOR]
The furor over Xin attacking

421
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,708
a 1,000-man commander, was
prevented from boiling over

422
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,458
thanks to Meng Tian's
maneuvering.

423
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,666
The Fei Xin Force
was now a little more

424
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,541
well known than before
among the Qin army

425
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,041
and the people of Wei

426
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,625
for both new and
different reasons.

427
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,083
Meanwhile, credit
for this first battle

428
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,291
went to Wang Ben
of the Yu Feng Force

429
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,375
and Meng Tian of
the Le Hua Force.

430
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,958
Their two squadrons brought down

431
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:09,000
the first castle, Gaolang,
in but a single day.

432
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,416
[NARRATOR] The following
morning, there came word

433
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,208
that General Meng Ao's
two lieutenants had

434
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:21,083
taken down their own Wei
castles with detached forces.

435
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,000
[NARRATOR]
The Qin army's offensive

436
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,708
was off to a really solid start.

437
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,916
[NARRATOR]
However, no one was able

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,666
to realize at the time,
that further on down the road,

439
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,833
they would be facing off against
an unthinkably huge opponent.

440
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,833
Those Qin mongrels
have brutally invaded our land.

441
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,125
Now even Xuzhong
and Xuxi have fallen.

442
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,041
And yet, my heart
remains free from terror

443
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,833
because you are here,
standing on our side.

444
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,166
[KING JINGMIN] Formerly
part of Zhao's Three Greats.

445
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,291
General Lian Po!

446
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,875
In the three years
that you have been

447
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:13,833
exiled to our land,
never before have I been

448
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,500
so grateful for your presence!
