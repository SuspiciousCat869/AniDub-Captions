1
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,333
[NARRATOR] With their sights
set on becoming great generals,

2
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,708
Xin and young rivals,
Wang Ben and Meng Tian,

3
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:47,083
played off each other to rack up
victories on the battlefield.

4
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:51,333
Meanwhile, an unusual situation
was unfolding in Xianyang.

5
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,166
Messengers from the forbidden
Inner Palace appeared

6
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,000
with a letter sealed with a
duplicate of the Imperial Seal.

7
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:03,000
With Lü Buwei's faction raging
against the King and his allies,

8
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,041
it was as if Zheng's mother,
the Queen Dowager,

9
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,958
was presenting herself as a new
third force in the struggle.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,041
[BI] The Inner Palace
is our third force?

11
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,625
[COURTIERS gasp]

12
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,083
[BI] I don't understand why you
didn't say any of this before!

13
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,375
There is no doubt in my
mind that the King's mother,

14
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,375
the Queen Dowager,
would most definitely

15
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,000
take our side...
if we simply asked it--

16
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,666
[LORD CHANGWEN]
If it were just that easy,

17
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,666
we would've done so by now.

18
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,500
My lord, what do you mean?

19
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,416
[ZHENG]
Bi.

20
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,125
Mm! Sir!

21
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,958
Some things...
just aren't that simple.

22
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,375
[ZHENG] I should say
that my mother and I...

23
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,708
[ZHENG breathes heavily]

25
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,625
[ZHENG]
Mother?

26
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,291
Aah!

27
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,916
[ZHENG groans]

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,541
I told you to stay out!

29
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,708
Ha! You there!

30
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,166
Yes?

31
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,583
All those here,
you may lift your heads.

32
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,625
Promptly now, then.

33
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,416
[NARRATOR] This was Zheng's
mother, the Queen Dowager.

34
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,875
[NARRATOR] A former
courtesan who captivated

35
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,750
monarchs of the time,

36
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:03,166
a beauty so bewitching
she endangered the nation.

37
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,708
At times, without even
lifting a finger.

38
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,875
The Queen Dowager appeared
so incredibly youthful

39
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,625
that rumors held
that she never aged.

40
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:15,666
She was surrounded by an
impossible glamour all her own.

41
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,083
[XIANG]
That is the King's mother.

42
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,000
She's so extremely beautiful.

43
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:27,250
But, why is it that--
I know this is rude of me--

44
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,166
but whenever I see
the Queen Dowager,

45
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,916
I don't know why, but...

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,083
...I sense no human warmth
from her whatsoever.

47
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,375
And that's why all of
the court ladies here

48
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,708
fear that stunning
Queen Dowager

49
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:44,708
from the bottom of...
each of their hearts.

50
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,708
Thus far we have made
a conscious effort

51
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,208
not to involve the
Inner Palace at all to keep

52
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,250
the Queen Dowager's influence
away from matters of the state.

53
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:59,541
Mo Xi of Xia, Da Ji
of Shang, Bao Si of Zhou--

54
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,750
though these were all
concubines, not Queen Dowagers--

55
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,708
it's said that their negative
influence on the Imperial Court

56
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,166
proved the downfall
of the rulers of their day.

57
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,125
When women from
outside the Court

58
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:15,541
get involved in Court matters,
then calamity ensues after.

59
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:19,208
Worse, the Inner Palace
is also a nest of eunuchs

60
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,458
who shrewdly carry favor
with the Queen Dowager.

61
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:27,041
If we bring her into our fold,
they will naturally follow suit.

62
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,958
And the Inner Palace
is protected

63
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,458
by special
extraterritorial rights.

64
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,291
Once they are given power here,

65
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,000
they will be
difficult to control.

66
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,291
All this logically
explains why even Lü Buwei

67
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,375
has not yet approached them.

68
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,708
[SI SHI] The Queen Dowager
has remained indifferent

69
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,166
to affairs of the Court
and silent on the struggle

70
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,916
between Lü's faction
and the King.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,500
However, for her to
send this to us...

72
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,958
...may be construed as
indicating a certain attitude.

73
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,833
What on Earth
could it contain, then?

74
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,083
Break the seal now, Si Shi.

What is it, then?

Well sir, a messenger
from the Inner Palace

called upon Si Shi yesterday.

00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,375
[LÜ BUWEI]
Is this true?

Yes, sir.

What could this mean?

105

[LORD CHANGWEN] It could also
be taken as a mere prank,

106
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,125
or it can also be taken
as saying she cannot decide

107
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,250
which of the two sides
to take as of yet.

108

Your Highness.

I am of the very same
opinion as Lord Changwen.

111
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,916
Does this not mean that she is
currently a neutral party?

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,208
We must firstly
understand that we cannot

113
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,125
judge her heart of hearts
so easily right now.

[LORD CHANGWEN]
Mmm.

[ZHENG] Though I too think
this implies her neutrality,

116
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,125
I believe it carries
an altogether

117
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,666
different meaning, as well.

118
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,166
That woman truly is inscrutable.

everything I did? Tell me

No, madam.

I thought not.

the most important is the seal.

Her intent in affixing
a duplicate of the Royal Seal

147
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,666
and sending it is clear enough.

She sent it knowing we could
not just simply cast it aside.

This is what I believe.

three ladies in waiting

[COURTIERS gasp]

[LORD CHANGWEN] It's true,
the three royal houses

are also the venomous fangs

Aah! Oh, Yang! Say a prayer

[XIANG] Huh? Huh?

00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:19,166
So what was
your mother like exactly?

214

[XIANG]
My-My mother?

00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,625
Yes, her.
Tell me about her.

216
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,833
Let me see, then.

217
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,250
I came from
a poor merchant family.

218
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,166
My mother is
small just like I am,

219
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,375
and works herself
super hard into a sweat

220
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,583
every single day
running the shop.

221
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,166
She's scatterbrained,
soft-hearted.

222
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,375
Not beautiful at all.

223
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,458
And do you love her lots,
a mother like herself?

224
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,125
I do.

225
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,500
When I see her, all she does
is complain all the time.

226
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,958
And yet ever since
I came to the Inner Palace,

227
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,250
we almost never meet.

228
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,500
Somehow even her nagging
cheers me up now.

229
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,916
I see, then.

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,583
A good relationship
is the one you two have.

231

[gasps]

232
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,916
Your Highness's mother is

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,958
so incredibly beautiful,
physically.

234
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:09,875
But then--

235
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,041
[ZHENG] Mm?

236
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,291
Um, nothing!

237
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:16,250
That's right. You have
seen her, haven't you?

238
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,875
How is she,
the Queen Dowager?

239
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,583
[XIANG] Good. Your Highness
does not get to see her?

240
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,750
Oh, well...
it's been a really long time.

241
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,250
But why is that, then?

242
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,666
Surely Your Highness
could see the Queen Dowager

243
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,750
at any time
he very well pleases.

244

A normal King and
Queen Dowager would, maybe so,

but we...
are just not normal.

difficult for us to meet.

Quite unexpected
for him to act without

255
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,458

it is hard to believe.

[BI]
My lord!

258
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,083
Uh, no. This is a private
matter that's just between

259
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,958
the King and the
Queen Dowager, and not us.

260
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,291
Please just tell me
one thing, my lord.

261
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,208
Why would the Queen Dowager,
the King's mother,

262
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,875
not come to his aid
in the first place?

263
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,375
What could have happened between
them to cause this distance?

264
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,958
All that seems
to be between them

265
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,041
are the unfortunate
and very difficult memories

266
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:47,833
of their time as hostages back
in Handan, the capital of Zhao.

267
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:52,375
In short,
they share only darkness.

268
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,083
I am well aware that
the King used to live in Zhao

269
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,833
until he was about
nine years of age or so,

270
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,375
and that he unfortunately
endured daily insults

271
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,708
and terrible cruelty
as a prince of Qin,

272
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,291
Zhao's sworn enemy
in the Battle of Changping.

273
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,250
Any reasonable person would
think that's all the more reason

274
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,125
for her to be a protective,
loving mother.

275
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,416
The suffering the
Queen Dowager had to endure

276
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,166
was even greater, I'm afraid.

277
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,958
[BI]
Uh!

278

[LORD CHANGWEN]
Her husband, King Zhuangxiang,

279
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,500
had fled to Qin. Left
completely helpless and alone,

280
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,791
she grew to detest
everyone around her.

281

And I do mean everyone.

the way people treated her,

And then, in the end...

285

would ever try to

kill her own child? Unreal!

292
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,083
And the poor King, he had to
go through all of that?

293
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,000
I think he was able to
recover impressively well

294
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,416
from this harsh period of his
younger formative years.

295

One woman risked her life
to rescue the King

296
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,791
from this darkness
I speak to you of.

297
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,333
If it weren't for her,
he would most definitely

still be there

between the King
and the Queen Dowager,

00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,208
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Closer!

317
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,666
[ZHENG'S footsteps]

318
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,416
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Hmph.

319
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,458
Well, then. That's just
my son for you, everyone.

320
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,041
I don't see you
for a long while

321
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:40,083
and look what a fine man
you have now become, Zheng.

322
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,916
And you, Mother,
have not changed.

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,375
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Hm.

324
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,041
[laughs]

325
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,708
And to think that you
would ever in your life

326
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,875
come here to see me,
your mother.

327
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,291
This is all
just as you pictured it,

328
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,000
isn't it now Zhao Gao?

329
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,541
[ZHAO GAO gasps]
N-No, not at all.

330
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,041
[ZHENG]
Zhao Gao.

331
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,125
And? What brings
you here, dear Zheng?

332
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,958
Please, just stop
playing dumb, Mother.

333
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,666
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Hmmm?

334
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,416
[ZHENG] I have come to retrieve
the duplicate Royal Seal.

335
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Your prank has gone too far,
don't you think?

336
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,000
If this matter
were to come to light,

337
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,875
you would definitely
be accused of treason.

338
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,250
Treason? How tragic!

339
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,708
I'd be so very embarrassed!

340
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,708
However, don't you
think it incredibly peculiar

341
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,041
and very interesting
that the word "treason"

342
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,208
would come up
between us again?

343
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,416
After the remarkable
life that you and I

344
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,083
both led together
back in Zhao, don't you think?

345
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,666
When you and I were
both living in Handan,

346
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,791
the attacks on us
were beyond anything

347
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,750
most people could ever imagine.

348
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,083
With no way at all
to raise money,

349
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,958
we both lowered ourselves
in order to live.

350
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,666
Literally lowered ourselves,

351
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,500
scrawling along
the very ground itself

352
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,875
quite pathetically,
wouldn't you say?!

353
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,166
But where exactly have
those two gone off to now?

354
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,625
Because you are now
the very King of Qin,

355
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,750
and I, the Queen Dowager!

356
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,583
Formally speaking,
we stand at the very top

357
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,125
of this nation,
the highest stations

358
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,875
with not a single person
ranking above us both now.

359
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,750
What a magnificent
twist of fate this is,

360
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,375
wouldn't you say?!

361
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,500
A scholar once said
that the heavens

362
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,750
are what decide
all of our destinies here.

363
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,875
But if that is true at all...

364
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,458
Hm!

365
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,333
I want to tear
the heavens asunder

366
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,500
as long as this
curse remains!

367
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,625
[laughing]

368
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,750
I'm sure you feel the same,
don't you, Zheng?

369
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,375
Let me tell you
something Zhao Gao:

370
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,500
We have not attempted
to see one another at all

371
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,041
because neither of us
wish to ever remember

372
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,625
those hellish days
that we both had.

373
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,666
Correct, Zheng?

374
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,625
Please, just return the
duplicate seal now, Mother.

375
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,583
Hmph. The seal?

376
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,083
Who cares about
that stupid toy?

377
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,666
If you want it, take it from
the eunuchs on your way out.

378
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,791
[ZHENG grunts] What is
any of this for, Mother?

379
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,708
Why do such a thing now?

380
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,750
Oh, no reason.

381
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,916
I only wanted to see
your darling face again

382
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,916
after all this time
that's passed.

383
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,750
[ZHENG]
Then if you'll excuse me.

384
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,625
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Ugh! Leaving so soon, then?

385
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,291
I was most certain that
you'd come to ask me a favor

386
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,791
of some sort while you
were here, my dear son.

387
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,583
Well, no. I doubt you
would hear me out anyway.

388
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:35,958
I changed my mind.

389
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,625
Well, dear me!

390
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,458
But you haven't asked me
anything yet, my son!

391
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,041
So what is it, then?

392
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,958
Can't you bear
to ask a single favor

393
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,250
to your poor useless mother?

394
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,500
Hm. Give it a try.

395
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:53,041
It's been nine years
since fleeing Zhao for Qin.

396
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,750
Perhaps something
has changed in some

397
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,791
small tiny way between us now.

398
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,458
[whooshing]

399
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,375
[birds caw]

400
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,708
[ZHENG] Although now I am King,
my own shortcomings mean

401
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,666
the true power lies
with Minister Lü Buwei.

402
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,916
I am currently engaged in an
ongoing bitter power struggle

403
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,291
with him as I speak to you.

404
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,666
So I'll ask you.
Please, Mother,

405
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,208
lend me the support
of the Inner Palace.

406
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:30,125
[eerie music plays]

407
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,291
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Hmm. Understood.

408
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,000
Well, you may leave now.

409
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:40,416
And you may look forward to my
response to follow promptly.

410
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:52,833
[gasps]
Mm. Uh! Uuh!

411
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:56,083
May I please ask
Your Highness something?

412
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,875
What is it?

413
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,583
[XIANG] I have heard
some of the rumors.

414
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,916
Rumors that Your Highness
has a benefactor.

415
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,541
Benefactor?

416
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:08,916
Someone named Hika
I think, wasn't it?

417
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,583
[ZHENG]
Mm!

418
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,166
[XIANG]
Mm.

419
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,916
[ZHENG sighs]
