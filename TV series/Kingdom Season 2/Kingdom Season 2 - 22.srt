00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,458
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,583
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,791
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,000
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:49,291
Their opponent:
the legendary general Lian Po.

6
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,125
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

7
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,166
their sights set
on a major victory.

8
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,791
Any last words now,
old-timer?

9
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,625
[XUAN FENG]
You may be ignorant,

10
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:04,875
but you aren't without
some aptitude. Hmph.

11
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,541
I could let you be
my apprentice, Huan Yi.

12
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,166
I don't think so.

13
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,125
You are nobody.

14
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,166
[LIAN PO]
Forgive me, Xuan Feng.

15
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,250
I let you die
such a mundane death.

16
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,791
I can't say these soft-hearted
things on the battlefield,

17
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:24,375
to lose someone with whom I'd
cheated death all those times.

18
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:29,333
[LIAN PO] However, I won't
be pinning you for Xuan Feng.

19
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,291
I am about to pay
Qin right back

20
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,333
with their soldiers'
own corpses and blood!

21
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:46,375
[SOLDIERS laughing, cheering]

22
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,375
General Huan Yi is amazing!

23
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,333
He avenged us here
in the central army!

24
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,500
He's so mind-blowing!

25
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank goodness!

26
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,708
I was scared that the old
geezer was gonna suddenly spring

27
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,083
another weird tactic on us
like he tended to do!

28
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,625
It's so funny how
you're always scared!

29
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,833
[growls]

30

[lauging]

00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,000
[XIN]
Xuan Feng.

32
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,875
[XIN]
I can't believe it...

33
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,125
That old fool,
cut down so easily?!

34
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,333
[SOLDIERS laughing]

35
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,125
Are they sure about this?

36
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,458
Huh, Meng Tian?

37
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,791
They are.

38
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,291
General Huan Yi disguised
himself as a messenger

39
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,541
and sneaked into the
main enemy camp right after.

40
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,041
[XIN]
What?! I need details!

41
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,666
Wait. But first of all,

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,083
I need to go now.
You come if you want.

43
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,500
Where to, though?

44
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,500
General Lun Hu.

45
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,541
I understand how you feel,
but we need a war council.

46
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,208
Everyone in the central army
is in an uproar over our tactics

47
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,625
now that we've lost
the left flank.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,125
--[WEI GENERAL A] Please, sir--
--[LUN HU] Oh, be quiet.

49
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,583
[gasps]

50
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,708
I lost both my parents
due to a war, you see.

51
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,958
My lord saved me from
the very brink of starvation.

52
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,416
And this is exactly why
I have always given my all

53
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,083
in the service of
being my lord's sword.

54
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,541
But it was Xuan Feng
who taught me everything

55
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,500
I know about strategy.

56
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:54,250
[LUN HU] If Lian Po is my
father, he was my grandfather.

57
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,625
Second in line with a
kindness I must repay.

58
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,125
[LUN HU] Although, it is true
that it was Xuan Feng's misstep

59
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,375
that led to his own execution.

60
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:22,708
But for someone like you
to say you understand how I feel

61
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,708
is insanely irritating.

62
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,416
[gasps]

63
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,041
Well I-I mean, that is--

64
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,333
[LUN HU] Don't you worry.
My lord is staying up all night

65
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,750
figuring out a
new strategy as we speak.

66
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,666
All we need to do is follow it.

67
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,125
[WEI GENERAL A]
Yes sir!

68
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,125
[XIN growls]

[growls]

71
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,291
Why exactly would you drag me
all the way out here, anyway?!

72
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,208
Come on, don't be that way.

73
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,875
I have something
important to discuss.

74
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,125
Besides, aren't you
somewhat worried

75
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,125
about the poor
Yu Feng Force now?

76
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,375
Just a little?

77
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,875
And how is his
wound healing now?

78
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,125
Wha--?! Not at all!

79
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,041
[MENG TIAN] We've come
to visit you, Wang Ben!

[MENG TIAN laughs]

00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,833
You see?!

85
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,500
I told you there's no point
worrying about this guy!

86
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,041
Get out. You're in my way.

87
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,875
Never mind! I was just leaving!

88
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,833
[MENG TIAN] Now, now.
Just sit down, both of you.

89
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,125
[WANG BEN]
Don't get between us.

90
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,583
[MENG TIAN] Wang Ben,
you heard about General Huan Yi

91
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,500
taking down Xuan Feng?

92
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,833
[WANG BEN]
Yes.

93
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,666
[MENG TIAN]
Shocking, right?

94
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,583
Not quite.

95
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,666
Don't you lie!

96
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,250
[laughs]

97
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,708
He really went down
fairly quickly for a man

98
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,125
who had both of you in such
a bind, don't you think?

99
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,541
Be quiet!

100
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,875
My spear was this close to
reaching that old geezer's

101
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,708
ugly looking head!

102
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,041
Well, it surprised me.

103
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,625
I'd heard General Huan Yi
was a real military genius,

104
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,166
but I never for a moment

105
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,250
thought he could pull off
something as big as this.

106
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,125
We three are looking
upward at this moment,

107
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,666
and just above us is a wall.

108
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,125
[gasps]

109
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,625
We need to think about
where we go from here,

110
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,291
if only to get over
that big wall above.

111
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,458
Right here is the main
camp with the Qin army's

112
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,458
commanding general
Meng Ao, see?

113
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,208
The central army to
which we all belong

114
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,125
is positioned out
in front of it.

115
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:07,708
To our right is the right flank
led by General Huan Yi,

116
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,625
and on our left is the left
flank led by General Wang Jian.

117
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:17,208
So as you can see, the Wei
army's main camp is around here.

118
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,875
That's where their commanding
general, Bai Guixi is.

119
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,625
Right now, Lian Po
is probably there, too.

120
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,458
Just in front
of their main camp,

121
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,958
and directly facing us, as well,
is their central army base

122
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,916
led by Lun Hu.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,166
They also have their own left
and right flanks as you can see.

124
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,291
This is a very big setup.

125
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,625
Just get to the point now.

126
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,375
[MENG TIAN]
After slaying Xuan Feng,

127
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,958
Huan Yi and his troops up and
vanished from everyone's radar.

128
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,333
Some think he's after
the enemy's main camp,

129
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,791
moving right over here,
but in fact,

130
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,166
he has pulled back to the rear
and is quickly regrouping.

131
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,958
He's regrouping?

132
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,541
Yeah.

133
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:10,166
Xuan Feng truly hated Huan Yi,
but Huan Yi hated Jie Zifang.

134
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,666
General Huan Yi's
main forces were attacked

135
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,541
by Jie Zifang's army,

136
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,458
and lost half their
troops in battle.

137
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,083
Jie Zi-who?

138
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,750
The general who is heading up
the enemy's left flank.

139
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,041
Although if Jie Zifang
has lost track of Huan Yi,

140
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,000
he can't be too rash.

141
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,083
Meanwhile, on the opposite
side of the battlefield,

142
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:35,750
Qiang Yan's right flank troops
have just entered the fray now.

143
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:40,041
I doubt Wang Jian can overcome
them the way things are now.

144
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,250
Correct, right, Wang Ben?

145
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,791
What I mean is, with both
the right and left flanks

146
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,208
in a tight deadlock now,

147
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:51,375
this battle seems to be
going nowhere really fast.

148
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,750
Oh man, I've just had enough
of this right-left talk!

149
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,166
We are fighting Lun Hu,
smack in the middle.

150
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,250
You just don't know anything.
Do you, then?

151
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,791
Say what?!

152
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:08,541
Actually, I do believe that
you're half right, anyway, Xin.

153
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,208
It is very true,
our main problem at hand

154
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,958
is Lun Hu right
in the middle of things.

155
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,833
But the issue is that his
movements are closely tied

156
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,875
to those of the
left and right flanks.

157
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,916
[XIN]
Huh?

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,750
[WANG BEN]
These past three days,

159
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,791
Lun Hu's central army
has waited for either flank

160
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,583
to push back their opponent
while they pull their punches.

161
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,000
[XIN gasps]

162
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:35,166
Since day two, our sheer
dedication to defense,

163
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,583
has helped keep
our casualties low.

164
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,958
It makes sense that Lun Hu,
one of Lian Po's Big Four,

165
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,125
is holding back
at this very moment.

166
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,125
Wait, Wang Ben, did you
look into Lun Hu already?

167
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,500
A little.

168
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,666
I had a Wei captive questioned.

169
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,666
Oh, okay. It figures.

170
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,333
[XIN]
Hey, no fair!

171
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,458
Don't keep me
out of the loop over here!

172
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,208
Lian Po has four generals
right under him

173
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,666
that are known as the Big Four.

174
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,958
All of them have a history of
fighting alongside Lian Po and

175
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,791
are exceptionally powerful.

176
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,041
[MENG TIAN]
Jie Zifang is their leader,

177
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,416
and he has chalked up
over a hundred victories

178
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,208
on his own,
all without Lian Po.

179
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,375
[MENG TIAN] Qiang Yan
is one of the top ten archers

180
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,291
in the Middle Kingdom
and he was the hero

181
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,083
of a state that confronted
the land of Zhao.

182
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,166
He gave Lian Po
his fair share of trouble,

183
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,875
but once his state fell,
Qiang Yan swore his fealty.

184
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,416
Xuan Feng worked as Lian Po's
staff officer for years.

185
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,916
He was talented enough
to serve as the commander

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,875
of the entire Zhao army
due to his cleverness.

187
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,208
So that old guy
was way up there in rank!

188
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,583
Moreover, Xuan Feng also was
the one to teach strategy

189
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,458
to a young Lian Po.

190
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:01,375
Lian Po is mourning Xuan Feng.

191
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,875
Which is why he'll be driven to
go all-out to win this battle.

192
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,500
[XIN gasps]

193
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,041
Finally, this
brings us to Lun Hu,

194
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,791
the man we're currently
facing right now.

195
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,833
If you knew Lian Po's
war records, you'd understand.

196
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,041
Indeed, Lun Hu is without
a doubt the most dangerous

197
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,333
of all of the Big Four.

198
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,916
Whenever Lian Po is
involved in a big battle,

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,125
Lun Hu is always there
getting decisive results.

200
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,458
He's scarily good at
breaking through ranks.

201
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,708
There's no telling how many
main army camps he's attacked.

202
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,250
He even broke through
General Wang Yi's main forces

203
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,416
and landed a
deathly blow to him.

204
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,416
[XIN]
What?

205
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,250
He landed the lethal blow...

206
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,041
...on the mighty Wang Yi?!

207
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,166
I get it now.

208
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,291
Lun Hu has definitely
been holding back on us.

209
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,791
You got that right.

210
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,375
[WANG BEN] If the enemy's
left or right flank

211
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,125
circles behind General Meng Ao
and cuts off his escape route,

212
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,416
Lun Hu can waltz
right in and attack.

213
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,166
Do you think our central army
can stop Lun Hu,

214
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,875
who's fighting in
earnest right now?

215
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,208
[WANG BEN]
Frankly speaking, no.

216
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,125
[XIN]
Uh?

217
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,708
[sighs]

218
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,458
I agree. I guess not.

219
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,166
[XIN]
Now hang on!

220
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,541
What are you really saying here?

221
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,375
Don't be giving up
before the battle's even begun!

222
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,083
Huan Yi beat Xuan Feng

223
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,000
and we're aiming
even higher than that!

224
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,166
We got no business not
going after Lun Hu!

225
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,833
He who landed a blow
on General Wang Yi!

226
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,375
He's way up there!

227
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,875
I say bring it on!

228
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,583
We'll pay it back in spades!

229
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,333
Yeah!

230
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,833
Works out great!

231
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,083
I fought with him first,
so he can definitely be

232
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,750
one of the general's
heads I'm aiming for.

233
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,541
It's perfect!

234
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,875
I'll take the head of Lun Hu,
one of Lian Po's Big Four,

235
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,833
and you can both bet on it!

236
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,708
And then,
I'll shoot up the ranks

237
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,083
leaving you two in the dust!

238
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,291
Anyone is able to talk real big.

239
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,208
You're out of your depth.

240
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,166
Say what?!

241
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,416
[MENG TIAN laughs]

242
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,666
Xin, you are half correct in
this case once again, it seems.

243
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,375
We do have to kill Lun Hu,
who's clearly aiming

244
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,666
to go after
Grandfather's main camp.

245
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,041
However,

246
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:17,250
it certainly won't be in
retaliation for his attack.

247
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,791
So, Meng Tian,
what are you trying to say?

248
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:25,958
If we cannot stop a marauding
Lun Hu, we'll stop his attack.

249
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,125
[MENG TIAN] Meaning we
defeat him right before

250
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,958
he can strike us first,
do you both understand?

251
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,416
[gasps]

252
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,833
Tomorrow, Le Hua Force,
Yu Feng Force,

253
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:41,625
and the Fei Xin Force
all together will kill Lun Hu!

254
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,125
Le Hua Force!

255
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,916
[gasping]

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,250
I truly believe that
our strongest point

257
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,833
is our ability to
handle both precise

258
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:30,541
and cool-headed fighting,
and crude and bloody brawling.

259

The young sir, making a speech?

260
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,208
[LU XIAN]
That's new.

261
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,583
[MENG TIAN] And so today
it'll be the latter.

262
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:43,250
As you know, I'm not fond
of this kind of thing.

263
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,333
But we are currently faced
with something

264
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,875
that only we can achieve.

265
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,041
Therefore, today will be
a battle most deadly!

266
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,458
[POPS] Ah, I see.
So that's what it is.

267
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,833
[LU XIAN] He's got an
important mission for us now.

but I do trust you.

What's that?

What's the Le Hua Force
getting all worked up about?

about the Le Hua Force today.

I don't think that was in

If they're acting on their own,

316
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,666
But if we don't,
we'll fall together.

317
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,708
The Le Hua Force cannot
kill Lun Hu on its own.

318
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,375
The same goes for the
Yu Feng and Fei Xin Forces.

319
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,250
Don't be painting us
with the same brush!

320
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,250
I really think that it's great
that we've been solid rivals

321
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,333
all this time, honestly,

322
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:34,083
but our situation's
changed harshly.

323
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,875
The Yu Feng, Le Hua,
and Fei Xin Forces have taken

324
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,625
three castles altogether,

325
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,833
distinguishing
themselves in war.

326
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,208
But honestly, our fame isn't
exactly ringing through Qin,

327
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,458
much less anywhere else.

328
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,708
[MENG TIAN] And yet,

329
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:55,208
here we are, fighting
against that Lian Po now.

330
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,541
Once the legendary great general
Lian Po joined the battle,

331
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,208
the whole Middle Kingdom
had its eyes on

332
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,500
the Shanyang Offensive's
timely final showdown.

333
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,000
[gasps]

334
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,875
[XIN] The whole
Middle Kingdom... watching us?

335
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,166
[MENG TIAN] However,
we cannot get Lun Hu the way

336
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,916
we've stood so far.

337
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,041
If we don't switch it up,
our commanding general Meng Ao

338
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,083
is simply a sitting
duck, you see.

339
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,333
If anyone decides to go
right after General Meng Ao,

340
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,250
we'll just lose to Lian Po,
who's not even currently

341
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,125
leading the Zhao army,
which he trained himself

342
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,250
and can freely
and easily control,

343
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,041
but the Wei army he
commands as an outsider.

344
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:39,208
The world's greatest general
will be a hot topic.

345
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,625
[growling]

346
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,416
I honestly never thought
I would ever hear those words

347
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,250
come directly out of your
mouth, Meng Tian.

348
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,833
I guess not.

349
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,208
I haven't been as passionate
about that very issue

350
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,916
as you two have been,
I'll admit.

351
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,250
But I'm a different man
this time around.

352
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,333
That I can promise you,
Wang Ben.

353
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,416
[WANG BEN]
Hmm?

354
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
[MENG TIAN]
As I said earlier,

355
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,833
we simply can't afford
to let Meng Ao be killed.

356
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,083
After all, he is my
very dear Grandfather,

357
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,583
as both of you are well aware.

358
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,541
He watches over
his positive grandson.

359
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:31,375
Taking your own private feelings
with you onto the battlefield.

360
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,458
How absurd.

361
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,625
[XIN]
It's not absurd!

362
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,875
Everyone's fighting to protect
something precious,

363
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:43,541
defending their line in the sand
and for what they believe in.

364
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,041
[XIN]
All right, Meng Tian.

365
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,625
The Fei Xin Force is
with you in this now.

366
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,291
We just gotta tell the
entire Middle Kingdom:

367
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:01,541
The leading role in this
whole war is about to be recast!

368
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,541
Well? What about you, Wang Ben?

369
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,666
It depends on our strategy.

370
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,500
[MENG TIAN]
Then let's talk strategy.

371
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:18,125
Firstly, the Le Hua Force goes
after Lun Hu's main camp alone.

372
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,958
Ah, I see.

373
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,333
A wedge formation.

374
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,333
They'll need a
focused breakthrough

375
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,833
if they're coming
after me with so few.

376
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:33,041
Okay, Qin army, show me
how you can pierce through!

377
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,500
[XIN]
Wait a second!

378
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,958
So you're the only ones
who will actually get to go

379
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,708
take down Lun Hu?

380
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,208
[MENG TIAN laughs]

381
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,291
[MENG TIAN] We can't do that.
Hence our plan, remember?

382
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,750
Come on, troops!

383
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,791
[LE HUA SOLDIERS yell]

384
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,208
Focused breakthrough,
on the way!

385
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,083
Garrison in position!

386
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,916
[WEI SOLDIERS yell]

387
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,416
Right now!

388
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,875
[growls]

389
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,875
What's this?

390
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,208
[MENG TIAN] Phase one
of our strategy will be:

391
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:15,333
[MENG TIAN] The Le Hua Force
will not go after Lun Hu!
