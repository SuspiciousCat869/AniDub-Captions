1
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,291
[NARRATOR] One day,

2
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,916
the Qin army units,
chiefly responsible

3
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
for successfully conquering
the Shanyang region,

4
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,375
and the civil servants,

5
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,750
who would oversee
the area's administration,

6
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,250
were gathered together
at Shanyang Castle.

7
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,791
What's the big deal?

8
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,875
Rounding us all up here
when it's too hot for this!

9
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,833
I believe they
must want to thank us

10
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,625
for conquering Shanyang.

11
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,708
But then why are
the civil servants here?

12
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:20,916
It's odd.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,666
Meng Tian, sir,
have you heard anything?

14
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,708
Nothing.

15
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,416
It's... It's the Yu Feng Force!

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,791
[SOLDIERS gasp]

17
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:33,916
[QIN SOLDIER 237B]
The Yu Feng Force that went off

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,833
to conquer Shanggui?
They're back now?

19
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,750
[QIN SOLDIER 237C] There's
their thousand-man commander,

20
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,791
Wang Ben!

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,625
[XIN] Ha! Oh, him.

22
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,541
Finally got around to
conquering his assigned post!

23
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,000
Took him long enough!

24
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,541
[laughs]

25
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,500
That's not it!

26
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,083
The Yu Feng Force
took care of the enemies

27
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,208
at their post right away,

28
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:59,333
then went around conquering
three other places.

29
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,375
What?

30
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,583
[gong sounds]

31
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,916
[XIN] What's with the guys
in black over there?

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,541
[gasps]

33
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,000
Wait, could it be?

34
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,500
Meng Tian, sir, isn't that--

35
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,166
Indeed.
The Imperial Headquarters,

36
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,375
a special convoy linked
to the Qin imperial court.

37
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,750
In other words,

38
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,625
we have important government
officials here today.

39
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,041
That is...

40
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,750
...Lord Changping, and Li Si!

41
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,458
[QIN SOLDIER 237A]
What? The top brass?

42
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,375
[QIN SOLDIER 237B]
The commander-in-chief

43
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,625
on the front lines?

44
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,291
[DIAO] Teacher...

45
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,416
[MENG TIAN]
And behind our teacher

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,333
is the head
administrator, Li Si.

47
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,250
I don't like
the looks of this.

48
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,583
[WANG BEN] So two of
Lü Buwei's Four Pillars

49
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,458
are here in Shanyang?

50
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,833
[LORD CHANGPING] Listen, now,

51
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:11,916
I hereby announce
Qin's plans for Shanyang.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,083
From this very moment onwards,
Shanyang will be only known as

53
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,375
the Dong Commandery
of the great Kingdom of Qin.

54
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:25,166
[CROWD murmurs quietly]

55
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,500
Therefore,

56
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,375
ten thousand Qin residents
will be relocated here.

57
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,333
What? All of them?

58
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,041
The land will be governed
according to the laws of Qin

59
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:40,291
under head administrator Li Si
and his very capable hands.

60
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,333
Those who cannot
accept these changes

61
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,166
will be forcibly
removed at once,

62
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,416
even the current inhabitants.

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,458
[gasps]

64
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,625
[MENG TIAN] There it is.

65
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,541
We must all be fully aware
that the Dong Commandery

66
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,958
is now a Qin territory that
we must defend with our lives,

67
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,291
as it is our land now!

68
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,583
I have said my part.

69
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,166
What in the world is this?

70
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,208
An expression of grit.

71
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,958
Expression of what?

72
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,333
[NARRATOR] Kingdoms stole
territory from one another

73
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,958
throughout this era.

74
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,416
Often, the stolen territories
were re-stolen soon after.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,375
[NARRATOR] The exception,

76
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,458
moving in residents and
making the area a commandery,

77
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:28,000
indicated a strong determination
never to relinquish it.

78
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,875
Making this a national policy
meant it would happen

79
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,291
the next time, as well.

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,333
In short, this proclamation
in the fifth year

81
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,583
of the future
Shi Huangdi's reign

82
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,666
was a declaration
of war to all kingdoms,

83
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,000
showing that Qin was serious
about expanding its territory.

84
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,541
[LI MU] I guess we'll
have to do this, then.

85
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,791
[KAINE] Li Mu, sir.

86
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,291
[LI MU]
General Gongsun Long...

87
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,666
[LI MU]
...prepare to raise an army.

88
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,250
Sir!

89
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,708
[LI MU] Send word to Generals
Wan Ji and Li Bai, as well.

90
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,333
We'll enter war with
a hundred thousand troops.

91
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:11,500
So we are definitely violating
our alliance with Qin, then?

92
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:15,541
No. We will quite
simply attack Yan.

93
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,375
The kingdom of Yan?

94
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:21,125
Sir, you'll be
commanding general?

95
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,625
[LI MU] No.

96
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:27,208
It's about time we finally
gave him a good wake-up call.

97
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,375
[cracking, squishing]

98
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,958
[NARRATOR] It was some time
after Shanyang was reborn

99
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,708
as the Dong Commandery.

100
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,833
Xin and the Fei Xin Force
had been given

101
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,500
a brand new assignment
elsewhere now.

102
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,583
They were to guard Qin's border
with the large land of Chu,

103
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,958
an area always on high alert.

104
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,666
[yelling]

105
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,625
Calm down, Xin.

106
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,041
This is just what being
a border guard is all about.

107
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,541
[XIN] Oh man!

108
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,416
But those Chu guys are really
ticking me off, you know!

109
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
If they're gonna sneak over
every day to check up on us,

110
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,250
why not attack us already?

111
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,541
[WEI PING] I know
just how you feel, but--

112
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,541
Bad news!

113
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,333
What's happening, Yuan?

114
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,375
Did Chu make a move now?

115
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,625
[YUAN]
Xin, Chu won't be attacking

116
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,916
at a dreadful
time like this!

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,500
Then what exactly
is the bad news, then?

118
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,333
It's Pang Nuan!
He's back again!

119
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,416
What? What did you say?

120
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,708
[XIN] Pang Nuan is back
as commanding general?

121
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,083
[DIAO] Yes, definitely.

122
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,208
Just like in MNyáng,
he's the commanding general,

123
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:50,125
with Li Mu behind him actually
controlling the army, too.

124
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,916
All of their troops have already
met with the Yan army by now.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,458
[WEI PING] All their troops?

126
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,416
[XIN] Pang Nuan...

127
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,833
[DIAO]
The Yan army has the same:

128
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,083
One hundred thousand troops.

129
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,750
[XIN] One hundred thousand
versus one hundred thousand?

130
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,041
That's a massive battle
to whip up out of nowhere.

131
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,958
[DIAO] Just as Qin
attacked Shanyang in Wei,

132
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,333
Zhao must want to strike
their own sworn enemies

133
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,416
while the alliance is
still in effect, you see.

134
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,250
[XIN] I get it.

135
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,291
Li Mu did say sometime before
that the Qin-Zhao alliance

136
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,416
would let them
focus on fighting Yan.

137
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,750
Hey, Diao!

138
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,583
What's this Yan
place like, anyway?

139
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,541
It's a riddle
wrapped up in an enigma.

140
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,375
Yan is far from Qin
on the eastern coast.

141
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,916
It has no battle
records over decades.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,708
We don't know what kind
of commanders they have.

143
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,500
But they do have one great
general whose name is known

144
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,375
throughout the Middle Kingdom.

145
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,583
Say what?
Just who is this--this general?

146
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,791
Ju Xin.

147
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,291
Forty years ago,
when Qi had Yan cornered,

148
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,208
he and the late
war hero, Yue Yi,

149
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,416
pushed and pushed Qi
all the way back

150
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,916
to the brink of
ultimate destruction.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,375
And he is one
of theirs, isn't he?

152
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,208
[DIAO] Yeah.

153
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,208
He was originally from Zhao.

154
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,833
Had he stayed,
he would have been

155
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:16,333
one of that era's Three Greats,
along with Lian Po.

156
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,625
One of the Three Greats
of Lian Po's era.

157
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,333
But Zhao's got Li Mu
and Pang Nuan, right?

158
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,458
That's one tangled-up battle,
all right.

159
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,958
[XIN] Yeah.

160
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,666
No matter who wins,

161
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,750
it isn't gonna be over
and done with that easily.

162
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,791
[NARRATOR] Word of the
sudden large-scale battle

163
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,333
between Zhao and Yan

164
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,500
rocked Xin deep down
to his very soul.

165
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,000
[NARRATOR] In the meantime,
the pointless standoff with Chu

166
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,375
would go on for three
more days, unfortunately.

167
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,583
I-Is it really
all true, then?

168
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:02,083
[DIAO] Well, actually,
we just got word ourselves that

169
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,708
the battle between Zhao
and Yan has been decided.

170
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,291
What'd you say?

171
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,833
One hundred thousand versus one
hundred thousand and it's done?

172
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,125
[DIAO]
That's not the half of it!

173
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,875
It just took one day.

174
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,875
It was over in exactly one day.

175
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,500
But how did it end, exactly?

176
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,166
[DIAO] Apparently Li Mu's
tactics had the Yan army

177
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,125
at Zhao's mercy at first.

178
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,208
However, then came
the great Ju Xin,

179
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,833
who saw through Li Mu's tactics
and launched a counterstrike.

180
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,875
But Zhao ultimately
had Pang Nuan to play.

181
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,333
[laughing]

182
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,458
Oh, he's one-handed?

183
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:28,375
[grunting]

184
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,958
[XIN] So it came down to
a duel between the generals,

185
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,958
and so Pang Nuan ultimately
beat Yan's general Ju Xin.

186
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,125
That guy is a total monster,
through and through!

187
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,916
Li Mu got his battle with Yan
in the end, just as he said.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,375
Of course,
it's really far from over.

189
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,791
So they'll be coming
for Qin next, correct?

190
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,000
Exactly.

191
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,208
The alliance
remains in effect still,

192
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,041
but Zhao is getting
antsy right now.

193
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,375
It looks like Chu is
about to make a move.

194
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,833
You understand
why we were assigned

195
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,541
to guard the border now?

196
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,791
Something...
very evil could happen

197
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,958
at any moment, you see.

198
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,333
[XIN] Are we gonna
end up fighting Chu?

199
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,208
Maybe not right away,
I don't think.

200
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,083
But Chu is huge.

201
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,708
Their territory truly is
about the size

202
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,125
of six kingdoms combined.

203
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,041
One is as big as six?

204
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,458
It's that big?

205
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,291
[DIAO] To be honest,
even the size of their military

206
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:30,041
is just beyond all
our wildest imaginations.

207
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,041
But isn't that weird?

208
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,708
If they are that strong,

209
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,875
how come they haven't
attacked us, then?

210
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,333
Because their sheer size
also turns out to be

211
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,083
what holds them back.

212
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,458
Chu is so broad,

213
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,541
they share borders with Qin,
Han, Wei, Zhao and Qi,

214
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,625
a full five kingdoms.

215
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,250
[DIAO] They have no choice
but to be prudent

216
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,791
when it comes to invasions.

217
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:55,583
If they attack, they may
well be attacked themselves.

218
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,958
I understand.

219
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,333
So when you're that big,
you just can't move so fast.

220
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,333
That being said, though,

221
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,916
word is they have
the power ready

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,291
to crush any kingdom that does
decide to attack them anyway.

223
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,666
Which is why everyone's
been avoiding a full-on battle

224
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,416
with Chu all this time.

225
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,416
But so doesn't that
mean that we won't ever

226
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,583
battle with Chu, either, then?

227
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,875
[DIAO] No.

228
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,708
The Qin army headquarters
have drawn up a plan

229
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,500
and are working on a strategy
for a huge battle with Chu.

230
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,958
The Dong Commandery
proclamation is proof

231
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,750
that those plans
are coming along.

232
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,875
[WEI PING] Seriously?

233
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,625
[NARRATOR] However, the Chu army
made no discernible moves,

234
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,583
and Xin's squadron received
no new orders, either.

235
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,458
[yawning]

236
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,500
Hey, look up!

237
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,125
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237B]
Shift's over, finally!

238
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,458
[XIN snoring]

239
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:02,375
[laughing softly]

240
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,916
[DIAO screams]

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,416
Hey why are you sleeping
over here, then?

242
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,750
And... And not only that,
but this, too--

243
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,000
Huh? Yeah, why am I...?

244
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,916
Was I sleepwalking?

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,291
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,166
"Sorry"?
I'll give you "sorry"!

247
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,375
[XIN yells]

248
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,375
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237C] Good
morning there, Tactician Diao!

249
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,458
Good morning!

250
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,625
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237D]
Good morning!

251
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,000
[DIAO] It's been more
than three months

252
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,500
since I became the tactician
of the Fei Xin Force.

253
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,791
I'm pretty used to
the place already, I'd say.

254
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,208
Even though I'm a woman,

255
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,458
there's been no
funny business happening,

256
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,541
likely because
I'm Xin's good friend.

257
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,583
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237F]
Ah!

258
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,666
You gotta get on
my case first thing?

259
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,041
[DIAO] These guys are
foulmouthed and boorish,

260
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,166
exactly like Xin is.

261
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,625
But I'm comfortable
being here, regardless.

262
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,875
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237H]
Hey!

263
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,166
Bunch of dummies.

264
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,541
[laughs]

265
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,166
He Liao Diao.

266
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,333
Are there new orders?

267
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,625
Indeed, at last.

268
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,291
[NARRATOR] The Fei Xin Force
had guarded the Chu border

269
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,750
for three months when
they finally received

270
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,458
their new orders.

271
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,625
They were relieved of
their border-guard duties

272
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,500
and sent to the far east,
to a castle town named Dongjin.

273
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,958
[NARRATOR] Just as the
Qin army left the border,

274
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,458
so did the Chu army...

275
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,958
...almost as if
by common agreement.

276
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,833
[DIAO] This isn't good.

277
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,333
What's up there, Diao?

278
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,333
Already, we're someplace
that's not on the map.

279
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:42,125
This is unexplored
territory for the Qin Army.

280
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,250
I suppose that puts us
on the front lines

281
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,875
of an eastward invasion.

282
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,250
Proceed with caution.

283
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,500
The Wei, Zhao, and Chu borders
converge right here, you see.

284
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,625
We don't know
who might show up now.

285
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,875
[XIN] Okay.

286
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:58,958
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237J]
All troops, be on alert!

287
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,375
Proceed with caution!

288
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,958
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237K]
We need more scouts!

289
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,291
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237L] Keep an
eye on the brush to the left!

290
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,916
And with us here
right on the outside, guys.

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,500
You said you wanted
to be on the edges!

292
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,666
And found the middle too hot!

293
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,625
Just quit yammering at me
from the side like that, okay?

294
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,916
[rustling noise]

295
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,291
A-An enemy?

296
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,250
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

297
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,291
What? Was that Wei Ping?

298
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,041
Now, wait a second,
Wei Ping! Look there!

299
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:24,583
Huh?

300
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,708
[rustling noise]

301
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,791
Help me, please...

302
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,833
[QING] Hey! Guys!

303
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,250
[WEI PING] Get Xin!

304
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,041
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 237M]
Watch for enemies!

305
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,250
You awake?

306
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,000
Drink this slowly.

307
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,625
[XIN] What happened?

308
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:57,541
Walled town in Xu.
Attacked by... Han army.

309
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,625
--Han.
--Han.

310
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,625
Han, huh?

311
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,875
Someplace we haven't fought yet.

312
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,708
Do you know this Xu, Diao?

313
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,083
No, I've never heard of it.

314
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,625
Hey, Xu belongs to Chu,
or Wei, or Zhao?

315
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,875
Whose is it?

316
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:17,708
It is nobody's at all
because Xu is a country.

317
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,541
I come from Xu, you see.

318
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,583
I'm Xiu, that's my name.

319
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,875
What is he talking about?

320
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,750
But no such place exists!

321
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,750
No, wait a sec.

322
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,583
The Middle Kingdom
once consisted

323
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,958
of about over a
hundred kingdoms,

324
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:36,166
which merged over 500 years
into seven kingdoms.

325
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,250
But I've heard that
some tiny mountain kingdoms

326
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,583
avoided being absorbed
by those seven,

327
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,958
and could still be out there
as we speak, hanging on.

328
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,916
So this Xu place...

329
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,166
You're saying it's not
that far from here, then?

330
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,916
[XIU] Please. Please help.

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,125
They will kill
everyone in their sight.

332
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,333
Please, my... my mother.

333
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,666
Save her, please.

334
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,166
[XIU sobbing]

335
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,208
You sure this is okay,
acting alone?

336
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,041
But what about
Dongjin, then, huh?

337
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,333
Of course it's not okay.

338
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,458
It's a clear violation
of orders!

339
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,416
Lieutenant!

340
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,166
I know.

341
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,208
But this is one of the
better things about Xin.

342
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,458
You lead the way
from now on, okay?

343
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,208
I... will, then.

344
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,750
You got a problem
with this, Diao?

345
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,000
[DIAO] Of course I don't.

346
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,208
[NARRATOR] Here, our story will
take a step backward in time,

347
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,708
its stage shifting to the
Qin capital, Xianyang.

348
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,083
The Fei Xin Force
had just taken on guard duty

349
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,333
at the Chu border,

350
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,416
and something big
was happening in Xianyang.

351
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,250
[CIVIL SERVANT 237A]
Report!

352
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,416
The houses of Gao Li and Lin

353
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,083
now side with
Lü Buwei's faction!

354
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,208
[CIVIL SERVANT 237B]
As does the Yue Zhuo clan!

355
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,166
[CIVIL SERVANT 237C] Yu Bai Shi
went from a neutral position

356
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,458
to side with the minister!

357
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,833
Hmm...
I expected this, and yet...

358
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,291
It has escalated so fast.

359
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,000
[NARRATOR]
When Lü Buwei's relationship

360
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,125
with the Queen Dowager
came to light,

361
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,833
his faction lost
some of its power.

362
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,833
Now, however, they
were suddenly starting to rally.

363
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,333
Meanwhile, powerful
allies left Zheng's side

364
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,458
one after another quite rapidly.

365
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:30,166
Behind all of this were the
active machinations of Lü Buwei.

366
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,208
[NARRATOR] He then sent out
a man to the Queen Dowager--

367
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,916
A man she found infatuating.

368
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,083
[NARRATOR] In this way,

369
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,291
Lü Buwei maintained a
relationship with her in secret

370
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,833
while riding out their scandal.

371
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,166
Consequently, his ties
to the Inner Palace

372
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,666
grew stronger than ever before.

373

[footsteps approaching]

374
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,291
[LÜ BUWEI]
Oh, it's you, Li Si!

375
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,583
For you to somehow
regain so much power

376
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,000
as you have right now,

377
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,583
while Lord Changping and I
were both away for awhile,

378
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,791
I am truly astonished.

379
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,875
[chuckles]

380
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,833
[LI SI] And yet,
the deep involvement

381
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,416
of the Inner Palace's power

382
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,166
could well be considered
a double-edged sword.

383
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,625
What is this?

384
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,708
You're angry I made my move
without telling you?

385
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,583
This is about nothing
so childish as that.

386
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,250
[laughs]

387
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,833
Forgive me, forgive me.

388
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,125
In my own way I meant
only to be mindful

389
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,875
of how very busy you are.

390
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:46,250
That, and well, this was also
just desserts in a fun way.

391
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,166
But enough of that.

392
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,250
It's settled now.

393
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,625
Now, to let out some
of my pent-up frustrations.

394
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,083
Li Si?

395
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,125
[LI SI] Sir.

396
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,791
I think it's time to
graduate from being a minister.

397
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,208
Sir?

398
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,625
[NARRATOR]
A short while later,

399
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,625
Lü Buwei moved above
his post as minister

400
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,958
to become Chancellor of State.

401
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,166
This was the highest
office possible,

402
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,500
with only the king
right above it.

403
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,375
[NARRATOR] Although the
position had always been vacant,

404
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:24,666
Lü Buwei used his faction's
might to claim it for himself.

405
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,166
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
Zheng and his court

406
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,041
could not stop this outrage.

And after we'd come so far!

409

Thanks to the
Inner Palace's power,

410

back Lü Buwei's faction.

[CIVIL SERVANT 237B]
Now I suppose we'll have to

our chance at victory
will be delayed again.

We must keep pace
with their power,

regardless of what
this may entail!
