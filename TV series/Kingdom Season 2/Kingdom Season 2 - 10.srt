1
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,791
My Lord Zheng.

2
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:45,083
No one else will
become a greater king,

3
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:49,875
having experienced the
hardships that you have.

4
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:53,333
And so then, I am certain.

00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,708
[gasps]

6
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:58,041
You will be a greater king

7
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,166
than anyone else has ever been.

8
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,583
[ZHENG]
Zi Xia!

9
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,458
Darn it! Darn it!

10
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:11,916
[ZI XIA]
Lord Zheng, your face.

11
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,750
[ZI XIA]
Your demons have left you now!

12
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:25,000
Your eyes, they're so
beautiful now.

13
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:34,083
[ZHENG sobs]
Zi Xia!

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,916
After Zi Xia breathed her last,

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,875
and I'd crossed
the border to Qin

16
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,791
with Lord Changwen
and his troops,

17
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,625
a sharp pain ran
through my left hand.

18
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,583
Pain had returned to me.

19
00:02:55,666 --> 00:03:00,708
And not only pain,
but taste, smell, all senses.

20
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:06,291
The human body is a
truly mysterious thing.

21
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,958
[XIANG sobs]

22
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,791
[ZHENG] I have never
spoken of Zi Xia before.

23
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:18,416
I truly thought I would never
speak of her in my life.

24
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,166
So then, why now?

25
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,708
[ZHENG sighs]

26
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:29,583
Something maybe is just,
changing within me,

27
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,333
once again, I think.

28
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,875
[gasps]

29
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:58,791
[XIANG] Zi Xia's story
was just so very shocking.

30
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,708
How hard it must have been
on His Highness all this time.

31
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:09,125
Someone so special
dying before his eyes.

32
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,833
[YANG]
Good morning, Xiang!

33
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,958
[XIANG]
Oh, Yang. Good morning.

34
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,625
Have you just come from
His Highness's chamber, then?

35
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,791
[XIANG]
Mm...

36
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:25,333
Oh? What's wrong, Xiang?
You seem down.

37
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,916
Huh? No, not at all.

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,541
It's just--

39
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,583
[YANG gasps]
Ha, ha, I understand.

40
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,208
Let me guess. His Highness
hates you now?

41
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:44,250
[gasps] Come on!
What is it really, though?

42
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,416
I am so sorry, Yang.

43
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I don't want to worry you.

44
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,583
Oh...

45
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,833
[XIANG]
But I'm all right now.

46
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:57,041
After all I do have you,
am I right?

47
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,666
[YANG]
Mh-mm!

48
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,833
[XIANG]
Yang?

49
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,000
[YANG]
Hmm?

50
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:07,666
[XIANG] I know I can't
say that I love His Highness.

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,541
Especially right now.

52
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,708
Eh?

53
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,250
[XIANG]
After hearing all about Zi Xia,

54
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:23,458
how could I confess my love
for him so incredibly hastily?

55
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,166
Hey, Xiang?

56
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,083
I just want to
help His Highness

57
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,041
in whatever small way
that I possibly can.

58
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,083
That's all, really.

59
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,375
[YANG] She really does
love him badly,

60
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,291
doesn't she, now?

61
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,416
[XIN]
Well, well, well.

62
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,791
Man, will you all
get a load of this!

63
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,958
[NARRATOR]
In the fifth year of

64
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,375
the future Shi Huangdi's reign,

65
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,833
the Kingdom of Qin
dispatched an army

66
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,916
of over 200,000
to conquer the area

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,166
around Shanyang
in the Kingdom of Wei.

68
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,791
This key military
and transport region

69
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:15,250
was to be taken over and
subsequently annexed to Qin.

70
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,875
[QIN SOLDIERS cheer]

71
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,083
[NARRATOR] The commanding
general assigned to this

72
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,250
grand operation was
the famed Bai Lao of Qin,

73
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,291
General Meng Ao.

74
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,958
[laughs] Do not get
too worked up.

75
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,000
That's how you get hurt.

76
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:36,208
[NARRATOR] General Meng Ao
divided the troops into three,

77
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,958
to be led by himself
and by his two lieutenants.

78
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,166
These three armies
would carry out

79
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,583
a carefully coordinated
invasion thereafter.

80
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,083
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Xin and his Fei Xin Force

81
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,041
were at the front
of the main army,

82
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,916
led by General Meng Ao himself.

83
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,208
[XIN chuckles] That's typical
Meng Ao for all you guys!

84
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,375
Now he really understands
the true power

85
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,250
of the great Fei Xin Force!

86
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,916
We had some pretty
crazy campaigns

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,250
along the way, though.

88
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,708
I really believe
that all those

89
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,666
piecemeal victories paid off!

90
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,083
[TIAN YONG]
Yeah!

a lucky bunch

to have made it up
to the main ranks.

Just look at them
looking all tough now,

aren't they, sir?

Why, these poor little peons

00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,750
will now be bragging
about this feat

106

for years and years to come!

Hm.

The upcoming battle
is greater than

every single skirmish that you
have fought so far, you see.

114
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,250
Greater even than the battle

115
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,041
you participated with
Zhao two years ago.

116
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,125
A real honest-to-goodness war.

117
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,291
An ant who flexes
his muscles out there

118
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,541
will soon be trampled.

119
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:30,250
That also goes for
your soldiers as well.

120
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,833
Be very careful.

121

You should know
the biggest victories

00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,125
in this war will be won
by the Fei Xin Force!

to request prompt assistance
with regards to this matter,

[COURTIERS gasping, murmuring]

Because there's no turning back
afterwards, Minister Lü.

If I'm discovered,
my head will roll.

And having come all the way
into the Inner Palace,

you are prepared, too, madam.

223
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,458
For all of the power
of the Inner Palace

224
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,125
that you solely control,

225
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,291
for you to now be
aligned with me, Lü Buwei.

226
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,708
It is truly a grotesque
and hostile act

in your son,

00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,333
[XIANG] D-Did he just say
the power of the Inner Palace

231
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,916
would align with
Minister Lü? Oh no.

[XIANG] But why? Isn't she
on His Highness's side?

234
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:54,250
The Queen Dowager
is his mother after all!

[QUEEN DOWAGER laughs]

236
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,541
Don't give Zheng
another thought.

237
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,291
As it happens,
I just met with him.

238
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,708
Just as a little test,
mind you, of course.

239
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,083
So I could really see if

240
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,708
a single spark
of maternal feelings

241
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,583
was alight within me
after everything

242
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,125
was said and done, you see.

243
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,500
Oh?

244
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,166
But it was just as I thought.

245
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,083
I felt nothing.

246
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,125
His face and his
words, his eyes.

247
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,500
I felt not a single thing.

248
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,666
With the exception
of complete apathy.

No. Oh no!

Whatever happens to Zheng

251
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,541
is no business of mine.

252
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,416
[XIANG]
That's her own flesh and blood

253
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,916
that she's talking about!

254
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,458
I thought it was very strange
when I heard that the heads of

255
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,791
all the three royal families,

256
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,125
usually so averse
to the spotlight,

had gone all this way
to see the king.

258
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,833
So, all of this
commotion was purely

259
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,250
just in order to
try to lure me into

260
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,583
the Inner Palace again
wasn't it then?

261

[QUEEN DOWAGER laughs]

262
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,541
I have cursed no man
more than I have you.

263
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,291
Hated no man more
than you, as well.

264
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:25,083
And yet, somehow, no man
excites me more than you,

265
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,291
excite me truly. I'll admit it.

This, too, may change.

00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:51,125
this woman truly
sparkled beyond anyone.

270
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,583
So many people gathered,

271
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,666
even from distant towns just
to catch a glimpse of her

272
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,500
as she danced
truly bewitchingly.

273
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,041
[LÜ BUWEI]
This peerless beauty brimming

274
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,541
with innocence and grace,
was beloved by all,

275
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:11,000
praised as the Jewel
of all of Handan.

276
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:15,791
Now she is but a shadow
of her former self.

277
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,541
Was it all my doing, maybe?

278

to me ever again, okay?

[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Seventeen years ago,

282
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:46,708
I was at the
very height of happiness.

283
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,750
[QUEEN DOWAGER] Because of
a man named Lü Buwei,

284
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,375
with whom I exchanged
heartfelt promises

285
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,875
to love and accompany
for a lifetime,

286
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,458
I never had any doubt
that my future would be

anything but happiness.

288
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:08,375
I truly believed
this with all my heart.

289
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,416
But one day,
you decided to bring me

290
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,291
to meet a royal
from a foreign land.

291
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,833
And you said to me--

[LÜ BUWEI]
"Jewel of Handan.

As of today, this is
the man you shall love."

294
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,291

Our love, our promise,

[QUEEN DOWAGER] All illusions!
Nothing more, truly.

297
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,666
I knew, even then,
all young and naive,

298
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,791
that you had put
everything you owned

299
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,750
into Zi Chu of Qin.

300
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,291
You and your
money drove Zi Chu

301
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,875
right into Qin's royal throne,

302
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,166
for which you
made him promise you

303
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,666
the coveted position
of becoming minister.

304
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,875
You made me just a mere tool

305
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:12,166
in your own rise
to power, Lü Buwei!

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,583
That's exactly right.
I make no excuse.

307

[XIANG gasps]

308
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,833
That is a relief.

309
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,250
If you were the kind of man

310
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,500
who'd make excuses now,
I'd just be completely forced

311
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:36,708
to give you up as well,
and that'd be a problem.

312
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,958
The joke is on the
king's faction solely,

313
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,333
I would have to say, then.

00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,000
So then, you and I can,

321
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:07,166
those lovers from
seventeen years ago,

322
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,791
can take over
that foreign land of Qin

323
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,791
and get that
happy ending after all.

324
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,708

[XIANG sobs]

326
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,875
The Queen Dowager
and Minister Lü,

327
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,416
were at one point
really lovers?

328
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,541
I don't quite understand.

329
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:38,291
But I feel something
quite dreadful

330
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,791
is about to happen.

331
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,083
I've got to tell
His Highness now!

332
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,083

[XIANG gasps]

337
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:04,833
[XIANG] I've got to...
tell His Highness.

338
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,541
[YANG yawns]

339
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,208
My turn for morning
clean-up again, huh?

340
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,458
That's it!

341
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,375
What's this?

342
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,375
[gasps]

343
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,750
[YANG]
Xi--Xiang!

344
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:02,250
Xiang? Xiang!

345
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,166
[YANG gapss]
Blood.

346
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,333
Stay with me!
You have to, Xiang!

347
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:14,125
Xiang. Xiang! Xiang? Xiang!

348
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,125
Somebody? Anybody, please!

349
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,083
Xiang!
