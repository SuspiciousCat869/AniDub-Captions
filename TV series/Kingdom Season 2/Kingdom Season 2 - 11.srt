1
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,541
[NARRATOR] Front-line
preparations were complete

2
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,666
for a major Wei offensive.

3
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,625
[NARRATOR] The Fei Xin Force
stood at the front

4
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:50,083
of the main army, led by
commanding general Meng Ao,

5
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,666
and Xin waited impatiently
for the battle to finally begin,

6
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,791
to rack up more victories
and get ever closer

7
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,708
to becoming one of the
world's greatest generals!

8
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,333
Meanwhile, in the
capital Xianyang,

9
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,875
Zheng asked his mother,

10
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,333
the Queen Dowager,
for her assistance.

11
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,791
In its public response,
the Inner Palace sent

12
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,875
the heads of their three
royal patron families.

13
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,708
Yet in private, the Queen
Dowager was colluding

14
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,666
with Zheng's archenemy,
Lü Buwei,

15
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,166
in a calculated plot
to betray the King.

16
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,708
[NARRATOR] Court lady Xiang

17
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,000
just happened to
witness their meeting,

18
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,750
and was gravely
wounded at the hands

19
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,375
of a eunuch bodyguard.

20
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,250
[LÜ BUWEI] Take a route
where we won't be seen.

21
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,625
Y-Yes sir!

22
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,500
[LÜ BUWEI] No one knows
about any of this but you.

23
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,250
This goes without saying,
but do not tell a soul.

24
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,041
I-I understand sir.

25
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,708
[LÜ BUWEI] Dear me.
I came to draw upon

26
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,833
the Inner Palace's power,

27
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,750
but to meet secretly
with the Queen Dowager

28
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,541
where men are forbidden?
[chuckles]

29
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,875
Perhaps I indulged a little too
much, if I do say so myself.

30
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:25,208
[XIANG labored breathing]

31
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,416
[NARRATOR] The Inner Palace
physicians kept Xiang

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,208
from losing too much blood,

33
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,708
but her high fever remained,
and on the second day,

34
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:36,708
she still hovered on the border
between life and death.

35
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,625
[XIANG labored breathing]

36
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:43,291
Oh, Xiang. It will be okay.

37
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,458
It is all going to be okay.

38
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,666
We have done everything
we can do for her, Yang.

39
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,166
Most likely, she only
has until evening.

40
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,500
[gasps]

41
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,750
The Queen Dowager's
personal physician

42
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:01,333
may be of some help, but far
be it from us to ask for it.

43
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,041
There is nothing
else that we can do.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,083
[DOCTOR A]
Prepare yourself now, Yang.

45
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,500
Oh... No...

46
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,833
[sobs]

47
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:23,250
[YANG] It can't...
be the end... Xiang. [cries]

48
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,333
...ness.

49
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,333
Oh...

50
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,041
Eh? Huh?!

51
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:40,208
Oh... H-His. High...
ness... Oh...

52
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,791
Oh! Xiang!

53
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:46,250
His... H-Highness... Uh...

54
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:51,500
His. His High... ness.

55
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,125
[YANG] Xiang! [gasps]

56
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,708
[cries]

57
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,541
[YANG] I'm sorry, Bai Chun.

58
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,000
[footsteps, door closes]

59
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,041
[ZHENG] Hmm?

60
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:21,083
[YANG] I am not Bai Chun.
My name is really Yang.

61
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:25,625
I-I have sidelined a lady,
vital to the kingdom,

62
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:30,833
which I fully understand is a
greater offense than any other.

63
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,541
A-And for which crime I-I...

64
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,458
...willingly accept
any punishment.

65
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,125
Just... Please,
Your Highness. Please.

66
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,125
Please just help
Xiang immediately!

67
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,500
Otherwise, she will
surely die soon!

68
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,083
[ZHENG] Hmm...

69
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,333
[YANG] Xiang has gotten tangled
up in something I think,

70
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,833
and was hurt in the stomach.

71
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,458
She's been
unconscious for hours,

72
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,875
but the entire time she has...

73
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,458
...been calling
for Your Highness!

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,333
[YANG] I know my request
is an unreasonable one,

75
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,541
but please.,. please help Xiang.

76
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:20,458
Please save her.
Will you, please? [sobs]

77
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,625
[ZHENG] Xiang has spoken
of you from time to time.

78
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,875
This unconventional
course of action fits

79
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:26,958
with what I've heard.

80
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,833
[YANG gasps]

81
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,375
[door opens]

82
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,666
[ZHENG] Wake Jing Ling
and her team of physicians!

83
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,416
I'll explain later!

84
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,916
[RETAINERS] Sire!

85
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,791
[ZHENG] Dry your tears, Yang.

86
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,666
[YANG] Ah.

87
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,583
We are going to help Xiang.

88
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,208
[XIANG moans]

89
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,458
Xiang, stay with us, now!

90
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,666
[DOCTOR B] Xiang!

91
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,708
It is amazing that
she is still alive at all.

92
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,208
Where'd that Yang
run off to, anyway?

93
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,458
[door opens]

94
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,458
Yang! Where on earth have you--

95
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,833
[gasps]

96
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,916
[DOCTOR A] Your Highness!

97
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,333
You may leave the
rest to us now, doctor.

98
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,291
[NARRATOR]
The medical team Zheng brought

99
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,625
with him were experts

100
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,083
in every field of ancient
Middle Kingdom medicine.

101
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,083
They tended to
Xiang with the best

102
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:25,875
of all the medical skills
they had at their disposal.

103
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,291
However...

104
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,458
[gasps]

105
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,791
[YANG]
How... is Xiang doing?

106
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,041
She is alive for the moment,

107
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,791
but she still
straddles the border

108
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,791
between our world and the next.

109
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,833
It is best for her to sleep
and get some rest right now,

110
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,875
but no matter how much
medicated vapor we use,

111
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,791
nothing takes.

112
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,791
Why not?

113
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,291
It seems that there is something

114
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,791
she desperately needs
to tell Your Highness now.

115
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,958
[ZHENG]
Huh?

116
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,083
[JING LING]
And her will is great enough

117
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,541
to resist the
effect of any drug.

118
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,833
Please hear what she has to say.

119
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,166
If she doesn't sleep soon,
her life will be in danger.

120
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:18,500
[XIANG breathes heavily]

121
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,833
You... Y-Your Highness.

122
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:29,791
[ZHENG sighs] Well,
you've done good Xiang.

123
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,250
What happened?

124
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,666
Uh...

125
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,541
Had something to say?

126
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,583
Quickly now, or your
health may suffer.

127
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:45,250
Ah. Uhn...

128
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,125
I-I am deeply sorry

129
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:53,000
that I must be the one to
deliver such difficult news.

130
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,625
Hmm...

131
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,375
The Queen Dowager
and Minister Lü Buwei...

132
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,250
...are both secretly together!

133
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,875
[ZHENG shocked]
What?!

134
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,625
[XIANG]
The Inner Palace's offer

135
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,458
that they would be
Your Highness's ally...

136
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,041
...was a lie.

137
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,875
[XIANG] And that's
not all, I'm afraid...

138
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,666
Much before Your Highness
was even born to this world,

139
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,208
the two of them
were also engaged.

140
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:33,333
And last night, the Queen
Dowager and the Minister

141
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,458
most likely spent the
night with one another.

142
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,958
Forgive me, please,
for this news.

143
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,666
I thought it was very important.

144
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,166
Oh please...
Y-Your Highness, forgive me.

145
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,541
[whimpers]

146
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,916
You have done very well, Xiang.

147
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:04,875
You probably have helped
by saving my life as well.

148
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,416
I thank you.

149
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,458
I'm happy right now
to have helped.

150
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,958
Now I can sleep.

151
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:22,791
I have been so very tired
for so long. I feel...

152
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,833
[ZHENG growls]

153
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,666
[ZHENG]
Mother and Lü Buwei...

154
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,375
[ZHENG]
What's she driving at,

155
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,916
taking Lü Buwei
as her companion?

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,666
The two of them, betrothed?

157
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,250
[ZHENG]
So all of this odd behavior

158
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,416
was just to draw out Lü Buwei.

159
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,583
And her meeting with me

160
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,250
was likely to make sure
she had no maternal feelings.

161
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:18,166
[ZHENG]
No... I'm hardly surprised.

162
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,791
You have forever been
like that, Mother.

163
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,500
You haven't changed one
bit ever since I was born.

164
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,666
You can't change.

165
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,791
You're still...
in that deep darkness.

166
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:40,916
[ZHENG]
I... changed when I left Handan.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,583
I have allies in whom
I place all my trust.

168
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,791
[ZHENG]
Your antics will not shake me,

169
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,416
not at this point.

170
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,041
[grunts] Lü Buwei...

171
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,666
...made a pretty huge misstep!

172
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,166
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, as the Qin army

173
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,875
approached the
first castle, Gaolang,

174
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,166
General Meng Ao began
readying his troops for war.

175
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,250
First, they would
divide into four

176
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,708
to attack the castle
from all sides,

177
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,041
and each team would
have its own reserves.

178
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,791
These reserves would serve

179
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,750
as floating reinforcements,
and could be called upon

180
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,833
to clinch the fight
for Qin as needed.

181
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,500
The Fei Xin Force
wound up in the front

182
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,500
of those reserves,
right where they wanted to be,

183
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,000
but Wang Ben's Yu Feng Force
was further forward,

184
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,583
having nabbed
the coveted front line.

185
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,625
Thus, the reserves'
highest hopes were pinned

186
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:51,291
completely on the shoulders
of the Yu Feng Force.

187
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,416
Darn it! Of course
they'd be ahead of us!

188
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,166
And they're a cavalry.

189
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,125
We'll never be able
to keep up with them

190
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,708
when it counts most!

191
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,166
[MENG TIAN laughs]

192
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,708
Huh?

193
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,541
[MENG TIAN] Things sure are
getting heated over here, huh?

194
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,333
Lighten up would you?

195
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,958
We're in for the long haul.

196
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,416
[XIN]
What's with that dude?

197
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,833
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry!

198
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,291
I didn't even introduce
myself, and I'm up here.

199
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,416
I am actually the commander
of a 300-man squad, too.

200
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,791
It's called the Le Hua Force.
Do you know it?

201
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,708
[CHONG YUAN]
The Le Hua Force?

202
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,416
Lieutenant Yuan,
isn't Le Hua Force the--

203
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,083
Oh, yes.

204
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,041
[YUAN]
The 300-man squad that managed

205
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,333
to score frontline
victories just south of us.

206
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,083
[YUAN] Their leader is
rumored to be capable

207
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,125
of commanding 1,000,

208
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,541
though he's also
no older than Xin.

209
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,333
[XIN]
The Le Hua Force?

210
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,500
No idea.

211
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,958
Who are you, and
what's with the getup?

212
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,208
[MENG TIAN chuckles]

213
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,041
[POPS]
Meng Tian sir!

214
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,416
Huh?

215
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,166
Just what are you doing
all the way over there, now?

216
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,750
[MENG TIAN]
Hey, Pops!

217
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,250
[XIN]
Meng Tian?

218
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,208
Look, Pops! It's the
whole Fei Xin Force.

219
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,125
I was just saying hello.

220
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,208
Right?

221
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,291
A fellow akin squad,
just like us,

222
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,916
in the same position
of the same reserves!

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,333
I thought us commanders
should get together.

224
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,291
But we are bringing
up the reserves' rear.

225
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,958
We are not in the
same position at all!

226
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,291
Huh?

227
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,833
Some squad commander
he is! [laughs]

228
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,875
I think the rumors were way off!

229
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,125
[chuckles] Well, anyway.
I'm Meng Tian.

230
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,541
It's a pleasure.

231
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,875
[MENG TIAN]
And with that then, good day!

232
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,291
[XIN] Wait!

233
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,666
[POPS] Hmm?

234
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,416
Who are you? Really?

235
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,125
[MENG TIAN] I told you,
Meng Tian of the Le Hua Force.

236
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,875
[MENG TIAN]
Oh, I know!

237
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,166
I have a better introduction.
One you will understand.

238
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,750
Huh?

239
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,625
[MENG TIAN] Just like
you and Wang Ben, too,

240
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,625
I want to be one of the
world's greatest generals!

241
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,875
[gasps]

242
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,041
[XIN]
Him too?

243
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,041
[laughter]

244
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,333
Who does he think he is,
talking like Xin always does?

245
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,958
Is he seriously the
head of the Le Hua Force?

246
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,916
Will they be okay?

247
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,916
He's pretty good, actually.

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,583
Yeah. I know.

249
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:56,083
[XIN] Meng Tian.
Better remember that name.

250
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,000
[POPS]
Meng Tian, sir?

251
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,208
[MENG TIAN]
Hmm?

252
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,416
I think I misunderstood you!

253
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,791
You're aiming to be

254
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,166
one of the world's greatest
generals, are you now?

255
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,791
Why that... that sincerely warms

256
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,875
the very cockles
of my heart, sir!

257
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:18,041
[sobs]

258
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,625
[MENG TIAN]
That was a joke, sorry.

259
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,208
[POPS]
Huh?

260
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,541
[MENG TIAN] I just thought it'd
be funny at the time, you see.

261
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,791
[POPS]
What?!

262
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,833
[MENG TIAN] I'd be
happy as a civil servant.

263
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,333
[POPS]
What?!!

264
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,458
[NARRATOR] Consequently,
whether by chance or by design,

265
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:37,708
three great 300-man squads in
their prime were placed together

266
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,708
in Qin's eastern army reserves:

267
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,416
Wang Ben of the Yu Feng Force,

268
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Xin of the Fei Xin Force,

269
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,250
and Meng Tian
of the Le Hua Force.

270
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,166
All three of them, though
young, were well experienced.

271
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,916
These three groups
bursting with personality,

272
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,791
would very soon be the
talk of the whole Qin army.

273
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:03,208
However, none of these young men
cared one bit about all of this.

274
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,750
[NARRATOR]
All they really wanted now

275
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,291
was to distinguish
themselves in battle.

276
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,958
[snoring]

277
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,458
[splash]

278
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,458
Huh?

279
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,458
[QIANG LEI]
Oh, it's you.

280
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,458
Huh? Hey, what's up?

281
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,208
[QIANG LEI]
Tending to Lu Sui.

282
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,083
And what are you
doing at this hour?

283
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,708
Well, we'll finally
reach Gaolang tomorrow.

284
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,791
Kinda feels like I got hot coals

285
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,041
burning in me
right now, Qiang Lei.

286
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,333
Just like you always do.

287
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,666
[XIN laughs]

288
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,000
Well I just wouldn't be
myself without 'em, right?

289
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,416
Oh hey wait!
Whaddya say to a spar?

290
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,916
Huh?

291
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,500
Hmm... Ahh!

292
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,083
Uh... [laughs]

293
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:33,875
Catch me off guard again,
and I'll run you.

294
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,416
[XIN]
Uh... Sorry! Sorry!

295
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,250
Hm...

296
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,208
[NARRATOR]
The new day dawned,

297
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:58,333
embracing all of the young
soldiers' myriad thoughts.

298
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,583
[QIANG LEI]
Right. Hyup.

299
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,166
[QIANG LEI]
I've finally set things

300
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,791
a little straighter in my head.

301
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,916
[QIANG LEI]
I will use this journey

302
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,791
to take care of
unfinished business.

303
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,583
I shall have revenge
with my own hands!

304
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,041
[QIANG LEI]
That's enough.

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,791
[NARRATOR] That day,
the 80,000-man Qin army

306
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,708
finally arrived at Gaolang,
Wei's first castle,

307
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,291
and surrounded it.

308
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,625
[LUO YUAN]
Meng Ao, sir!

309
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,416
Isn't the enemy being
a little too quiet?

310
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,291
Probably fearing an
army that's so strong!

311
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,541
When we can move, Meng Ao, sir,

312
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,250
we should all move at once.

313
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,708
[MENG AO]
Hmm...

314
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,458
Charge now!

315
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:27,750
[SOLDIERS roar]

316
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,625
[MESSENGER A]
Report!

317
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,416
Lots of casualties at
the west and south walls!

318
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,666
The north wall
has almost fallen!

319
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,583
[LUO YUAN] Then send
reserves to the north!

320
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,833
[GENERAL B] Wait, though!
What about the east?

321
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,666
I am certain the east
is losing little strength,

322
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,125
but the tide of battle changes!

323
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,375
Use the north as a decoy
to focus enemy strength,

324
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,541
then send in the reserves

325
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,416
to attack the east wall
in one fell swoop.

326
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,125
The eastern reserves have
some exceptional talent.

327
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,875
Hmmm... But I believe
that there's something

328
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,875
about the east wall.

329
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,250
Something? Something?

330
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,208
I feel it as well

331
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,625
Then let's get a better
read on the situation--

332
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,916
No. If we're right, all
the more reason to advance.

333
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,875
This is a war of attrition.

334
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,708
Best to make the enemy
tip their hand early on,

335
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,375
wouldn't you say so, too?

336
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,000
[MENG AO grunts]

337
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,583
[MESSENGER B]
Storm the east wall immediately!

338
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,333
Reserves mobilize at once, now!

339
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,791
Storm the east wall as well!

340
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,250
Reserves mobilize at once!

341
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,375
Yes! Our turn to shine!

342
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,291
Let's go, Fei Xin Force!

343
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,500
[SOLDIERS roar]

344
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,208
Huh?

345
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,625
[XIN]
Wh-What is this?

346
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:31,833
[gasping]

347
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,291
[XIN]
Even from down here I can tell

348
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:38,125
they're crazy powerful.

349
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,250
[XIN]
How are we

350
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,833
supposed to storm
something like this?

351
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,958
[ADJUTANT] General,
isn't it about that time?

352
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,791
Ha! Those poor Qin idiots.

353
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,041
We've got them
where we want them.

354
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,625
[FENG BO]
Fire!

355
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,375
What the--?

356
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,833
[QIN SOLDIER A]
What's with all these arrows?

357
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,541
[QIN SOLDIER B] There's
a huge squad of archers

358
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,375
hiding behind the walls!

359
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:09,083
I knew it.

360
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,666
Yep, a trap.
