1
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,291
[NARRATOR] The 80,000 troops
under Qin general Meng Ao

2
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:49,750
had surrounded their first
Wei target, Gaolang Castle.

3
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:55,125
Xin's Fei Xin Force was serving
in the eastern army's reserves.

4
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:58,958
Alongside them were
Wang Ben's Yu Feng Force,

5
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,250
as well as Meng Tian's
Le Hua Force, working together.

6
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:07,291
Now the assault on
Gaolang Castle was underway

7
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:11,083
right before the very eyes
of these three young soldiers

8
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,125
who would usher
in a new era for Qin!

9
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,375
However...

10
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,083
[FENG BO]
Fire!

11
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,041
What the--

12
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,166
[QIN SOLDIER A]
What's with all these arrows?

13
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,416
I knew it.

14
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Yep, a trap.

15
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:35,416
[SOLDIERS screaming]

16
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,541
[XIN gasps]

17
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,583
Huh?

18
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,583
[XIN] There's
a huge squad of archers

19
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,208
hiding behind the walls!

20
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,125
[FENG BO]
Ready!

21
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,875
Fire now!

22
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,541
Huh? Our comrades will--

23
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:19,000
Watch where you move.
It is safer over here.

24
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,250
I know Qiang Lei, but still!

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,958
Don't falter! Clear the wall
and we'll be victorious!

26
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,750
[SOLDIERS roar]

27
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,041
[XIN] Right!
Fei Xin Force, onward!

28
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,833
[ADJUTANT]
General Feng Bo, sir.

29
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,625
It appears that the Qin monkeys

30
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,583
are still fighting their
way up all the ladders!

31
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,625
[FENG BO] Hmmm...

32
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,583
Huh?

33
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,541
Take this, you Qin imbeciles!

34
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,291
[screaming]

35
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,625
[XIN] Ah!

36
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,833
[XIN] Ugh!

37
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,500
Ow.

38
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,625
Are you all right, Xin sir?

39
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:19,333
I'm fine, but now what
are do we do about this?

40
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,208
[NARRATOR]
The war was in its third day.

41
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,750
In the blink of an eye,
the Wei army's traps

42
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,666
had backed the Qin
troops into a corner.

43
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,833
Those pitiful fools.

44
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,500
[NARRATOR]
It stands to reason,

45
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,916
the four generals guarding
the four walls of Gaolang Castle

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,208
were all renowned military men
well-versed in castle defense.

47
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,708
[MESSENGER A]
Report! Report!

48
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,541
The east army
reports major casualties!

49
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,166
The south army too!

50
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,250
Lieutenant Sun has
suffered arrow wounds!

51
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,375
[NARRATOR]
Commanding Qin general Meng Ao

52
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,833
was informed immediately

53
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,958
of the setbacks at the start
of the battle. However...

54
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,875
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

55
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,916
Then this message is
for the four generals:

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,458
"Make sure that you don't
forget to pay a little visit

57
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,666
to all of the severely
wounded squads afterwards."

58
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,666
Ha, ha, ha!

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,875
A visit?

60
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,833
Pay a little visit!
Just tell them that.

61
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,333
[MESSENGER A]
Sir!

62
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,625
Ha, ha, ha!

63
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,125
[EAST ARMY COMMANDER A]
Retreat! Retreat!

64
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,958
Fall back for now!

65
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,291
[NARRATOR] Now the scene
changes to the capital Xianyang.

66
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,916
On the same day that the battle
with Wei sparked into action,

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,166
a new piece of kindling

68
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,416
was starting to smolder
at the Royal Court.

69
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,541
[CIVIL SERVANT A]
But that's ridiculous!

70
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,708
The Queen Dowager
and the Minister?

71
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,625
[CIVIL SERVANT B]
Shh! Keep your voice down!

72
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,000
[CIVIL SERVANT C]
Could the story really be true?

73
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,125
[CIVIL SERVANT B]
Indeed. Actually--

74
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,000
What story is this?
Let's hear it.

75
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,166

L-Li Si sir!

I-It's nothing,

78
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,416
just an insignificant rumor
that is going around.

79
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,291
[LI SI] Kingdoms have been
lost to malicious false rumors,

80
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,250
given the right time and place.

81
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,000
Mind your tongues!

82
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,333
Begging your pardon, Li Si sir.

83
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,625
We have business to attend to,

84
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,375
so, if you'll excuse us.

85
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,333
Hmm...

86
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,166
Honestly, that lot.

87
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:33,083
[groans, unsettled murmurs]

88
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,708
[LI SI]
Unfortunately, Minister.

89
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,333
there's a rumor that
has been going around

90
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,000
these past few days that
badly implies that you

91
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:45,333
and the Queen Dowager have
been quite... indiscreet.

92
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,666
[LÜ BUWEI]
What did you say?

93
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,833
[RETAINER A]
An unforgivably evil rumor!

94
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,041
For accusing the Minister
of such improprieties

95
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,291
is tantamount to calling
him an unabashed traitor!

96
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,083
We cannot let this stand!

97
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,583
[RETAINER B]
Indeed Sir!

98
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,458
This won't end well for those
who spread such nonsense!

99
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,291
If you will please
pardon my rudeness.

100
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,166
Indubitably, you
can think of nothing

101
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,958
that could spark
such outrageous rumors,

102
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,583
can you Minister?

103
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,666
[LÜ BUWEI]
What are you driving at, Li Si?

104
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,708
Huh?

105
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,125
Forgive me, Sir.
The details of this rumor have

106
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,458
triggered more than a little
unrest among your faction.

107
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,416
It was necessary
to put them at ease.

108
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,750
[LÜ BUWEI] Fine, then.
Now go and squash

109
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,916
that horribly vulgar
rumor immediately.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,250
[LI SI]
Yes. I shall.

111
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,250
A rumor so baseless
and wild like that

112
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:55,416
spreads extremely quickly,
but is easily contained.

113
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,166
Besides,

114
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,958
I suspect we know
whence it came from.

115
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,541
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Are you absolutely sure,

116
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,250
about this whole
rumor business, sire?

117
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,041
Indeed, it truly is
shaking the foundations

118
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,541
of Lü Buwei's entire faction,

119
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,666
but at the same time,

120
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,708
it has muddied the
name of your mother,

121
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,083
the Queen Dowager.

122
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,458
Although she had clearly
already made herself

123
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,875
to be your adversary
in the past,

124
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,166
aren't you bidding
the impossible, sire?

125
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,083
[ZHENG] It would be
a lie to say I am not.

126
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,791
She may be a bad mother, but
I am still flesh of her flesh.

127
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,583
But what of it, then?

128
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,833
[LORD CHANGWEN] Hmm?

129
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,541
[ZHENG] We are
fighting a war, after all!

130
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,333
We must be prepared
for bloodshed,

131
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,208
for our own injuries too,

132
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,666
and willing to use
any means necessary!

133
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,166
Even if those means
come back to bite me,

134
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,541
I will not hesitate!

135
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,208
Now that we're in
the fight, we must win.

136
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:20,708
You are the one who taught me
that about war, weren't you?

137
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,208
Lord Changwen!

138
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,541
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Hmm?

139
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,541
We have already lost
so many at this point.

140
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,500
Now is no time to flinch.

141
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,750
Si Shi, how is it going?

142
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:37,541
Sire, I think things are
about to start moving.

143
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,375
Lü Buwei's faction
likely believes

144
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,916
that this rumor will
just quickly fade away,

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
but now it seems it's
ushering in yet another storm.

146
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,333
[RETAINERS shocked murmurs]

147
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,166

[LI SI]
How absurd.

155
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,000
Anyone could see how unnatural

156
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,541
and strange it would be
for the Queen Dowager

157
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:22,000
to lend her support to the
faction led by her son's enemy!

158
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:26,125
This must mean the rumors
were telling the ugly truth!

00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,708
If I may ask?

163
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,333
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Hmmm... [chuckles]

164
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,000
This letter I just
received from Lü Buwei.

165
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:49,583
He says he cannot meet with me
until everything blows over.

166
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,875
I see.

167
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,875
That was pretty fast,
wouldn't you say?

168
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,166
[ZHAO GAO]
Surely, it can't be helped.

169
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,750
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Hmph. Bring me the finest

170
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:05,208
perfumed oil, quickly,
and prepare for an outing.

171
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,916
[ZHAO GAO]
Where to, madam?

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,500
[QUEEN DOWAGER]
Where else do you think?

173
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,583
If he won't come to me,

174
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:17,291
I shall just have to go
to him instead. [laughs]

175
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,375
[ZHENG] You may all already have
heard the news going around:

176
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,250
The Inner Palace
has double-crossed us

177
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,750
and sided with Lü Buwei.

178
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,666
This means the
power gap between us

179
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,250
is now, much too great
for us to begin to overcome.

180
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:37,500
However, Lü Buwei made a
mistake in securing their help.

181
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,666
While he was serving
as the kingdom's

182
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,458
highest-ranked Minister, he
committed full-fledged adultery

183
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,833
with the Queen Dowager of Qin!

184
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:49,666
This is an unprecedented
act of base immorality,

185
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,208
a traitorous act,

186
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,833
an evil act that shall
not be countenanced!

187
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,208
[roaring]

188
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,416
[ZHENG] Unfortunately, as the
only witness is a court lady,

189
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,541
taking his head
would not be feasible.

190
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,458
However, Lü Buwei's faction
has been shaken to its core.

191
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,291
A wedge of never-before-seen
proportions

192
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,083
has been successfully
driven into his stronghold

193
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,583
and severely restricting
Lü Buwei's actions.

194
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,750
We will seize this chance
to recover from our setback!

195
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,208
Understood?

196
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,916
We've justice on our side!

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,375
Don't you ever forget that!

198
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,291
[roaring]

199
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,125
Sun Xian, work with Li Hai

200
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,083
to undercut the
neutrals right now!

201
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,666
Sir!

202
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,583
[SI SHI] Tun, you'll convince
the neutrals to side with us!

203
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,166
[TUN]
Leave it to us!

204
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,750
[SI SHI] Zhang, you'll muster
soldiers into a reserve force!

205
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,000
They won't be pulling
any punches at us now!

206
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,291
[RETAINERS roar in agreement]

207
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,208
[ZHENG] Here's where
the real battle begins.

208
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,458
There's no turning back now!

209
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,625
[WEI PING] What the
heck is up with that wall?

210
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,833
Some fight this
turned out to be!

211
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,916
Come too close and we'll
get a hide full of arrows!

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,500
Ugh... Those arrows are a pain!

213
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,208
[YUAN] I don't think
we've lost anyone Xin,

214
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,041
but some 20 men
are out of commission.

215
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,958
[CHONG YUAN]
So then, commander,

216
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,208
haven't we received any
orders from above by now?

217
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm telling you guys,

218
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,041
those ladders are
prime targets for the enemy.

219
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,416
I doubt we can storm
the castle using those.

220
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,166
[XIN]
I haven't heard a thing.

221
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,916
General Meng Ao
can't be out of options!

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,625
If we don't get some
kind of strategy soon,

223
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,625
this is all just gonna drag on!

224
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,166
And that can't happen!

225
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,541
[MENG TIAN] I don't think
Bai Lao has put together

226
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,833
any clever
strategies or anything.

227
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,875
[XIN]
Meng Tian of the Le Hua Force!

228
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,500
Hi!

229
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,958
The ace castle-buster Bai Lao,

230
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,666
uses only conventional
tactics in war.

231
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,791
Surround the castle
and chip away,

232
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,083
lower the enemy's morale,
then strike at the rift.

233
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,291
That's it.

234
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,916
[XIN]
"Chip away"?

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,583
You think we're gonna
take going that slow?

236
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,583
The longer this fight drags on,

237
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,875
the more men we'll lose,

238
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,416
and the less
provisions we'll have!

239
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,416
Besides, shouldn't
we special forces

240
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,416
be using not-so-conventional
tactics out here now?

241
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,000
Hm. You really do have
a point right there.

242
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,541
But practically speaking,

243
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,875
there really isn't any other way

244
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,208
to bring down
a wall with 300 troops.

245
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,583
We'll just have
to resign ourselves

246
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,583
to a long and drawn-out fight.

247
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,916
In other words,
until those gates open,

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,625
we reserves have nothing
to do. Right now.

249
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,833
That's right, but we--

250
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,291
Heh. Just be patient
and wait for your turn.

251
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,208
[MENG TIAN]
I'll be seeing you!

252
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,625
[XIN]
Why did he come out here anyway?

253
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,000
[YUAN]
No idea.

254
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,666
[QIANG LEI] I think that
may be because he likes you.

255
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,416
Huh? Who, him?

256
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,583
Yeah right.

257
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,625
What makes you say
that anyway, Qiang Lei?

258
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,041
No reason.

259
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,583
What?! Hah!

260
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:59,666
Man, I just do not
get that guy at all.

261
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,541
[NARRATOR]
Meng Tian was right:

262
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,875
The tide of war hadn't
budged even ten days in.

263
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,125
[EAST ARMY COMMANDER A]
Retreat! Retreat!

264
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,666
[NARRATOR] But Meng Ao
showed no signs of panicking.

265
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,250
Ha, ha, ha!
Do not rush things, now.

266
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,458
You need to take
your time with it.

267
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,833
The castle will not run away.

268
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,583
[NARRATOR] And with that,
the army was told

269
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,708
to expect a month of fighting.
At the very least.

270
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,875
However, the Qin troops
were clearly very anxious now,

271
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,416
and their morale was down.

272
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,583
[SOLDIERS roar]

273
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,791
[NARRATOR]
On the other hand,

274
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,041
the Wei army's morale
was only increasing,

275
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,791
by holding off the Qin army.

276
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,958
[FAN YANG]
It has arrived at last, my lord.

277
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,000
[WANG BEN]
Indeed.

278
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,041
[distant banging]

279
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,916
Huh... Do you hear that?
That sound?

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,375
[distant banging]

281
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,875
Tomorrow, then.

282
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,500
Yes.

283
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,958
Huh?

284
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,208
Ah!

285
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,875
It's the Yu Feng Force!
They're out ahead!

286
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,208
Is he real dense?

287
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,875
What good is the cavalry
against a castle wall?

288
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,250
No, look closer.

289
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,125
[XIN]
They're carrying stuff on carts!

290
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,375
Those are not just carts.

291
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,541
[XIN]
Trees?

292
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,125
What the heck are
they trying to do anyway?

293
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,000
[COMMANDER A] All those in
position, take cover at once!

294
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,000
Fire!

295
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,666
A-A fire attack?

296
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,583
Amazing!

297
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,166
Um, but those walls
will just not burn!

298
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,416
Clearly that's no fire attack.

299
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,041
[ADJUTANT]
General, the front!

300
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,250
Keep your head!

301
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,000
We're not the only ones
this smoke and fire

302
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,041
is working against right now!

303
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,041
[XIN] Wang Ben is gonna
try using this smoke

304
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,750
to climb the walls!

305
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,500
We'll do the same!

306
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,333
[LU YAN]
Wait! We can't!

307
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,625
[ALL]
Huh?

308
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,958
[WEI PING]
Lu Yan?

309
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,250
There's no way anyone
could climb those ladders

310
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,958
amid the smoke and flames
that have been spewed.

311
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,666
If we go, we'll
be burned to a crisp!

312
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,083
But isn't that why
Wang Ben did this?

313
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:53,166
[rumbling]

314
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,458
What? What is that loud sound?

315
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,250
[gasps]

316
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,458
[CHONG YUAN] The forest!
The forest is moving!

317
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,250
[ADJUTANT] We can't attack
with all these flames and smoke!

318
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,916
Put out the fires at once, now!

319
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,875
Huh? What is that?

320
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,625
[ADJUTANT]
Sir?

321
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,625
That extremely loud noise.

322
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,291
Wh-What in blazes--

323
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,875
[XIN]
Huh?

324
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,375
Ah... Ah...

325
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,083
Yu Feng Force.

326
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,666
[SOLDIERS scream]

327
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,416
Onward, men!

328
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,541
[XIN gasps]
What gives, Wang Ben?

329
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,750
[XIN] Did you seriously bring
that monster with you over here?

330
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,916
Is that what I think it is?
It's a-a siege tower!

331
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,375
That's it. Ha, ha!

332
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,666
Figures the Wang clan would
have something so unusual.

333
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,166
And how clever of
them to have brought it!

334
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,958
Though it is a bit much.

335
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,541
Just stay calm!

336
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,666
There are only one
or 200 of them,

337
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,833
Surround them and corner them!
That's all it takes!

338
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,458
Send all of them
plummeting to the ground!

339
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,333
It won't work.

340
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,791
[MENG TIAN]
With Wang Ben's spear skills,

341
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,416
not even ten men can
get anywhere near him.

342
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,875
Plus...

343
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,166
[WEI SOLDIER B] Tear those
Qin monkeys to pieces!

344
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,458
[SOLDIERS roar]

345
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,333
[MENG TIAN] ...every last man on
that squad is a master soldier.

346
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,750
[MENG TIAN] And what's more,
the Yu Feng Forces

347
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,583
use many high-level group
fighting techniques,

348
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,416
giving them raw power
that is truthfully

349
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
far beyond that of
Wei's 1,000-man squads.

350
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,375
[distant screams]

351
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,041
[XIN]
Even without their horses,

352
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,083
the Yu Feng Force
is a powerhouse!

353
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,666
[MENG TIAN] I can tell
from down here, Wang Ben.

354
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,166
You guys've really been
perfecting your group fighting.

355
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,250
[MESSENGER A] Report! The east
army has begun its attack!

356
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,500
The Yu Feng Force
has scaled the wall,

357
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,541
and is fighting hard!

358
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,458
Yu Feng, you said?

359
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,666
Wang Ben's 300-man squadron?

360
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,333
Doesn't he have a bad history

361
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,833
of continually
disobeying orders?

362
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,625
Well, if he can
lead us to victory,

363
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,041
I am sure this one
fault can be overlooked.

364
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:53,166
Ha, ha, ha! I really do
believe the vigor of youth

365
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,875
is so incredibly delightful!

366
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,250
However,

367
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,208
let us hope he won't go too far,

368
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,416
and just lose
his life in the process.

369
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,125
It's too dangerous, sir!
We must evacuate!

370
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,583
[FENG BO growls]

371
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,666
I want all of the
reserves here, right now!

372
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,041
I'll show those upstarts
just how fearsome

373
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,375
and lethal
Wei soldiers can truly be!

374
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:24,166
Ho, ho! Their general
is mad! I heard him here!

375
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,250
[YUAN gasps]

376
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,958
Xin, sir, look!

377
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,083
[XIN]
Huh?

378
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,458
What is it?

379
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,625
The Yu Feng Force finally
managed to gain a foothold,

380
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,375
but the ladder brigade
isn't following up on it.

381
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,625
I bet this was the
Yu Feng Force's sneak attack

382
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,583
that other squads
don't know about.

383
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,875
Even your allies
would jump to see

384
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,750
that giant thing
show up out here.

385
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,375
But that means...

386
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,041
[XIN]
Uh...

387
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,625
The Yu Feng Force is alone
and helpless with that army!

388
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,333
[MENG TIAN]
However, it's all gone

389
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,833
just according to plan so far.

390
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,375
[MENG TIAN] Why don't
we just see what you can do

391
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,125
from way up there,

392
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,708
Wang Ben.
