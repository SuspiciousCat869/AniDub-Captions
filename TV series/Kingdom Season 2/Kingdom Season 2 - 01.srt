[ZHENG]
Has it been a year already?

3
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,666
[NARRATOR]
The kingdom of Qin had invaded

4
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,541
the smaller Han
to expand its territory.

5
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,583
Neighboring Zhao jumped
at the chance to draw Qin

6
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,375
into a dangerous battle.

7
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,458
Stepping up as
commanding general

8
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,500
was the Strange Bird of Qin:

9
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,291
Wang Yi, the last of
the six great generals,

10
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,791
feared throughout
the Middle Kingdom.

11
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,500
Zhao sent forth as their
commanding general Pang Nuan,

12
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:06,375
a so-called god of war
with deep ties to Wang Yi.

13
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,333
The two men clashed violently.

14
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,250
[NARRATOR]
Just as strategist, Li Mu,

15
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,791
one of Zhao's
Three Greats, had planned.

16
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,625
Thus, Wang Yi was
skillfully manipulated

17
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,166
into dying a hero's death.

18
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,625
[NARRATOR] Without the absolute
symbol of their army,

19
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,625
Qin's military power waned,

20
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:43,750
and the neighboring lands
of Zhao, Wei, Han, and Chu

21
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:48,291
started launching
invasion after invasion.

22
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,125
But now, every Qin man,
woman, and child knew:

23
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,083
The time for action had come!

24
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,541
Kill them all!

25
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,208
Squash those Qin worms!

26
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,833

under Wang Yi
in the Zhao battle.

40
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,666
Proving their prowess there,
the Fei Xin Force grew

Cheng Jiao, plotted
an uprising with Jie Shi,

his Minister of the Left,
the level-headed Si Shi

gave his support as
Jie Shi's right hand.

86
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,250
Cheng Jiao didn't
bring an uprising,

87
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,041
because of his popularity,
nor Jie Shi's ambition.

88
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,291
It was because Si Shi took part
in all of the planning.

89
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,708
He also had to seize the
remnants of Jie Shi's faction,

90
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,958
But, I'll have him serve
as a close advisor.

As it happens, sire,

we've received word
of troubling behavior

from Lu Buwei.

We do not know the specifics,

but you should know,
Your Highness.

99
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,041
That man...

100
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,541
What is he planning?

101
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,000
[LU BUWEI]
Now, where are you?

102

Where is my little prey now?

[LU BUWEI] Aha! Gotcha!

Well, if it isn't
the little Quan!

[NARRATOR] Qin's Minister
of the Right, Lu Buwei.

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,083
Once a mere Zhou merchant,

108
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,458
his insatiable thirst
for wealth and fame

109
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,958
propelled him up the
ranks to become the ruler

110
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,250
of Qin in all but name.

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,125
[NARRATOR] With a faction

politics, diplomacy, and law,

113
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,666
Lu Buwei had designs

114
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,666
on taking the Qin
throne for himself.

115
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,916
Now, powerless to confront him

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,375
in the face of such
naked ambition,

117
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,708
Zheng's camp could only wait
for the other shoe to drop.

118
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,250
The greatest threat
for Zheng, the king of Qin,

119
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,500
may not be the
surrounding nations

120

and the battles they wage.

121

Indeed, it may be Lu Buwei.

Lord Chunping, you say?

[KAINE] Yes, His Highness's
absolute favorite.

128
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,291
He'd have no reason to

You assume your post as

So, why are you running away?

But-but-but, not me!

Why can't you tell me?

139
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,500
There have been dozens of
ladies called by the king,

but it has always been
only for one day.

I think I am much
too childish for this.

What do you mean?

143
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,208
Why do you think
His Highness said as much:

144
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,333
It is your devotion that counts!

You see?

Don't be silly!

We don't draw straws for this,

What would Your Highness
like me to do first, exactly?

to come all this way.

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,708
The answer to that question

[NARRATOR] Si Shi's advice
came seconds too late.

The situation surrounding Zheng
silently grew ever more tense.

Attacks from other kingdoms,
Lu Buwei's plotting,

187
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:15,208
and a darkness that lurked
in a most unexpected place.

[QUEEN DOWAGER]
And just when exactly

We have, in fact, reached
a conclusion in that regard.

[LORD CHANGPING]
This is a school, Cai Ze.

197
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,291
[CAI ZE] Waiting for the
minister to make a move is dull.

198
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,541
[LORD CHANGPING]
He does us no favors.

199
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,208
It seems the one
you had your eye on

200
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,708
is coming along
quite nicely, correct?

201
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,541
Xin of the Fei Xin Force?

202
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,291
Mmm.

203
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,291
Do you still want him after all?

204
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,833
Or not?

205
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:21,916
Well, no.

206
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,500
[CAI ZE]
You give up on him?

207
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,708
[LORD CHANGPING]
Quite the opposite.

208
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,208
I want to see how far he'll go.

209
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,458
For now, Cai Ze,

210
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,125
we will just
leave him out there.

[CAI ZE]
Oh, I see.

212

And the little straw man
you are training now

213
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,083
is to help speed up
Xin's progress?

214
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,833
[LORD CHANGPING]
That, I do not know for sure.

215

Meng Yi.

217

Tactician school's just
not easy, that's for sure.

218
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,541
I knew that well coming in.

00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,583
Kaine told me so.

220
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,958
You do not understand anything.

221
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,875
If you're going
to be a tactician,

222
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,291
you need to truly grasp
what that really means.

223
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,875
What it means?

224
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,125
Indeed.

225
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,250
It's more sad and painful
to be a tactician,

226
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,250
than being a soldier
out on the front lines.

227
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,333
Painful...

228
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,666
...and terrible.

229
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,250
[DIAO]
It's not me I worry about.

230
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,250
I just wonder how
he's doing out there.

231

[MENG YI]
Xin?

00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,250
[DIAO]
Yeah.

233
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,333
I bet he keeps on
charging onward,

234
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,125
getting farther away.

235
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,750
[MENG YI]
No, sometimes he stays put.

236
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,458
He must know, the real
battle is only beginning.

237
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,750

The real battle, you say?

238
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,416
[MENG YI] You can really feel
the times changing fast.

239
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,833
The battlefields are full

240
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,875
of young and talented
generals of Xin's generation.

They are hardworking rivals,
ready to butt heads.

[DIAO]
Hardworking rivals?

243
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,250

Just like my older brother.

Do you really have a brother?

I have never ever met him then!

247
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,625
[MENG YI] He never did
like to be tied down.

248
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,416
He really loves his freedom.

00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,458
[QIANG LEI]
Lay off.

322
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,125
[WEI PING] Have I got
an embarrassing story

323
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,500
about Xin for you!

324
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,625
Say what? Hey, Wei Ping!

325
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,666
Wait till you hear the
dirt I have on Wei Ping!

326
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,500
[WEI PING]
Don't you dare!

327
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,583
[NARRATOR]
The Fei Xin Force remained

328
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,208
as an unattached
special squadron,

329
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,500
running from battle to
battle as reinforcements.

330
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,750
Their opponents weren't
much of a challenge

331
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,791
after the pitched Zhao battle,

332
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,333
and victory came
quickly and often.

333
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,041
Their allies grew
to rely on them,

334
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,041
while their enemies
learned to fear them.

335
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:06,583
In short, both the
Fei Xin Force's name and Xin's

336
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,916
had begun to resonate
on front lines everywhere.

337
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,291
Ah. Y'know, we've
gotten awful famous

338
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:20,083
for never losing one
single battle up to now.

339
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,291
If a cute girl
came up to you to say:

340
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,750
Aren't you that
super-famous Wei Ping?

341
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,583
So, what would you do then,
if that happened, Wei Ping?

342
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,500
[WEI PING]
Huh? A cute girl came up to me?

343
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,750
So you mean that--

344
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,750
Dummy!

345
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,916
Dong Mei's the
only girl for you!

346
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,125
Don't worry, I will
gladly take care

347
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,333
of the village girls.

348
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,708
[WEI PING]
Well but, hang on a sec!

349
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,875
I have rights too!

350
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,166
[QING]
Bad news!

351
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,291
[MAO]
Bad, terrible awful!

352
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,833
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 201B]
What is it? Qing, Mao! An enemy?

353
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,708
No, not now. It's not that.

354
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,250
There was a battle between

355
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,375
the Yan and those
Zhao army guys!

356
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,125
[SOLDIERS gasping]

357
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,208
The Yan...

358
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,750
...and the Zhao?

359
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,083
[laughs] Exactly as we thought!

360
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,666
[MAO]
Hm.

361
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,375
[QING] The general who led the
Zhao against the Yan was Li Mu!

362
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,916
Well, go on!

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,458
How did the battle turn out?

364
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,500
Li Mu toppled two
massive Yan castles;

365
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,458
they seem to be Wudui
and also Fangcheng.

366
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,250
[XIN growls]

367
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,791
[QING grunts]

368
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,125
Wudui and Fangcheng, you said?

369
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,916
Those two are impregnable.

370
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,541
[QING]
It was terribly one-sided.

371
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:31,000
The Yan army was
completely helpless.

372
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,500
So, he is making a bold move.

373
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,666
Ehmm.

374
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,791
All right!

375
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,208
Time for us to--

376
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,666
[SONG ZUO] Maybe just save
your swagger a minute now.

377
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,958
Song Zuo!

378
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,791
Yan is off in the opposite
direction from Qin.

379
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,708
If Zhao went after Yan,

380
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,333
they must be
looking eastward.

381
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,708
Which means we will
not be facing them

382
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,666
any time soon, now.

383
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,833
If we are preoccupied
with an enemy,

384
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,166
we are not going to fight,

385
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,125
the small fry might
sneak up on us.

386
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,875
You make a good point.

387
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:03,708
Yes. Song Zuo's quite right.

388
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,041
[NARRATOR] But something
even more unexpected

389
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,541
was happening over in Xianyang.

390
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,500
[JIANG YA]
Oh, no!

391
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,375
He Liao Diao! Meng Yi!

392
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,500
This is bad!

393
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,208
[DIAO]
Hm?

394
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,750
What happened, Jiang Ya?

395
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,458
[JIANG YA]
The Zhao, their chancellor

396
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,250
is coming to Qin right now!

397
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,458
[MENG YI gasps]

398
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,166
[MENG YI]
Zhao's chancellor?

399
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,708
Coming of his own accord?

400
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,958
Why would he?

401
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,833
[JIANG YA]
Oh, we do not know.

402
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,875
but he is definitely coming!

403
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,833
The palace has been
thrown into utter chaos,

404
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,708
I'm telling you!

405
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,041
And after last year's invasion.

406
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,375
What could the chancellor
be up to now?

407
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,291
[JIANG YA] But that's not
the only shocking news

408
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,125
that I've heard!

409
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,125
[DIAO]
Huh?

410
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,000
You ready?

411
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,500
Take a deep breath and listen!

412
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,166
Meng Yi, He Liao Diao.

413
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,166
The chancellor that will be
visiting Qin very soon...

414
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,208
[JIANG YA]
...is none other than...

415
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,291
[JIANG YA]
...Li Mu!
