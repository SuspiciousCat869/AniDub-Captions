Hey. Is the kid
all right now or what?

Hm. He's fine now.

back to the kingdom of Qin,

passed through

Yes! Yes! We can do it!

We can go back to Qin!

are pretty tuckered out

so many days in a row.

too much time

There's a dust cloud
right behind us!

is on our tail!

We are living on

I felt, don't you think?

back when we were sixteen.

followed in the

00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,750
[ZI XIA]
There is that, yes.

323
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,625
But that's not all.

324
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,750
[ZI XIA] To see the moon
we saw that night

325
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,708
one more time with you.

326
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,250
[sniffs, sighs]

327
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:58,541
I won't let you...
kill this child!

328
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,583
Uuuh! What are
you doing? Kill her now!

329
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,500
I won't let you!

330
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,000
[gasps]

331
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,875
There he is!
Lord Zheng is right there!

332
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,166
Zi Xia! The Qin soldiers!

333
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,083
Help has arrived!

334
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,625
Mmm! Forget the woman!
Go for Zheng!

335
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,875
Stay strong, Zi Xia!
We're so close!

336
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,916
[DONG YAN]
Just fire!

337
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,083
[squelch]

338
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,041
[ZHENG]
Zi Xia...!

339
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,541
[ZHAO SOLDIER 209G]
What is with her?

340
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,041
[squelching]

341
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,375
[DONG YAN]
Kill her!

342
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,666
Aah!

343
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,541
Lord Zheng!

344
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,208
[ZHENG]
Zi--

345
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,333
Xia!

346
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,708
[gasps]
Dear Lord Zheng.

347
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,958
[ZHENG]
What is it?

348
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,750
[ZI XIA]
Are you... hurt at all?

349
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,541
[QIN SOLDIERS groan]

350
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,333
Ah, I'm fine now.

351
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,750
I'm headed back to Qin
all thanks to you.

352
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,208
Thanks to you,
I shall be king.

353
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,541
[ZI XIA laughs lightly]

354
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,333
Don't forget about Dao
Jian and the rest,

355
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,333
will you, Lord Zheng?

356
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,291
Oh, you're right.

357
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:47,333
Dao Jian, Dan Yuan, Tian Ci,
Ya Men, Jiang Zhang.

358
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:51,250
I won't forget them.

359
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,000
My Lord Zheng.

360
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,250
Huh?

361
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,541
[ZI XIA] The misfortune
of your birth made you

362
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,208
tread a path that
royalty rarely walks.

363
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,250
But you need to understand this.

364
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:07,166
No one--no one else
will become a greater king

365
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,625
having experienced
the hardships that you have.

366
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,916
And so then, I am certain.

367
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,666
[ZHENG gasps]

368
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,541
You will be a...

369
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:24,208
greater king than anyone
else has ever been.

370
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,041
[ZHENG]
Zi Xia! Darn it. Darn it!

371
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,666
[sobbing]

372
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,083
[ZI XIA]
Lord Zheng. Your face.

373
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,291
Your... sweet eyes.

374
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,875
[ZI XIA] Your demons
have left you now.

375
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:55,375
Your eyes, they're so--

376
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,583
They're so beautiful now.

377
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,625
[gasps]

378
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,833
[ZHENG]
Zi Xia!
