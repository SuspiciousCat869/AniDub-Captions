00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,000
[NARRATOR]
In the middle of a fierce battle

2
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,166
between Qin and Wei,
they meet again:

3
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,708
Xin and Lun Hu.

4
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,000
Which of them will be
able to overcome his limits

5
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,166
and have his own way
in the end?

6
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,166
[NARRATOR]
Their blistering-hot emotions

7
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,750
truly are making sparks fly!

8
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,000
Now just get down here!

9
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,125
We'll settle this with a duel!

10
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,791
I will take you on
bare-handed!

11
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,958
Sir?

12
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,916
Your banter hasn't
changed a bit, I see!

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,333
Ah, but that's a
very good thing.

14
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,958
All right, let's begin!

15
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,291
[MA LING]
Yes sir!

16
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,791
Take your positions!

17
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:17,833
[QIN SOLDIERS yell]

18
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,250
[QIN SOLDIER I]
Round up the troops!

19
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,125
[QIN SOLDIER J]
On the double!

20
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,333
You're utterly no fun.

21
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,375
[laughs]

22
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,500
Lian Po didn't come
alone after all.

23
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,416
[MENG AO SOLDIER B]
Of course he didn't!

24
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
[MENG AO SOLDIER C]
What is really going on here?

25
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,458
[NARRATOR] The greatest duties
of the headquarters,

26
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,708
that is, a commander
and all of his staff,

27
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,250
are producing an overall
picture of the battle at hand

28
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,750
and leading its army to victory.

29
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,416
The plans both sides
had drawn up for this battle,

30
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,458
shared a few points in common.

31
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,916
[NARRATOR] Meng Ao and Lian Po,
though sworn enemies,

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
were in reality exceedingly
similar in some ways

33
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,541
and close at heart.

34
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,541
[MENG AO]
The overall plan I had devised

35
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,750
for this very battle here...

36
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,791
...utilizes the main central
army as if it were a shield,

37
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,625
In order to bear the brunt
of the harshest attacks

38
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:47,208
that Lian Po's central
army can give us.

39
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,541
In the meantime,

40
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,333
the two lieutenants
Huan Yi and Wang Jian

41
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,458
will serve as our
main attack team

42
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,083
with their great
offensive power,

43
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,458
moving in from
both flanks at once.

44
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,708
They will crush the
opposing Wei army

45
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,625
and go for their
main camp afterwards.

46
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,291
[LIAN PO] The Wei army's
main attack force

47
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:12,000
consists of Lun Hu's army
at the very center of it.

48
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,500
However,

49
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,916
we should send our flanks
after the enemy's lieutenants,

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,250
destroy them, or at
the very least, hold them back.

51
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:25,541
Then surround Meng Ao's
main camp completely.

52
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,208
[MENG AO]
In other words...

53
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,000
[LIAN PO] ...our strategy's
built on three fields:

54
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,083
left, right, and center.

55
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,791
[MENG AO]
The same tactics.

56
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,666
[LIAN PO] Anyone could come up
with that much, really.

57
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,208
But here's where it
gets tricky:

58
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,875
[MENG AO]
We respond in different ways.

59
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:48,000
I've ordered them
to mainly focus on defense.

60
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,583
[LIAN PO]
I came out swinging ruthlessly,

61
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,541
and won without question.

62
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,625
It's a given.

63
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,666
[LIAN PO]
I lost Xuan Feng very early on,

64
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,625
but then Jie Zifang's army
rushed in quickly thereafter.

65
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,291
In the free-for-all
that followed,

66
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:12,083
Huan Yi's army,
some of Qin's hardest hitters,

67
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,458
went silent.

68
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,416
That's all it took for
us to dominate.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,458
I really believe that what
truly turned the tide

70
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,500
more than anything else,
was the right-flank battle.

71
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,333
My own army mobilized,
and Wang Jian's army

72
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,958
promptly retreated far and deep.

73
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:34,666
No--They ran away from me.

74
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,541
PO] Meng Ao, are you sure
you haven't made

75
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,250
some gross miscalculation?

76
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,166
Presently, you have
lost half of the brawn

77
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,041
you have been counting on, and
you let me rush your main camp

78
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,666
from behind,
regrettably for you.

79
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,083
I have been working
on this for so long now

80
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:56,416
that even putting Bai Guixi
in charge was part of my plan.

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,750
Now Lun Hu has to
destroy the central army.

82
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,041
I attack from behind,

83
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,541
the main camp gets caught in
the middle, and it's all over.

84
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,500
[laughs]

85
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,375
[MENG AO laughs]

86
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,916
[MENG AO]
Nothing to fret about.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,041
To him, I'm always a loser
no matter what happens.

88
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,291
[MA GONG]
My lord?

89
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,250
Send all the main camp's
troops to the very back.

90
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,208
[MA LING]
A-All of them?

91
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,791
But Sir when the-the enemy
gets past the central army

92
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,958
at the front--

93
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,541
[MENG AO]
I don't care.

94
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:43,583
[MENG AO] Lian Po, it seems
that I have always lost to you.

95
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,958
So I expected this to happen.

96
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,000
And having expected it,

97
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,166
I can cope with it
incredibly well.

98
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,625
Furthermore...

99
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,416
[MENG AO]
I constructed this fortress

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,416
solely for you to
attack it, you see.

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,916
Behold:

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,083
my Meng Ao-style anti-Lian Po
counterstrike formation!

103
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,250
[LIAN PO growls]

104
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,375
You mean to tell me
he did all of this in secret?

105
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,375
I heard that he is
big on defense,

106
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,166
which would mean fewer chinks.

107
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,416
Huh? Hey, wait
a second! Ha, ha!

108
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Get a load of that fortress!

109
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,666
[WEI SOLDIER D] I know! It's so
inelegant and inefficient!

110
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,541
[LIAN PO]
No...

111
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,750
It's not bad at all.

112
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:35,541
You did pretty well for someone
that is so mediocre, Meng Ao!

113
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,791
[MENG AO]
Oh, but of course.

114
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,625
I've been planning and plotting
this formation for years,

115
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,708
all to draw your attacks
when the day finally came

116
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,875
for both of us to
engage in battle once again.

117
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,750
[LIAN PO]
Hmm...

118
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,833
This could prove to be
just a little tricky.

119
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,833
There's too many horsemen
that have half dismount.

120
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:00,833
[WEI SOLDIER E]
Yes sir!

121
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,625
The archers are just fine.

122
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,541
Put the shields in front
to take the arrows.

123
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,791
[WEI SOLDIER F]
Yes sir!

124
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,708
[LIAN PO]
All right, here we go, Meng Ao.

125
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:14,333
I will take your head by my own
hand, I can promise you that.

126
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,208
[LI CHONG]
The enemy is on the move!

127
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,000
[MA LIANG]
Where's Lian Po striking from?

128
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,875
[GUO JIAO]
My lord!

129
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,958
[MENG AO]
Come on then, Lian Po.

130
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,958
Enter this fortress
and you are the dead man!

131
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,083
Stay aware of
your surroundings!

132
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,583
There are enemy soldiers
wandering the area,

133
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,416
just like us.

134
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,208
[BI'S SOLDIERS]
Sir!

135
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,375
[BI] We brought up
the rear just fine,

136
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,541
but now we're separated
from Wang Jiang's squad,

137
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,250
and lost, to boot.

138
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:52,083
We picked up other squads along
the way, so we're plenty strong.

139
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,458
Better get back to the
front lines on the double.

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,416
Huh...?

[BI'S SOLDIER B]
Bi, sir, is that--

142
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
[BI]
General Meng Ao's main camp?

143
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,833
Exactly how lost are we, then?

144
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,458
[shouting]

145
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:19,000

Oh, no! Are they under attack?!

[gasps]

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,583
[MA LING]
Lian Po has mobilized!

151
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,583
Ah... Commander!

152
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,166
Lian Po is coming this way!

153
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,958
[QIN COMMANDER A]
Don't panic!

154
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,750
Ha! That fool!
We've got you now, Lian Po!

155
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,250
Huh?

156
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,708
[QIN COMMANDER A] If you want
to avoid a rain of arrows,

157
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,250
it's standard practice
to attack from the sides.

158
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:59,166
That's why we've hidden archers
in the woods on either side see?

159
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,333
With arrows from the
front and the sides,

160
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,750
even Lian Po
won't stand a chance!

161
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,750
[laughs]

162
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,416
That's the legendary
general, Lian Po!

163
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,791
His tactics are outdated!

164
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,500
Fire!

165
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,250
[gasps]

166
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,708
[SOLDIERS screaming]

167
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,000
[QIN COMMANDER A]
Are they in their right minds?!

168
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,041
Why would they
fire on their allies?!

169
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,916
[LI CHONG]
My lord, what is this?!

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,541
[MENG AO]
The bordering area of the forest

171
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,250
is already in enemy hands.

172
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,958
[LIAN PO growls]

173
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,583
[QIN SOLDIERS screaming]

174
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,083
[LI CHONG]
Lian Po just went right on in.

175
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,875
[MA LING] They're breaching
the front ranks!

176
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,916
[GUO JIAO]
The right edge is done!

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,166
[MA LING]
My lord!

178
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,125
Never fear. The true
terror of this fortress

179
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,958
starts right now!

180
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,458
All right, then!

181
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,500
They're thin on the ground here!

182
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,791
[LIAN PO SOLDIER B]
We can do this!

183
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,708
[LIAN PO SOLDIER C]
We'll tear Meng Ao apart!

184
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,166
[LIAN PO SOLDIERS cheer]

185
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,458
What the--

186
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,208
It is a...

187
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,958
[LIAN PO SOLDIER A]
...a dead end?!

188
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,250
[LIAN PO SOLDIER D]
What's going on there?

189
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,583
[LIAN PO SOLDIER E]
What is it?

190
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,458
[LIAN PO SOLDIER B]
No! Stay back! Listen to me!

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,416
[MENG AO ARCHER A]
Now! Fire!

192
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,791
[LIAN PO SOLDIERS screaming]

193
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:33,000
General, it appears
some of our squads are done for.

194
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,333
The broken-path plan:

195
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,458
Clearly cutting off pathways
to corner the enemy effectively.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,666
[LIAN PO] And unlike Wang Jian's
drum-tight fortress from before,

197
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,791
Meng Ao's is, at first glance,
messy and full of holes.

198
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,166
However,

199
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,916
start to climb it and you'll
discover dead-end routes

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,958
that are invisible
when viewed from below.

201
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,333
Meng Ao planned it that way:

202
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,583
ideal pits for
trapping his prey.

203
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,875
He sprinkled the entire
fortress with these traps,

204
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,583
laying them out like a maze.

205
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,041
This fortress isn't for defense.

206
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,166
No, it's clearly made
for striking back

207
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,333
at the foes who enter.

208
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,333
Damn you, Meng Ao.

209
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,500
So you're serious about
attacking me, aren't you?

210
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,625
[GUO JIAO]
Amazing!

211
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,333
Here I thought we'd
slowed them down,

212
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,666
but we've killed them!

213
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,916
[MA LING]
Leave it to our lord

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,583
to come up with
something like this!

215
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,791
[GUO JIAO] We built it
as we were instructed,

216
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,875
but we had no idea.

217
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,916
[GUO JIAO]
Talk about a surprise!

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,083
[MA LING] What's surprising
is how it shut down

219
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,708
Lian Po's sneak attack!

220
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:48,166
Did you anticipate his
timely arrival then, my lord?

221
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,125
[MENG AO] Lian Po is a general
of many faces, you see.

222
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,791
[MENG AO] Before war he,
is a resourceful general

223
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,958
who comes up with
complex plans.

224
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,708
And when the fighting begins,
he's an intuitive general

225
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,000
with his finger on the
very pulse of war.

226
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,291
Once he decides to defend,
he becomes a protective general,

227
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,541
the steel wall that guarded
Changpei for two years.

228
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,750
And when it's time to attack,
he's a fierce general

229
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,708
who strikes with deadly force,

230
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,791
in regular tactics or in
very clever schemes.

231
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,250
He has even been known
to head up his own vanguard

232
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,625
ruthlessly sometimes.
That's how intrepid he is,

233
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,250
to his very core.

234
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,208
Intrepid, and a show-off
like none other you have seen.

235
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,750
[laughs]

236
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,791
[MENG AO]
So yes, I saw this coming.

237
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,541
[MA LING]
Remarkable, my lord!

238
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,625
I tip my hat to you.

239
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:44,250
I must say, it really is uncanny
just how well you know Lian Po.

240
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,666
[MENG AO] Indeed, merely losing
to him so many times over

241
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,458
as a young man, I came
to learn Lian Po well.

242
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,208
But that's not all.

243
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,583
It's been about 40 years
since I came to the land of Qin.

244
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:03,333
In this time, I have not
fought Lian Po, not even once.

245
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,625
Yet I know all the
minutest details

246
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,500
of Lian Po's every
moves in battle.

247
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,041
I spent a great
deal of money

248
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,666
to gather that information

249
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,500
and even secretly went
to watch some battles myself.

250
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,333
[MENG AO]
That is right:

251
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,125
I have always...

252
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:34,083
[MENG AO]
...kept a close eye on Lian Po 

253
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,166
[XIN grunts]

254
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,791
This is the end of the
line for you!

00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,166
Xin, sir!

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,166
[WEI PING growls]

257
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,166
Xin's fighting so
hard over there,

258
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,041
we gotta win this here,
right men?

259
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,166
[yelling]

260
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,833
[LUN HU SOLDIER A] Don't let
the Fei Xin Force beat you!

261

[LUN HU SOLDIER B]
Show them what we're made of!

[LUN HU SOLDIERS yell]

What are you
looking at, you rat?!

264
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,583
[XIN]
Right, now!

265
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,916
The other squads are
joining up with ours now.

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,541
If we grow, we won't get out
of one of those dead ends!

267
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,291
[laughs]

268
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,708
Don't fret,
just leave it to me, now.

269
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,625
[ZHAO MESSENGER A]
A new report!

270
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,541
[ZHAO MESSENGER A]
Yesterday, Lian Po's army

271
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,583
appeared at the right
flank and pushed

272
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,708
Wang Jian's army far back!

273
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,125
[KAINE] The general
himself at the right.

274
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,583
[LI MU] This doesn't
look good for Meng Ao.

275
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,708
Lian Po must be creeping up
behind him right about now.

276
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,250
Meng Ao will have to go
without his revenge, then.

277
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,083
[gasps]

278
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,916
[LI MU]
What do you mean?

279
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,041
Huh? Oh! I, um...

280
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,083
It's just that Meng Ao kept
losing to General Lian Po

281
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,291
when he was
in the land of Qi.

282
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,875
It is unclear whether Lian Po
remembers this, but for Meng Ao

283
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,833
this battle is the first
revenge match they have engaged

284
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,833
in decades, my lord.

285
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,708
Ah. I am originally from
Qi myself, as you can see.

286
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,500
I found it rather moving, and--

287
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,875
And again, had I
not mentioned it?

288
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,416
Um, Li Mu, sir?

289
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,458
If only you'd said
something sooner.

290
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,541
[ZHAO TACTICIAN A]
Huh?

291
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,333
[KAINE]
Li Mu, sir?

292
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,541
[LI MU]
I'm almost 100% certain

293
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,833
it's not the case for
General Lian Po,

294
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,541
but when a mighty
commander gets tripped up,

295
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,333
there's always a moment
of inattention or two.

296
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,458
Whenever I go into war,

297
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,875
I do my utmost to
throw my foe off his guard.

298
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,541
[LI MU] If general Lian Po
remembers Meng Ao,

299
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,250
that itself is to
Meng Ao's benefit.

300
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,916
That's because the winner

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,583
tends to view his opponent as
being of a certain caliber.

302
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,833
What is the matter, sir?

303
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,791
[LI MU]
No. That's right.

304
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,791
There's a lot more.

305
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,791
If Meng Ao does in fact
harbor something

306
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,333
incredibly sinister deep
within him for Lian Po.

307
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,875
then he'd have had a complete
40 years to perfect a strategy

308
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,166
against the biggest rival
that he has ever had.

309
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,333
It's become clear to me
at long last:

310
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,666
If Meng Ao is
even a bit better

311
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,625
than Lian Po's
idea of Meng Ao...

312
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,875
[LIAN PO]
This way!

313
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,750
[MA LING]
Damn it!

314
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,958
We can't manage to
snare Lian Po's squad!

315
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,583
[ZHU KE]
He's very lucky!

316
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,333
[LIAN PO]
Over here!

317
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,958
[MENG AO ADVISOR A]
He's going down?

318
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:53,750
[gasps]

319
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,625
Another trap he's dodged!

320
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,291
It... can't be.

321
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,333
[ZHU KE] Does Lian Po
know where the traps are?

322
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,333
[LIAN PO growls]

323
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,750
[LI CHONG]
Impossible!

324
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,791
You cannot see their
layout from down below!

325
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,708
He couldn't have known!

326
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,375
[MENG AO]
Even if he cannot see them,

327
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,000
he can guess
where they might be.

328
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,375
One can still see the
entire fortress

329
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,291
from below before entering.

330
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,875
Given where the fences are
and the layout of the mountain,

331
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,375
it wouldn't be impossible
to pinpoint likely spots.

332
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,291
[ZHU KE] So, he looked at
the fortress first

333
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,666
and knew there were traps?

334
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,041
[MA LING] Um, but even if-even
if he could work out

335
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,750
where they were,

336
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,625
he'd lose the big picture
as soon as he went in.

337
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,375
Memorizing the correct path
through such an intricate maze

338
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,500
so incredibly quickly?

339
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,166
It can't be done!

340
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,416
[MENG AO]
And yet, my esteemed ones,

341
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,000
Lian Po has done it.

342
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,583
He's dodged another one!

343
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,541
They're already halfway up!

344
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,958
[LIAN PO'S ADVISOR A]
All right! Raise the flag!

345
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,791
The general's got us
on the right path now!

346
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,166
[WEI SOLDIERS]
Yes sir!

347
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,625
[WEI SOLDIERS]
Whoa! Look! Over there!

348
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,041
[MENG AO]
So, he's come at last.

349
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:13,375
Lian Po, I know you
incredibly well.

350
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,916
The talent that allows you to
etch this maze's path

351
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,291
into your brain and
follow it to the letter...

352
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,791
[MENG AO]
...comes as no surprise.

353
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,291
And so then, I shall use
your own sheer cleverness

354
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,041
against you here.

355
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,708
Move them, right now!

356
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,208
What-What's that?

357
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,083
There's a new path now
leading straight to a trap!

358
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,208
[MA LING]
There he goes!

359
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,000
Got him!

360
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,250
We've got him!

361
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,083
My lord!

362
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,416
Meng Ao, sir!

363
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,375
[MENG AO] Lian Po,
this fortress's greatest weapon,

364
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,041
the product of 40 years of
careful planning

365
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,041
and dedicated polish.

366
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,708
The maze you figured out
in advance?

367
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:15,875
[SOLDIERS gasping]

368
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,333
[MENG AO] It can easily be
reconfigured after the fact.

369
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,250
[LIAN PO SOLDIERS]
A dead end? Dead end?

370
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,625
[LIAN PO]
Oh no.

371
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,666
Fire!

372
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,916
[XIN]
Behind me,

373
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,541
I know something's
going on at the main camp.

374
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,958
But I can't be thinking
about that right now.

375
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,416
Right now...

376
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,125
[XIN] ...if I take
my eyes off this guy...

377
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,750
...I'm a goner!

378
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,166
[YUAN]
Xin.

379
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,500
Fight alongside the
five-man squad over there!

380
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,375
Don't give them an inch!

381
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,375
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS yell]

382
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,250
Cavalry fights cavalry!

383
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,166
Infantry, back down!
Men, listen up!

384
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,541
Put all you've got
into this one fight!

385
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,750
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS yell]

386
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,500
[CHU SHUI]
Xin...

387
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,333
I'll handle the squad.

388
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,208
And in return for this...

389
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,500
[CHU SHUI] ...you've got
to take Lun Hu's head!

390
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,375
[XIN]
Sorry, Yuan, Chu Shui.

391
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,625
[LUN HU] He's done a fine job
stopping my advance.

392
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,750
Partly thanks to that
wheel thinning the ranks.

393
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,416
These intervening Fei Xin
troops are powerful too.

394
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,958
Both the cavalry
and the infantry.

395
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,708
And then, there's the
other squads

396
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,416
who also answered the
call to join the fray, as well.

397
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,750
In short, the source of the
Qin's army morale around here

398
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,916
is the leader of the
Fei Xin Force, Xin.

399
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,875
This young man here.

400
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,041
He's practically playing
general already, isn't he?

401
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,166
[LUN HU]
His military might aside,

402
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,125
I didn't have his magnetism,
his charisma at that age.

403
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,375
[LUN HU]
This young man really is...

404
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,416
[LUN HU] Do you
understand the significance

405
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,708
of this undertaking,
Xin of the Fei Xin Force?

406
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,750
If you fall, the Qin army
here will be destroyed,

407
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:31,125
and we will rush off to
kill Meng Ao promptly.

408
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:35,375
Keep babbling!
If I take you down right now,

409
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,041
we win the whole central battle!

410
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,000
[XIN]
My path! It's cleared!

411
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,458
[yells]

412
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,416
[horse whinnies,
XIN yells]

413
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,250
A sword-strike to the
thigh while on horseback?

414
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,791
That's lethal.

415
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,708
[XIN]
No!

416
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,166
[XIN screams]
