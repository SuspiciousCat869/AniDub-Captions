Meng Ao and

If you take over as

[LIAN PO] Taking an overall
view of the battlefield,

23
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,208
most of Jie Zifang's left flank
is still scattered

24
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,833
in the mountains at this time.

25
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,458
The central army
has lost Lun Hu

26
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,208
and is practically powerless,
while Qiang Yan's right flank

27
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,250
is in the rear mountains still.

28
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,375
If we had enough time to spare,
I could attempt to rally

29
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,666
the Wei army from
this very spot.

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,833
But a certain someone
won't let that happen.

31

In a mountain fortress
at the rear

and carefully
watching the battle

33
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,375
is Wang Jian.

waiting for the
exact moment to strike.

37
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,250
For 10,000 full-powered
troops to step in now

38
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,166
would undoubtedly be the
precise nail in our coffin.

39
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,333
[XIN]
Wang Jian?

40
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,125
That's Wang Ben's dad, right?

41
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,541
But Qiang Yan can handle
Wang Jian, and then--

42
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,416
He'd only slow him down.

and so much for the
Wei army regrouping.

46
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,458
Then Huan Yi would
mercilessly pick off

Yes, I must admit you're
not bad at all, young boy.

Because for the first time in a
long while I'm seeing in you

a rather accurate glimpse of
who we once really were.

Well then, boy,
since you seem to know so little

about what you speak of,
let me clue you in.

Surpassing or just
even equaling us,

[LIAN PO] Those gloriously
tempestuous days

That's why, even if you go on
to tear up the world,

you'll always be
battling "if only"s.

But there's absolutely nothing
we can do about any of that!

Yes, exactly.

forever safeguarded

...we can prove ourselves...

In spite of this fact,
there is one sure way

that you can surpass

and you shall be
revered by history!

192
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,500
A daring feat? Like what, then?

But... But that... that's a task
so far removed from reality.

198
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:36,125
Indeed it is, hence these
arduous past 500 years

of constant war.

200
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,541
To achieve it will take
astonishing military might

and the capacity to
wield it as well,

202

Not to mention a king
who can handle such a massive

and bloody assignment
to begin with, of course!

204
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,750
Impossible. We'd need
a king greater even than

No, it's not impossible.

It's not impossible, Meng Tian!

A unified Middle Kingdom!

I'm fairly positive
you get to keep it now.

I guess so.

Right, then.

I truthfully have nothing to
discuss with you whatsoever.

our treaty, you know.

I'll send a representative.

how you slice it,

you did beat us respectably.

There are a handful of important
regions in the Middle Kingdom,

but Shanyang is definitely
a big one, for sure.

I thought I would be capable

my face before the king.

317
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,125
[NARRATOR] The road home
took a month to travel.

318
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,458
Along the way,
many wounded soldiers

319
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,208
would breathe their last.

320
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,083
But even this did not
slow down the steps

321
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,458
of any of the homebound
victors whatsoever.

322
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,833
[SOLDIERS laughing, chattering]

323
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,291
[QIANG LEI]
That's right. It's over.

324
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,583
[NARRATOR] And one of them
was about to leave

325
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,083
in a very different way.

326
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,791
[WEI PING]
Oh! Qiang Lei!

327
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,791
[QING]
Lieutenant Qiang Lei!

328
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,958
Y-You're finally awake!
You've been out all this time?

329
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,125
So, you're okay?

330
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,291
--Yeah, I'm okay.
--[gasping]

331
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,125
[FEI XIN SOLDIER A]
What a looker!

332
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,291
She's so cute!

333
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,500
[FEI XIN SOLDIER C]
This could be trouble!

334
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,791
[FEI XIN SOLDIER D]
What's this I'm feeling?

335
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,500
Stop looking at Qiang Lei
all creepy-like, men!

336
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,625
[FEI XIN SOLDIER C] Says the man
with the beet-red face!

337
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,750
[FEI XIN SOLDIER D]
Yeah, that's right!

338
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,625
Ugh, be quiet!

339
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,583
[WEI PING]
Er, so, uh, Qiang Lei,

340
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,916
we all know you're really a
woman and everything now.

341
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,833
We were surprised, but it's
not like it changes anything.

342
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,708
In fact I'm glad
you're a woman.

343
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,000
There were a few times
I admit that I was worried

344
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,666
I might've switched
teams or somethin',

345
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,416
but when I saw you, and
felt all weird inside, I--

346
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,000
Wei Ping, what are
you talking about?

347
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,916
[WEI PING]
I-- Just look, all right?

348
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,208
I'm just saying. Everything is
going to be just like it was!

349
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,666
I got it.

350
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,958
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS]
So cute!

351
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:51,458
Qiang Lei! Are you leaving
to seek revenge right now?

352
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,750
I-I'm sorry. Xin told us
some stuff about it.

353
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,250
Just so you know,
we won't stop you.

354
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,166
Just please tell us
when you are leaving

355
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,541
so we can see you off properly.

356
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,958
[QIANG LEI]
Yeah.

357
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,375
Wei Ping, where is he?

358
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,750
Um, Xin?

359
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,083
Well, he's hurt
pretty bad, as well.

360
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,791
But he'll be all right.

361
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,625
Lu Yan said to just
give him three more days

362
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,250
and he'll come around.

363
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,333
Oh, I see...

364
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,541
Tomorrow, I leave before dawn.

365
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,666
If I head north on the
branch of the Yang River

366
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,125
that runs by here,

367
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,666
I'll go straight to Zhao,
where my revenge awaits.

368
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:04,125
But, that's no reason
to leave while it's still dim.

369
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't know how... to act
when I say bye to you all now.

370
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,750
Truthfully...

371
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,333
Used to be I would laugh and
cry, just like anyone else.

372
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,416
[QIANG LEI] But when
I found Xiang's dead body,

373
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,708
something broke inside me.

374
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,500
I hope I go back to normal
after my revenge.

375
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,125
Well... I guess I'm off.

376
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,750
[QIANG LEI]
Don't hate me.

377
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,625
[QIANG LEI]
Goodbye...

378
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,000
[QIANG LEI]
Couldn't sleep a wink.

379
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,250
[QIANG LEI gasps]

380
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,125
There she goes.

381
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,458
[XIN] And you're planning on
going off for revenge?!

382
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,916
[XIN laughs]

383
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,666
Hey, hurry up and toss
Qiang Lei a rope!

384
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,791
[XIN laughs]

385
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,000
What's the meaning
of this? Huh?!

386
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,750
It's punishment, cause
this is what you get

387
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,500
for trying to sneak off alone!

388
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,958
[gasps]

389
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,416
[XIN]
Look,

390
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,041
you've never been good
at this kinda stuff.

391
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:36,208
Cry or smile or something, it
just doesn't matter what it is!

392
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,083
So I got something to say to you
and your fragile heart,

393
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,791
so listen carefully.

394
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,791
No matter how far away
we might be,

395
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,666
know that we've all
got your back,

396
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,958
tiny as yours happens to be
in reality, don't you see?

397
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,833
[gasps]

398
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,833
Well then, go on Qia--

399
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,625
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS]
Qiang Lei!

400
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:03,250
[XIN screams]

401
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,708
[FEI XIN SOLDIER F]
Xin!

402
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,125
[FEI XIN SOLDIER G]
Commander!

403
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,791
See you guys.

404
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,208
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS yelling]

405
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,750
