00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,375
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,250
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,500
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,375
of the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,541
Wang Ben, Meng Tian, and Xin.

6
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,166
These bold soldiers and
aspiring great generals

7
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,416
were together here now,

8
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,000
ready to usher in
a brand new age!

9
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,750
Having assassinated many of
Meng Ao's 1,000-man commanders,

10
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,125
Lun Hu fought
one-on-one with Xin,

11
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,750
then vanished like the wind.

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,875
But Meng Ao's army was able
to persevere through this,

13
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,833
remaining ultra-vigilant
and prepared

14
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,166
for another possible attack.

15
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,625
[MENG TIAN]
Xin?

16
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,291
Do you have a second?

17
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,125
Oh man, you again.

18
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,083
Can't stay away?

19
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,250
[MENG TIAN]
Don't you make that face.

20
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,791
I'm here because something's
been on my mind.

21
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,458
[XIN]
What is that?

22
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,333
[MENG TIAN] Well, it's all of
those commanders being killed.

23
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,125
You must have heard
all about it by now.

24
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,875
Did you pick up on
anything then, Xin?

25
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,416
[XIN]
What do you mean?

26
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,875
Like, how they were different
from all the Wei troops

27
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,708
we've seen so far.

28
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,333
Different, you say?

29
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,666
Well, uh...

30
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,250
[MENG TIAN]
Hm.

31
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,208
There was this geezer-brat who
was saying all this random stuff

32
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,250
about the heavens,
or something.

33
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,000
Huh?! A geezer-brat?

34
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,208
[XIN] I thought he was
a 300-man commander,

35
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,500
but he was a general!

36
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,583
[XIN laughs]

37
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,166
Name's Lun Ho,
or Land Ho, I dunno.

38
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,208
[MENG TIAN]
Whoa, whoa! He's a general!

39
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,083
At least remember his name!

40
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,625
Well, whoever he is,
he's insanely powerful.

41
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,875
And I get this terrible feeling
he was holding back with me.

42
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:28,875
He's unlike anyone that
we've fought so far.

43
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,500
Do you know anything
about General Lian Po?

44
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,000
[XIN]
Lian Po?

45
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,833
Oh, He's some famous
general guy, right?

46
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,791
Quite strong and
all that, I believe?

47
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,791
"Strong" doesn't
begin to cover it!

48
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,250
He's actually one of Zhao's
Three Greats, as mighty as

49
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,541
Qin's six great generals
I'll have you know!

50
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,750
What? Lian Po was one of
the Three Greats, then?

51
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,000
Lian Po seems to be
currently in exile in Wei.

52
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,375
However, as a former
Zhao general like him,

53
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,416
Wei's King Jingmin
doesn't really trust him.

54
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,250
So in the three years
Lian Po's been exiled there,

55
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,833
the King has not allowed him
to command the Wei army,

56
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,375
not even once.

57
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,666
The entire Middle Kingdom
believes Lian Po

58
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,000
to currently be
out of commission.

59
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,791
But, what if that's all
nonsense in reality?

60
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,291
Huh?

61
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:19,000
Because, if the dispassionate
treatment towards Lian Po

62
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,458
is a massive Wei lie,

63
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,416
we'll be stepping
blindly into a place

64
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,625
where one of the Three Greats
is lying in wait

65
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,541
just to get to us in the end.

66
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,250
Ah! What?

67
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,416
But then--

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,708
[MENG WU]
I see your intuition is still

69
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,416
the only mature thing about you.

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
[MENG TIAN, XIN gasp]

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,625
G-General Meng Wu?!

72
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,750
[MENG WU]
Just where are you going, Tian?

73
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,833
[MENG TIAN gasps]

74
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,416
Father of mine!

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,750
It has been so long!

76
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,958
I'm glad to see
you're looking well.

77
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,125
Wait, he is your,
um, your father?

78
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,041
O-Oh, uh, didn't I mention it?

79
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,625
Uh, you look nothing alike!

80
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,041
[laughs]

81
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:10,166
Say there, boy, what became
of Wang Yi's poleax?

82
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,750
[MENG TIAN, XIN]
Uh...

83
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,416
It's still a little
too heavy for me.

84
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,875
[MENG TIAN]
Xin has Wang Yi's weapon?

85
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,250
If you are never going to use
it, I'll take it off your hands.

86
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,583
Yeah, right!

87
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,875
So then, Father, what brings
you way over here?

88
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,083
I didn't expect you to
be joining this campaign.

89
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm here as Lord
Changping's messenger

90
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,750
concerning the matter
you were discussing earlier.

91
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,083
[MENG TIAN] Xin, that general
you fought earlier on today

92
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,750
was working for Lian Po,
without a doubt.

93
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,333
Looks that way.

94
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,833
Which can only mean

95
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,333
we're already caught
up in his scheme.

96
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,875
Yeah, but being up against
one of the Three Greats

97
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,875
is all the more reason
why we cannot lose!

98
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,041
May I, my lord?

99
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,000
Right now?

100
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,791
What is it?

101
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,708
There's something I
do not understand.

102
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,833
My motivation?

103
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,291
[QIANG YAN]
Yes.

104
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,208
Why my lord would suddenly
rise up at this very moment,

105
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,958
after remaining silent
for three years.

106
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:27,166
Because he encouraged me to do
so, three years ago, so you see.

107
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,083
"He" sir? Who did?

108
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,791
One of Qin's six
great generals, Wang Yi.

109
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,375
[QIANG YAN]
I have not forgotten.

110
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:41,875
Three years ago is when
our Wei exile began.

111
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,541
However, you said Wang Yi
suggested this to you?

112
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:49,291
That's right, he suggested it
when you were travelling

113
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,833
between Wei and
Zhao at the time.

114
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:55,458
So, did Wang Yi send
you a missive then?

115
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,166
[laughs]

116
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,583
Not a missive, no.

117
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:04,166
The man himself appeared
before me in the flesh,

118
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,375
at the very residence that
was provided to me in Wei.

119
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,000
[LIAN PO]
Wang Yi.

120
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,750
Do you know what?

121
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,166
You always did have

122
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,416
this paralyzing effect on me.

123
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:48,333
You have my sympathies for
all your troubles, Lian Po.

124
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,291
[LIAN PO]
How good of you to come.

125
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,583
Come in!

126
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,458
I have prepared good
liquor like before a war!

127
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,541
I'll keep you here drinking
for a full ten days!

128
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,208
[LIAN PO laughs]

129
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,958
[WANG YI laughs]
Much obliged.

130
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,375
[LIAN PO] Wang Yi had had
to go through all that trouble

131
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,708
to cross borders just
to be able to visit me

132
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,750
in Wei exiled from Zhao.

133
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,333
Along the way, he had
stuck his nose into a battle

134
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,166
between Wu Qing and Lord Biao,

135
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,458
so his visit had to remain
a big secret at the time.

136
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,375
Surprising indeed.

137
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,958
How happy you must have been,

138
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,583
enjoying your time with him.

139
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,000
Indeed, happy to
bring tears to my eyes.

140
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,375
But then again,

141
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,625
I really did cry
plenty that night!

142
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,541
[LIAN PO laughs]

143
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,208
[LIAN PO] If Lin Xiangru
of the Three Greats and I

144
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,875
were friends, who would
gladly risk our necks

145
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,791
for one another at any time,

146
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,958
Wang Yi and his fellow
generals were my greatest,

147
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,250
and definitely
most hated foes.

148
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,958
But at the same time, they were
friends with whom I shared

149
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,250
suffering and joy alike.

150
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,833
So when the head of the
six great generals, Bai Qi,

151
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,250
had killed himself,
I wept badly.

152
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,958
And when Liao was done in
by some dirty rogue,

153
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,125
I shook with complete rage.

154
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,166
Then...

155
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,541
How did Wang Yi manage

156
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,916
to successfully
entice you, my lord?

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,458
All that deep blood-tingling
and heavy heart-pounding action

158
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,958
are in the past.
The world's dull.

159
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,750
General, I understand
your sorrow all too well,

160
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,750
I must admit.

161
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,625
However, you see,

162
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,541
if there ever comes a time
when you will take a stand,

163
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,000
let it be in battle
against Meng Ao's army.

164
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,583
That should prove a very
pleasant diversion.

165
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,791
[LIAN PO growls]

166
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,041
Meng Ao?

167
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,458
You mean...

168
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,458
...that pathetic
mediocre general?

169
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,125
[LIAN PO]
Mediocre?

170
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,333
You've really got that right!

171
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,875
[laughs]

172
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,958
[TU MEN]
Lian Po is on the move now?

173
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,583
[RONG BEI] This isn't good
at all, General Tu Men.

174
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,666
Any castle he guards is
practically impervious!

175
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,041
Even when General Bai Qi
took on Lian Po--

176
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,500
Settle down, now.

177
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,125
There is absolutely
no reason to panic.

178
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,583
[QIN SOLDIERS gasp]

179
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,291
Lian Po's arrival was not
unexpected in the slightest.

180
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,083
My lieutenants have always
had detailed plans in place

181
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,375
to deal with him, you see.

182
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,666
[QIN SOLDIERS gasp]

183
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,625
[MENG AO laughs]
It was very good of you

184
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,833
to tell me this, my dearest son.

185
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,541
Knowing this so early means
we can take our time

186
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,208
building our strategy.

187
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,458
It seems today's war council
will run a bit long.

188
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,208
Why don't I find us
something to drink?

189
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,000
That's classic Meng Ao!

190
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,375
He barely bats an eye
at the mention of Lian Po.

191
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:53,000
[MENG AO]
So, Lian Po is back now.

192
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,500
[MENG WU ADVISOR 216A]
Bluffing, you say?

193
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,875
Yes.

194
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,916
General Meng Ao?

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,250
It didn't look like
he was bluffing.

196
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,041
This isn't the
first time my father

197
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,583
has done battle with Lian Po.

198
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,458
[MENG WU ADVISOR 216B]
What? But that can't be right.

199
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,000
[MENG WU] You know very
well that my father and I

200
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,791
are originally from
the kingdom of Qi.

201
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,125
[MENG WU ADVISOR 216B]
Yes, but--

202
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,916
[MENG WU] My father is of the
same generation as Lian Po.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,958
As young soldiers, they fought
each other countless times

204
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,000
in battles between
Qi and Zhao.

205
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,250
What's more,

206
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,791
my father has never been
able to win against him.

207
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,625
What?

208
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,166
No, it can't be.

209
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,708
So when the path to becoming
general was closed to him in Qi,

210
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:37,083
he was shunted over to Qin
with his young son in tow.

211
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,000
Father soon found
success in Qin,

212
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,833
but never faced Lian Po again.

213
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,583
It has been something that
has haunted him ever since.

214
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:48,333
I really doubt Lian Po even
remembers fighting my father

215
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,750
to begin with, truthfully.

216
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,166
For my father,

217
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,333
Lian Po is just like one
huge wall that is simply

218
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,541
insurmountable in his view.

219
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,958
[NARRATOR]
Meng Ao had a strange habit.

220
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,708
[NARRATOR] When he was under
excessive mental pressure,

221
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,375
he would remove his
general's armor at once

222
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,000
and simply transform into
an old and grimy foot soldier

223
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:28,750
and take a stroll
around the camp.

224
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,125
He would cap this off

225
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,500
by sinking back
into a quiet field,

226
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:37,625
and quite simply emptying
his head in nature.

227
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,166
However, that night...

228
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,875
Lian Po.

229
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,375
Why him and why right now, then?

230
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,125
Still, hmm.

231
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,333
Quite an incredibly nice moon.

232
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,708
[XIN]
Yes!

233
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,083

Sorry for stomping on you.

238

You'll be okay.

Ugh...

Hang on, lemme get
you a little nibble.

241

Did you actually catch
that rabbit yourself?

242
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,333
Yeah!

243
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,583
It's my own delicious dinner!

244
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,583
Our rations aren't enough
to fill my hungry belly.

Those higher-ups sure are
stingy to us, huh, Gramps?

[MENG AO]
Mm.

00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,500
[MENG AO]
Oh!

00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,083
[XIN]
Whoa, Gramps!

250
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,166
You're huge!

251
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,750
Who are you? And that beard?

252
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,958
Oh wow! You gotta tell me, now!

253
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,000
[MENG AO laughs]

254
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,375
How very strange.

255
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,541
I've never seen a big
ol' foot soldier like you

256
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,916
around here before.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,416
[laughs] Oh, no?

258
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,291
I have never seen a
youngster foot soldier

259
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,583
like you before, either.

260
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,500
I am actually quite
surprised, myself.

261
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,291
I'm no youngster foot soldier!

262
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,416
Xin of the Fei Xin Force,
a proper 300-man commander!

263
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,125
[MENG AO]
Hm. The Fei Xin Force?

264
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,583
The special forces
so dubbed by Wang Yi?

265
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,541
So then, this is Xin
of the Fei Xin Force.

266
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,458
The one who inherited
Wang Yi's poleax.

267
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,125
[laughs]

268
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,291
So, what're you doing out here?

269
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,375
Well, I was actually

270
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,708
just taking a little
escape from reality.

271
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,541
[laughs] Whaddya mean?

272
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:29,166
Do old men still have lots of
stuff to worry about, as well?

273
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,541
[MENG AO]
Of course we do!

274
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,291
With great experience
comes serious concerns.

275
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:37,500
Well, let this 300-man
commander hear 'em!

276
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,791
All right, then.

277
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,083
Don't mind if I
spill them out to you.

278
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,583
When I was younger,
I never once was able to win

279
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,666
a fight against this one fellow.

280
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,625
[XIN]
Yep, that happens.

281
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,666
Now I'm just a really old man,
see, and it looks like

282
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,041
I'll be fighting him again
in the very near future.

283
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,125
But it appears that he hasn't
grown weak with age at all.

284
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,041
Instead, he's in his
very prime these days.

285
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,583
It boggles my mind.

286
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,333
Wow, I can't imagine being that
old and still in your prime.

287
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:09,416
Yes. He is a monster.

288
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,041
[laughs] It's serious,
is it not?

289
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,291
So, an old man has to take
on this massive monster.

290
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,125
Hmm.

291
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,458
I just don't see the point
in worrying about it.

292
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,458
I mean, you did it, Gramps!

293
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,125
Huh? Wait, boy,
have you listened

294
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,458
to a word I have said to you?

295
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,958
'Course I have!

296
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,083
You gotta fight this monster guy
that's still in his prime,

297
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,250
and you've never managed to
beat him before, am I correct?

298
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,250
But you already did it!

299
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,916
Wait, what do you mean
by "did it", exactly?

300
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,416
You got yourself the
perfect opportunity

301
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,000
to turn the tables on this guy
around this time, for sure!

302
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,583
Huh?

303
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,750
[XIN] Okay then, the winner is
the last man standing, right?

304
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,250
You will win now, and run after.

305
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,125
Then you'll surely have
won the whole thing, see?

306
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,750
Huh?

You startled me!

310

Well, you are definitely
right about that, Commander.

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,250
If I win now,
I will turn the tables,

312
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,125

[GUO JIAO]
As you know, the recent attacks

00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,625
Those units will either be
led by their lieutenants,

320
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,458
or they'll be dissolved
and incorporated

321
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,666
into other units immediately!

322
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,666
Listen, Xin!

323
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,708
This is really important!

324
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,125
[yawns]

325
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,583
[GUO JIAO] However, two
1,000-man commander positions

326
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,166
remain open right now.

327
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,416
Therefore,

328
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,125
we will now be promoting
two 300-man commanders

329
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,541
on the spot,
so listen carefully!

330
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,916
Huh?

331
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,333
Huh? Did he just--

332
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,291
He said they're promoting
300-man commanders

333
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,833
into 1,000-man commanders!

334
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,291
This is great, Xin!

335
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,375
Now you can--

336
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,458
No, just wait a second.

337
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,583
They are promoting

338
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,500
only two commanders,
it sounded like.

339
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,291
Who will they choose?

340
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,250
What's your take, Qiang Lei?

341
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,375
If we're going only by rights,
it'll be Wang Ben and Meng Tian.

342
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,625
[growls]

343
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,250
Aw, hey, wait!

344
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,416
What's going on?

345
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,541
Now those selected:

346
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,541
First up is...

347
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,875
[GUO JIAO]
Meng Tian of the Le Hua Force!

348
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,541
You are hereby promoted
to 1,000-man commander!

349
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,333
Yours will become
a 1,000-man unit

350
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,375
with an extra 700 troops!

351
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,083
[LE HUA FORCE cheers]

352
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,250
You really did it,
Meng Tian, sir!

353
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,375
At long last!

354
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,333
I'm conflicted.

355
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,958
[XIN]
Meng Tian...

356
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,708
What did you expect?

357
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,583
He already was at the
1,000-man command level.

358
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,541
O-Oh yeah.

359
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,333
So then, uh...

360
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,375
Who's the other one?

361
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,458
[GUO JIAO] And the second
300-man commander to be promoted

362
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,125
as of this moment
is none other than...

363
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,791
[GUO JIAO]
Wang Ben of the Yu Feng Force!

364
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:30,666
[YU FENG FORCE cheers]

365
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,625
[laughs] It was only natural
you'd be chosen, sir,

366
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,625
in absolutely every
sense of the word!

367
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,291
[POPS laughs]

368
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,291
[growls] Figured it
would be them!

369
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,916
They do get good results
out in the battlefield,

370
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,333
and they are
nobility, after all.

371
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,625
Are you all right, Xin, sir?

372
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,708
[XIN]
Well, I...

373
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,875
Well, I...

374
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,708
X-Xin, sir.

375
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,875
Xin.

376
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,208
Commander.

377
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,583
You are all dismissed!

378
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,083
[MENG AO]
Wait.

379
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,416
[TU MEN]
Meng Ao, sir! What is it?

380
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,250
Xin of the Fei Xin Force!

381
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,041
Come forward.

382
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,916
Xin, sir, the
general's calling you!

383
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,041
Xin, sir!

384
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,208
Y-Yeah.

385
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,875
[XIN] General Meng Ao
is now calling me?

386
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,083
Huh?

387
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,250
[MENG AO giggles]

388
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,333
Y-You're that guy from last--

389
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:52,166
[MENG AO laughs] If we consider
the sheer ability shown

390
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,291
by Xin of the
Fei Xin Force here,

391
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,458
it is true that
on this campaign

392
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,166
he is definitely outshone
by both Meng Tian

393
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,666
and Wang Ben together.

394
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,291
However, if we look at the
prowess shown in the past

395
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,583
battle with Zhao,

396
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,458
we see he has demonstrated
might beyond that

397
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,666
of a 300-man commander.

398
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,375
In other words, it truly
is worth creating

399
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,458
a third commander's
post just for him

400
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,000
at this moment, as well.

401
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:16,916
Huh?

402
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,250
Wha--?

403
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,000
[GUO JIAO]
But--

404
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,291
I don't understand, sir,
if we need another commander,

405
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,375
there are plenty
to choose from.

406
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,708
Then there's the problem of him
simply being of servant stock.

407
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,041
And why is that
a problem, exactly?

408
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,583
Er, n-nothing.

409
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,791
This is just an
arbitrary decision

410
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,416
that was made on a whim.

411
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,291
Accepting this promotion
will naturally provoke the ire

412
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,583
of those around
you right now.

413
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,208
To silence their objections
once and for all,

414
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,625
I must add a rather extreme
requirement on top of this.

415
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,583
[XIN]
An extreme requirement?

416
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,583
You must take
the enemy's head.

417
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,208
[XIN, SOLDIERS gasp]

418
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,291
[MENG AO] Specifically,
the heads of three or more

419
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,541
1,000-man commanders,

420
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,291
or the head of one general.

421
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,208
If you do not
deliver my requests,

422
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,083
you will be demoted
three ranks,

423
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,250
and must start again
from corporal.

424
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,125
In short,

425
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,916
if you fail,

426
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,666
then, the Fei Xin Force
will be disbanded.

427
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,125
Well, then?

428
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:20,750
Will you still accept this,
Xin of the Fei Xin Force?

429
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,041
[XIN]
Ha! Like I said previously,

430
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,625
that's nothin' worth worrying
about, really, Gramps!

431
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,708
[MENG AO]
Mm-hm.

432
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,958
Impertinent!

433
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,500
How dare you speak
to the general like that!

434
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,708
Anyone who'd back down
'cause he's afraid of failure,

435
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,916
woulda been better off
just stayin' at home, I say!

436
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,666
Starting over from corporal?

437
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,083
If I screw up,

438
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,375
I'll start over from the bottom
rung as a foot soldier!

439
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,416
What's more, I'm thinking much,
much bigger than just

440
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,041
one lousy general's head.

441
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,125
Huh?

442
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,791
This Xin here is
going after the head

443
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,958
of commanding enemy
general, Lian Po!

444
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,333
[MENG AO]
Mmm.

445
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,000
Very well.

446
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,875
Xin of the Fei Xin Force,

447
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:20,208
you are hereby promoted
to a 1,000-man commander!

448
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,875
The Fei Xin Force will
also gain 700 troops

449
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,958
to become a
1,000-man unit!

450
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:33,625
[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]

451
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,583
[XIN]
We did it!

452
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,083
A 1,000-man commander?

453
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,708
I'm sure he's
quite strong and all,

454
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,500
but he's still very
much a child.

455
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,583
Is he sure about this?

456
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,500
[MENG WU]
My father's military skill

457
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,791
may lag behind that
of other generals.

458
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,875
but as a judge of
character, however,

459
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,500
he truthfully is without equal.

460
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,958
If that is who's
recommending him,

461
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,208
he should be fine.
