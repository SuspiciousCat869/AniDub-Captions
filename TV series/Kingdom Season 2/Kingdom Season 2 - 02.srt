00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,875
[NARRATOR] Lü Buwei was once
a merchant who traveled

35
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,833
from kingdom to kingdom.

36
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,041
Some ten years earlier,
while living in Zhao,

37
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,750
he made the acquaintance
of a young man

38
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,791
named Lord Chunping.

39
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,833
A short time before the
upheaval presently at hand,

40
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,791
Lü Buwei wrote a letter
to Lord Chunping,

41
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,666
seemingly out of the blue,

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,041
proposing that the
two work together

to rebuild the relations

44
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,125
between the kingdoms
of Qin and Zhao.

45
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,166
Having gained favor
with King Daoxiang

46
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,416
and wanting to please him,

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,250
Lord Chunping paid
a secret visit to Qin.

48
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:59,083
There, of all things,
he was abducted by Lü Buwei,

49
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,000
who then sent a ransom
note demanding a visit

in return for the hostage.

positive about all of this.

160
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,583
On my signal,

00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,750

Ah!

00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,541
Yes, Xin and Qiang Lei
of the Fei Xin Force

to come here right now.

[XIN] You're telling me
to become an assassin?

172
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,250
I am.

173
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,041
There's no way!

174
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,958
[XIN] Who would stoop to
such a cowardly trick?!

175
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,125
Why, I'd be too
ashamed to even look

176
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,708
General Wang Yi in
the eye afterwards!

177
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,875
[LORD CHANGPING] If you won't
do it, another simply will.

178
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,000
Huh?

179
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,875
[XIN]
M-Meng Wu.

180
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,166
[gasps]

181
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,250
Teng and the commanders!

182
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,291
[LORD CHANGPING]
Xin.

183
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,083
Huh?

184
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,250
My calling you here

185
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,708
was the smallest
kindness I could offer

186
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,791
to the one who received
Wang Yi's poleax.

187
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,375
I do not know why,
but the Minister has allowed

188
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,875
the Zhao contingent
to stay armed.

189
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,416
Huh?

190
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,875
[LORD CHANGPING]
It has taken a strange form,

191
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,208
but at this point,
it can only be war.

192
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,000
I am Li Mu,
chancellor of Zhao.

193
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,708
I am Qin's Minister, Lü Buwei.

194
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,041
[XIN]
Th-This is Li Mu?

195
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,583
His looks say one thing,

196
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,500
but the powerful stink
of war about him

197
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,791
is telling another story.

198
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,500
[ZHENG]
Indeed, Li Mu the military man

199
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,875
has been on
countless battlefields.

200
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,500
It was that experience
that supported his strategy

201
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,833
and made it possible
to lay Wang Yi low!

202
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,083
[CAIZE laughs]
Seems Zhao is simply overwhelmed

203
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,666
by the greatness of
their own minister!

204
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,791
How interesting!

205
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,500
And so we meet at last,
Chancellor Li Mu.

206
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,916
It is a pleasure,
Minister Lü Buwei.

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I do mean it.

Th-They'relaughing!

211
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,041
Truly, thank you for coming
all this way, Chancellor.

212
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,583
So how is Handan
doing nowadays?

213
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,625
It must have grown quite a bit
since I was there last.

214
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,250
Unfortunately, I stay
in the frontier lands

215
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:36,666
so I can't speak to any changes,
but I'm sure you must be right.

216
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,541
Handan takes me back.

217
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,625
A capital like Xianyang,
but differing in opulence.

218
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,541
Why, Handan could be the capital
of the whole Middle Kingdom.

219
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,625
Here it is some dozen years
after having left Zhao,

220
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,708
with you now minister
of the great land of Qin.

221
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,708
You must be so resourceful.

222
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,750
[LÜ BUWEI] Zhao may be my
second home but I am now

223
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,791
a minister of Qin. Its enemy.

224
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,166
In addition to that,

225
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,583
now that we are fighting
my old homeland,

226
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,083
its people must look
upon me with contempt,

227
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,333
I'd imagine so.

228
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,708
[LI MU]
Not at all.

229
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,666
Improving one's station
by serving different nations

230
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,375
is just the way of war.

231
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,166
Actually, Zhao rejoices
to have brought forth

232
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,208
such a great man.

233
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,583
[LÜ BUWEI laughs]
That's good to hear.

234
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,708
And you, Li Mu,
you have been chancellor

235
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,791
for only a year or so.
How are you finding it?

236
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,208
Is it difficult,
being so popular after

237
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,458
having such success
in last year's battle?

238
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,583
If I may be frank,
in a word, it is stifling.

239
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,291
[OFFICIALS gasp]

240
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,541
I'm not the leader type,

241
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,333
so, to be entrusted
with a kingdom

242
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,291
and its people is proving
to be a terrific burden

243
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,916
on my shoulders, I'm afraid.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,375
And I'm not used to
the elegance of cities.

245
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,500
I would like to return
to the frontier...

246

grow old in due time.

249
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,583
Those are the things
I would want.

250
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,166
That's the kind of peaceful
life I want to lead.

251
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,333
[LÜ BUWEI laughs]
Oh, how you jest.

252
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,166
To think a national
hero as yourself

253
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,916
would nurse such a
disheartening dream!

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,583
I expected the man who
was able to finish Wang Yi

255
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,083
to be bigger than
all of that, you see.

256
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,708
Quite the opposite.

257
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,250
It's because I'm a small man

258
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,750
that I formulate these
cunning strategies.

259
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,416
You may call it craven,

260
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,791
but I will do whatever it
takes to remain unharmed.

261
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,000
Since becoming chancellor,
I have truly come

262
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,166
to envy daring men such
as yourself, you see.

263
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,583
But...

264
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:33,458
If I were daring, I would never
have gone after Wang Yi.

[LÜ BUWEI laughs] I understand!
So you're a coward, then!

That's it!

00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,625
Now, shall we move onto
the matter at hand?

268
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,666

before all of us.

[UNDERLINGS, KAINE]
What?!

271
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,750
If you were just
an ordinary tactician,

272
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,291
you would not be
worth killing at all.

But you are not
ordinary in the least.

Call yourself a
coward if you wish,

275

but that is no way to
show your greatness.

It is clear that
you are not greedy.

As the very embodiment
of greed myself,

I tend to view such
people as rather trivial.

Yet you come across as powerful.

And so I shall kill you.

Ha, ha! I am listening.

[LI MU] So. The Middle
Kingdom is in the age

299
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,291
of the Seven Warring
States, right?

300
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:23,125
But these seven kingdoms
differ in their own might.

301
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,125
There's Qin, which
expanded its power

302
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,791
during King Zhao's reign,

303
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,000
and Chu, which spans half
of the Middle Kingdom.

304
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,583
These two are at
the top, and Zhao, Wei,

305
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,375
Qi and Yan are in the middle.

306
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,708
Han is at the bottom,
with its smaller size

307
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,250
and weaker army.

308
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,500
These seven kingdoms maintain
an exquisite balance,

309
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,916
fighting one another for
nearly 200 years now.

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,416
But if we here in Qin truly want

311
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,458
to conquer the Middle Kingdom,

312
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:56,041
then we must stamp out the
other nations, one by one.

313
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,041
Firstly, we would turn
to the weaker Han.

314
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:05,208
[LI MU]
Han is significant for Qin.

315
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,958
Han is blocking Qin's path

316
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,000
to the rest of the
Middle Kingdom.

317
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,333
Until the time comes when
Qin finally destroys Han,

318
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,333
our dream will
never be realized.

319
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,583
Now, here's the rub
in this situation

320
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,291
that you must understand:

321
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,875
You see, the weak kingdom
of Han will never fall.

322
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,541
If Qin tries to take
it down, it will face a war.

323
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,125
Zhao and Wei will send
reinforcements into Han,

324
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,833
that situation is unavoidable.

325
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,916
[XIN]
Say what?!

326
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,250
[LI MU]
So then, Wei and Zhao see Han

327
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,000
as the shield keeping
Qin in check.

328
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,333
Without Han, Qin's sword
would soon be at their necks,

329
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,750
and they will jump
in to defend Han.

330
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,166
So, Han shouldn't be
Qin's first target at all.

331
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,166
Go after Wei.

332
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,541
Give Wei a thorough
beating until they lack

333
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,875
the strength to help Han at all.

334
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,291
Once you've done that,
only Zhao can come to Han's aid.

335
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:03,750
But this is where I,
Chancellor Li Mu vow that.

336
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,166
Zhao will provide
Han with no assistance.

between Yan and Qin,

with whom we have
a storied past.

345

Zhao's greatest
challenge is having to

346
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,791
divide its power between them.

347
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:34,208
Therefore, we will henceforth
focus on our battle with Yan.

At this time, Qin will
make a promise

There is no farce here.

I do understand
just how you feel.

But soldiers are not
welcome here at all.

Huh, this is surprising indeed.

00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:38,250
For Zhao to propose an
unlikely alliance with Qin.

[LORD CHANGWEN] Killing

There are many drawbacks

[LORD CHANGWEN]
He-He said no?!

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,000
Of course, someone like Li Mu

381
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,416
would come proposing
an alliance.

382
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,708
Allying with Zhao
at this juncture

383
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,833
would greatly benefit
both kingdoms, no doubt.

384
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,125
However, as for
Li Mu the proposer?

385
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:19,291
You are Zhao's one and only
treasure now, I believe.

386
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,416
In comparing the sheer
value of your head

387
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,875
to that of this
possible alliance,

388
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,750
I clearly find that,
by a small margin,

389
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,000
your head is the greater prize.

390

But,

Hm, all right Li Mu,

You mean for me to simply

400

hand over a castle to you?

I know the absolute
perfect spot.

It's where I often traveled
way back in my merchant days!

In Hangao, wasn't it, I believe?

Hangao?

408
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,208
Is that-- is that the one
in the southwest of Zhao?

409
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,208
Undoubtedly so.

Thanks to changing borders,

411

Hangao has experienced
a recent surge

in military importance.

413
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:26,000
With that in mind, Li Mu started
boosting the area's defense,

414
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,000
as soon as he became chancellor,

415
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,458
building a giant
castle at its center

416
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,458
that we are told
is near completion.

417
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,291
If we attempted to
capture that castle,

how many soldiers' lives,
how much money,

419

how much time would it take?

420
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,583
To simply demand the castle
in Hangao is utterly mad.

He drives a hard
bargain, doesn't he?

Surely he would be satisfied
with the common ground

425
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,708
that would exist of
a Qin-Zhao alliance.

426
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,416
It's his merchant spirit
that's making him squeeze

427
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,375
a little harder than
he really needs to.

lower the minister's

not have a castle.

promptly allow it.

After all, we have Lord Chunping

439
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,833

him back badly enough

Perhaps you'd consider
another castle then.

That one is still being built,

to the Wei border

No, I want Hangao.
