Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,000
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,833
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,625
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:48,625
Their opponent: the
legendary general Lian Po.

6
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,541
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

7
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,708
their sights set
on a major victory.

It can't be!

00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,250
Oh, no.

War chariots in this smoke?

There's only one...

Only one way through this.

00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,375
[XUAN FENG]
There's a thrill to war that

25
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,166
quite honestly has
no equal at all.

26
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,125
For a strategist like me,
it's using your own brain

27
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,458
to manipulate the fighting
of a multitude of men

28
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,583
into complete
one-sided massacre.

29
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,750
[NARRATOR]
Indeed, Xuan Feng's strategies

30
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,541
controlled the battlefield

31
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,125
as though war were simply

32
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,125
a mere board game,
and not real life,

33
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,416
dispatching Qin troops
with great efficiency.

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,708
Behind the smokescreen,
the once-confused Wei troops

35
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,083
were divided up
into several zones

36
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,250
and repositioned accordingly.

37
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,333
Next up, the archers
attacked the Qin troops,

38
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,833
while at the same time,

39
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,708
herding them to crowd
together in a straight line,

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,958
a "road" of Qin soldiers down

41
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,041
which the chariot
squadron barreled.

42
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,458
Of course, the
smoke-blinded Qin troops

43
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,750
were completely unaware that
all of this was happening then.

44
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,666
When the war chariots
attacked thick and fast,

45
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,833
they could barely manage it.

46
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,916
Behind this great smokescreen,

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,375
unfathomable both
inside and out,

48
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,333
rose up a truly
horrific mountain

You must've heard
that occasional

65
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,958
high-pitched bell around.

66
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,375
That's giving our position,
to the archers

67
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,416
and the chariot squadron.

68
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,041
It's the rhythm, I think!

69
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,208
You're right.

70
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,458
If we put out a similar
sound to theirs,

71
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,041
then we can disrupt
their communication.

72
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,208
Right.

73
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,208
First off, have
everyone find things

74
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,083
that make a similar
sound to that one,

Another signal?

Sounds like a gong.

A signal from the
main forces, I'd guess.

greater direction.

If we somehow make it that far

It's hard to say.

Since we cannot see inside,

156
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,500
we can't tell where to
send reinforcements--

or how, really.

158

That smokescreen, though,
it's no ordinary smoke.

159

If the Wei troops are
fighting in there too,

160

the smoke must be made
of something breathable.

Anyone who'd bring something
like that to the battle

00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,208
No, wait you guys!

327
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,458
Inconceivable,
there was no signal

328
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,791
warning of their arrival at all!

329
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,000
[XUAN FENG]
Oh.

330
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,958
They must have
exterminated the surrounding

331
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,083
sound corps first, I suppose.

332
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,125
And in such a really
short time, I must admit.

333
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,250
Ha!

334
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,625
We might have
a real contender here!

335
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,541
[growls]

336
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,875
[FEI XIN SOLDIER]
Commander!

337
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,750
[XIN]
It's you! You're all right!

338
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,208
[FEI XIN SOLDIER A]
And you, sir!

339
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,750
[FEI XIN SOLDIER B] We used
bodies as stepping-stones

340
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,541
to cross just like the
Yu Feng Force did.

341
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,958
[XIN]
Right!

342
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,541
We can still do this!

343
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,333
After the Yu Feng Force!

344
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,041
That general's head
belongs to us alone, men!

345
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,625
[FEI XIN FORCE yells]

346
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,875
Why! They just keep
going and going now!

347
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,916
Did our sound
interference even work?

348
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,125
Those rogues have switched to a
rolling sound and new rhythm!

349
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,166
That means--

350
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,083
[QIN SOLDIER C] The third
unit has been destroyed!

351
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,458
Now, Fei Xin Force!

352
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,458
Hang in there a little longer!

353
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,083
If we can just get through this,

354
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,333
I know our commander
will kill their general

355
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,958
and come back to us!

356
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,916
[YUAN]
Xin...

357
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,291
[XIN yells]

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,791
[XIN] We caught up
to the Yu Feng Force?

359
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,416
[CHU SHUI]
They don't have their strength.

360
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,166
It's likely due to Commander
Wang Ben being wounded now.

361
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,000
[XIN] Did that idiot go
and get himself hurt?

362
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,250
[XIN]
Hey!

363
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,416
Why're you goin' all pale for a
little scrape, Little Lord Wang?

364
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,708
How 'bout providing us a little
combat support here, huh?

365
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,958
That little brat!

366
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,291
He has no clue my lord's
wounds are quite deep!

367
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,041
You call that encouragement?

368
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,875
How you insult me!

369
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,375
[FAN YANG]
My lord!

370
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,958
[FAN YANG]
Wang Ben's in front!

371
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,791
Go on, go!

372
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:03,250
[YU FENG FORCE yells]

373
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,208
[XUAN FENG]
See, I told you.

374
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,250
If you think a battle will
go well on force alone,

375
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,000
you are greatly mistaken!

376
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,333
[WEI SOLDIER J]
Fifth and sixth units, advance!

377
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,500
Seventh and eight units,
spread out now!

378
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,708
Enemy garrison aid!

379
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,416
Doesn't matter!

380
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,416
Their general...

381
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,958
[XIN]
...is right there!

382
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,500
[YU FENG SOLDIER A]
Reinforcements!

383
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,666
[FAN YANG] I don't care,
there aren't enough to matter!

384
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,708
Just keep moving forward!

385
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,416
[WANG BEN] A dust cloud
in the enemy's main camp?

386
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,875
Are they changing
formations again?

387
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,416
[CHU SHUI]
Commander!

388
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,250
[XIN]
Why, you!

389
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,000
Go now! We can make it through!

390
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,625
Xuan Feng, sir,
preparations are complete!

391
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,750
Look out! Something's not right!

392
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,083
[yells]

393
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,708
All right.

394
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,500
Retreat!

395
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,625
[gasps]

396
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,250
[XIN]
They-They ran away?

397
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,583
W-What on Earth?

398
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,625
What about all these
other guards, then?

399
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,958
Is this just another trap?

400
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,541
[XUAN FENG] Sound the retreat
gong for the troops, right now!

401
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,041
[XUAN FENG'S ADJUTANT]
Yes, sir!

402
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:36,125
[gong rinigng]

403

[gong rinigng]

404
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,958
[FAN YANG]
L-Look!

405
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,125
The Wei army is
retreating en masse!

406
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,750
We drove them off.

407
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,541
We did it, men!

408
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,166
We did it!

409
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:02,208
[QIN SOLDIERS cheering]

410
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,666
[LIAN PO] The strategist
Xuan Feng possesses none

411
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,208
of the military man's pride,
as you can clearly see now.

412
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,166
He pulls out.

413
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,000
Simple as that.

414
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:26,000
That's only after he judges all
his work to be mostly done,

415
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,791
that is, of course, you see.

416
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,500
If I'd had my way, I'd have
trampled them a while longer.

417
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,791
But it's fine, no matter.

418
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,458
The job's 80% complete.

419
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,750
And if I ask for too much...

420
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,416
...I'll die a little too soon.

421
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,541
[gasps] Xuan Feng, sir!

422
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,333
[XUAN FENG]
Hm?

[WEI SOLDIERS gasp]

425
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,250
[XIN]
I missed!

426
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,708
[yells]

427
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,041
[CHU SHUI]
Xin, wait! Don't be rash!

428
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,916
[XIN]
Stay outta this, Chu Shui!

429
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,041
Our blades won't reach that
general anymore at the moment!

430
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,416
We've made them retreat, isn't
that enough, at least for now?

431
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,625
No, not by a long shot!

432
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,416
[XIN]
They retreated, so what?

433
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,583
We lost how many of our
men in the meantime?

434
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:37,250
They toyed with us horribly and
left us in pieces, afterwards!

435
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,583
Damn it. Damn it all!

436
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,375
[NARRATOR]
Xin was certainly right.

437
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,708
When the smoke finally cleared
from the battlefield,

438
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,833
the Qin army was aghast at
the sheer number of bodies

439
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,666
that lay on the ground.

440
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,333
They had suffered a crushing
defeat before they knew it.

441
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:05,666
[LUN HU'S SOLDIERS cheer]

442
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,833
[NARRATOR] The Qin army's
big sortie was quite simply

443
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,291
a failure from the very start.
