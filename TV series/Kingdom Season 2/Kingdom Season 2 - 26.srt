Under the rule of Ying

for unification,

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,541
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

on the neighboring land of Wei.

00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,791
Their opponent: the
legendary general Lian Po.

00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,750
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,833
their sights set
on a major victory.

[WEI SOLDIERS yelling]

00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,625
[NARRATOR]
It was said that Wei's soldiers

13
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,416
were so incredibly serious

14
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,541
that they lacked
raw explosive power.

15
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:22,625
But with Lian Po's presence,
they broke free of those bonds.

16
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,875
[WEI SOLDIER A]

Commander Bi!

00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,708
[BI'S UNDERLING B]
Sir, the sheer momentum

19
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,166
of the Wei infantry--

20
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,750
[BI]
Stay calm. Just stay calm.

21
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,125
A commander needs to be
cool-headed at a time like this.

22
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,583
[gasps]

23
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,291
[BI] The clifftops are still
under our control, though.

24
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,291
[BI] The Qin army still has all
the advantages of this terrain!

25
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,416
The only part of the
clifftops we've lost

26
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,291
is right where Lian Po
suddenly appeared.

27
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,708
I've got it!

28
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,125
Given how fast Lian Po
came here from their main camp,

29
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,083
as well as how we didn't
see him coming over here at all,

30
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,666
[BI] I would generously
estimate his troops

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,000
currently at about
a thousand men!

32
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,916
Taking into account the
casualties thus far,

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,458
I'd say there are maybe
about 8,000 Wei troops,

34
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,208
to Qin's 10 at the moment.

35
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,041
Almost no difference on
numbers alone.

36
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,500
Lian Po's appearance may
have given their morale a boost,

37
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,416
but we still have the absolute
advantage in these straits!

38
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,583
[BI] Defeating Lian Po all
comes down to how we fight!

[WANG JIAN'S ADVISOR A]
Qiang Yan is fleeing

40

to the other side!

41
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,541
[WANG JIAN]
Let him go.

42
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,291
Our central army is a
complete mess right now.

43
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,875
Get the commanders
to rebuild our formations.

44
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,333
Sir!

45
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,541
[LIAN PO] So it appears
that they're the ones

46
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,375
regrouping first, at the moment.

47
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,916
[laughs]

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,125
And what exactly will your
next move be then, Wang Jian?

49
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,625
[NARRATOR] Lian Po was very
interested in discovering

50
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:07,000
what Wang Jian's actions
would be from here on out.

51
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,208
The armies were
matched in numbers.

52
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,125
The Qin army had the benefit
of the most ideal terrain

53
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,916
while the Wei army
was high on morale.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,166
A strategist couldn't ask
for better ingredients

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,833
with which to show his skills.

56

[WANG JIAN'S ADVISOR A]
All squads have been regrouped!

57
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,333
[WANG JIAN] Just make sure
that they don't chip away

58
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,958
at our main units, though.

59
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,625
[WANG JIAN'S ADVISOR B]
Understood, sir.

60
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,375
[NARRATOR] Wang Yi
thought him to be on a par

61
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,250
with Qin's six great generals.

62
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,541
It remained to be seen
what Wang Jian would cook up.

63
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,791
Lian Po was using
this battle as a yardstick

64
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,166
to truly measure
Wang Jian's military worth.

65
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,916
[NARRATOR] However,

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,291
Wang Jian would betray Lian Po's
expectations most splendidly.

67
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,791
All right.

We're pulling out?

With such a
good opportunity, why?

I don't know!

00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,750
We're bringing up the rear,
so just look sharp!

I don't understand.

Why are you so happy to have
been thwarted in this manner?

Am I happy, then?

Seems so.

Perhaps I am!

Tell me, who among Qin's
six great generals

90
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,875
have you fought against,
Qiang Yan?

91
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,708
Of the six great generals?

92
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,291
[QIANG YAN]
Bai Qi...

00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,000

95
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,708
Liao...

96
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,083
These four.

97
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,625
Who was the most
intense of those four?

98
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,375
Intense?

99
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,333
For me that was Liao, I believe.

100
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,708
Our mutual emphasis on
offense always meant

101
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,500
countless casualties
on both sides, you see.

102
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,875
[laughs]

103
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,458
Liao's attacks always
were particularly atrocious.

104
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:36,375
So who of those four was
the hardest to handle, then?

105
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,166
Bai Qi, the leader
of the six great generals.

106
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,458
[LIAN PO] I thought so.
He was my toughest, too.

107
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,791
Though Bai Qi was
no risk-taker, really.

108
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,916
No matter how tasty
the bait dangled before him,

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,541
he never rose to take it.

110
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,791
The more muscular
my approach became,

111
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,333
the more slow and relaxed
his response to me was.

112
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,625
He always had a good read

113
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,208
on his opponent's
state of mind, as well.

114
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,291
I would chase Bai Qi too far
out of sheer anger

115
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,166
only to have him retaliate.

116
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,208
That was our
little routine, see.

117
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,333
[LIAN PO laughs]

118
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,583
Why mention all of
this right now, then?

119
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,458
The thing is that somehow,

120
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,666
watching Wang Jian
as he sauntered away

121
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,500
reminded me so much of
Bai Qi and how he used to be.

122
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,500
Then Wang Jian is
equal to Bai Qi?

123
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,750
[LIAN PO laughs]

124
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,291
[LIAN PO] Well, I really
wouldn't go that far.

125
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,291
However, I honestly do believe
that their fighting styles

126
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,250
have several points in common.

127
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,333
And very similar
fighting styles between them.

128
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,000
It may indicate they share
a pretty similar view

of the world, as well.

130
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,541
That could be true,

131
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,208
but his scheme to appear in the
straits was truly excellent.

132
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,416
But based on that alone?

133
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,666
In any case,
Bai Qi was a real monster.

really did it all.

How many times I chased
after his army just like this?

140
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,291
Wherever he ran to he would have
something just waiting there

to stop me right in my
tracks on time.

in the middle of a campaign.

150

This is enough to know
the extent of his skill.

151
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:49,083
Could he have built this
in expectation of my arrival?

To think a man like you

A natural stronghold.

Wang Jian has seen more terrain
in this battle than anyone else.

But to find something
like this and those straits?

00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,708
and to strike unprepared
means many casualties.

That's the Fei Xin Force.

It appears their commander

The battle was so chaotic that
the squads that had gone alone

to their original positions.

We may still have someone
on our tail, men!

What are you, General Wang Jian?

What are you thinking?

196
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,333
[BI]
Firstly, using us as a decoy,

197
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,125
then sacrificing
all those soldiers

198
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,333
only to run right afterwards?

199
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,041
Never mind Qiang Yan.

200
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,208
You're the one
I don't understand.

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,291
[LIAN PO]
Rare is the commander

202
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,791
with fortress-building
capabilities.

203
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,750
Of the six great generals,
only Bai Qi could do so.

204
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,208
I had my share of trouble
with Bai Qi's defenses.

205
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,333
This fine building
stands up to any of his.

206
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,666
The depth of his
schemes and uniqueness,

207
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,625
I really believe match up to
those of Bai Qi back in the day.

208
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,500
Although, I'd say this
is where you differ greatly.

209
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,166
See, Wang Jian,

210
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,833
you are a lieutenant,

211
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,166
and in this battle you
believed yourself to be

212
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,583
the Qin army's best and
brightest of them all,

213
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,208
quite frankly.

214
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,041
Your behavior made
this all incredibly clear now.

215
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,041
Definitely.

216
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,208
[LIAN PO] It may be
difficult for us to strike

217
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,291
Wang Jian in that fortress,
but on the other hand,

218
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,458
we have him trapped
right there as well.

219
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:18,041
If the Qin army's main power
is in its left and right flanks,

220
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,833
this'll be a great blow.

221
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,750
Plus, this erases half the means

222
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,916
the Qin army had to cope
with a worst-case scenario.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,583
Surely he must have
realized all of this, too!

224
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,416
[WANG JIAN] At this moment,
my land has a desperate need

225
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,000
of a war-strong man
such as yourself.

226
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,291
It seems Wang Jian is lacking
something imperative

227
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,166
needed as a very good commander.

228
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,458
[LIAN PO]
Greatly lacking!

229
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,250
The man is twisted indeed.

230
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,250
Wang Jian, I know why
you never let the sun

231
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,291
shine on you until today

232
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,083
going back to the
days of King Zhao.

233
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:00,875
A commander who puts himself
first, truly cannot be trusted.

234
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,833
No matter how skilled
you are in battle,

235
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,291
no one will see you as a
hero when this is all over.

236
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,791
You surely stand a completely
different path than we do.

237
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,708
[LIAN PO] I won't go so far as
to discount you completely,

238
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,250
but I've lost interest.

239
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,458
Qiang Yan,
I leave this place to you.

240
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,791
After all is said and done,
Wang Jian has removed himself

241
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,208
from the battlefield.

242
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,000
He won't be making
any moves for a while.

243
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,458
And you, my lord?

244
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,125
Going back to basics.

245
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,875
War is about killing the
general, am I right?

246
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,833
Perhaps it's time I give that
miserable acquaintance of mine

247
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,583
a proper send-off.

248
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,833
[LIAN PO] I'll have this war
over by tomorrow, Qiang Yan!

[MENG AO]
So, Tu Men and Rong Bei

252
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,708
have given you a
piece of their minds.

253
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes, and one slap
apiece at that, too.

254
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,833
[MENG AO laughs]

255
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,541
Well, I am really
pleased it ended there.

256
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,250
Well, what is it you needed,
General Meng Ao?

257
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,625
Enough of that.
At this very moment,

258
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,666
we're just a grandpa and
his grandson simply talking.

259
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,416
Come here, Tian.

260
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,000
What's the matter, Grandpa?
You're acting different.

261
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,833
I don't like it one bit,
you know.

262
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,333
[MENG AO]
Don't say that, Tian.

263
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,916
Strangely, there are some things
you come to understand

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,041
at my age.

265
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,083
It is just like when a
desperate battle

266
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,000
is rapidly approaching him.

267

See, that's just
not like you at all.

268
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,791
Remaining calm and reasonable
in battle is the Bai Lao way!

00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,666
[MENG AO laughs]

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,583
Usually, yes. However,

left its mark now.

Look, Xiang.

[ZHENG] I got these during
my brother's uprising.

Absolutely not! Not at all!

I'm not lying! I swear!

Hey! What is that stuff?!

00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,833
[QIANG LEI]
I take it he was strong?

320
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,583
"Strong" doesn't even
begin to cover it.

321
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,583
I mean he wasn't a monster
like that Pang Nuan guy was,

322
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,541
but then again, you can't
go comparing them.

323
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,708
He had the strength of a man
who'd fought many battles,

324
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,416
who'd faced death and
overcome his own limits

325
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,750
time and time again.

326
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,750
And me, too. I...

327
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,708
...don't know how to put it...

328
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,166
I just feel like I've
really overcome

329
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,750
one of my own limits, as well.

330
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,708
[QIANG LEI]
I see. So that's what it is.

331
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,458
Even all beat-up like this,
his presence is bigger and

332
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,541
radiates more than ever before.

333
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,666
[XIN] I guess it's kinda weird
for the loser to be saying that.

334
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,583
[XIN chuckles]

335
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,125
[XIN]
But listen,

336
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,375
all these people were dying and
I went and screwed it up.

337
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,958
And I'm gonna settle that
once and for all!

338
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,666
Next time for sure.

339
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll kill him
with my bare hands!

340
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,333
Then you need to get
some sleep and recover.

341
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,375
You are not fighting anyone
till that fever's gone.

342
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:44,250
With your help and medicine,
I'll be back to my old self!

343
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,416
[QIANG LEI]
You will not.

344
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,583
[XIN laughs]

345
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,750
Things aren't that
convenient, are they?

346
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,541
[gasps]

347
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,375
What is this?
Are you sleeping here?

348
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,958
That medicine is
very strong, you know.

349
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,416
So your body might reject it.

350
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,916
I will keep an eye
on you for a while.

351
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,583
[XIN] But really,
you just want to be with me.

352
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,000
[QIANG LEI]
Never mind that.

353
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,291
If your condition worsens,
feel free to die.

354
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,916
[XIN]
I was kidding! Kidding!

355

357

[XIN]
Once this war's over,

358
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,416
we won't be able
to just talk like this.

359
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,375
I hate to say this,
but I'll miss it.

360
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,000
[QIANG LEI] Don't worry about
things past tomorrow.

361
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,125
I'm positive that this war
just won't end that easily,

362
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:39,958
you know.

363
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,833
[XIN]
Yeah...

364
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,541
I guess you're right.

365

[FEI XIN SOLDIERS murmuring]

366

[WEI PING grunts]

367
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,166
Now that I look around, it's
like everyone's injured, too.

368
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,875
Well, of course they are.

369
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,750
How many days has it been?

370
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,583
It makes sense having
many injured soldiers.

371
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,833
But you know that Xin's
really hurt worst of all.

372
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,666
With a fever on
top of those cuts

373
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,583
he'll be flat on his back
for two or three d--

00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,458
Hey, who did that?!

00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,583
X-Xin?!

00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,958
Are you really okay now?!

382
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,833
Just fine, see?

383
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,916
And...

That's our commander!

00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,666
[FEI XIN SOLDIER H]
Amazing!

388
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,166
[FEI XIN SOLDIER I]
That went down to the bone!

389
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,375
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 226J]
Xin, all right!

390
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,333
Um, you sure
healed up quick, Xin.

391
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,416
Honestly, I thought your
right hand was a goner.

392
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,083
It was Qiang Lei.

393
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,666
Gave me some great special
medicine for the wounds.

394
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,916
[QIANG LEI]
It wasn't just the medicine.

395
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,291
[XIN]
Qiang Lei?

396
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,583
[QIANG LEI] It was
half thanks to the medicine,

397
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,875
and half thanks
to your own crazy

398
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,750
power of recovery, as well.

399

Qiang Lei...

[XIN]
Qiang Lei!

401
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,416
Today is the day that
we crush the Wei army!

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,583
Right! Get ready
for another charge!

403
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,250
We're gonna hit 'em hard!

405
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,375
[LUN HU chuckles]

406
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,333
They're starting the
day off right!

407
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,791
Sounds like it!

408
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,958
[NARRATOR] This was the
sixth day in the battle

409
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,541
on the Liuyi Plains.

410
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,458
It had been about two and a half
months since the Qin army

411
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,125
had embarked on the
Shanyang Offensive.

412
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,250
Even though they had
taken 16 fortified cities,

413
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,458
their goal was still
to secure Shanyang,

414
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,083
the militarily vital
stronghold beyond them all.

415
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,708
Unless the Qin army
could destroy Wei

416
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,000
which had moved to
protect Shanyang,

417
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:18,375
their entire offensive would
surely end in utter failure.

418
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:22,791
Defending Wei,
attacking Qin, as well as

419
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,625
the strong foes from
other lands who watched them,

420
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,041
the myriad great thoughts
and expectations

421
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,875
of the entire Middle Kingdom

422
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,666
were focused solely on Shanyang.

423
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,916
Um, Xin, sir?

424
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,875
[laughs]

425
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,291
I guess they can't
see me, huh?

426
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,833
[NARRATOR] And there,
the men who risked their lives

427
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,750
in the battle at its
very center,

428
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,666
came to a strange realization.

429
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,041
Why, yes, certainly.

430
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,125
[NARRATOR] Finally,
the curtain was now rising.

431
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,875
on the final day of the
Great Shanyang Offensive!
