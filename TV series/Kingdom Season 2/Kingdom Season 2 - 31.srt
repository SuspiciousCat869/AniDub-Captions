1
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,250
[NARRATOR] A fierce battle is
nearing its end, finally,

2
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:47,083
as Meng Ao comes face to face
with Lian Po at long last.

3
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,000
Can the perpetual loser
of the past

4
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,708
settle the score
once and for all

5
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,375
with his lifetime foe
this time around?

6
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,125
--Ow!
--Can you stand?

7
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,416
Just stop the bleeding
on my leg right now.

8
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,875
And bring me a horse,
immediately.

9
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,208
Hey, Yuan!

10
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,875
How's their army look?

11
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,916
Sir, their momentum
has slowed down now,

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,166
with word of Lun Hu's death,

13
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,958
but they haven't fallen
completely yet.

14
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,083
But we do have the upper hand.

15
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,833
[YUAN]
For now.

16
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,000
[XIN] Sorry Yuan,
can you take over for me?

17
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,208
Xin, you can't mean--

18
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,666
Yeah.

19
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,416
[XIN] There's one last
place I got to go now.

20
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,333
[WEI SOLDIERS scream]

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,125
You must keep the enemy at bay,
no matter what it takes!

22
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,708
If they get past us, they will
reach the main camp

23
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,291
at the summit in no time at all!

Here he comes!
Get ready this second!

28
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,083
[QIN GUARD B]
It's Lian Po!

29
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,916
[QIN GUARD C]
Lian Po's coming!

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,875
[MENG AO] So then, the time has
finally come, at long last.

31
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,375
Time to decisively
unleash 40 years

32
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,083
of deeply heated
emotions on you,

33
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,875
Lian Po!

34
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,083
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in the central battle,

35
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,750
Lun Hu's death
had taken the wind

36
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,708
out of the Wei army's sails.

37
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:50,541
We are so close to the end!
Hang in there, Yu Feng Force!

[YU FENG SOLDIERS yell]

[WANG BEN grunts]

40
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,583
You are concerned about
the main camp, I see.

41
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,458
Well, sir? What shall we do now?

42
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,000
Listen. We will
battle right here.

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,708
We cannot let even
a single Wei soldier

44
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,750
get up to the
main camp right now.

45
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,250
That's our mission as
a rear mobile unit, you see.

46
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,708
[FAN YANG]
What remarkable resolve, sir!

47
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,208
Let's go, Fan Yang!

48
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,208
Yes sir!

49
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,416
[BOTH] Haah!

50
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,583
[YU FENG SOLDIERS yelling]

51
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,208

Please be all right,

56
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,250
[MENG TIAN]
Heading to the main camp?

57
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,375
I came down the second
I heard you had killed Lun Hu.

58
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,875
I see.

59
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,500
So you really did kill him
with your own two hands.

60
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,666
Those wounds speak volumes
about the intensity

61
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,625
of that deadly fight.

62
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,083
You pulled off quite
possibly the biggest feat

63
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,666
of this whole battle!

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,666
[XIN] Well, not counting your
strategy yesterday, that is.

65
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,083
However, if we
lose this battle now,

66
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,250
all of this will be for nothing.

67
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,125
We've gotta hurry.

68
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,541
Come on, let's get
to our general!

69
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,208
[MENG TIAN]
Yeah!

70
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,583
[LIAN PO snarls]

71
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,125
[LIAN PO] I believe that their
continued focus on us

72
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,708
at the moment is definite proof

73
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,250
that the central army isn't
closing in from the front.

74
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,541
[LIAN PO] Has something
happened to Lun Hu?

75
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,166
[GUO JIAO]
Oh no! He's coming!

76
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,916
Tighten the ranks
in the front!

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,416
Step it up, guards!

Hurry!

79
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,291
[QIN GUARD E]
Over there!

80
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,750
[ZHU KE]
Fetch the general's horse!

81
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,625
You need to leave, my lord!

82
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,083
[MENG AO]
No need.

83
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:17,000
I will not
back down right now!

[GUO JIAO]
Completely understood, my lord.

87
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,250
Intercept them!
Do whatever it takes,

88
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,083
whatever to stop Lian Po!

[LIAN PO snarls]

90
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,208
[GUO JIAO]
Stop Lian Po at once!

91
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,875
[QIN GUARD F] They're not
evacuating the main camp?

92
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,250
What? Seriously? Whoa-oh!

93
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,708

Here he comes!

Fire arrows! And line up
all of the spearmen!

[yells]

96
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,416
Use that other trick!

97
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,041
But that trick's only for when
the troops below have withdrawn

98
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,791
or have been wiped out!

99
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,000
We have no choice!

100
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,500
[QIN GUARD H]
But our allies, Sir--

101

We can't hold out much longer!

104
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,750

[GUO JIAO]
Lian Po has arrived!

124
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,708
I had planned on a pincer attack
striking from front and back,

125
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:02,208
but in the end I only needed
to attack from just one side.

So dull!

127

A battle such as this one will
do nothing to stoke my fire.

He can't mean a duel, can he?

140
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,500
Ridiculous!

141
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:53,500
It's been a long, long time,
wouldn't you say, Meng Ao?

142
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,291
And you are very, very old.

143
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,250
Oh, be quiet.

144
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,958
In any case, I really am
most pleased to see

145
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,541
that you remember
me still, Lian Po.

146

[Indeed, well.

147
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,500
That's because you were about
the only enemy general

148
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,750
that I never managed
to ultimately kill.

149
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,833
Although, that's
because you turned tail

150
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,958
as soon as things weren't
quite going your way.

151
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,250
[LIAN PO]
So...

152

Meng Ao the Running
Scared enemy general,

153
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,583
tell me what the heck do you
think you're doing now, exactly?

154
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,125
[gasping]

155
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:34,000
Isn't it more your style to
stick with the miserable fleeing

156
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,250
until the bitter end,

157
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,166
rather than die a
hero's death?

158
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,875
[MENG AO laughs]

159
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,416
For better or worse,
so many interesting thoughts

160
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,750
occur to a person
when he gets to be our age.

161
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,625
[MENG AO] And well, since you
have come all this way,

162
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,041

00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:08,208
in my heart of hearts
you really do terrify me.

207
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,791
It stands to reason.

208
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,208
I lost to you many times
over when I was young.

209
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,541
Indeed, I never once
won a battle against you.

210
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,125
[MENG AO]
To be honest with you,

211
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,083
when I heard you had returned,
that ironic twist of fate

212
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,083
made me lose all hope
initially, you see.

213
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:30,125
Because here I am, right on
the precipice of retirement.

214
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,125
Why should I have to
fight you now,

215
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,500
after all of those
years have past?

216
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,750
But at the same time,

217
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:42,125
then a certain young man I met
through fate told me wisely...

218
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,041
...that if I was to win in the
end, I'd win it all, you see.

219
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,750
That I should be grateful
for this opportunity

220
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,916
to turn the tables on the
likes of you, finally.

221
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,250
And so...

Ah, the flame of youth
always burns so very bright,

00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:19,666
What exactly did you think that
you would accomplish, then?

325
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,708
The era was about
Qin's six great generals,

326
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,500
as well as Zhao's Three Greats.

327
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,416
Holding the lives of
millions of soldiers

328
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,458
in the palms of your hands,
and risking both body and soul

329
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:37,583
as we clashed decisively
with one another during battle!

330
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,083
[LIAN PO]
When I lost those opponents,

331
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,041
I can admit I lost
some passion,

332
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,125
But having survived
that incredible golden age

333
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,666
left me with an adamantine body!

334
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,458
Did you honestly believe
you could blow that away

335
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,583
with your 40 measly
years of emotions?

336
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:02,583
I must say you have gravely
underestimated me, Meng Ao!

337
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,750

So this is Lian Po!

[BAI GUIXI]
Have you got any news?

342
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,458
[BAI GUIXI'S ADVISOR A]
Nothing yet.

343
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:41,125
Send out a messenger
to gather intel immediately.

344
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,500
Sir! A messenger!

345
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,625
[BAI GUIXI]
That General Lian Po.

346
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,000
Surely nothing's
happened to him, but...

347
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,791
I pray that victory
may ultimately be his.

348
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:12,583
It's commanding general
Bai Guixi's main camp!
