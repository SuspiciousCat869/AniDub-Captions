00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,416
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,333
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,625
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,500
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,833
Their opponent: the
legendary general Lian Po.

6
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:52,041
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

7
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,000
their sights set
on a major victory.

8
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,208
Tomorrow, Le Hua Force,
Yu Feng Force,

9
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:06,916
and the Fei Xin Force
altogether will kill Lun Hu!

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,625
Then let's talk strategy.

11
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:14,416
Firstly, the Le Hua Force goes
after Lun Hu's main camp alone.

12
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,750
Right now!

13
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,333
What's this?

14
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,958
[MENG TIAN] Phase one
of our strategy will be:

15
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,291
[MENG TIAN] The Le Hua Force
will not go after Lun Hu!

16
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:46,083
[LUN HU] A mere 800 troops,
split into five teams.

17
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,625
[LUN HU]
What are they attempting,

18
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,583
coming after the main camp
with its 5,000 men?

19
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,083
Right! Going in!

20
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,083
[SOLDIERS yelling]

21
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,458
[LUN HU] And they're waltzing
right in, aren't they?

22
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,500
This is no clever plan.
It's plain bizarre!

23
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,750
[LUN HU]
They're charging to their death.

24
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,708
[GUO JIAO] Meng Ao, sir!
It's the young lord!

25
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,166
The Le Hua Force is
attacking the camp alone!

26
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,291
[MENG AO groans]

27
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:20,208
Dear Meng Tian,
what on earth are you--

28
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,916
[GUO JIAO]
Call them back at once!

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,583
[QIN MESSENGER A]
Yes sir!

30
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,291
[MENG AO]
Wait a moment.

31
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,791
[QIN MESSENGER A]
Sir?

32
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,916
[MENG WU]
Father, about Meng Tian.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,083
Will he remain a
300-man commander?

34
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,958
Being overprotective
will stunt his growth.

35
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,583
[MENG AO] As will
too much neglect, I'd say.

36
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,458
[MENG WU] You should
consider trusting him more.

37
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,583
[MENG WU] He may be a girlish
lad, but I see far more in him

38
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,833
than in any of those
thousand-men commanders.

39
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:57,041
You ought to understand that
more than anyone else, Father.

40
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,458
[MENG WU]
Trust fully in Meng Tian.

41
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,500
If he dies, then he dies.

42
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,000
But whatever happens,
he dies a man.

43
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,125
[MENG AO]
Meng Tian...

44
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,083
[MENG TIAN]
Grandpa, look! See? A crab!

45
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,875
[MENG TIAN laughs]

46
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,791
[MENG AO] Take a message
to General Tu Men.

47
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,958
[QIN MESSENGER A]
Sir!

48
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,250
[MENG AO "The Le Hua Force
are independent.

49
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,083
Let them go on
doing as they wish."

50
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,083
[QIN MESSENGER A]
B-But sir...

51
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,208
[MENG AO]
Go now.

52
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,875
[QIN MESSENGER A]
Yes, sir!

53
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,291
[MENG AO]
I am fully aware, Meng Tian.

54
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,916
[MENG AO] I know you are,
without question,

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,166
the most gifted in three
generations of Meng soldiers.

56
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,000
[MENG AO]
However...

57
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,291
[MENG AO] ...you cannot die
in vain, you see.

58
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,625
The enemy is launching
an unexpected invasion!

59
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,250
[GUI]
What does this mean?

60
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,125
[LUN HU] They're just aiming
at the seams in our defense.

61
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,500
If that's truly
their little plan,

62
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,416
it's really not much of one.

63
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,291
After all,
those spots are covered...

64
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,208
[gasps]

65
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,666
[screaming]

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,666
[LUN HU] ...with soldiers
with at least a hundred battles

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,916
under their belts.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,458
[SOLDIERS yelling]

69
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,833
[LE HUA SOLDIER E]
Meng Tian, sir!

70
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,250
[MENG TIAN]
Yeah!

71
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,708
There they are: Lun Hu's men!

72
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,000
[CHU SHUI] The infantry should
be able to handle things

73
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,333
around here. The cavalry
can move out, too.

74
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,083
Xin, sir!

75
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,333
Xin?

76
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,916
[growls]

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,250
[XIN]
Huh?!

78
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,625
You're not going after Lun Hu?!

79
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,791
What's the matter
with you, Meng Tian?!

80
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:53,375
The Le Hua Force's target
will be Lun Hu's men.

81
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,833
Wha--?

82
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,375
Lun Hu's men, then?

83
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,708
You're saying we
go after his troops?

84
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,791
[MENG TIAN]
That's right.

85
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,833
What do you mean "that's right"?

86
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,416
Lun Hu is a monster, to be sure.

87
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,250
However, he alone
can't destroy enemies

88
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,333
by the hundreds, much less
thousands at that, you see?

89
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,791
Behind Lun Hu are the troops who
always fight right beside him,

90
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,083
battle after battle,
without fail.

91
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:24,125
Lun Hu's destructive power is in
commanding those very troops.

92
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,583
When Lun Hu was exiled,

93
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:30,041
he brought 700
chosen soldiers with him to Wei.

94
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,291
During this battle, they've been
surrounding Lun Hu, as well,

95
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,583
waiting for the
opportunity to charge.

96
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,583
The Le Hua Force will
go after those 700 troops

97
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,916
and take them out.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,500
So that way, Lun Hu has
absolutely no real way

99
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,458
to strike Meng Ao's main camp
like he intends to do.

100
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,291
[MENG TIAN]
Well, I suppose it's more

101
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,166
about laying some groundwork,
don't you think so?

102
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,583
[XIN]
Groundwork?

103
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,416
[WANG BEN] I don't believe
that it's that easy.

104
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,958
The Yu Feng Force fought them
that first day of war.

105
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:08,125
They bested us in individual
and in group strength as well.

106
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,000
You want to get the jump
on the unstoppable Lun Hu

107
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,125
and his specially chosen troops.

108
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,000
But if you challenge them,
the only one who'll wind up

109
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:24,125
with casualties is the
Le Hua Force, Meng Tian.

110
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,416
[CHU SHUI] Why aren't we
mobilizing, Xin, sir?

111
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,291
Aren't we supposed
to be fighting alongside

112
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,166
the Le Hua Force now?!

113
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,958
If this keeps up, they will--

114
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,083
[XIN] Stay put
and wait for the signal!

115
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,250
This is part of
Meng Tian's strategy.

116
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:49,416
Wang Ben sir, it seems
the Le Hua Force is struggling.

117
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,333
Perhaps this strategy
was a terrible mistake.

118
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,125
No, I do not think so.

119
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,708
You need an attack
framework to take down

120
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,333
a big game like Lun Hu, you see.

121
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,500
It's an attack framework,
you say, then?

122
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,833
[WANG BEN]
When we attack Lun Hu,

123
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,875
his powerful troops will prove a
huge obstacle to us all here.

124
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,041
[WANG BEN]
Meng Tian is attempting

125
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,708
to get rid of them first.

126
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:20,416
Obviously, this is
no simple task. But still...

127
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,166
He's the one who
took on this prep work,

128
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,750
drawing first blood after all.

129
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,958
[WANG BEN]
You've really made up your mind,

130
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,208
haven't you now, Meng Tian?

131
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,000
The ever-temperamental
Le Hua Force.

132
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,083
Once you show your
enthusiasm at the forefront...

133
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,916
[grunts]

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,666
[WANG BEN] ...they'll get
worked up into a lather,

135
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,916
and put more than their
usual force on display.

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,500
What gives, men?
Are you tired already?!

137
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,000
[LE HUA SOLDIERS yell]

138
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,625
[LUN HU]
My soldiers, being killed?

139
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,791
[XIN]
W-Wait a second!

140
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,458
What gives, Meng Tian?
Why do you have to be the one

141
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,791
sacrificing yourself
in that way?!

142
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:20,125
Silly. I am not setting out
to be some martyr.

143
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,958
The Yu Feng Force
and Fei Xin Force

144
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,875
can't fulfill this vital role
the way they stand now.

145
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,166
Only the Le Hua Force can.
And we will, rest assured.

146
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,666
We will bring down Lun Hu!

147
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,791
[MENG TIAN]
We three forces, that is!

148
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,291
[MENG TIAN]
Right, it's time now!

149
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,500
[gasps]

150
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,583
[CHU SHUI]
Is that--?

151
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,083
[MENG TIAN]
Wang Ben, and Xin...

152
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,791
...the rest is up to you!

153
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,583
It's the... signal!

154
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,166
Come on, Fei Xin Force!

155
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,000
Go, Yu Feng Force!

156
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,166
[SOLDIERS yelling]

157
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,250
Will the infantry
be all right back there?

158
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,333
The sergeants know
the gist of our plan.

159
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,500
The bigger issue here
is whether we can reach

160
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,541
Lun Hu before the Le Hua Force
is ultimately defeated.

[LE HUA SOLDIER G]
Meng Tian, sir!

163
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,083
We are hurting pretty bad!

164
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,041
If we keep losing any more men,
we'll fall apart completely!

165
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,875
Yes, I know that!

166
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,333
But Lun Hu's troops
have thinned out plenty, too.

167
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,958
Pull my soldiers back and
have them assemble immediately.

168
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,875
[GUI gasps]
You said your soldiers, sir?

169
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,375
Yes, I did, and hurry up, now.

170
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,791
Fill those holes over there
with new Wei recruits.

171
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,875
Strengthen the perimeter,
and don't let any escape.

172
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,750
[GUI]
Yes sir!

173
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,583
[LUN HU]
Oh dear...

174
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,625
This whole time they
were coming after my men.

175
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:10,000
Such precious elements,
and I only have so many of them.

176
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,666
Yaah!

177
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,625
Forget the small fry! Plow
through and send 'em flying!

00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,041

What's all this?!

181
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,291
The enemy's reaction to us
is significantly slow!

182
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,291
Let's go! Find an opening
and run through it!

183
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,208
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS yell]

184
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,791
Yes, we can do this!

185
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,750
Keep this pace and we
can make up for lost time!

186
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,375
[XIN]
Oh yeah, I know!

187
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:47,041
It's like I said, it's all just
going according to our plans!

188
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,958
They got a late start now.
Correct, sir?

189
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,208
That's right.

190
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,875
When the Le Hua Force
suddenly ran out ahead,

191
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,791
the enemy would've been watching
for other units to mobilize.

192
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,500
But it was only the
Le Hua Force.

193
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,000
Their no-hesitation rush
into the Wei army's main camp

194
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,333
surely drew the
enemy's attention.

195
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,041
The later we mobilize, the
more the enemy would be focused

196
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,875
on the Le Hua Force
running wild in their midst.

197
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,916
With no enemies in
the cavalry's way,

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,333
we can reach Lun Hu's camp
in the blink of an eye,

199
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,833
if you know what I mean.

The main camp! Let's go!

202
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,916
Meng Tian, sir, the Fei Xin
and Yu Feng forces

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,166
are approaching!

204
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,041
Good! Then how
about we give them

205
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,041
one more special
little present?

Attention flanks!
Retreat at once!

now, as well!

W-Wang Ben, sir! Is this--

00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,208
[FAN YANG]
Argh. It's impossible.

216
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,958
This, too, is Meng Tian's doing?
I can't believe it!

217
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,916
Fighting in this manner,
and with one of Lian Po's

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,125
right-hand men, no less.

219
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,166
And bringing three
young rivals together

220
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,583
into one allied force,
on top of it?!

221
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,208
[FAN YANG]
The talent that made him

222
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:31,375
our first thousand-man
commander was not for show.

223
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,583
In fact, I think Meng Tian's
skills may already be

224
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,083
far beyond that level
at this very moment!

What hurts the most, I believe,

Even if the enemy does close in,

00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,250
it's not like they can
actually ever kill me.

Why did you come back?

[QIANG LEI] I decided to
pull back and fight here.

[CHU SHUI gasps]

304
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,000
This means that you're
not going with Xin?

305
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,416
No. I definitely
do not want to lead

306
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,666
those Lun Hu troops
directly to him.

307
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,291
Let Xin do it.
He can handle Lun Hu.

308
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,541
[LUN HU]
Oh?

309
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,125
Aren't you that
Fei Xin Force fellow?

310
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,333
That, um...

311

It's Xin.

312
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,333
And so, we meet once again.

[XIN] And this time,
you're not running away, Lun Hu.

314
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,083
[LUN HU laughs]

315
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,916
[LUN HU]
It's the other way around.

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,125
I won't do you the
favor of running.

317
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,000
[XIN]
What did you say?!

318
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,166
[LUN HU] You and
Mr. Spearman way over there?

319
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,416
You've both entirely
underestimated

320
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
your opponent's might, you see.

321
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,333
Did you really think that
the two of you

322
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,541
could even touch
someone of my grand stature?

323
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,541
[XIN snarls]

324
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,583
[WANG BEN growls]

325
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,916
Just quit messing around!

326
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,083
[XIN yells]

327
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,125
Is-Is that all you got?

328
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,958
[LUN HU]
I don't mind two at once,

329
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,458
but let's do this
more efficiently.

330
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,125
[LUN HU]
You look easier to deal with.

331
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,416
I'll save you for later.

332
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,291
So the first one to
take his lumps will be...

333
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,750
[WANG BEN gasps]

334
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,541
[growls]

335
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,666
Wang Ben, Sir!

336
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,125
Yaaah!

337
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,583
Uwaaugh!

338
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,291
[LUN HU]
Out of the way.

339
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,000
[WANG BEN growls]

340
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,000
[LUN HU]
Oh, wow!

341
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,833
You are plenty determined,
but your wounds have

342
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,458
taken the edge off now.

343
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,916
[WANG BEN]
Idiot.

344
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,291
[LUN HU]
Oh, he's fast!

345
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,916
Xin of the Fei Xin Force.
If that's what you're up to,

346
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,083
I've no choice.

347
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,833
[WANG BEN]
He's going for Xin!

348
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,916
[LUN HU]
I guess I'll start with you.

349
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,125
Stop it! Xin!

350
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,583
[XIN growls

351
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:36,041
[gasping]

352
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,833
[XIN] So who's
underestimating who, now?!

353
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,291
Lun Hu?

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,208
I will make darn
sure that you know

355
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,375
who the strongest one here is!

356
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,541
[MA LING growls] What's going on
with Lun Hu's main camp?

357
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,500
[HUANG GONG] The dust clouds
from all the fighting

358
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,333
make it impossible to see!

359
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,333
[LI CHONG]
The Le Hua Force has withdrawn,

360
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,208
but the Yu Feng and
Fei Xin Forces

361
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,750
have moved in instead!

362
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,375
Working with the
Le Hua Force, I assume.

363
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,750
And all three of them are now
acting independently, too!

364
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,625
They may be independent reserves
right now, but if they don't win

365
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,541
they'll have to answer for it!

366
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,083
[MENG AO laughs]

367
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,000
[MENG AO]
Well, naturally they would!

368
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,250
[MENG AO] And I'm one hundred
percent positive

369
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,416
no one knows that better
than those three themselves.

370
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,458
Wang Ben... Xin...

371
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,458
[yells]

372
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,416
[LUN HU]
This is real fighting.

373
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,083
[LUN HU] So, he's the type
who pours on the power

374
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,583
according to his
opponent's strength.

375
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,666
[LUN HU] I suppose everyone's
like that to some extent.

376
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,875
However, with this boy,
it truly is like night and day.

377
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,666
[yells]

378
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,625
[LUN HU]
And then,

379
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,541
there's the strange weight
of this one's blow.

380
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,250
[LUN HU]
Whoops!

381
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,375
Darn it, Wang Ben!
Get out of my way!

382
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,125
Get out of MY way!
He is all mine to kill!

383
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,000
[XIN]
Oh no, he isn't!

384
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,666
Lun Hu!

385
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,583
[gasping]

386
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,666
[gasping, laughing]

387
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,583
Is... he human? Im not sure!

388
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,083
[chuckles]

389
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,375
You are strong,
I'll give you that.

390
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,083
I'm starting to believe
you really did land a blow

391
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,958
on Wang Yi after all.

392
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,125
[LUN HU] I would rather you
didn't make light of that event.

393
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,875
Huh?

394
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,500
[LUN HU]
I mean,

395
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,958
you don't know what it's like
to be up against Wang Yi.

396
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,250
Or someone like him.

397
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,250
[XIN laughs]

398
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,666
[XIN]
Who are you trying to kid?

399
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,875
We know, all right.

400
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:03,916
Heck, the guy next to you
is related to General Wang Yi.

401
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,083
[LUN HU]
Related to--

402
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,208
And what about you?

403
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:13,625
Who am I? I'm the man
who got Wang Yi's poleax.

404
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,625
And his dying wish
as well, you see!

405
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,958
[XIN] And I'm the man who'll
surpass all those generals.

406
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:26,041
To be the greatest general that
all of history has ever had!

407
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,083
Wang Yi's poleax and
his dying wish?

408
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,375
And the greatest general
that history has ever had?

409
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,791
Aren't you thinking big?

410
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:45,291
Then you'll be surpassing
my lord General Lian Po as well.

411
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,916
[XIN]
Obviously! After I kill you,

412
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,958
I'm definitely going straight
for Lian Po, next!

413
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,458
[XIN grunts]

414
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,916
[LUN HU] I do wish you
wouldn't get so carried away.

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,166
After all, you see,
your lives will be ending here.

416
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,625
[XIN growls]
