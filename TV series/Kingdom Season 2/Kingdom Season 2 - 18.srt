00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,500
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,541
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,583
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,666
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,833
Wang Ben, Meng Tian, and Xin.

6
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,416
These bold soldiers and
aspiring great generals

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,541
were together here now,

8
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,291
ready to usher in
a brand-new age!

9
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,166
[QIANG LEI]
That's why...

10
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,583
That's why I'm leaving
when this battle

11
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,916
is finally over and done with.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,666
I don't know how many months,
how many years it will take,

13
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,750
but I will have my revenge.

14
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:16,291
And once I have, when I
come back here, finally then,

15
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:20,833
I-I think I should be able
to move forward with you guys

16
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:24,666
in the Fei Xin Force.
You'll all be my home.

17
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,333
Let's win it, Qiang Lei.

18
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,250
[QIANG LEI]
Yeah.

19
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,708
[NARRATOR]
Shanyang, the key position

20
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,333
holding down western Wei,

21
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,375
is home to four
castle towns.

22
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,541
Exactly west of those
lay the Liuyi Plains.

23
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,083
[NARRATOR]
Despite the name,

24
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,416
these plains are
complex terrain,

25
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,125
encompassing great
mountains, forests,

26
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,583
and even swampland as well.

27
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,458
Here, where one trades
ease of movement

28
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,916
willingly for the
ability to enact

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,625
an impressively vast
myriad of tactics,

30
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,458
was the site the unparalleled
martial master, Lian Po

31
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,833
had chosen for the battle.

32
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,083
So you have come, Meng Ao!

33
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,291
[QIANG YAN] I'm afraid I still
don't quite understand.

34
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,041
I'm afraid I don't believe
Meng Ao is powerful enough

35
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,208
to really entertain my lord.

36
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,583
[LIAN PO]
No, not at all!

37
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,500
Meng Ao is the most
common general

38
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,958
you could ever come across.

39
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,458
And yet...

40
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,916
Despite this very fact,
he somehow has

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,083
a lot of campaigns
under his belt.

42
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,791
It's as Wang Yi told me,

43
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,875
In place of any actual ability,
Meng Ao possesses

44
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:58,416
really powerful twin swords
instead of that, you see.

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,458
Twin swords, he said?

46
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,416
[LIAN PO]
Seems Meng Ao's two lieutenants

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,791
are just absolute monsters,
the likes of which the world

48
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,291
has truly never
seen before them.

49
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:20,000
[LIAN PO] Well then, my dearest
Meng Ao, we are quite anxious

50
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,208
to see you swing them
around before us,

51
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:27,083
these very special little
twin swords of yours!

52
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,291
[NARRATOR]
Qin commanding general, Meng Ao

53
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,125
and his army had
arrived at the Liuyi Plains,

54
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,708
site of this decisive battle.

55
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,250
[laughs]

56
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,250
Ah, we have been
waiting for you.

57
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,541
Our esteemed
General Meng Ao.

58
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:37,833
[MENG AO laughs]
Really fine work, you two!

59
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,041
What's with them, down there?

60
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,750
[MENG TIAN]
Oh right!

61
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,458
You really don't
know, do you, Xin?

62
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,875
Not you again.

63
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,916
Those are Grandfather's
two lieutenants there.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,250
Lieutenants?

65
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:56,166
[MENG TIAN] General Huan Yi
and General Wang Jian.

66
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,708
Huan Yi and Wang Jian?
Never heard of 'em.

67
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,291
They must really not
be that great, huh?

68
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,125
What are you
talking about, Xin?

69
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,541
They're monsters, both of them!

70
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,375
They're monsters?

71
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,541
[MENG TIAN] In fact, most of
Grandfather's military successes

72
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,166
truly are thanks to them.

73
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,291
Neither one is
well-known as a general

74
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,916
because of particular
reasons, you see.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,250
What "reasons"?

76
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, General Huan Yi
was once the head

77
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,583
of a big band of marauders

78
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,208
whose controlling territory was
the mountains of southern Qin.

79
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,333
Say what?

80
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,541
[MENG TIAN]
He's a real brutal man.

81
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,625
Even after being
appointed general,

82
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,916
he can't shake the violent
temper of his marauder days.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,791
They say, Huan Yi once
took down a castle town

84
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,166
and beheaded every single one
of its inhabitants mercilessly,

85
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,000
all by himself.

86
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,833
Every inhabitant?

87
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,250
Oh, man.

88
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,583
[MENG TIAN]
Huan Yi the Headhunter.

89
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,833
That heavy nickname
still follows him around

90
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,083
to this very day.

91
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,458
He's simply the
worst kind of brute!

92
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,416
How'd he become a
lieutenant, anyway--

93
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,000
Because he's a
war genius, you see.

94
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,000
[MENG TIAN]
Back when he was a marauder,

95
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,083
Qin sent out all kinds
of punitive forces

96
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,458
to put a stop to his cruelty.

97
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,333
However, they never managed
to successfully win out

98
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,416
over Huan Yi's unique tactics,

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,583
strategies that no one could've
ever have taught him

100
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,833
in the first place.

101
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,666
Yes, perhaps it was very
shameful for Grandfather

102
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,333
to take him on right now,

103
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,083
but even setting
all of that aside,

104
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,166
his power really more
than makes up for it.

105
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,000
So what exactly is the deal
with that Wang Jian general?

106
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:39,166
General Wang Jian is
simply Wang Ben's father.

107
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,750
Huh?

108
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,083
[MENG TIAN]
And that means

109
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,541
he is the current head
of the same Wang clan

110
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,666
that gave us the
great general Wang Yi.

111
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:59,083
Head of the Wang clan
like General Wang Yi was.

112
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,166
[POPS]
Young sir! Hurry, please!

113
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,458
[MENG TIAN]
You got it! Coming!

114
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,000
[XIN]
Meng Tian, wait up!

115
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,208
Earlier you said that both those
lieutenants had "reasons."

116
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:14,291
So what exactly is
Wang Jian's reason, then?

117
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,833
[MENG TIAN]
Wang Jian is just perhaps

118
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,916
the most dangerous man in Qin.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,958
He has been driven
into the deep shadows

120
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,125
ever since the time
of King Zhao's ruling.

121
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:30,083
What does that mean exactly?

122
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,875
Well, you see,
from what I hear,

123
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,875
he has a particularly high
ambition he wishes to achieve.

124
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,500
Word is, he very much
wants to be King.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,375
King, you say?

126
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,875
How can that be?

127
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,750
[MENG AO laughs]

128
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:53,583
I will really be counting on
you yet again, dear gentlemen.

129
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,791
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the Wei army had also arrived

130
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,833
at the Liuyi Plains.

131
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:02,125
There, atop Mt. Malian and
overlooking the main forces,

132
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,458
stood Wei's commanding
general, Bai Guixi!

133
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,125
[JIE ZIFANG]
What is this?!

134
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,416
[LUN HU] Our lord isn't
the commanding general?

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,583
[JIE ZIFANG]
I don't know this Bai Guixi!

136
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,208
Who on Earth is he?

137
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,791
[QIANG YAN] I believe that he
was one of the lieutenants

138
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,666
in General Wu Qing's
battle against Qin.

139
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,833
[XUAN FENG]
Yes, the coward who turned tail

140
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,125
the very second Wang Yi
glared at him at once!

141
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,875
[BAI GUIXI]
I'm not listening to this.

142
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm not listening to
any of this nonsense!

143
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,833
[LIAN PO laughs]

144
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,333
Well, then!
Surprised, aren't you?

145
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm glad I didn't say anything!

146
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,083
This is really no
laughing matter, my lord!

147
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,625
What is the true meaning
of all of this, then?

148
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,583
Why is he our
commanding general?

149
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,791
Reason number one is morale!

150
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,166
[JIE ZIFANG]
Huh?

151
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,250
Well, those both in Wei
and abroad currently believe

152
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,958
that I have been kept
off the battlefield

153
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,333
these past three years
purposely because

154
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,541
of the sheer lack of
the King's trust in me.

155
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,750
My suddenly turn-up as
a commanding general

156
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,916
would hardly boost the
Wei troops' morale!

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,166
Very good point.

158
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,666
[LIAN PO] But what's more,

00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,291
temporary 1,000-man unit,

321
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,250
just like Tai Yun's also was.

322
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,208
It can't be!

323
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,541
Is someone now
targeting them?

324
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,541
[YU FENG SOLDIER 218A]
The fourth unit is struggling!

325
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,916
[FAN YANG]
Call back the second unit

326
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,375
and send them as
reinforcements, immediately!

327
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,958
[YU FENG SOLDIER 218A]
Sir!

328
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,916
[YU FENG SOLDIER 218B] The right
garrison is being pushed back!

329
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,291
What's taking them?

330
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,041
Seventh unit,
you are much too slow!

331
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,875
[YU FENG SOLDIER 218C]
The ninth unit has been captured

332
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,791
at the rear!

333
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,375
[FAN YANG]
What?!

334
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,500
[WANG BEN]
The squad is moving slower

335
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,375
with these extra 700 troops.

336
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:02,250
Slower than we're used to
with the Yu Feng Force.

337
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,291
[FAN YANG]
Zhou!

338
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,875
Go help the ninth unit now!

339
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,250
I will stay and
protect Wang Ben!

340
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,666
Sir!

341
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,958
[WANG BEN] The slower we move,
the more it will take

342
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,791
to tease open a seam now.

343
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,833
These new soldiers
are skilled,

344
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,500
but I knew they just
didn't measure up

345
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:22,208
to the battle-bred 300 men that
have been in the Yu Feng Force.

346
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,416
But, I didn't know how much
it would hold us back

347
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,458
fighting beside them
as we currently are!

348
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,708
[YU FENG SOLDIER 218D]
Wang Ben sir!

349
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,250
Lieutenant Fan Yang!

350
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,958
There's a new wave
coming from the left!

351
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,416
From the left, too? Fine!

352
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,750
Send the third unit
after them, right now!

353
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,250
But first, the right!

354
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,208
Get the right unit back
into formation, quickly!

355
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,500
[WANG BEN]
No.

356
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,333
First, we must face this.

357
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,250
Huh?

358
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,041
[SOLDIERS yelping, groaning]

359
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,291
[gasps]

360
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,041
[SOLDIER 218A groans]

361
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,875
[LUN HU]
Look close and you can tell

362
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,666
which squads are under command,

363
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,791
and which squads
aren't whatsoever.

364
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:11,041
The former is strong, of course,
and the latter is quite weak.

365
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,833
Furthermore, all of the weak
squads in the Qin army

366
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,625
truly are my handiwork,

367
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,083
having assassinated
all those commanders

368
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:23,000
and forced them to form
temporary squads, purposely.

369
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,666
I see.

370
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,041
So, you're the one responsible

371
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:30,500
for killing our 1,000-man
commanders at Jinliguan.

372
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,833
Bingo, Mr. 1,000-Man-
Commander-For-A-Day.

373
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,875
So right now,
I'll take your life too.

374
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,375
[FAN YANG]
Defend General Wang Ben!

375
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,250
[SOLDIERS yell]

376
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:43,250
[laughs] I wonder if you can!

377
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,583
Move now.

378
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,291
Me, move now?

379
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,458
I've got this one.
