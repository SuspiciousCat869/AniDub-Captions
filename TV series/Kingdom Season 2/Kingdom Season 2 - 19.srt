Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,458
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,458
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,250
of the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,666
Their opponent: the
legendary general Lian Po.

6
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,833
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

7
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,958
their sights set
on a major victory.

8
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,541
Bingo, Mr. 1,000-Man-
Commander-For-A-Day.

9
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,583
So right now,
I'll take your life too.

00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,125

[laughs] I wonder if you can!

13
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,041
Move, now.

14
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,708

15
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,000
I've got this one.

The first unit is struggling!

[MESSENGER 219B] Yan Bi's and
Tai Yun's squads are destroyed!

18
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,166
[MESSENGER 219C]
General Tu Men has taken up arms

19
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,708
and is now standing
on the front lines!

20
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,250
Two 1,000-men squads have
gone down just like that, now?

21
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,958
Hey, wait a moment.

22
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,333
Yan Bi and Tai Yun
were both appointed

No, thank you, though.

[FAN YANG]
Wh-What might!

43
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,416
This has nothing to do with
coordination within the squad.

44
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,208
This enemy is
frighteningly strong!

45
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,833
This squad isn't like the rest,

46
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,333
There must be two, three
hundred elites among them.

47
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:18,916
Though, surely even they have
far less experience than my men.

48
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,666
In any case, our squad

49
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,416
is under Lun Hu,
one of the Big Four

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,166
directly linked to
General Lian Po...

51
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,333
...who fought solidly
through and survived

52
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,291
the big era of Zhao's
first Three Greats,

and Qin's Six Greats.

00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,708
[WANG BEN]
It makes no difference.

59
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,041
No matter how strong
your troops really are,

60
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,958
take out their commander,
and the squad will be destroyed.

61
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,083
Then it's all over.

62
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,041
[LUN HU]
That's very true, yes.

63
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,083
[laughs] You've got a point.

64
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,875
And if you want it as badly
as you're suggesting,

65
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,708
there'll be no hard feelings.

66
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,625
[TU MEN'S ADJUTANT]
General Tu Men,

67
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,125
don't push yourself too hard!

68
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,333
I know that very well!

69
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,458
[TU MEN] My merely standing
at the fore of this battle

70
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,625
has revitalized the
troops a little, it seems.

71
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,750
But losing two of
8,000 troops so quickly,

72
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,458
I fear it is too big a blow
for us to endure now.

73
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,791
My lord!

74
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,041
May I suggest falling back
for now and regrouping?

75
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,416
[TU MEN]
No!

76
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,916
Victory for these once
identically sized vanguards,

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,125
depends greatly on the morale
of all troops on both sides!

78
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:47,250
We will turn the tide of
this battle, no matter what!

00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,708
I'll visit the hurting
squads to inspire them!

[RONG BEI] The first unit's
status is just as reported.

94
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,833

probably going after

[RONG BEI]
Which means

98
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,541
you better fully understand the
fact that your Fei Xin Force

99
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,708
is most likely next in line!

Don't go down too fast.

[FAN YANG]
No, that's not it.

129
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,791
Wang Ben's been dealing
some full-powered thrusts,

130

the likes of which we
rarely ever see in battle.

And in spite of this,

a single scratch at all.

with a real innate
talent for the spear,

00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,166
[LUN HU]
At first, I wasn't entirely sure

163
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,875
that I'd dodged it.

164
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,458
But as I said before,

165
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,500
when you've fought
with enough spearmen,

166
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,583
you tend to see these kinds
of tricks a time or two.

167
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,291
And well,

168
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,708

[LUN HU] Right after
a major move like that,

172
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,958
there's always a little opening.

173
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,666
[FAN YANG]
His sword!

174
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,250
When did he throw that?

175
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,416
[LUN HU] It really seems
like the Qin army has lots

176
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,291
of pretty ambitious
young fellows, these days.

177

But you see,

178
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,916
you were unlucky today.

Don't pull out blindly!

You'll be hit from behind.

Lun Hu, sir!

We're making contact!

00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,458
[BAI GUIXI]
General Lian Po,

204
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,666
we should send out our
own reinforcements.

205
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,333
[LIAN PO]
No need now.

206
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,833
Huh?

207
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,791
[LIAN PO] Keep sending these
defective armies out there,

208
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,083
and we will just keep
getting the same result.

209
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,958
Commander Chang Fan!

210
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,958
The first unit has
now been split up!

211
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,708
[SOLDIER 219A]
The seventh unit is destroyed!

212
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,583
[SOLDIER 219B]
The eighth unit too!

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,208
Send the fourth
unit out in front!

214
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,000
[CHANG FAN'S ADJUTANT]
The fourth unit?

215
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,916
There is no fourth unit!

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,875
What did you say?

217
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,791
[NARRATOR] A squad's strength
on the battlefield depends on

218
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,291
a unified consciousness
and precise coordination.

219
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,666
Without these,
a squad can't show its

220
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,958
offensive or defensive powers.

221
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,083
[SOLDIER 219A]
The enemy cavalry approaches!

222
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,416
[NARRATOR] If even the
Yu Feng Force was struggling,

223
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,791
the rest of the squads
were finding it impossible

224
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,791
to fight in a real battle.

225
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,041
[RONG BEI'S ADJUTANT]
Rong Bei, sir!

226
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,750
Chang Fan's squad is hurting!

227
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,333
Send help right away!

228
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,958
Mmm. So, they're no good.

229
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,833
What about the Fei Xin Force?

230
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,750
It seems they have also
been split up and--

231
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,291
[NARRATOR]
There was one strange thing:

232
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,916
alone among all of the squads...

233
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,458
[NARRATOR] ...the Fei Xin Force
emanated the brightest,

234
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,375
and the most intense light!

235
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,791
Go!

236
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,125
What is that over there?

237
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,333
[LUN HU'S ADJUTANT] Lun Hu, sir,
there's shouting to the left.

238
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,416
[LUN HU]
I hear it.

239
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,708
What a strange, odd upsurge.

240
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,041
[YU FENG FORCE SOLDIER 219G]
The shouts came

241
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,291
from this side, here!

242
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,708
[YU FENG SOLDIER 219H]
Which squad was that?

243
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,000
[WANG BEN]
The Fei Xin Force.

244
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,708
[HUANG]
Wh-What's with these guys?

245
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,000
That's one very mixed-up squad,

246
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,458
and with not a speck
of coordination

247
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,208
between infantry and cavalry.

248
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,125
So why haven't they
been destroyed already?

249
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,875
How can they be this strong?

250
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,208
No, they're not just
mixed up, they are just--

251
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,958
[NARRATOR] There was a trick
to the Fei Xin Force's actions

252
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,958
that fateful day.

253
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,041
[CHU SHUI] And next, if we in
the cavalry are right over here,

254
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,416
the infantry moves down here,
and circles to here.

255
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,958
At the same time,
split into two,

256
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,333
with one half following
the cavalry.

257
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,833
But watch this here,
and right here, too.

258
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,750
If the enemy shows up
here, we have to--

259
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,750
Let's just forget
about it, Chu Shui.

260
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,166
[FEI XIN FORCE gasps]

261
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,666
[XIN] We really have got
plenty of faith in our brawn,

262
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,416
but we're not so great
at brains, honestly.

263
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,791
There's no use springing
a joint attack plan on us.

264
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,625
It's bound to fail
pathetically, see?

265
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,250
[XIN]
It'd be even better,

266
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,333
if we fought separately
this time around.

267
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,416
We can handle being on our own,

268
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,458
and I'm sure you
Guo Bei folks will be fine.

269
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,375
B-But then what's the point of
our being a 1,000-man army--

270
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,791
That's not it.

271
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,750
I think Xin's definitely
right about all of this.

272
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,958
I had the feeling,
as I was explaining it

273
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,000
that we couldn't
fight that way now.

274
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,291
All right, then.

275
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's forget all
about that, for now.

276
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,375
Just one thing.

277
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,583
Let's go out there
as a 1,000-man unit

278
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,541
with one very simple, very
easy arrangement in mind.

279
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,500
An arrangement?

280
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,666
[CHU SHUI]
That is...

00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,916
[NARRATOR]
The arrangement held that,

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,208
given the signal,

286
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,125
at any time, and fighting
absolutely any foe,

287
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,500
Commander Xin
would set his sights

288
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,666
on the previously
agreed-upon enemy,

289
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,625
And at that moment,
all 1,000 troops

290
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,750
would attack as one!

291
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,041
Wow! What raw power!

292
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,125
Their main force
went flyin', there!

293
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,708
Never seen that before!

00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,125

295
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,125
Yep!

296
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,166
[XIN] You bet we've never
had that kinda power before!

297
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,791
If we can fight like that
with one simple tactic...

298
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,958
Imagine what this unit'd be
if we came together as one!

299
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,958
[CHU SHUI] That's not all
a 1,000-man unit can do!

Look around you, now.

303
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,500
[CHU SHUI] The offensive
power of the Fei Xin Force

304
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,958
is spreading to the others,

305
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,333
and the whole Qin army

306
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,708
is starting to rally
incredibly hard!

Lun Hu, sir, the action's
over there, see?

313
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,250
That's odd.

314
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,500
To think the Wei army
could lose the upper hand

315
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,500
so very easily now.

316

There clearly must be a real

We have already lost track of
