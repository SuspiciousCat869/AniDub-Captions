[LÜ BUWEI laughs]
That's enough.

00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,833
No more trying to
outwit one another.

00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,791
The cards are on the table.

4
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,333
Your choice is
quite simple, really:

5
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,750
Give us Hangao Castle and
have a Qin-Zhao alliance,

6
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,791
or you and all of your
companions will be executed

7
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,625
where you stand now.

8
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,833
One or the other.

9
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:03,208
Now, Chancellor Li Mu,
your answer would be?

10
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,666
[LI MU] Sadly, I haven't the
chance of beating your price.

11
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,041
Hangao Castle is yours.

12
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,375
Great!

13
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,125
The Qin-Zhao alliance
is concluded!

[OFFICIALS, UNDERLINGS shouting]

15

Shouldn't we start
raising hell now?

16
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,333
[XIN] Even if we did,
the stakes are too high.

17
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:35,791
Lü Buwei was right:
this is no place for soldiers.

18
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,791
So that's the monster
you're now fighting, Zheng?

19
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,208
[NARRATOR] With Li Mu agreeing
to hand over Hangao Castle,

20
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,916
the Qin-Zhao alliance
was complete.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,458
The meeting concluded
without any mishaps.

22
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,500
To celebrate the new alliance,
a feast was to be held

23
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,833
in a hall on the grounds
of the Royal Court.

24

[XIN]
Here you go.

25
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,875
You need to leave
all your weapons

Go in already.

[XIN] What's with the
atmosphere in here?

35
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,958
[XIN] It's so grand and fancy,
but there's a definite

36
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,916
edge in the air.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,125
I guess that makes sense.

38
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,041
It's not like just
having an alliance

Hey wait, Zheng's not here?

that's worth missing a feast?

deep into your brain carefully:

The one who's gonna
kill you is none other

at an alliance banquet!

00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,333
I will never forget your face.

163
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,291
Or any of your words.

164
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,125
However...

165
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:27,458
Defeating me is no easy task,
I'll have you know.

166
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,708
Truthfully, unless you come
to surpass General Wang Yi,

167
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,250
it will be impossible.

168
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:39,333
Don't you worry, that's actually
been the plan all along.

169
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,375
Huh?

170
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,708
[LORD CHANGWEN]
You damned fool!

171
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,708
We're begging your pardon,
dear Chancellor.

172
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,500
Please, forgive
his impertinence!

173
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,541
[XIN]
Let me go, old man!

174
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,916
[LORD CHANGWEN] What are
we going to do with you?

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,333
What seems to be
the problem now?

176
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,041
Has that child committed
some insolent offense?

177
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:13,000
Nope, the insolent one would
actually be me in this case.

178
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,750
I do believe he's such
a genuine young man,

179
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:20,916
that I couldn't help but tease
him in a rather immature manner.

180
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,416
But he can give as good
as he gets, that one.

181
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,416
[NARRATOR] The banquet
continued, somewhat awkward

182
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,291
at times, but lively
in its own way.

183
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,416
Towards the very end,
the heated topic of the hostage,

184
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,833
Lord Chunping, arose
naturally at last.

185
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,166
The Zhao contingent could not
return without him in tow.

186
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,166
Lü Buwei's man, Xie Jun,

187
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,333
demanded another
hostage in his stead

188
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,583
until they got Hangao Castle.

189
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,291
Marquis Pingdou, a big player
in Zhao's financial world,

190
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,916
came to take Lord Chunping's
place as the hostage.

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:13,291
[CIVIL SERVANTS snoring]

192
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:20,500
[XIN snoring]

193
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,666
Not another bite...

194
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,500
[NARRATOR] And so, the entire
affair came to an end

195
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,500
without a single
drop of blood shed.

196
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,750
[NARRATOR] Li Mu and the rest of
the Zhao contingent put Xianyang

197
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,291
safely behind them
all for the moment.

198
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,625
Pardon me, did something
good happen, my lord?

199
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,583
[LI MU]
Hm?

200
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,625
Do you even have to ask me?

201
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,791
The negotiations went
exactly as I had planned.

202
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,125
That was bound
to happen, then.

203
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,083
I can see that you
don't get excited

204
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,125
about foregone conclusions.

205
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,166
How very perceptive of you.

206
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,375
Well, I don't know how
things will go from here,

207
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,958
but I did manage to meet
one very promising individual.

208
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,333
[DIAO]
Kaine!

209
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:19,875
Hi!

210
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,166
Why? Who are--

211
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh! It's He Liao Diao!

212
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,833
Fancy meeting you
here of all places!

213
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,375
So, it's been a year since
we met in that battle.

214
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,291
Time flies, don't you think?

215
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,666
I got myself in a
real bad bind there,

216
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,125
but I'm still super glad
I went then.

217
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,291
If I hadn't gone
to watch that battle,

218
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,833
I wouldn't have wound up
in tactician school.

219
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,208
You are in tactician
school now?

220
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, wow.

221
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,416
[DIAO]
Mm-hm!

222
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,750
Oh, so hey, they let all
of you go home safe and sound.

223
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,666
That's so great!

224
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,916
Naïve as ever, so I see.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,583
I am your enemy now, you know.

226
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,291
And here you are telling me
you're going to be a tactician?

227
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,250
We ate together and
even camped together.

228
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,583
Enemy or not,
I won't wish you to die.

229
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,416
[KAINE]
Is that so?

230
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,791
Besides, we are both allies
now, not enemies anymore.

231
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,833
Maybe we will
for a year or two.

232
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,000
That is about the limit

233
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,625
for a standard wartime
alliance it seems.

234
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,291
And Li Mu says
even that long

235
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,958
is really pushing
the duration of it.

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,291
Speaking of which,

237
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,416
aren't you pushing it?

238
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,583
P-P-Pushing what?

239
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,250
[KAINE] You're starting
to get pretty cute there.

240
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,916
No way!

241
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,083
And a bit curvy I believe.

242
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,875
Uh! Don't be ridiculous!

243
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,958
[XIN]
What are you two doing?

244
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,083
[DIAO]
Xin! Qiang Lei!

245
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,375
Don't you be talking
to her, Diao!

246
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,125
Get over here, now!

247
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,250
Huh? Uh...

248
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,583
[DIAO] I got so worried
when I heard you two

249
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,125
were asked to assassinate Li Mu.

250
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,208
Ah, come on!

251
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,500
Like we'd go along
with any of that!

252
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,333
He Liao Diao, These are
actual friends of yours?

253
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,750
Huh? Oh, you heard
about Xin, didn't you?

254
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,791
Actually, he and I used to
live together, y'know!

255
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,666
And is this a friend
of yours, then?

256
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,583
[DIAO] Ever since I went to
watch the Zhao battle from afar,

257
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:26,416
I, uh, shared my food with her
and she captured me after.

258
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,625
She is not a bad person though.

259
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,291
But she is bad enough!

260
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,916
So you are the famous Xin.

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,458
That little confrontation
you had with Li Mu?

262
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,875
You have to be
a stone-cold idiot.

263
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,708
Why you little--

264
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,375
That's right, there's no time.

265
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,583
Let's go, now.

266
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,708
[DIAO] Huh? What do you
mean, not much time?

267
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,375
You need to just listen
and come with me already!

268
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,416
[DIAO]
What's up with you?

269
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Shall I stay out of this?

270
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,791
You should, if you don't mind.

271
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,708
Sorry, Kaine.

272
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,875
I gotta run.

273
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,791
Yep.

274
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,291
Take good care!

275
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,250
I get the feeling our paths
will cross again real soon!

276
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,875
I think that by then,
we'll be back to being enemies.

277
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:10,916
[DIAO]
Huh?

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,041
[XIN]
Just hurry up, wouldja now?

279
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,541
[DIAO]
Okay.

280
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,375
[gasps]

281
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,166
[XIN, DIAO panting]

282
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,041
[DIAO]
Hey, wait!

283
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,458
Where are you taking me?

284
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,250
What is it?

285
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,916
We've arrived.

286
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,583
Huh?

287
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,916
Diao!

288
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,500
Zheng!

289
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,500
[DIAO]
Zheng!

290
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,375
[laughs] Isn't this a sight!

291
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,333
The Original Three,
back together!

292
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:11,541
[ZHENG, DIAO, XIN laughing]

293
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,875
[XIN] When you think about it,
this whole thing started

294
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,541
with the three of us.

295
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,958
We escaped your
Heibei Village hideout,

296
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,833
met up with Lord Changwen
and all the other guys,

297
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,458
even went to see the
mountain folk as well.

298
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,958
Hey, Zheng.

299
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,666
the power struggle
between you and Lü Buwei,

300
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,041
has it gotten any
worse since then?

301
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,208
You didn't say a single
word at the meeting,

302
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,958
and you were a no-show
at the banquet, too.

303
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,166
Honestly?

304
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,125
It was like you almost
did not even exist.

305
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,625
[DIAO]
Really?

306
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,000
They must really be holding
you back, isn't that right?

307
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,375
If that's what it looked like...

308
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,625
Huh?

309
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,500
...then it's working.

310
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,500
[ZHENG] I have dared
to play the fool now.

311
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,208
Once I'm able
to get real power,

312
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,291
Li Mu will be my greatest foe.

313
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,041
So I diligently
erased my existence.

314
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,083
and kept him from knowing
my real true inner self.

315
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,083
It's something the sages have
done since ancient times.

316
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:15,791
[BOTH gasp]

317
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:16,791
You heard him!

318
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,000
He's a sage?

319
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,750
Besides, we are putting up
a good fight at the moment.

320
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,916
[XIN, DIAO sigh]

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,541
All the efforts of
Lord Changwen and Si Shi

322
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,875
are coming along
at a steady pace.

323
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,750
In particular, Lord Changwen
is getting results

324
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,916
on that tricky flood
control project.

325
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,541
[ZHENG] He often works
alongside a civil engineer

326
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,000
by the name of Zheng Guo.

327
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,250
[XIN]
Lord Changwen?

328
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,250
That old guy,
digging along rivers?

329
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,916
[ZHENG]
Yes.

330
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,583
At first, Lü Buwei pressed
the dirty job upon him,

331
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,208
but now, he works
to support Zheng Guo,

332
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,458
as a true rightful Minister.

333
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,416
I'd even say he is making
significant achievements.

334
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,333
Huh! So the old guy's
actually workin' pretty hard!

335
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,625
But the Lü faction is
pretty powerful, you know.

336
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,750
[XIN]
Huh?

337
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:04,750
Huh.

338
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,250
[DIAO]
Sorry Zheng.

339
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,916
I'm currently in
Lord Changping's

340
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,250
tactician school, you see.

341
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,333
Even though I knew
Lord Changping wasn't really

342
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,541
on your side,
and for that I'm sorry.

343
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,083
[ZHENG]
I'd heard about that.

344
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,875
These things happen.

345
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,166
[gasps]

346
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,458
[ZHENG] You have nothing
to worry about, Diao.

347
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,958
I doubt the bonds we forged
defying death together

348
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,333
in Cheng Jiao's uprising
will be broken that easily now.

349
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,833
No need to apologize.

350
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,125
[DIAO]
Yeah.

351
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,541
Thanks, Zheng.

352
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,875
Ah!

353
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,333
So your own battle is
moving along nicely, too,

354
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,791
isn't that right?

355
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,166
[ZHENG] Moving along, yes,
but one cannot be

356
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,916
too optimistic about it.

357
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,625
Their power is only increasing.

358
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,083
I have only five years' grace
remaining now, I'm afraid.

359
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:50,833
[BOTH gasp]

360
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,875
Five years?

361
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,333
Five years, but what
does that mean?

362
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:59,750
[ZHENG] In five years,
I will be 22 years old.

363
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,958
[DIAO]
So that means...

364
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,625
My crowning ceremony.

365
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,208
[NARRATOR]
The crowning ceremony:

366
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,250
a ritual performed
as testimony

367
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,083
that a male member of the
royal family had come of age.

368
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,416
While other lands perform
the ceremony at the age of 20,

369
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
the proper age in the
kingdom of Qin is 22.

370
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,083
The ritual takes place in the
former royal city of Yong cheng,

371
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,750
where generations of
kings are enshrined.

372
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,625
[ZHENG] Once I am finally
crowned, I will be recognized

373
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,333
as Qin's ruler both
at home and abroad.

374
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,916
When that happens, some in
Lü's faction are sure

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,333
to come over to my side.

376
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,625
Which is why

377
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,750
Lü Buwei will absolutely
be coming to destroy me

378
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,125
before that happens.

379
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,958
[gasps]

380
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,583
I shall fend off
his attempts,

381
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:51,000
and in five years I will take
the ruling power for myself.

382
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,875
[gasps]

383
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,666
[gasps]

384
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,833
But, Zheng, five years is
practically no time at all!

385
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:02,541
This man at school,
Meng Yi, he told us

386
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,416
that ten years wouldn't
be enough time

387
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,875
for the Zheng faction

388
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,041
to grow strong enough
to fight off the Lü guys.

389
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,208
[XIN]
Wrong!

390
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,333
Five years is plenty!

391
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,458
Xin?

392
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,791
We're not playing
around here at all.

393
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,375
You think they're gonna wait ten
years because we ask them to?

394
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,958
If they're comin' in five
years to put an end to this,

395
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,375
that's when we fight!

396
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,875
[DIAO]
But realistically--

397
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,500
Shut it! This isn't
about "can" or "can't,"

398
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,000
We simply will! Right, Zheng?

399
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,583
Exactly so.

400
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:37,583
And Xin, what about
you exactly, then?

401
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,625
Can you make general
in five short years?

402
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,000
[gasps]

403
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,083
[gasps]

404
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,416
[XIN]
A general in five years?

405
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,166
[ZHENG]
Five years from now,

406
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,208
the general I mobilize with
my very first command

407
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,166
will be you, Xin!

408
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,583
[gasps]

409
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,541
[gasps]
