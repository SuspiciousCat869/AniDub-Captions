1
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,333
[WANG BEN] Remember this,
commander of the Fei Xin Force,

2
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,125
My name is Wang Ben.

3
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,250
Wang Ben.

4
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,250
Wang?

5
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,666
Wang!

6
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,708
Yes.

7
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,125
Of the same clan as your
dearly beloved Wang Yi.

8
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,250
Unlike Wang Yi, though,

9
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,291
this Wang carries on
the family name!

10
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,875
[growls]

11
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,000
[WANG YI] Go through hell
along with your men.

12
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,541
You do have
the aptitude, Xin.

13
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,166
What the heck is wrong
with that Wang Ben upstart?

14
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,250
So we're ants, are we?

15
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,250
And we should just shut up
and follow orders, too?

16
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,208
Who does he think he is?!

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,916
But however, we can hardly
argue or fight back, can we?

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,541
Just one shout from
that big guy and we all

19
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,333
snapped quickly to attention.

20
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,416
Oh man, oh man, you guys.

21
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,416
I have not been reminded
of that in a while.

22
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,458
That huge impassable
wall between us

23
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,750
and all of those noble
types we saw then.

24
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,125
[MAO]
But...

25
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:38,833
The Yu Feng Force that we all
met was kinda pretty cool.

26
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,250
[growls] Hey, Mao!

27
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,875
What did you just say right now?

28
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,916
I'm so sorry!

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Come on!

30
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,333
Are you completely
clueless or what?

31
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,541
[XIN]
Cut it out, Wei Ping.

32
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,916
There's nothing wrong
with being honest

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,500
and saying what's on your mind.

34
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,541
I also think the Yu Feng Force
was pretty cool.

35
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,916
They kinda gleamed.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,583
Correct, Mao?

37
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,208
[MAO]
Mm-hm.

38
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,291
[XIN] You wanna be just
like them, huh?

39
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,541
Huh?

40
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,208
If you rack up a ton of
victories, and you can,

41
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,000
you can join the warrior class!

42
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,208
Me, a noble?

43
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,708
Song Zuo!

44
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:20,041
Cut all that nonsense about
walls especially right now.

45
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,666
That's nothing but an excuse.

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,000
An excuse?

47
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,333
Yes.

48
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,208
All it does is let
them overpower us,

49
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,416
and then it brings all
of our spirits way down.

50
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,208
If we let ourselves
get beaten like that,

51
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,208
we lose our will to fight.

52
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,250
We're not playing around!

53
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,291
Even if he is General Wang Yi's
relative or not,

54
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,416
I won't take this lying down!

55
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,750
Now it's our turn!

56
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,083
We're gonna take what they
gave us and give it right back!

57
00:04:50,166 --> 00:05:00,416
[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,541
Give it right back huh?

59
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,666
But fighting allies'll get
us all court-martialed.

60
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,916
[WEI PING]
Don't you get it, Mao?

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,250
What he really means
is that we're gonna start

62
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,208
beating that Yu Feng Force
to the punch each and every time

63
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,791
that we are able to!

64
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:19,333
[CHONG YUAN] But then, the only
question is how will we do it?

65
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,750
We're going to need an
incredibly special strategy

66
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,125
to be able to surpass the
elite mounted Yu Feng Force.

67
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,166
That's exactly what we're
going to work on now.

68
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,500
[LU YAN]
I think I have a good idea!

69
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,333
[FEI XIN FORCE gasps]

70
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,166
[XIN]
Lu Yan?

71
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,166
A very harsh
strategy that I think

72
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,458
only we would be
able to pull off.

73
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,958
Harsh?

74
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,750
What is it?

75
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,916
[FAN YANG] Did you hear
the news, Wang Ben, sir?

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,166
It appears that
the Fei Xin Force,

77
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,416
that we met the other day,

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,750
went missing that night,
so my sources tell me.

79
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,708
It is a bit of a mystery.

80
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,666
Quite a few other units
have been out there

81
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,833
searching for them,
all to no avail.

82
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,583
It appears we stole
their thunder, sir.

83
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,375
Maybe showing them
our superior strength

84
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,500
had quite the effect.

85
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,791
They must be back
working the fields!

86
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:28,666
[FAN YANG laughs]

87
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,583
[growls]

88
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:40,916
[DOGS growling]

89
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,875
[WEI PING yelps]

90
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,583
[QU HAI]
What the--?

91
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,041
Ow!

92
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,750
That stupid stray
bit me on my leg!

93
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,875
[XIN]
Darn it, Wei Ping.

94
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,833
[XIN]
Get lost, you mongrel!

95
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:22,583
[rumbling]

96
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,000
Here they come.

97
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,208
That's the Wei troops.

98
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,958
[XIN] Okay, Lu Yan, go ahead
and tell me all about this

99
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,833
"harsh strategy" of yours.

100
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,458
The Wei army is gathering up
all of its scattered soldiers

101
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,916
on the fields to get its
encampments in order.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,708
Such large enemy gatherings
give us the ideal chance

103
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,125
to pull off something
quite major, I do believe.

104
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,041
However, with all the enemies
we would have to fight

105
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,208
on our way to the main
force, our small group

106
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:03,250
is at a disadvantage,
as you can see.

107
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,500
Luckily, not only is
the fog thick here,

108
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,083
but the bodies of those lost

109
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:12,250
in the ongoing hostilities have
been left where they fell.

110
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,166
[LU YAN]
If we disguise ourselves

111
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,166
among the fog and the bodies,

112
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,958
we can sneak up
to the main force

113
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,083
without engaging
the enemy at all.

114
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,041
[LU YAN]
However,

115
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,458
know that being among
these rotting corpses

116
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:35,083
will be far more trying than
crossing swords with the foe.

117
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,833
[gasps]

118
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,666
What is it Mao?

119
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,791
Are you all right?

120
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,750
You are kinda
white as a ghost!

121
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,958
I-I'm fine.

122
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,166
They're back again!

123
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,625
So hide!

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,166
All for the warrior class!

125
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,833
I'm gonna be nobility and
bring my poor single mother

126
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:20,291
some genuine happiness!
I vow to this!

127
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,458
[WEI PING]
Mao...

128
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,500
[XIN]
Heh, heh. Well, well, Wang Ben.

129
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,666
Does your Yu Feng Force
have the guts

130
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,041
to actually go this far?

131
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:35,666
Once those guys go past, we
will rush the main enemy force!

132
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,625
[HORSEMAN 205A]
Hmm?

133
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,541
[HORSEMAN 205B]
What?

134
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,750
I thought I saw

135
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,041
something moving
right over there.

136
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,916
[WEI PING]
Huh?

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,541
[HORSEMAN 205B]
Hey, you guys!

138
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,625
Go make sure that
no one's alive out there!

[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

140
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,666
[XIN]
You've gotta be kidding.

141
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,250
[TIAN YONG]
Now what?

142
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,125
Do we just fight
'em here and now?

143
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,375
[YUAN]
No, we let them pass us by.

144
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,416
If they spot us now,
this'll all be for nothing.

145
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,625
We'll never be able to
storm the main force.

146
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,833
[PEI LANG] And with so many
dead bodies laying here.

147
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,458
the Wei troops can only
stab so many of them

148
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,625
before they move on.

149
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,833
[WEI PING]
That's right.

150
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,208
There's no way we'll
get the brunt of their--

Don't do a thing!

00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,250
they appeared at my
residence, unannounced.

316
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,958
Messengers, from that castle.

317
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,208
[SI SHI]
Wh-why?

318
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,416
Why are you here now?

319
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,208
Si Shi.

320
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,166
I bear a missive in my hand.

321
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,291
[SI SHI]
Th-Th-The Royal Seal!

322
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,875
[COURTIER 205B]
The Royal Seal?

323
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,125
What kind of nonsense!

324
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:08,083
Why, the Royal Seal stays with
the King, everybody knows this!

325
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,000
No Seal-bearing message
could ever possibly arrive

326
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,833
from a place of which the
King has no knowledge of,

327
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,166
you know this!

328
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,250
What are you
going on about?

329
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,666
When the King's younger
half-brother, Cheng Jiao

330
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,166
had sparked that
fateful uprising before,

331
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,791
The Royal Seal was concealed
in a certain safe place

332
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,083
as the King fled to Xiangyang.

333
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,875
As part of Cheng Jiao's
faction at the time,

334
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,875
I had been unable
to uncover the Seal.

335
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,916
That is because it was hidden
among the third force of which

336
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,333
I now speak of before you.

337
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,708
[COURTIERS gasp]

338
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,791
Do you mean the
Seal was duplicated

339
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,750
before it was returned to me

340
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:54,000
after quelling the
fateful uprising?

341
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,541
Blasphemy!

342
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,041
Duplicating the Royal Seal is a
treason against the kingdom,

343
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,666
a misuse punishable
by death, even!

344
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,250
What exactly are you driving at?
I don't understand!

345
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,541
This "third force" he speaks of;

346
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,416
I have never once heard
of anything like it

347
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,208
here in Xianyang. I do not
believe it even exists!

348
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,458
[LORD CHANGWEN]
No, Bi.

349
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,166
[gasps]

350
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,041
Of course you do know
of that force he mentioned.

351
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,416
[gasps]

352
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,666
Because being distracted
by its own different nature

353
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,666
has quite simply kept you
from ever recognizing it

354
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,083
until this very moment here.

355
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,250
As having anything to do
with the power struggles

356
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,458
that we face, it's in Xianyang,

357
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,791
though the most elite
aren't permitted entrance.

358
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,916
The sealed castle.

359
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,208
[VOICE]
Bow down!

[YANG] Don't look up,
Xiang, no matter what.

361
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,458
Understand?

362
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,458
[XIANG]
I-I know that, Yang.

363
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,916
[LORD CHANGWEN] A castle
of over 1,000 court ladies

364
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,916
and countless eunuchs.

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,750
Most of the ladies are of
distinguished families,

366
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,250
both here and abroad.

367
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,875
Behind it all lurk the
power and ambition

368
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,583
of an influential figure.

369
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:55,125
Taken all together,

370
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,583
it makes for an enormously
powerful castle of women.

371
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,500
The Inner Palace.

372
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,500
And the ruler of
that castle of women

373
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:06,958
is the Queen Dowager of Qin.

374
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,625
In other words,

375
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,875
this "third force"
is none other than

376
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,666
the power of
His Highness's mother!
