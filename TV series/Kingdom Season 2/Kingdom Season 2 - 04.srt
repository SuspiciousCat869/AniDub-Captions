I have only five years' grace
remaining now, I'm afraid.

00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:46,750
In five years, I will
be 22 years old.

00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,833
[DIAO gasps]
So that means--

00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:52,375
My crowning ceremony.

5
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,208
Once I am finally crowned,
I will be recognized

6
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,916
as Qin's ruler both
at home and abroad.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,250
When that happens,
some in Lü's faction

8
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,625
are sure to come
over to my side.

We're not playing
around here at all.

that's when we fight!

Exactly so.

And Xin, what about
you exactly, then?

16
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,291
Can you make general
in five short years?

[XIN]
A general in five years?

The general I mobilize
with my very first command

19
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,541
will be you, Xin!

Five more years.

Even if Lü Buwei does
come to crush him,

I do believe that Zheng will be
the undisputed king of all Qin.

24
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,833
Which means...

25

I'll do it, Zheng!

[BI]
Talk about a surprise!

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,583
To think the Fei Xin Force is
this famous on the front lines.

73
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,083
As soon as I heard,
I knew you'd be here.

74
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,291
Only 'cause these
front lines are small.

Doesn't take much to get
your name out there.

All of this really
means nothing to me.

Just as I thought,
you are chomping at the bit.

all this way to see you.

Uh, now that you mention it,
what are you doing out here?

post at Yashui Castle.

[BI]
Our strategy to attack Wei!

85
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,916
Since we don't have to be
wary of Zhao anymore,

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,625
we can focus absolutely
all of our military power

87
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,208
exclusively on Wei, you see.

88
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,125
So Xianyang's formed a grand
strategy to send troops

00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,083
into Shanyang in Wei

90
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,291
to take the region's 20 castles
in just one fell swoop.

to tell you anyway, Xin.

[gasps]

96
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,875
[BI] If you want to keep
climbing the ranks,

97
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,458
your best bet is to win big
in a really huge battle

98
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,625
like this one. But first,
you absolutely have to be placed

99
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,125
in a very crucial position
right within the army,

100
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,500
do you understand me?

101
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,083
Why is that?

102
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,000
You can't expect great results
at the edges of the battlefield.

103
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,875
For logistical
support, you know.

Hm. Makes sense.

105
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,208
So this is no time
to be disheartened, Xin.

106
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,000
The Wei offensive
will likely get started

107

in less than a year from now.

108
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,583
Until then, keep chalking up win
after win, no matter how small,

109
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:14,125
and get into a better position
for the actual real fight!

However, this information's
already been leaked

to military commanders,
I should warn you.

It's obvious by all of the
ambitious men at the front lines

I've said into practice.

where Xin and his troops
found themselves.

136
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,250
The Wei army had mustered
from throughout the area

137
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,000
to push back the front lines,

138
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,208
and were now more
than 10,000 strong.

139
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,125
The Qin army mustered their
troops to the north and south,

140
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,791
intending to attack
Wei from both sides.

141
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:44,958
It was the first midsized battle
in this part of the kingdom.

Here we go, Commander.

No sittin' this one
out now, huh, Xin?

Right.

00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,625
The Fei Xin Force will stay
an independent reserve squadron.

147

We can go where we want
during the battle,

but don't count on
any other help.

take on all of this?

153
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,916
The Qin army will likely
make it to the main force

154

before reaching stalemate.

155

If you want their general,

156
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,208
start back here first,

157

circle around behind their
main force, then rush them.

Of course, it won't be easy

No objections.

Same here.

Okay.

Let's do this!

I-It's no use!

We can't reach Wei's
main force right now!

We're only losing soldiers
on our side instead!

[HORSEMAN 204A] What's that
squadron over there?

176
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,583
They're dodging the
defensive formation

177
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,833
and circling behind the
enemy's main force!

Th-That is--

[COMMANDER 204A]
The Fei Xin Force!

Don't let them through!

[YANG]
What?

193
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,833
There's still nothing going on
between you and His Highness?

194
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,750
Uh, huh, um.

195
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,125
[XIANG] I go to his bedchamber,
but he always tells me

196
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,250
to just sit quietly beside him.

197
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,375
[YANG] But Xiang, His Highness
has kept on summoning you

198
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,083
time and time again!

199
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:11,041
Usually people don't get
called more than once if...

Hmm...

201

202
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,666
[YANG]
Hm? Hm...

203
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,583
I don't see anything special
about you whatsoever.

204
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,625
So why you specifically?

205
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,125
I-I have no idea!

206
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,083
That girl bolts at the
most suspicious of times.

Xiang, wait up, come on!

208
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,625

better look at you!

to our borders again.

[LORD CHANGWEN]
Yes.

213

There have been ongoing

with the Wei offensive.

So we weren't the only ones
after the main force.

239

Unfortunately, you're a little
too late, I would say.

We belong to Qin's

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,958

00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,333
Identify yourselves now!

254
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,666
We happen to be
the Yu Feng Force,

255
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,041
the special 300-man squadron
in Qin's southern army.

Huh?

257
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,166
A special 300-man squadron?

258
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,125
Uh, exactly like our squad?

259
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,458
I see.

260
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,416
So you are that Fei Xin Force.

[WANG BEN]
Ha. Apologies.

266
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,250
Forgive our rudeness.

267
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,375
But you see, I can explain it.

268
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,791
We hear so much of the famed
Fei Xin Force these days.

269
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,375
Being a fellow
special force ourselves,

270
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,750
we've been on the
lookout for them

271
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,541
for a long time now, you see.

272
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,041
But to learn that the
rumors were right,

273
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:18,291
and you really are a
bunch of country soldiers?

274
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,708
Why, we could hardly
believe our eyes.

[YU FENG FORCE gasp]

280
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,916
So what if we're
country soldiers then?

281
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,958
We're 300 men strong,
the same as all of you!

282
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,208
We are definitely far from
the same, you imbecile.

283
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,208
Say what?

284
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,541
[WANG BEN] The Yu Feng Force
is an elite squadron

285
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,833
made up of noblemen

286
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,666
educated in military school
from a young age.

287
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,625
We wield swords and swing spears

288
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:00,541
long before any farm
child grips a hoe,

289
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,958
and have both individual and
group combat drummed into us.

290
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,791
Whereas you are novices at war,

291
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,333
meant to be working
the fields, quite simply.

292
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,541
I see why'd you be
so happy to pull off

293
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,208
a string of victories at all,

294
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,875
but the idea that your squadron
is on a par with ours

295
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,208
makes me ill.

296
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,458
Actually, just having you foot
soldiers in a special squad

297
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,375
in the first place
is a big mistake.

298
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,291
No doubt about it.

299
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,500
So quite frankly, your
presence on the battlefield

300
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,916
is most akin...

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
...to that of an ant.

302
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,041
[XIN, FEI XIN FORCE growl]

303
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,458
An ant?

304
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,750
[WANG BEN] Ants faithfully carry
out orders from above,

305
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,500
regardless of their
own self-interest.

306
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,875
It's what they do best, you see.

307
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,375
Devoting yourselves to this
is the most crucial duty

308
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,541
for you foot soldiers.

309
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,958
It's not to belittle you
peasants whatsoever, of course.

310
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,833
With an army of over 100,000,

311
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,750
80% is made of foot soldiers,
like yourselves.

312
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,083
You're the fundamental
power of any army,

313
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,875
and without you,
we cannot fight.

314
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,083
However, ants can
only be ants.

315
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,500
That's what they are.

316
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,458
Leave the high-level,
independent-reserve work to us.

317
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,583
You go back to your
post and work hard.

318
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,458
Dreams don't cut it.

319
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,583
Though, I can sadly
see some fool

00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,541
putting you all up
to this scheme.

321
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,916
[gasps]

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,083
[BI]
I knew it.

323
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,250
Make any small mention
of the Wei offensive,

324
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:38,166
and little squads start
showing up from everywhere.

325
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,875
[BI]
Including the Yu Feng Force.

326
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:44,666
A 300-man squadron that is
exceedingly skilled and strong.

327
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,875
But that commander of theirs...

328
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,000
[BI]
Hang in there, Xin.

329
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,083
[FAN YANG]
Shall we then, sir?

330
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,708
We must take the general's head
and put an end to this battle.

331
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,166
Yes.

332
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,958
Not so fast!

333
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,291
[WANG BEN, FAN YANG]
Huh?

334
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,916
X-Xin, sir, easy there!

335
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,375
You're talking to a nobleper--

336
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,875
Enough!

337
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,708
So what exactly have I been
listening to all this time?

338
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,333
Noble or not, doesn't matter.
Once the fighting starts,

339
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,000
you should know, you moron!

340
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,166
These hands of ours have
killed high-falutin' guys

341
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,958
just like you!

342
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,333
Who's the moron here?

343
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,500
Did you not fully understand
my story about the ants?

344
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,750
[YU FENG FORCE laughs]

345
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,166
Lieutenant Fan Yang!

346
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,166
[FAN YANG]
Sir!

347
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,875
Wh-What in the--

348
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,333
Troops! Attention!

349
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,875
[FEI XIN FORCE gasp]

350
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,000
[laughs] There we go!

351
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,375
Now do you
understand your place?

352
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,833
[laughing]

353
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,500
[FEI XIN FORCE growls]

354
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,583
You bastard!

355
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,750
Don't do it.

356
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,875
[laughing] 

357
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,125
[gasps]

358
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,416
[WANG BEN]
Hm?

359
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,958
[XIN]
Well, that does it.

360
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:35,166
Gramps, get down off your
horse right now and apologize.

361
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,375
Unless you want me
to drag you off it.

362
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,541
Oh!

363
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,416
With that toy sword
of yours, you will?

364
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,708
[XIN grunts]

365
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,833
[XIN]
Why, you--!

366
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,500
Xin, sir!

367
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:01,083
I'd like to give some candid
advice to you in particular:

368
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,375
You were a servant,
and now openly brag

369
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,625
about becoming the
greatest general,

370
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,291
or something like that.

371
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,291
[XIN growls]

372
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,708
[WANG BEN]
Now, among the nobility,

373
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,833
talented young
commanders like myself

374
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,500
are coming to the force,
I will have you know.

375
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,666
The battle to be the next
general has already begun,

376
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,666
but there's not even a
speck of room in there

377
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,750
for a roadside weed like you.

378
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,958
I'd advise you to know
your limitations well.

379
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,875
You'll command no more
than 1,000 men.

380
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:29,958
[XIN gasps]

381
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,458
[XIN yells]

382
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,875
[XIN gasps]

383
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,916
[gasps]

384
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,125
[ALL gasp]

385
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,375
Xi-Xin...

386
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,041
No way.

387
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,875
It's a reverse thrust.

388
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,125
[XIN grunts]

389
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,541
[YUAN, WEI PING]
Xin!

390
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,250
[FAN YANG] Why bother
using the Dragon Finger

391
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,875
on the likes of him, sir?

392
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,291
[XIN grunts]

393
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,833
Dragon?

394
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,375
A piercing technique, tracing
weaving orbits in midair,

395
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,375
like a dragon.

396
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,250
This guy here, he's tough.

397
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,750
[WANG BEN] Honestly, you've
been a thorn in our side.

398
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,500
Now's the time to make
the crucial gap between us

399
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,833
absolutely crystal clear.

400
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,708
[XIN]
I-I'll get you.

401
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,083
[WANG BEN] Remember this,
commander of the Fei Xin Force:

402
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,041
My name is Wang Ben.

403
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,916
Wang Ben.

404
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,125
Wang?

405
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,208
Wang!

406
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,625
Yes.

407
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,791
Of the very same clan as your
dearly beloved Wang Yi.

408
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,041
Unlike Wang Yi, though,

409
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:46,208
This Wang carries on
the family name!

410
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,125
[gasps]

411
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,208
[WANG BEN] We'll stay on this
front line for a while yet.

412
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,666
So you'd better get used
to lots of disappointment,

413
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,333
I'm afraid.
