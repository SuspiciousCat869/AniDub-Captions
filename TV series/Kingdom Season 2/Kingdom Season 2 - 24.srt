[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,291
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,250
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,500
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,833
Their opponent: the legendary
general Lian Po.

6
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:52,250
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

7
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,166
their sights set
on a major victory.

8
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,750
[WEI SOLDIER A]
Charge!

9
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,541
[WEI SOLDIER B]
We're breaking on through!

10
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,708
These guys just keep coming!

11
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,416
They must know
we're shorthanded here!

12
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,250
Oh no, our ranks are a mess!

13
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,583
Front row, switch out now!

14
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,583
Ah! That did the trick!
At least, for now.

15
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,625
[YUAN]
Stay sharp!

16
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,541
Put the unit together,
on the double!

17
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,083
[WEI PING, SOLDIERS]
Right away!

18
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,583
The Fei Xin Force will be
fighting right alongside you,

19
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,125
Xin, sir, like we always
have been, make no mistake.

20
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,416
So make sure to just give
them everything you've got!

21
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,250
I am the man who got
Wang Yi's poleax,

22
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,125
and his dying wish,
as well, you see!

23
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:54,500
[XIN] And I'm the man who'll
surpass all those generals

24
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,500
to be the greatest general that
all of history has ever had!

25
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,958
The greatest general that
history has ever had?

26
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,416
Aren't you thinking big!

27
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,833
Then you'll be surpassing my
lord, General Lian Po, as well.

28
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,583
[XIN]
Obviously!

29
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,750
After I kill you,
I'm definitely going

30
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,583
straight for Lian Po, next!

31
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,708
[LUN HU] I do wish you
wouldn't get so carried away.

32
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:33,958
After all, you see, your lives
will be ending here.

33
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,416
[XIN growls]

34
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,166
What's ending now, huh?

35
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,333
You two are certainly a handful!

36
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,958
Which is why...

37
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,833
it is imperative that the both
of you die right here and now.

38
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,041
[XIN]
Darn!

39
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,625
I realize that you're
very strong and all,

40
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,208
but still!

41
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,083
[XIN, WANG BEN yell]

42
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,333
[XIN]
No matter what happens...

43
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,291
[WANG BEN]
...this is where...

44
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,875
[XIN, WANG BEN]
...we kill him!

45
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,708
[XIN]
Yaaugh!

46
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,541
Haaa...

47
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,875
...aaaah!

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,875
[XIN grunts]

[WANG BEN gasps]

50
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,250
[XIN]
His wound... is bloody!

51
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,708
[XIN]
You're mine!

52
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,000
Is he human...
or just a monster?

53
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,250
Commander!

54
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,666
Get him! Kill Lun Hu!

55
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,791
Just stay back!

56
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,250
[SOLDIERS gasp]

57
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:58,250
[XIN] I'm the one who's
gonna be... taking his head!

58
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,166
[FEI XIN SOLDIER C]
But, um, Commander!

59
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,583
[XIN] Seems to me
there are only two kinds

60
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,583
of generals in existence.

61
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,958
[SOLDIERS gasp]

62
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:20,416
[XIN] Those who put themselves
out as pawns on the battlefield,

63
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,041
and those like
Wang Yi and Lian Po

64
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,500
who draw the attention
of friend and foe alike

65
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,291
and singlehandedly
turn the tide of battle.

66
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,250
They're both generals,
but the gap between them

67
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,041
is insanely huge.

68
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,083
Lun Hu is probably
the latter kind.

69
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,041
[XIN] But I'm looking
to climb even higher

70
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,500
than anyone can imagine.

71
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,375
[XIN]
And that's why

72
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,166
this guy's a wall
I've got to get over with!

73
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,166
Once and for all!

74
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,541
[yells]

75
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,708
[LUN HU] I am a
spear thrown by Lian Po.

76
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,541
And if you, the man
with Wang Yi's poleax,

77
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,541
considers me a wall
you must overcome,

78
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:29,166
see if you can!
Destroy me, then.

79
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,250
[XIN chuckles]

80
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,625
Well, that much...

81
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,958
...is just a given!

82
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,625
[NARRATOR] That day,
the independent action taken

83
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,666
by Xin and his fellow young
thousand-man commanders

84
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,333
brought new changes to
the battle on the Liuyi Plains.

85
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,416
Taking a broader view
of the battlefield, however,

86
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,708
Qin's left flank led by Huan Yi,
was nowhere to be found,

87
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:00,583
and Wei's Jie Zifang
had been stopped in his tracks.

88
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,666
On the left, Wang Jian's army
continued its customary retreat

89
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,583
from Qiang Yan's strong attacks.

90
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,791
Both flanks' movements remained
unchanged from two days earlier.

91
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:17,916
[SOLDIERS yelling]

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,666
First and second squads,
stand your ground!

93
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,625
Third, fourth, fifth, and sixth
squads, head down the ridge

94
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,958
and hit the enemy right now!

95
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,208
[NARRATOR] But within the
struggling Wang Jian's army,

96
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,541
only commander Bi's unit
was heroically holding out.

97
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,333
What are Wang Jian's
main forces doing?

98
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,875
[QIN MESSENGER A] The forces
continue to retreat, Sir.

99
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,958
Say what?!

100
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,000
Here we are
in the thick of battle

101
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,208
and somehow they
are still retreating!

102
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,541
What does this mean,
commander Bi?

103
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,000
[BI]
It is strange--

104
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,833
this is a general who
attacked quick as lightning

105
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:55,791
in absolutely all of
our sieges so far in battle.

106
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,166
He may still have
something up his sleeve, but,

107
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,333
the units on the front lines
have been all but abandoned.

108
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,541
With no orders
from headquarters,

109
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,083
I suppose we just stay here
and fight hard now.

110
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,416
Luckily, this terrain here
benefits from being

111
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,708
quite soggy and sloped--
soggy for the marshy areas,

112
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,916
and sloped for the
steep terrain.

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,708
That makes it hard to
attack here,

114
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,875
but pretty easy to
defend, I'd say.

115
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,875
We can hold off triple the
number of enemies

116
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,125
just fighting normally!

That is exactly Bi for you.

119
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,708
He has mastered the
basics of strategy

120

over the course of
this past year.

[BI'S ADVISOR C]
This is bad!

128
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,583
We are no match for

129
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,625
[BI'S ADVISOR D]
We must bring in reinforcements!

130

But even if we do just that,
do not forget

131
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:03,541
that General Wang Jian's
army is still falling back!

132
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,583
Commander Bi, the situation
has changed so radically,

133
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,208
I would say we must
retreat immediately.

such advantageous terrain.

It'd be such a shame
to leave it behind.

Still...

137
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:21,541
only a foolish commander would
be overly attached to the land.

138
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,625
Round up the troops and
begin to withdraw at once!

00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,291
And you must certainly know
something about the land

160
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,250
that lies ahead.

161
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,708
Lies ahead?

162
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,041
The straits!

163
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,916
Once through the
dangerous entryway,

164
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,208
we'll be surrounded
by steep cliffs.

165
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,416
The path through the straits
tapers as we move

166
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,583
to the way out.

167
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,250
If we can somehow lure Qiang Yan
successfully into the straits,

168
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,750
we can strike at him and
all his men from up above.

169
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,791
Ten thousand troops could
then be caught by half that.

170
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,791
[WANG JIAN]
Very well.

171
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,000
I can see it was worth the
effort coming all this way.

172
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,208
I shall hand over
my troops to you.

[WANG JIAN]
Round up the squads nearby,

175
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,416
and you should have your 5,000.

176
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,458
You now have commanding
authority over them.

177
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,666
[WANG JIAN]
Bi!

178
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,125
Henceforth you're a
5,000-man commander.

179
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,416
So now, go stop Qiang Yan
of the Wei army!

Me? A 5,000-man commander?

[BI]
Yes, sir! Understood completely!

182
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,416
The Bi squad will intercept
Qiang Yan's army,

183
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,000
per your command!

184
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,666
Who would have ever thought
General Wang Jian

185
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,541
saw something in me?

186
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,666
It's no surprise, Sir,
just looking at the battle here.

187
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,458
Commander, our fight with
Qiang Yan will be a critical one

188
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,458
that will decide the fate
of the entire left flank.

189
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,791
I know that!

190
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,166
Bi squad, prepare to
move out, and quickly!

191

[BI'S ADVISORS yell]

We can do this. We can win!

193
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,708
You don't scare me,
Qiang Yan!

194
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,458
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, the Le Hua Force who

195
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,500
was first to infiltrate
the main unit...

196
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,458
We will be through very soon,
Meng Tian, sir!

197
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,916
[NARRATOR] ...was one mere push
away from successfully

198
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,500
escaping Lun Hu's army.

199
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,666
The troops in back
have had it, Sun Gan!

200

Trade places with them!

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,083
[SUN GAN]
Yes sir! Sun Gan unit, after me!

202
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,708
How many men
do we have, Pops?

203
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,625
Maybe about 400!

204
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,583
However, it should be noted that
all of them are wounded.

205
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,041
Oh, I see.

206
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,083
[POPS]
We left with 800.

207
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,791
And now we have four.

208
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,500
A high price to pay
for our attack.

209
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:35,208
I knew it'd be high,
just not quite that high.

All in the name of victory!

understood that very well,

How are the Fei Xin and
Yu Feng Forces doing?

215
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,666
[POPS] I can't really
tell from here, but...

216
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,958
...there's no indication that
Lun Hu's been killed just yet.

217
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,333
They haven't gotten him yet?

Wang Ben, Xin.

222
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:19,625
You better not forget that this
truly is a surprise attack.

223
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,458
That's the heart of
the enemy's main camp.

224

Take too long, and you'll be
fenced by tons of foes

225

The main camp is in
complete disarray.

318
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,291
Perhaps it would be best
that we back down

319
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,833
for the moment and regroup.

320
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,875
No need for all that.

321
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,750
There'll be no more
surprise attacks,

322
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,750
and next time,
it'll be our turn to strike.

323
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,166
The Qin army's formation
is a mess, too.

324
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,458
If we get through that,

325
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,375
then we can do twice the
damage they did to us.

326
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,833
Yes sir!

327
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,291
[LUN HU] He must have
gotten me in a tendon.

328
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,875
I can't move my fingers.

329
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,250
Wounded through carelessness.

330
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:54,500
Me... of all people...

331
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,291
I let my guard down,
perhaps I underestimated him.

332
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,416
[LUN HU]
No, that's not all...

333
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,000
That Xin of the Fei Xin Force,
he was truly powerful.

334
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,541
[LUN HU] I'll repay you
for this left hand.

335
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,833
Tomorrow is the main event.

336
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:18,500
[XIN yells]
