1
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,041
[DIAO]
Battle hasn't even started yet!

2
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,833
[DIAO]
We won't get swallowed up!

3
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,958
[BING GUI] The Fei Xin Force's
main unit escaped the dragnet

4
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,875
before we could close in.

5
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:53,041
Then, they joined up
with their scattered troops.

6
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,750
Regrouping so quickly.

7
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:00,750
Clearly, they must have gotten
some brains on board, finally.

8
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:05,166
This one move will show me just
what their tactician's made of!

9
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,125
They're here!
The enemy vanguard!

10
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,750
[DIAO]
Out of all 4,000 troops,

11
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,416
a quarter of them
are now on the move.

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,541
And an elite force, at that!

13
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,125
They definitely
don't want this over.

14
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,541
[TIAN XIAO]
He Liao Diao!

15
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,291
If we don't intercept
the enemy, they will--

16
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,375
No mind!

17
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,250
[DIAO] They can't
tell from over there...

18
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,291
...that the Wei army has lots
of branching paths on their way!

19
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,500
[SOLDIERS yelling]

20
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,958
The enemy has dispersed!

21
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,916
That's good!

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,125
[DIAO]
With their manpower scattered

23
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,041
and the narrow path before them,

24
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,083
they've got a small attack area!

25
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,708
[DIAO] That's how our
five hundred troops can prevail

26
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,666
over their thousand troops!

27
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,666
[SOLDIERS yelling]

28
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,500
Firstly, we will use
our heavy-weight men

29
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,250
to block off one path for them.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,875
[DIAO] After that,
we march onward through force

31
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,666
and push the enemy to
the crossroads.

32
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,375
That way, we will have
capped off the entrance

33
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,333
to all the smaller paths.

34
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,958
Something's not right behind!

35
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,041
Say what?

36
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,458
[WEI SOLDIER 236C]
Enemies behind us?

37
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,000
[WEI SOLDIER 236D]
Impossible!

38
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,791
With all of their
escape paths suddenly cut off,

39
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,041
they'll dive into confusion.

40
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,958
[SOLDIERS yelling]

41
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,625
[DIAO] And that's exactly
when we strike hard!

42
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,541
[FEI XIN SOLDIER laughs]

43
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,708
These guys are total pushovers!

44
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,666
They have absolutely
no idea what's going on!

45
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,583
Yeah, I'd say so.

46
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,708
They're just like how
we used to be in the past!

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,833
Stay firm!

48
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,166
We don't need an
escape path anyway!

49
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,416
Yes, commander!

50
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,250
All troops focus only
on the enemy before you!

51
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,583
They are hardly
powerful enough to match us!

52
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,708
[TIAN XIAO gasps]

53
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,750
[DAO QING]
First off tighten ranks!

54
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,375
[TIAN XIAO]
Oh no! We need to regroup!

55
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,833
[DIAO] No, now we know
where their leader is!

56
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,583
Kill him and
his unit is done for!

57
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,500
[yelling]

58
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,333
[WEI SOLDIERS]
Dao Qing, sir!

59
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,375
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 236B]
Tian You!

60
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,791
If this were a real fight,

61
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,416
you would be no match
for us whatsoever.

62
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,583
[WEI MESSENGER 236A]
Urgent report!

63
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,500
Commander Dao Qing
has been killed,

64
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,625
and his unit
almost destroyed!

65
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,750
[WEI SOLDIER 236E]
What did you say?

66
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,125
[WEI SOLDIER 236F]
It happened so soon!

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,958
Bing Gui...

68
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,750
[BING GUI]
I have underestimated them.

69
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,791
The vanguard must
charge immediately!

70
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,833
[WEI SOLDIERS]
Sir!

71
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,500
He Liao Diao! The enemy...

72
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,625
...they're spreading out
and advancing!

73
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,458
[JIAN YONG] Bing Gui...

74
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,083
Do you think the
same thing would happen

75
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,666
if we go down
that path instead, then?

76
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,458
No need to worry.

77
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,791
That strategy
was just a stopgap.

78
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,541
That can only be effective
if our troops are concentrated

79
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,166
at the narrowed path,
as you can see.

80
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,541
If we split up our troops
and send them down every path,

81
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,375
their puny squad won't
be able to stop them all.

82
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,708
Once we get through,

83
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:59,250
we'll be at the heart
of their camp in no time.

84
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:03,416
[DIAO] Quick thinking.
These guys really mean business!

85
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,708
[TIAN XIAO gasps]

86
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,875
[TIAN XIAO] Now they're coming
through unguarded paths!

87
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,250
He Liao Diao!

88
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,833
The narrowed path
battle is done!

89
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,250
Already done?

90
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,500
Have all posted troops
assemble by Xin to the right!

91
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,291
To the right?
Aren't we defending our camp?

92
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,583
We simply cannot
spare the manpower for that!

93
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,875
I had always intended
to leave this place to rot.

94
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,833
What? But we--

95
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,791
[DIAO] Expose the camp
to draw in the enemy.

96
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:33,666
For the significantly small and
injured Fei Xin Force to win,

97
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,875
this can't be drawn out.

98
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,208
It needs to be a short war!

99
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,791
Come on, let's go, guys!

100
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,666
[DIAO] If we manage
to take their main camp

101
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,625
before they take ours,
we will win!

102
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,000
[distant yelling]

103
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,875
[WEI SOLDIER 236G] Enemies
headed our way from the left!

104
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,333
Are they after us?

105
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,125
That's absurd.

106
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,500
[TIAN XIAO] Go! Go!

107
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,000
[MENG YI] He Liao Diao...

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,125
[MENG YI]
...there are two main ways

109
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,500
to destroy a heavily
guarded main camp.

110
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,375
So then, I would have
to say that the one that's most

111
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,708
commonly used during a battle
is still plain old brute force.

112
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,000
Of course, that way
comes at great cost.

113
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:29,916
[SOLDIERS yelling]

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,083
[MENG YI] Then again,

115
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,583
that is precisely
why it works so well.

116
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,375
[LONG YOU]
Follow the commander!

117
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,250
[WEI SOLDIER 236H] They are
now fighting on the left!

118
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,083
We're being pushed back!

119
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,666
[BING GUI] Don't flinch!
Send backup to boost numbers.

120
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,041
[WEI SOLDIER 236H]
Yes, sir!

121
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,666
Ha! What now?

122
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,666
Ending with force instead of
a real proper strategy? Haha!

123
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,958
Some tactician they've got now!

124
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,000
Not quite.

125
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,125
A brute-force attack
is a good call.

126
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,583
Huh?

127
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,458
Your enemy will be racking
their brains, too,

128
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:06,083
so you can rarely win with an
unconventional tactic alone.

129
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,000
A brute-force attack tactic
is almost always

130
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,625
the very final move.

131
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,791
It's really just a matter
of when to use it, you see.

132
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,291
[BING GUI] You could say
the enemy tactician we targeted

133
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,416
right after mobilizing
made the best choice.

134
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,250
[JIAN YONG] You seem confident,
Bing Gui, to be heaping praise.

135
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,416
I'm not praising, I'm
just saying they weren't stupid.

136
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,541
Four defense formation!

137
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,208
Into position!

138
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:38,041
Stop them from the front
and thin them from the sides!

139
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,625
Considering the
Fei Xin Force's might,

140
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:45,083
earlier Wei armies probably
would have lost this charge.

141
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,000
But now we have
thoroughly trained generals

142
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,166
and my regular soldiers
in our camp.

143
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,958
Plus, we saw
the destructive power

144
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,791
of the Fei Xin Force
in Shanyang,

145
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,166
so there's absolutely no chance
of us misjudging our response!

146
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,416
[BING GUI] They don't have
a snowball's chance

147
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,375
whatsoever right now!

148
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,250
Xin, sir!
All this enemy backup.

149
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,000
[SOLDIER] These guys make
for one tough front line!

150
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,333
[TIAN XIAO] The enemy's
response is unusually swift!

151
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,500
They're overwhelming
our commander!

152
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,958
[TIAN XIAO] The enemy
is right at our feet!

153
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,166
We need to retreat,
He Liao Diao!

154
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,708
[DIAO] Leave them!

155
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,458
Leave them? But uh...

156
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,583
Take rocks and
throw them down, now!

157
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,458
[SOLDIERS gasp]

158
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,083
[TIAN XIAO] He Liao Diao!

[DIAO] Hang in there, everyone.

00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,666
[DIAO] And Xin!

162
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,291
This strategy...

00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,083
What's that brat doing?

164
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,291
You must be doing okay

165
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,708
if you can still
call her names!

166

We still can't crush them?

Let's finish this.

Send in more backup!

Surround the back and do not let
their commander Xin escape now!

[SOLDIERS yelling]

[WEI SOLDIER 236L]
Kill Xin of the Fei Xin Force!

Even more than before!

175
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,833
All right.

176
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,458
Here we go then, men!

177
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,208
Let's show them what the
Fei Xin Force is really made of!

Those bastards!

[TIAN XIAO] Hurry up,
He Liao Diao! The enemy!

[DIAO gasps]

[DIAO] Their defense is
entirely focused on Xin now!

00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,125
Right now!
Raise the signal flag!

--Hm?
--Huh?

185
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,125
What's that?
That strange noise?

00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,000
[BING GUI] Behind us?

[rumbling noise]

188
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,291
[MENG YI] The second way to
strike an enemy's main camp

189
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:16,916
is to use an ingenious trick to
open a hole in their defense,

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,708
then unleash a lethal one-hit
surprise attack right after.

191

[YOUNGER LIE] Guo Bei's men
of the Fei Xin Force, go!

00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,625
[WEI SOLDIER 236M]
They're attacking us?

194
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,833
[WEI SOLDIER 236N]
It's an attack!

195
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,291
[XIN] Diao, you really
are something else!

196
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,791
Are you seriously using me
as a decoy right now?

197
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,666
Hey! Did we capture
their generals?

198
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,291
Hahaha! We did it!

199
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,416
[TIAN YONG]
Why haven't you killed them?

200
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,375
[YOUNGER LIE] The lady tactician
said to take them alive.

201
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,875
[TIAN YONG] Take them alive?

202
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,625
[YOUNGER LIE] She said
it's a battle of subjugation.

203
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,000
What?

204
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,166
Well either way, they'll
be very pleased to see them

205
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,583
at main camp!

Hey, look up, you guys!

207
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:25,125
[WEI PING] The main camp--our
main camp is burning now!

00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,166
[PEI LANG]
What? What's happening?

209
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,375
[PEI LANG] Just as we
took down their camp?

210
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,375
We did use most of
our soldiers for the attack.

211
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,833
There must've been almost
no one guarding the camp.

212
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,291
Uh, what did you say?

213
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,750
Don't tell me that brat
ended up sacrificing herself.

214
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,958
Hey now!
Don't go writing me off!

215
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,083
[XIN] Diao!

216
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,291
[TIAN YONG]
The brat!

217
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,625
So what's with our camp?

218
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,625
Oh, they probably
set fire to it

219
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,500
out of spite for losing.

220
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,000
And because I wasn't there.

221
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,125
[YUAN] How'd you manage to
escape the surrounding troops

222
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,750
with so few men?

223
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,791
[DIAO] You have got to
secure a solid escape route

224
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,666
from the beginning!

225
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,333

226
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,250
[WEI PING]
Amazing!

Completely out of this world!

Seems like you have
some guts, you know!

Hey. Bing Gui?

--Oh yeah!
--led us to victory today!

you're wrong, right, Tian Yong?

234
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,208
[TIAN YONG]
Eh, it was just a fluke.

235
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,166
[PEI LANG]
Hey, take it like a man!

236
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,166
[BING GUI]
Quit yanking my chain!

237
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,583
This? This little
tiny girl right here?

238
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,416
I am the great Bing Gui,

239
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,875
one of Wei's top
eight elite tacticians,

240
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,375
and I lost today
to someone like her?

241
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,875
[BING GUI]
I refuse to accept that.

242
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,541
This attack was
an impractical creation,

243
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,625
the worst plan of all time!

244
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,875
It worked only because
the Fei Xin Force

245
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,541
just happened to have
good fighting strength!

246
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:10,583
Because if it was any other
unit, the decoys would be dead!

247
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,333
[BING GUI] You must have
significant casualties!

248
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,916
[XIN] Hey.

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,625
Quit your yapping now, old man.

250
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,875
Me? "Old man"?

251
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,750
Then her plan
was pretty amazing,

252
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,875
using the power
of the Fei Xin Force

253
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,083
to its greatest
potential in the very end.

254
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,791
Face it, this was a battle
of wits, and you just lost

255
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,708
to He Liao Diao, our tactician!

256
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,250
Catch that name?

257
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,333
Make sure you remember it!

258
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,583
Um, Xin...

259
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,125

260
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,333

[curtain opens]

265
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,000
[XIN] Hey.

266
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,416
Hi, Xin!

267
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,208
What are you doing over here?

268
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,708
It's been a good long while
since we properly celebrated.

269
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,125
Come on.

270
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,500
No, I'm good.

271
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,166
I have to work out strategies

272
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,333
for the terrain that's
coming up real soon, you know.

273
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,833
[XIN] Yeah, but you
can do that tomorrow.

274
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,958
Well, no, I cannot!

275
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,791
If I... If I make
just the slightest mistake,

276
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,958
dozens of people
will die once again.

277
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,416
I need a solid plan this time.

278
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,000
[XIN] You really
shouldn't burden yourself

279
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,083
with the number of casualties.

280
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,625
But I do, I have to!

281
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,208
Why can't you
understand the stakes?

282
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,708
[DIAO] Every direction
I give on the battlefield

283
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:55,875
takes into account just how many
men might die out there for us.

284
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,208
Look, Diao--

285
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,000
[DIAO] I am truly
cut out for this work,

286
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,125
and I showed that aptitude
in my first battle.

287
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,916
However, when I think
of what lies ahead,

288
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,666
I can't help but get scared.

289
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,833
Nearly a hundred troops
died in this battle, you know.

290
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,791
How many hundreds more
will there be in the end?

291
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,625
Even the nice man who told me

292
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,541
that I looked like his
daughter, just earlier...

293
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,625
He died by my strategy.

294
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:35,083
He went out of his way to
offer encouragement, and I--

295
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,125
And I--

296
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,791
[DIAO] I can't bring him back.
That smile of his.

297
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,083
[curtain opens]

298
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,000
You should just
leave now, then.

299
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,833
[XIN] Go to war,
and you'll kill someone.

300
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,666
Friend or enemy, who knows
how much blood and tears

301
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,916
are spilled behind the scenes?

302
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,500
And the victors carry all that
with them as they move forward.

303
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,291
That's why your back
gets heavier and heavier

304
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,208
with every single win.

305
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,041
[XIN] If you came over here
not knowing about that pain,

306
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,083
just leave now.

307
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,666
I'm not going anywhere!

308
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,916
I was just talking about
how much worse it was,

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,291
in a real battle!

310
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,125
It's a pain worse than I
had ever imagined, you know!

311
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,208
I didn't come here on
a whim, do you understand me?

312
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,458
[laughs]

313
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,500
Right on!

314
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,833
That's why this old veteran in
front of you is gonna teach you

315
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,625
the trick to sticking
around out here!

316
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,041
Give me your hand, then!

317
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,916
What?

318
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,666
[XIN] Come on! Like this!

319
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,916
[DIAO] Hey, Xin!
That hurts a lot!

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,666
Just keep going!

321
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,208
[XIN] The pain of losing
a comrade is the same

322
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,125
for tacticians
and soldiers alike.

323
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,458
However, we happen
to know the best way

324
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,375
to overcome that pain,
as you'll soon see.

325
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,666
[SOLDIERS laughing]

326
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,708
[laughing continues]

327
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,916
[XIN] We all share it
and make it hurt less

328
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,625
by celebrating over the top
and send it packing.

329
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,375
You do it too, then.

330
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,833
Because you're one of us,
and now you know.

331
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,708
[GUO BEI'S SOLDIERS] And-a one,
and-a two, and-a one-two-three!

332
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,666
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 236E]
I'm gonna die!

333
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,000
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 236F]
You guys are the best!

334
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,041
And you want me to do that?

335
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,666
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 236G]
Hey, it's the lady tactician!

336
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,833
[WEI PING]
No! Don't look down!

337
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:01,958
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 236H]
There she is!

338
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,708
Over here, Miss Diao!
Come down!

339
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,208
I still don't like her!

340
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,000
Be quiet, Tian Yong!

341
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,541
Hey, Xin.

342
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,500
[XIN]
What? What is it?

343
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,958
[DIAO] Will you let go of
my hand? It's mortifying!

344
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,666
Don't be such a jerk!
It's not like I was trying to--

345
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,791
Yes I know, I know!

346
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,125
Right, let's do this!

347
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,083
[QING] Xin is here!

348
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,666
[WEI PING]
Oh, who needs you?

349
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,625
[XIN]
Say what?

350
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,166
[XIN]
So who doesn't need me?

351
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,916
[laughing]

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,458
[DIAO] Thanks a lot, Xin.

353
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,916
[yawning]

354
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,833
Hey!

355
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,458
Lieutenant Chu Shui
and his troops are back!

356
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,208
[TIAN XIAO] I've brought back
Lieutenant Chu Shui.

357
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,625
[DIAO] I see.

358
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,208
It must have been rough
handling your supply work

359
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,958
with the main camp
moving all over the place.

360
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,708
I will take over
all that kind of stuff

361
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,583
from now onwards, understand?

362
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,708
So you can just go right back
to the front of the lines now.

363
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,291
And just who
is this girl, then?

364
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,000
I thought you said
you told him before!

365
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,666
This is Xin's little sister?

366
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,500
[DIAO, TIAN XIAO]
No, no, no!

367
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,875
[TIAN XIAO]
This is He Liao Diao,

368
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,708
and she's our new
tactician you see!

369
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,750
Yep, it's all finally
coming together!

370
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,291
[NARRATOR] From then on,

371
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:50,250
the Fei Xin Force went on
to crush their opposition.

372
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,583
[gasps]

373
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,291
[XIN yelling]

374
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,541
[NARRATOR] The Wei army
that had gathered at Lijing

375
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,625
to try to reclaim Shanyang

376
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,791
were instead rounded up
by the dozen,

377
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:04,875
and in ten short days,
Lijing was finally conquered.

378
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:10,375
[SOLDIERS cheering]

379
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,708
The Fei Xin Force
has come all this way?

380
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,625
That's right, with no enemies
left to go after Lijing,

381
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,250
they're moving north.

382
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,458
I hear they'd be working
with the Le Hua Force

383
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,000
in order to rout
Wei troops in Weizi.

384
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,083
It really does appear
like they've gotten

385
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,666
their old strength
right back now.

386
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,958
Even stronger.

387
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,916
In the Lijing Offensive,

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,291
they didn't just take out
the enemies they had,

389
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,500
they fought as if battling
absolutely all of the Wei troops

390
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,208
throughout the region
they were in, you see.

391
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,916
And with the help
and the positions

392
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,416
of the adjacent
fellow Qin armies,

393
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,375
they treated all of Lijing like
one big battlefield, and won!

394
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,750
And so, that truly
was wide-scale warfare.

395
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,208
Clearly, the Fei Xin Force
possesses a might

396
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,833
they never had
in times before.

397
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,500
Now that they're coming
into their own

398
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:18,541
as solid independent reserves,
they're truly powerful.
