[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,500
the king who worked
toward unification,

3
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,583
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,250
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,583
Wang Ben, Meng Tian, and Xin,

6
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,958
these bold soldiers and
aspiring great generals

7
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,625
were together here now,

8
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,791
ready to usher in
a brand-new age!

9
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,750
So you're Xin. Hmph.

10
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,625
You look just as I'd imagined.

11
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,791
You were once a servant, yes?

12
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,458
[XIN grunts]

13
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,583
I, Guo Bei, was
also once a servant.

[gasps]

15
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,791
[GUO BEI]
I thought I would step in

16
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,791
to offer my help perhaps,
but I see... Hmph.

17
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,958
I should mind
my own business.

18
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,000
[XIN]
Uh...

19
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,416
This unit is on the right track.

20
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Just keep going.

21
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,541
Don't let those nobles
beat you down, Xin!

22
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,416
[XIN]
Uh.

23
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,333
[LUN HU] Commander
Guo Bei, a moment?

[gasping]

33
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:14,583
[XIN] How...
How could this happen?

34
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,125
He was only just talking
to us a second ago.

35
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,000
[XIN]
Commander Guo Bei.

36
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,041
You watch.
I'm going to avenge you.

37
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,791
You can count on it!

38
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,666
There must definitely
be Wei assassins

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,916
hiding somewhere around here!

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,458
I think they might
still be nearby!

41
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,791
We should look
as well, right, Xin?

42
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,791
Damn right, we should!

43

Leave no stone unturned!

46

We are gonna find that bastard

47
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,541
who killed Commander Guo Bei!

[QIN HORSEMAN A]
Terrible news!

50
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:01,583
Say what? They find 'em already?

51
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,666
[QIN HORSEMAN A]
It's not just Guo Bei!

52
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,500
Commander Bi Zhi, too...

53
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,875
...and Commander
Ma Gao have been slain, too!

...all three of them!

[shocked murmuring]

00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,250
What in the world?

60
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,541
What exactly is going on?

Let's see, so then...

64
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,041
...that was Ma Gao
I killed earlier.

65
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,625
So, um, who's this, then?

66
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,000
[ADJUTANT A]
Lun Hu, sir?

67
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,000
It's about time to move out.

68
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,500
The Qin appear to be growing
increasingly restless now.

69
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,791
Fine, fine. I think
I will go with him next.

70
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,000
All right.

71
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,916
I'll take down one or two more,

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,958
then we can call it a night.

73
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,958
[UNDERLINGS murmuring]

74
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,208
And now Commander Lu's
been slain!

75
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,916
We cannot dismiss
this as the work

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,833
of a mere enemy remnant!

77
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,500
[UNDERLING C] There is a
skilled assassin among us

78
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,500
that does not make a mistake.

79
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,708
[UNDERLING D growls]
We're in an unfamiliar place,

80
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,500
and with night falling
we're in real danger!

81
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:46,875
Remain calm!

82
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,041
[UNDERLINGS gasping]

83
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,625

--[LUO YUAN] Huh?

[UNDERLINGS gasping]

90
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,416
[LUO YUAN]
Ah, young sir!

91
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,416
We have a rat among us, I see.

92
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,250
Correct, and one with

93
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,125
particularly nasty
fangs, I'm afraid.

94
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,083
We've already lost
6,000-man commanders.

95
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,875
[MENG TIAN]
Six now?

96
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,041
[MENG TIAN]
The commanding general is safe?

97
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,375
[LUO YUAN]
He is.

98
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,166
Commander Bai Lao is
naturally extremely cautious

99
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,125
and we've increased
his guards, as well.

100
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,500
You ought to be careful
yourself, young sir.

101
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,291
The Le Hua Force
has 300 members,

102
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,208
but you are ranked high
enough to command 1,000.

103
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,666
The assassin could
well come after you.

104
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,875
Yes, well about that matter.

105
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,666
Doesn't it make you feel uneasy?

106
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,083
[LUO YUAN]
Hmm?

107
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,000
[MENG TIAN] From what
I hear, every single one

108
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,333
of the slain commanders
were all powerhouses

109
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,791
in the main unit.

110
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,916
Whoever is doing this

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,750
is obviously going
after the big guns.

112
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,083
It's almost as though a
certain Wei general could be

113
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,291
laying the groundwork
for a massive war

114
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,583
to happen down the road.

115
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,041
[gasps]

116
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,916
[sighs]
The Meng clan has grown

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,375
more secure in your generation.

118
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,625
But I really believe you are

119
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,208
simply overthinking this matter.

120
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,333
There are no generals
in Wei that could ever

121
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,250
be skilled enough
for the careful plotting

122
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,625
that you're suggesting,

123
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,291
not since Wu Qing died.

124
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,458
This business is simply

125
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,791
by a rogue Wei
soldier-turned-assassin

126
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,500
here in Jinliguan,

127
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,000
striking back the best he can

128
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,416
at the most appropriate moments
of vulnerability, you see.

129
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,541
He merely targets
1,000-man commanders,

130
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,416
because the higher ranks
are better protected.

131
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,875
Security is light for
1,000-man commanders,

132
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,625
that much is very true.

133
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,791
However, please be cautious,
General Luo Yuan.

134
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,625
As hard as it really is to lose

135
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,750
all of these skilled commanders,

136
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,291
there is no substitute for you,

137
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,583
so please understand.

138
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,333
If you ever were to be slain,

139
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,750
General Meng Ao's army
would be greatly diminished.

140
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,125
I hope you see this clearly.

141
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,750
[LUO YUAN grunts]
Understood.

142
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,541
But never fear,
the assassin will be caught

143
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,291
and beheaded tonight! [laughs]

144
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,791
[QIN SOLDIERS laugh]

145
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,250
[NARRATOR]
But in the end, the Qin army

146
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,250
was unable to
apprehend the culprit

147
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,875
of all of these killings.

148
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,000
[NARRATOR]
Meng Ao's army lost eight

149
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,458
one 1,000-man
commanders mysteriously

150
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,250
in that single night.

151
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,375
[NARRATOR]
Three days later,

152
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,458
Meng Ao's army was preparing

153
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,875
to take their very next castle,

154
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,208
under the strictest
of conditions.

155
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,416
[FAN YANG]
Look over there, sir!

156
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,041
All those heavy
infantry surrounding

157
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,958
the main camp
where General Meng Ao

158
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,166
is currently riding in.

159
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,750
Can you see them?

160
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,916
Perhaps your advice worked
too well, young sir.

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,666
Now no one can approach Bai Lao,

162
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,333
be they an assassin
or an assistant! [laughs]

163

[MENG TIAN] This is
the same tightened security

00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,291
we'd have during
a pitched battle.

165
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,625
Has Grandfather picked
up on something, too?

166
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,833
That wall around
Luo Yuan is impenetrable.

167
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,666
An assassin won't come
after them like this.

168
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,750
I mean, it's just
far too impractical.

169
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,041
[gasps]

170
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,833
[XIN]
What's this? [grunts]

171
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,916
[XIN]
For a second there, I--

172
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,875
[WEI PING]
Um, what's up, Xin?

173
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,375
[XIN]
It's like I felt a chill.

174
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:22,875
[WEI PING]
Hey, Xin!

175
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,875
[XIN gasps]

176
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,916
What's wrong?

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,666
[XIN]
Uh. Nothing. C'mon. Now.

178
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,541
[KING JINGMIN] What's the
meaning of this, Lian Po?

179
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,333
I hear one of your
associates has gone off

180
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,958
to slay a bunch
of Qin commanders

181
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,125
with only 300 men in their unit.

182
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,000
I could've given
him thousands of troops

183
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,333
if you'd asked.

184
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,916
Someone like Lun Hu would never

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,583
misjudge his own ability,
if you catch my drift.

186
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,333
If he says 300, then 300 it is.

187
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,375
It's as simple as that.

188
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,083
B-But it'd take 300 troops

189
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,541
if they had to chip
away at one camp!

190
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,083
Killing commanders of an army

191
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,833
of more than
10,000 strong!

192
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,250
And Lun Hu, he's that young man

193
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,333
with the feminine
appearance right?

194
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,541
[LIAN PO]
Oh.

195
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,458
[LIAN PO] Do you mean to
say that the spear

196
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,541
I have thrown their
way is a light one?

197
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,541
[gasps] No, not at all.

198
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,791
Excellent. Since you
judge only by appearances,

199
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,083
allow me to explain
so you will understand.

200
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,083
[grunts]

201
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,083
[LIAN PO]
Are you quite familiar

202
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,625
with Qin's six great generals?

203
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,750
[gasps]
Yes, of course I--

204
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,500
[LIAN PO]
No,

205
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,708
you are not!

206
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,333
[KING JINGMIN]
Say what?

207
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,541
Wh-What do you mean, Lian Po?

208
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,125
Lian Po?

209
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,791
[LIAN PO]
Indeed.

210
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,000
It really felt as
though burning lead

211
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,791
was being driven
directly into my belly.

212
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,916
[LIAN PO] Whenever
I faced off against troops

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,833
led by those very
six great generals.

214
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,166
[LIAN PO] No matter how many
times we fought each other,

215
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,208
each time brought
pressure so great

216
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,500
as to crush all of
my insides into sheer paste.

217
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,958
Especially Wang Yi's army.

218
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,166
His multilayered
defense formation

219
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,041
was a veritable iron wall
as you'd ever seen!

220
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,958
[LIAN PO]
Attempting to take his head

221
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,125
would be like stripping
yourself naked

222
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:58,250
and then bashing yourself
afterwards against that barrier.

223
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,916
And yet...

224
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,916
[LIAN PO]
...Lun Hu did it!

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,375
[gasps]

226
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,375
[LIAN PO]
Furthermore, having put

227
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,125
a chink in that metal wall,

228
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,833
he then crossed blades...

229
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,333
[LIAN PO]
...with Wang Yi beyond it!

230
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,416
[laughs]

231
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,916
[chuckles]
So, you now understand.

232
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,375
If Lun Hu says 300,
300 is enough.

233
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,666
Once he has been loosed
from my tight grasp,

234
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,958
no one will ever
be able to stop him!

235
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,083
[groans]

236
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,541
Augh!

237
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,333
[QIN SOLDIER E] Aaah!
No, it can't be! General, sir!

238
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,583
It's the general!
General Luo Yuan!

239
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,583
[QIN SOLDIERS shocked chatter]

240
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,083
[QIN SOLDIER F]
Not General Luo Yuan!

241
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,125
[QIN SOLDIER G]
General Luo Yuan is slain!

242
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,750
Say what?!

243
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,125
[MENG TIAN]
Impossible! How on earth--

244
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,333
[QIN SOLDIER G] The assassin
has troops laying in ambush!

245
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,291
[QIN SOLDIER F]
Some 300 of them too!

246
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,583
[QIN SOLDIER E]
Here they come!

247
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,416
[QIN SOLDIER E] We're up
against a 300-man unit!

248
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,166
[QIN SOLDIER F]
Over there!

249
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,291
Three hundred?

250
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,958
[QIN SOLDIER F]
They went that way!

251
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,708
[QIN SOLDIER G]
They went down the slope!

252
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,250
[QIN SOLDIER E]
You down there, surround them!

253
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,583
[QIN SOLDIER G]
Don't let them get away!

254
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,208
[grunts] It's them now!

255
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,416
The 300-man unit that
killed General Luo Yuan!

256
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,583
They must also be who
killed General Guo Bei then!

257
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,500
Aaaaah!

258
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,708
[XIN]
Time for us to get revenge!

259
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,750
For General Guo Bei!

260
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,375
What shall I do, Lun Hu, sir?

261
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,666
Forget about the small fry.
Drive them in front and go.

262
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,875
[FEI XIN FORCE yell]

263
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,291

00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:30,583

00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,875
[gasping]

00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,375
Hyaaaaa!

267
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,083
[XIN]
He stopped it?

268
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,250
[LUN HU]
Hmph!

269
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,500
[XIN gasps]

270
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,583
Uh! Aaaaaaaah!

271
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,666
[FEI XIN SOLDIER A]
Sir!

272
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,375
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS]
Sir! Sir!

273
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,625
L-Let go!

274
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:04,958
Ow! I said let go!
Agh! Let go! Ow! Ow!

275
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,333
Let go, darn it!

276
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,333
[XIN growls]

277
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,625
[XIN]
This guy's grip is insane!

278
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,875
You idiot! Let me go!

279
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,333
[LUN HU]
Hmph!

280
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:27,833
[XIN screams] You pest!
Quit screwing around!

281
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,833
[XIN]
Huh? Uh! Ah! Aaaaah!

282
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,875
[XIN grunts]

283
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,958
Lun Hu, sir?

284
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,333
Go on ahead.
I'll be along shortly.

285
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,041
Lun Hu?

286
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,125
[LUN HU]
Now that's strange.

287
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,166
You're not at all
afraid of my bloodlust.

288
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,583
You even dodged my sword!

289
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,416
Am I getting rusty, then?

290
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,708
Or are you... just really
that strong, perhaps?

291
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,291
Which is it?

292
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:09,791
[XIN grunts] I'm just
that strong, obviously!

293
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,833
Right, then. And your name?

294
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,166
Xin of the Fei Xin Force!

295
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,750
[laughs] Straightforward!

296
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,125
[XIN grunts]

297
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,333
[LUN HU]
Hmm? You're not in here.

298
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,083
Xin of the
Fei Xin Force, was it?

299
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:33,875
Then I guess I don't need
to be killing you. [chuckles]

300
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,041
It's your lucky day, then!

301
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,916
Bye for now.

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,750
Wait a minute! Are you
the one who killed Guo Bei?

303
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:53,041
[LUN HU] Well, what do you know?
I sure did kill him!

304
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:57,833
Oh, right! That was the
turn-and-slash job I did!

305
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,291
Why, you little--

306
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,250
[XIN yells]

307
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,833
[XIN grunts]

308
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,041
[XIN]
He did it again!

309
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,333
[LUN HU laughs] It's been
a while since I've sparred.

310
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,291
[LUN HU]
Seems like despite his age,

311
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,583
this kid has quite a
few battles under his belt.

312
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,041
[LUN HU] A shallow one.
So, he dodged that too.

313
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,500
[XIN grunts]

314
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:43,666
[LUN HU] Oh, dear me!
Isn't this a surprise!

315
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,166
It's ever so faint,

316
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,583
but this boy already has the
air of a general about him,

317
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,958
more so than the
1,000-man commanders

318
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:56,083
I've been killing.
Without a shadow of doubt.

319
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:00,916
So even a place like Qin has its
promising young buds. [snorts]

320
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,291
My lord would be very eager
to see just how he turns out,

321
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,166
but I'm afraid
I don't care about that.

322
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,958
[XIN gasps]

323
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,958
[LUN HU] So sorry, an enemy I
see must be pulled by the roots.

324
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,750
[screams]

325
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,125
[XIN gasps]

326
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,875
[FEI XIN SOLDIER B]
Commander!

327
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,750
Rescue Commander Xin!

328
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,041
[SONG ZUO]
We're coming now!

329
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,250
[WEI PING]
Xin!

330
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,875
It's them!

331
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,333
[gasps]

332
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,291
Wait! Who are you, exactly?

333
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,458
You act like an assassin,
but you're a 300-man commander?

334
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,416
[LUN HU] I do have
300 men at the moment,

335
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,833
but I'm no 300-man
commander, truthfully.

336
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,166
[LUN HU] There have been
times I've led 1,000,

337
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,916
even 10,000 men.

338
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,541
Actually,
I'm a full-fledged general.

339
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,750
Say what? A general?!

340
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,083
You're lying to me!

341
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,291
A twisted kid like you

342
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,916
could never be a
general in the first place!

343
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,458
A twisted kid? You wound me!

344
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,958
Despite all appearances,
I'm in my thirties.

345
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,416
Wha-- Thirties?

346
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,083
Well, I think that's
enough for today.

347
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,541
Huh?

348
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,833
Your comrades seem to truly
idolize you. Good for you.

349
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:49,041
People like that tend to be
beloved by the heavens too.

350
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,333
Heavens?

351
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,666
[LUN HU] No matter how
talented or powerful you may be,

352
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,666
without a touch
of luck from above,

353
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,416
you'll only meet an early
end along your path.

354
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,625
[XIN]
Uh...

355
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,625
[LUN HU] I've seen it happen
to lots of military men.

356
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:09,750
Like, oh I don't know, those
slain 1,000-man commanders?

357
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,000
You killed them, as well?

358
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,166
[LUN HU]
There are so few.

359
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,750
Only a handful of generals
are adored by the heavens.

360
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:51,625
Wait, why am I telling you
all of this right now?

361
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:55,916
Oh, of course. Hmm.

362
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,208
[LUN HU] Because I thought
the way he just shone

363
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,791
somehow reminded me
of them a little bit.

364
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,083
[LUN HU]
Xin of the Fei Xin Force.

365
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:23,041
I will be adding you to
my list very shortly, indeed.

366
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,166
Uh... Wait!

367
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,958
[pants]

368
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,791
[LUN HU]
I'll let you go, just this once.

369
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,000
If we should meet again,

370
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,166
I will take your life.

371
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,166
[FEI XIN SOLDIER C]
Commander!

372
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,000
[FEI XIN SOLDIER E]
Sir!

373
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,000
[FEI XIN SOLDIER D]
Xin!

374
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,291
[WEI PING]
Xin! Are you okay? Xin!

375
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,625
So the fool just got away?

376
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,833
What do we do Xin? Go after him?

377
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,208
Hmm?

378
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,833
A general adored by the heavens.

379
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,000
[MAO, WEI PING]
Hmmm?

380
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,666
Xin?

381
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,416
[gasps]

382
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,750
[XIN]
What's up with that?
