00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,291
[NARRATOR]
Under the rule of Ying Zheng,

2
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,125
the king who aimed
for unification,

3
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,333
the kingdom of Qin
launched an invasion

4
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,375
on the neighboring land of Wei.

5
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,541
Their opponent: the
legendary general Lian Po.

6
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,708
The young commanders stepped
onto a relentless battlefield,

7
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,500
their sights set on
a major victory.

8
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,291
[WANG JIAN]
Very well.

9
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,541
I shall hand over
my troops to you.

10
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,666
[BI gasps]

11
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,333
[WANG JIAN]
Round up the squads nearby

12
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,583
and you should
have your 5,000.

13
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,916
You now have commanding
authority over them.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,958
[WANG JIAN]
Bi!

15
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,458
Henceforth, you're a
5,000-man commander.

16
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,833
So now, go stop Qiang Yan
of the Wei army!

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,083
[BI]
Me? A 5,000-man commander?

18
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,833
[BI]
We can do this. We can win!

19
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,541
You don't scare me, Qiang Yan!

20
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:48,416
{SOLDIERS yelling, grunting]

21

[yelling]

22
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,250
[BI]
The straits.

23
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,541
It's an area of low ground that
is surrounded by sheer cliffs.

24
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:17,625
A fairly gentle slope enters
the straits at one end of it,

25
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,333
while a narrow,
cliff-bound path exits

26
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,291
at the other end of the strait.

27
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,666
[WEI SOLDIERS screaming]

28
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,916
[BI] If an attacker can
get on top of those cliffs,

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,916
they can rain down arrows
from that high ground,

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,166
destroying the enemy's power.

31
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,666
Then, at the right moment,
race down the cliffs

32
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,375
to finish the job.

33
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:00,333
Keep going, or you'll just
be eating enemy arrows!

34
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,541
Hurry! Keep going!

35
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,625
It's no use! Our path's blocked,
we can't move!

36
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,291
[BI] With their
clifftop escape route blocked,

37
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,625
the soldiers under attack

38
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,541
will rush their only exit,
the narrow path out,

39
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,875
The bottleneck will
hinder their movements.

40
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,500
[QIN SOLDIERS yelling]

41
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,875
[WEI SOLDIER C]
No good!

42
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,541
They're blocking
the rear route, too!

43
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,375
[BI] Once the enemy is
focused on the way out,

44
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,083
it's easy to
surround them from behind.

45
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,208
[BI] In other words, if you can
lure the enemy into the straits

46
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,416
and maintain control
of the cliffs,

47
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,208
you can fairly easily take
down twice as many men!

48
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,541
[QIN SOLDIERS yelling]

49

[BI'S UNDERLING A]
Bi, sir!

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,250
It appears that our army has
completely overwhelmed

51
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,333
the enemy now!

52
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,000
They can no longer
run or fight back!

53
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,208
They are incapacitated!

54
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,375
[BI]
All right.

55
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,250
Excellent!

56
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,416
We've got 'em!

57
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,625
With 5,000 men
currently in my command,

58
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:14,041
I'll take down one of Lian Po's
Big Four: General Qiang Yan,

59
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,416
and his 10,000 troops, as well!

60
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,125
We will now finish this
battle immediately,

61
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,416
giving the foe no chance!

62
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,541
Troops, you must
descend the cliffs

63
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,791
and strike their general
Qiang Yan, right away!

64
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,541
Was that really such a
good idea, Wang Jian, sir?

65
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,625
Giving Bi 5,000 more men

66
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,333
on top of the thousand
in his command?

67
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,375
[WANG JIAN]
My judgment is impeccable.

68
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,625
[WANG JIAN] He will prove
an excellent decoy.

00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:10,166
Qiang Yan! The enemy is pouring
down from the cliffs now!

71
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,541
It seems their entire army
is after our main camp!

72
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,083
Keep the defense
formation intact.

73
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,375
Once we've pulled
them in, we attack.

Qiang Yan, sir!

00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:27,000
Enemy troops have broken through
our defenses and are closing in!

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,250
It seems we will have no choice
but to fight our way out.

78
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,458
Unless we hold our ground and
beat them at their own game.

79
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,208
What shall we do, my lord?

80
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,583
Pardon me, sir?

[QIANG YAN'S UNDERLING C]
Qiang Yan, Sir!

Just stay strong! Go onward!

00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,875
Go in there and take
Qiang Yan's head right now!

We've just received word
from the unit

stationed in the
northeast woods!

This is the only battle that
concerns us at this very moment!

But, sir!

90
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,375
Those same troops who had
been fighting hard

91
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,791
right until yesterday have now
suddenly disappeared, you see!

has just disappeared?!

[BI'S UNDERLING A] The enemy!

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,791
Wei soldiers on
top of the cliff!

99
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,958
That's just absurd!
Where'd they come from?!

No! Get everyone back up
on the cliff, right away!

They'll use the straits
against us! Right now!

00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,291
[BI'S UNDERLING A] We can't,

107
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,750
[BI'S UNDERLING C] The enemy has

Just keep running!
Gather allies and regroup,

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,833
then find a way, any way,
out of this place right now!

[SOLDIERS yelling]

131
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,875
So you're Qiang Yan, aren't you?

132
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,625
[WANG JIAN]
The clifftops belong to us, now.

133
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:30,375
[BI] We have the advantage
of the straits once again!

134
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,291
[WANG JIAN]
You lose this time, Qiang Yan.

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,583
Impossible!

136
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,000
How could we have overlooked
their incoming reinforcements?

137
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,458
[WEI SOLDIER D]
We're done for!

138
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,125
[WEI SOLDIER E]
We'll be slaughtered!

139
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,708
[BI'S UNDERLING C]
Bi, sir, does this mean...

140
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,666
...that we have won just now?

141
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,291
We're all saved?

142
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,916
[BI'S UNDERLING A yells]

143
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,416
[BI] Yes, it's true,
victory is definitely ours now.

144
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,833
And yet...

145
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,875
...where on earth did those
clifftop reinforcements

146
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,833
come from, exactly?

147
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,916
An army of 5 or 6,000
cannot just show up

148
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,958
so easily like that.

149
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,125
Clearly, they were ready
and waiting for the right time.

150
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,583
[BI] General Wang Jian.
He must have known all along

151
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,958
that we couldn't
possibly defeat Qiang Yan

152
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,041
without all this
additional help!

153
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,708
The losing commander
must now die.

154
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,500
Such is the iron law
of the battlefield, Qiang Yan.

155
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,625
Qiang Yan, sir! We will be
able to hold them off!

156
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,166
You must escape as we do so!

157
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,541
But... I am a merciful man.

158
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,791
I shall offer to you
a single path to survival.

159
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,125
[WANG JIAN]
From now on,

160
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:05,958
you shall serve only me.
And praise me as your only lord,

161
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,708
pledge me all your fealty,
and I shall spare your life

162
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:13,208
and those of all your
men present here.

163
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,750
Pardon me?

164
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:19,291
[BI] What? He's
recommending surrender?!

165
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,791
[WANG JIAN]
You shall not be servants.

166
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,916
I promise each of you land,
as well as sufficient pay

167
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,666
for your livelihoods.

168
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,541
And you, Qiang Yan.

169
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,875
You shall be my very own
personal advisor.

170
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,416
So he's recruiting us now?

171
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,250
How can a commander possibly
give us all land and pay?

172
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,083
Does he think we'll be
fooled by such nonsense?

173
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,750
The war's not even
over just yet!

174
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,416
He must think we're stupid!

175
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,375
I speak in all seriousness.

176
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,416
At this moment, my land
has a desperate need

177
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,666
of a war-strong man
such as yourself.

178
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,500
[QIANG YAN
 "My land"?

179
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,833
[BI] What is General Wang Jian
going on about right now?

180
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,458
[WANG JIAN] You will not
regret it, Qiang Yan.

181
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,250
[WANG JIAN] However...

182
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,791
If you refuse,

183
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:16,458
these straits will be made into
a sea of blood immediately.

184
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,166
[growling, gasping]

185
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,125
Wow, his arrows are
able to pierce a shield

186
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,458
of specially forged
steel, somehow!

187
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,875
Amazing.

188
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,791
If he's turned his bow
upon Wang Jian--

189
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,041
Shall we then tear him apart
right now, sir?

190
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,958
[WANG JIAN]
No. Take him alive.

191
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,416
[growling]

192
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,958
[QIANG YAN] Wang Jian, there's
something I must ask you first.

193
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,916
Not a step closer, Qiang Yan!
Throw down your bow!

194
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,583
When we gained the upper hand in
the early stages of the battle--

195
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,000
was that really your plan?

196
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,291
That's correct.

197
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,000
What does he mean,
Qiang Yan, sir?

198
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,833
You see, there's a reason
we didn't notice the Qin army

199
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,875
atop those cliffs before.
I get it now.

200
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,416
They didn't come
from elsewhere.

201
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,583
They were hidden here,
waiting before the battle began.

202
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,958
Before the battle even began?

203
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,458
You mean he knew
we would be fighting here?

204
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,125
It was all planned?

205
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,333
[BI]
General Wang Jian.

206
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,541
[By the time he
gave me 5,000 men

207
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,708
and told me to go
after Qiang Yan,

208
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:02,166
he had already hidden his
troops here long before.

209
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,000
So, I... was nothing
but a decoy!

210
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,250
Still...

211
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:11,125
So then, he couldn't put
together such an army

212
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,708
without our noticing.
Hidden or otherwise!

213
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,250
It's a trick!

214
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,458
We scattered exactly like the
Qin army scattered as well,

215
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,458
and we were keeping track
of their every movement.

216
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,625
We would have surely noticed a
5,000-man army disappear!

217
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,666
No. We did not note
their every movement.

218
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,125
Because one army
successfully evaded our grasp.

219
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,666
That was his main army.

220
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,708
Wang Jian's main army
began their retreat so quickly

221
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,166
that we knew very few details of
their scale or equipment,

222
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,291
if any.

223
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,708
That is true.

224
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,791
We closely followed the movement
of the retreating army

225
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,791
but not numbers.

226
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:57,291
Before we realized it, he must
have split up the main army.

227
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,125
[BI] Which means... the troops
who appeared on the cliff

228
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,833
were a part of
General Wang Jian's main army.

229
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,375
[QIANG YAN] Wang Jian knew this
land was special terrain

230
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,916
due to the straits.

231
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,458
Thus, he knew we'd
be fighting here.

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,916
Well, more accurately,
he knew he could use a decoy

233
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,041
to compel us subconsciously
to select this very place

234
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,750
for our upcoming battle.

235
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,625
Consequently, in order to attack

236
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,916
once we'd chose
the battleground,

237
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,416
he would've had to hide
his troops right here

238
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,083
ahead of time you see.

239
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,458
and to put those
troops together,

240
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:42,333
he had to pull out his main army
as soon as possible.

241
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,416
Additionally, to make that
retreat look quite natural,

242
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,375
Wang Jian's troops
let themselves

243
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,166
be pushed further back,
and purposely,

244
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,166
they struggled
in the early stages.

245
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,458
No way!

246
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,416
That's when this began?

247
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,291
[BI] What on earth
is this battle anyway?

248
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,541
Just how far ahead
was this all planned?

249
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,791
It is hard to believe.

250
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,208
To have foreseen this
with the faintest of clues,

251
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,583
his opponent's very
state of mind,

252
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,625
a shift in the tide of war.

253
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,041
He has surpassed the
bounds of humanity.

254
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,250
[QIANG YAN]
He is a monster, and...

255
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,000
...esteemed personage.

256
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:35,791

[SOLDIERS yelling]

258
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,166

259
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,541

[laughs]

262
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,208
You really did exactly
everything that I thought

263
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,958
you would do, Wang Jian!

264
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,083
[laughs]

265
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,125
[NARRATOR] It was then, that a
strange phenomenon occurred.

266
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,708
[NARRATOR] All sound vanished
from the bellowing battlefield.

267
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,208
Completely.

268
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,250
[NARRATOR]
Qin and Wei alike at this time,

269
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:02,083
every soldier on the scene stood
stock-still and simply stared.

270
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,041
[NARRATOR] And then,

271
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,458
they all felt their
temperature rise tremendously

272
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,916
at the same time.

273
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:34,166
[WEI SOLDIERS yell]

274
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:40,833
[BI]
This... This is... Lian Po!

275
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:56,166
[WEI SOLDIERS yell]

276
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,041
[XIN]
What is this... sensation?

277
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,125
[XIN]
Feels just like...

278
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,041
...when General Wang Yi
used to appear

279
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,208
on the battlefield back then.

280
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,833
[LUN HU] I see you've made
your move at last, my lord.

281
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,250
[XIN]
No doubt about it...

282
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,833
[SOLDIERS yelling]

283
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:14,250
[XIN] ...he is one of the
world's greatest generals!
