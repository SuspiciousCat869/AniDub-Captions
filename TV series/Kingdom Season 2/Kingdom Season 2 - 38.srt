222
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,250
[DIAO, XIN]
Huh?

223
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,375
You took the head
of General Feng Ji,

224
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,708
in the battle you
had against Zhao,

225
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,750
and recently, you also
defeated General Lun Hu

226
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,291
in the war with Wei.

227
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,333
Over here, we have
heard about you.

228
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,958
Qin's brave and young commander.

229
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:39,958
What?

230
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,125
And now you have saved

231
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,583
the country of Xu
in its time of crisis.

232
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:48,083
I can't thank you enough
for what you've done for us.

233
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,583
Wow.

234
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:58,541
So this tiny place really
is a country after all.

235
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,416
You've managed all these years,

236
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,958
where many borders intersect,
and wars don't cease.

237
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,916
Yes. There is a reason

238
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Xu has survived for
all these many years.

239
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,500
I'll explain.

240
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,291
Xu is under the protection

241
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:18,833
of the three kingdoms
of Wei, Zhao and Chu.

242
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:19,750
[DIAO, XIN gasp]

243
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,208
Protection, you say?

244
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,291
But just how would
that be, then?

245
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,416
In these times of war,

246
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,083
knowing the doings of other
lands is really paramount.

247
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,666
Any place where
this special information

248
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,708
can be safely obtained,

249
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,833
would be greatly prized,
as you can see.

250
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,500
[DIAO, XIN]
Hm...

251
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,791
So then,

252
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,500
you provide special
and secret enemy intel

253
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,250
to your three neighbors.

254
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,000
In return, they
guarantee your safety.

255
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,083
In other words,
you make a living

256
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,708
in black-market information.

257
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,708
[CHIEF ELDER]
I offer no defense.

258
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,166
It is what the weak
can do to stay alive,

259
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,125
in a world that is
constantly at war, you see.

260
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,416
[CHIEF ELDER] Xu and its
environs are surrounded

261
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,708
by steep mountains and
swaths of deep, lush forest,

262
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,375
making it extremely difficult

263
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,125
for any outsider
to find us, really.

264
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,541
It's another trait in our favor.

265
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,000
In fact, only the most
important officials

266
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,041
of Wei, Zhao, and Chu,

267
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:34,375
such as their chancellors,
know of Xu's existence.

268
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,250
That is why we can
go on existing

269
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,708
as a mere staging
area for intrigue

270
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,333
with many varied
undercover agents,

271
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,125
under secret orders
from those officials

272
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:49,166
trading with us behind
closed doors, you see.

273
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,416
[XIN, DIAO gasp]

274
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,541
[DIAO]
Hang on...

275
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,666
In a battle between
two kingdoms,

276
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,500
gathering intel on one's enemy

277
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,291
is of the utmost importance,

278
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:05,291
and putting together a strategy
from that intel is essential.

279
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,375
Does Qin have a place that's
just like this, then?

280
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,583
Because, if they do not...

281
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,708
So then, what's with
that Han army, anyway?

282
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,833
I didn't think they
would even know about

283
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,750
this little place, really.

284
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,625
Earlier, a Han squadron
got lost in the woods,

285
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:28,666
and happened to stumble
across Xu over here.

286
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,666
Han came to demand that
we manipulate our intel

287
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,708
to confuse our three neighbors.

288
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,250
[DIAO, XIN gasp]

289
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,416
[CHIEF ELDER] We refused,
as we here stand firmly

290
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,166
on neutral ground.

291
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,958
But you see where that
got us by doing so.

292
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,541
[CHIEF ELDER]
Take this with you, please.

293
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,000
It's a map of the area.

294
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,291
I have drawn in the path
that will lead you

295
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,041
to your destination, Dongjin.

296
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,666
Forgive me, it's my way
to show my gratitude

297
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,583
for saving our country.

298
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,125
Don't worry, Gramps.

299
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,000
We didn't do it for any reward.

300
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:21,500
The map is greatly appreciated.
We didn't even have one.

301
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,083
Do you think you will
be all right without us?

302
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,666
If the Han army attacks again--

303
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,166
I believe that earlier attack

304
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,250
has put the fear of
Xin into them now.

305
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,958
I doubt they'll
return anytime soon.

306
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,916
If not, we can ask our neighbors
for their assistance.

307
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,291
I am positive they
won't stand idly by

308
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,833
in that case.

309
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:48,541
After all, Xu is their crucial
information-clearing house.

310
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,083
So information is
your weapon, isn't it?

311
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,916
Ha, ha. Guess there are lots
of different ways to fight.

312
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,791
Right! Let's head out
to Dongjin, right now!

313
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,708

Hey, it's Xiu!

317
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,875
[XIN] How're your injuries?
You doing okay?

318
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,166
Yeah. But they still hurt.

319
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,375
[XIN laughs] Suck it up!
Those are wounds of honor!

320
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,541
Your efforts here saved
this country, you know!

321

[XIU]
Thanks, mister!

I will never, ever forget you,
for as long as I live!

323
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,750
[XIN]
Yep!

324
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,750
And I definitely will not
forget you either, Xiu!

325
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,166
[XIN]
See ya!

326
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,083
This map is insanely detailed.

327
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,500
According to this,

328
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,000
if we'd not just
stopped at Xu just now,

329
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,208
we would've run into
Wei and Zhao garrisons.

330
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,833
Taking the long way
will still get us

331
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,416
to Dongjin faster,
won't it, then?

332
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,583
[laughs] That's right,
helping people pays off!

333
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,750
[whistle blows]

334
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,583
That's Shi's whistle!

335
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,000
It means he's spotted an enemy!

336
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,458
All troops, halt now!

337
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,291
That's strange.

338
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,875
The chief elder said there
were no enemies here.

339
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,708
Look at them all now.

340
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,625
Three thousand.

341
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,375
But whose are they, exactly?

342
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,083
Can't tell when all
their flags are down.

343
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,291
[DIAO]
And what are they doing here

344
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,416
in the first place?

345
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,291
Xu's chief elder said only
the highest-ranking officials

346
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,916
rom Wei, Zhao,
and Chu even know

347
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,583
these roads exist
in the first place.

348
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,625
So then, these people
must be here

349
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,041
on the orders of a big shot.

350
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,333
Look down.

351
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,333
[XIN]
Whoa! Now that's a big carriage!

352
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,708
So then, are you
really telling me

353
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,208
that the big shot himself
came all the way out here?

354
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,416
[XIN]
The carriage stopped!

355
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,916
Here comes the man in charge.

356
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,375
Well, even if I did
get a look at him,

357
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,000
I wouldn't know
where this guy is fro--

358
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,458
[gasps]

359
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,250
That's Li Mu!

360
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,083
And Kaine!

361
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,750
Commander, they'll see you!

362
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,958
[XIN]
What's going on?

363
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,000
That's Li Mu.

364
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:10,083
What is he doing here?
