[NARRATOR]
The battle for Shanyang ended

2
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,125
in the Qin army's victory,

3
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,083
and the defeated
general, Lian Po,

4
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:50,208
returned to the capital of
Daliang soon thereafter.

5
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,500
[KING JINGMIN]
Li...

6
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,250
Lian Po!

7
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,416
[LIAN PO]
It was an unforgiveable fiasco.

8
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,250
If it is your will, sire,
I understand if you behead me.

9
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,791
[KING JINGMIN]
What are you saying?

10
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,041
I know very well that you made
the best decision possible

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,458
on behalf of the land of Wei
at that given time.

12
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,041
I have not the
slightest intention

13
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,000
of blaming you for this.

14
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,708
However,

15
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:21,583
the most I could do right now
is call off your death sentence.

16
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,916
Forgive me, Lian Po.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,208
I hereby banish you
from the land of Wei.

18
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,125
[NARRATOR] History books
tell us that after leaving Wei,

19
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:36,500
Lian Po was exiled again
to the land of Chu.

20
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,500
There, the Zhao hero, Lian Po,

21
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,291
lived out the rest of his days,

22
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,791
never once returning
to his homeland.

23

[XIANG hums]

24

[YANG]
Xiang!

25
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,583
Morning! You're sure
in a good mood.

26
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,708
Uh, I spent the, um, night.

27
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,083
[YANG]
Huh?

28
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,500
[gasps] Wait a sec, what?

29
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,458
What's that? You don't mean--

30
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,541
No, no, no! Not that! Not that!

31
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,083
No, nothing happened!

32
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,416
Um, it's just, the war is over,

33
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,583
and His Highness
seemed so very happy.

34
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,166
[YANG]
What? What's that about?

35
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,875
So, absolutely nothing is
going on between you two?

36
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,500
I thought that incident earlier
would have set off sparks.

37
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,250
Well, I uh,
it's not like there's

38
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,083
nothing going on
at all, you see.

39
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,625
Huh? What'd you say?

40
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,250
Uh! Oh! No, nothing!

41
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,250

Hm...

[MINISTERS, SOLDIERS chatter]

43
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,541
[LORD CHANGWEN] What's with
that outfit you have?

44
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,208
Do you intend to show up at
the awards ceremony like that?

45
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,875
Huh? Well, what's
wrong with it?

46
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,958
Besides, this is really
all I have, you know!

47
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,375
Well, if armor is permitted,

48
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,166
I suppose that thing
you have is, as well.

49
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,291
Hey, you had me worried there.

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,291
Okay, let's do this.

51
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,375

[XIN laughs]

53
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,500
Is everyone gonna
be praising me?

54
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,375
[chuckles]

55
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,625
You really are something else.

56
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,000
[XIN] An awards ceremony,
how about that!

57
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,458
[XIN] What are you
looking at, old man?

58
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,625
[LORD CHANGWEN]
How far he's come

59
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,583
in such an incredibly
short time.

60
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,000
What are you
lookin' at, old man?

61
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,541
[LORD CHANGWEN] You really are a
big deal now, aren't you, Xin?

62
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,208
What are you doing, old man?

63
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,958
Come on!

64
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,875
[LORD CHANGWEN] The most
powerful members of the Court

65
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,375
will be at today's
ceremony, you know.

66
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,333
Remember your manners,
and behave accordingly!

67
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,458
[XIN]
I know, I know, calm down!

68
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,916
[XIN]
Whoa. This is amazing!

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,125
Um, uh-oh, suddenly
I'm getting nervous.

70
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,791
You idiot! You sit
in back! Move now!

71
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,166
Huh? What old man?

72
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,375
[whispering] Over here, now,
because you are killing me!

73
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,125
[XIN]
Hey! Meng Tian!

74
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,875
Is Wang Ben here?

75
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:31,125
No, the Yu Feng Force is
out there guarding Shanyang.

76
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,333
Huh?

77
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,875
Uh, well, you sure are
dressed weird, man.

78
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:40,708
--Look who's talking!
--Keep it down now, both of you!

79
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,833
All present, salute!

00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,250
[XIN, MENG TIAN gasp]

81
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:49,750
[QIN MINISTER A] The High King
is making his entrance!

82
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,708
[MENG TIAN]
So that's the High King, huh?

83
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,083
Can't see him too well
from back here.

84
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,250
[XIN] Oh! He's got
himself new clothes.

85
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,500
Very well, everyone.

86
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,166
Let the awards
ceremony begin now!

87
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,541
[XIN]
Lü Buwei!

88
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,041
That's right!

89
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:15,041
Almost forgot that half of these
guys are Zheng's enemies.

90
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,666
And first up, then,

91
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,833
are three great men of truly
extraordinary bravery.

92
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,875
These very special three will
receive congratulatory swords

93
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,125
directly from His Majesty.

94
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,791
So then, Lord Changping?

95
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,750
Sir.

96
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,416
First things first,
the commanding general

97
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,458
who led Qin's army to
ultimate grand victory:

98
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,333
General Meng Ao!

99
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,541
[MINISTERS, SOLDIERS cheer]

100
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:47,250
Oh, General Meng Ao!
Listen to those cheers!

101
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,166
[LORD CHANGPING]
The general will go up one rank

102
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,875
in the peerage, and receive
the lands of Jiabai and Chan,

103
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,708
2,000 gold pieces,
and ten treasures.

104
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,125
[MINISTERS, SOLDIERS
cheer, gasp]

105
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,541
You have done well.
Please take care of yourself.

106
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,666
[MENG AO chuckles]
I thank you.

107
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,750
Next up is the lieutenant who
killed the enemy's tactician

108
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,541
and their commanding general:
General Huan Yi!

109
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,708
[MINISTERS, SOLDIERS cheer]

110
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,208
Yeah, way to go, boss!

111
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,666
It's about time!

112
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,458
[LORD CHANGPING] The general
will go up two ranks

113
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,833
in the peerage,

114
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,375
and receive the lands of
Qing Bei, Qinglin, and Dake,

115
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,875
2,000 gold pieces,
and ten treasures.

116
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,458
You have done quite well,
General Huan Yi.

117
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,916
[HUAN YI]
I thank you.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,708
[ZHENG] So this is Huan Yi,
Qin's very own hidden talent.

119
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,583
[HUAN YI]
So this is our king,

120
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,916
the very one who lost
authority to his minister.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,791
How does he look like, anyway?

122

[XIN gasps]

123
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,833
[HUAN YI]
Hmm.

124
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,916
Way to go there, boss man!

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,250
[HUAN YI'S MEN cheer]

126
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,666
[HUAN YI]
What's a coddled puppet doing

127
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,583
with eyes like that, exactly?

128
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:18,750
Why do they give off such
a fierce and haunting light?

129
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,166
Last, but definitely not least,

130
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,583
the man who killed a key enemy
general by himself,

The award goes to
a 300-man commander?

136

A 300-man commander
who served in this war

as an ad-hoc

00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,000
[gasps] He got over his nerves.

161
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,250
[LORD CHANGPING]
To continue,

162
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,458
Xin of the Fei Xin Force
will go up three ranks

163
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,541
in the peerage immediately,

164
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,625
and receive 500 gold pieces,
five treasures,

165
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:50,583
and an official promotion to
become a 1,000-man commander!

166
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:54,375
[XIN] I'm officially a
1,000-man commander?

167
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,583
Yes!

168
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,875
[LORD CHANGPING]
Um, hey now!

169
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,625
[CROWD laughs]

170
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,250
[ZHENG]
Xin of the Fei Xin Force,

171
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,083
you have done well.

172
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,166
[XIN]
What do I do now, Zheng?

173
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,541
Didn't you see the other
two go before you?

174
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:12,375
Go down on one knee
and say "Thank you," now.

175
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,041
[XIN]
I thank you.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,041
[NARRATOR] For some reason, all
those present were enthralled

177
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,666
by the sight of these
two in this very moment.

178
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,833
Despite the difference in rank
between king and commander,

179
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,875
it seemed entirely
fitting, somehow,

180
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,250
to see both of them together.

181
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,500
Such beauty brought a momentary
hush upon the audience,

182
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,166
and then...

183
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,916
[cheers and applause]

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,458
[NARRATOR]
...in the next moment,

185
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,583
the room broke out in
great cheers and applause.

186
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,416
Yet the two in the middle of it
all were just doing their best

187
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,375
to hold back the laughter
welling up within them both.

188
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,833
[XIN, ZHENG chuckle]

189
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,208
[LÜ BUWEI]
Well, that's over.

190
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,750
[LI SI]
Yes, sir.

191
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,916
It is now time for my battle
to start right back once again.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,625
I wonder who will be present
at the next awards ceremony

193
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,375
for it all.

194
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,791
[LÜ BUWEI laughs]

195
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,375
[ZHENG]
What did you expect?

196
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,125
Anyone who knows
the civilian Xin

197
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,791
couldn't help but laugh.

198
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,000
[XIN]
Come on!

199
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,458
It wasn't that easy
doing all that with you!

200
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,458
[XIN, ZHENG laugh]

201
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,708
Oh, right, then.

202
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,000
There's something I really
need to tell you.

203
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,333
[ZHENG]
Huh?

204
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,875
Just being one of the
world's greatest generals

205
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,791
isn't gonna cut it
right now, Zheng.

206
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,666
Looks like my path and yours

207
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,125
have started to overlap,
don't you think?

208
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,958
My path?

209
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,041
A unified Middle Kingdom!

210
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,583
[gasps]

211
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,083
Pull off a real daring feat

212
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,500
we could never have even
dreamed of achieving,

213
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,750
and you shall be
revered by history!

214
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,916
A daring feat?
Like what, then?

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,958
[LIAN PO]
Say, the...

216
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,875
...Unification of
Middle Kingdom!

217
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,583
[ZHENG] I see. So Lian Po
said that, then?

218
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,666
[XIN] Yeah. It's about
overwriting their legends.

219
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,125
And to be able to do that,
we are gonna need

220
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,583
both the military and
the royal might, as well.

221
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,333
And, to be honest,
I just don't really get

222
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,083
all of this "nation"
business whatsoever.

223
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,291
But even I can see
that this would be

224
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,875
a really major deal
for everyone.

225
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,208
It is truly such a huge
undertaking no one's managed.

226
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,416
A huge undertaking, huh?

227
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,083
I like the sound of that!

228
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,583
There are many obstacles

229
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,750
standing between us
and that path, you know.

230
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,916
But I'm telling you, we're
bursting with might over here!

231
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,791
Let's do it then, Zheng!

232
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,666
[ZHENG]
Yes!

233
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,541
[SOLDIERS yell]

234
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,458
[NARRATOR] It was some months
after the awards ceremony,

235
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,791
and skirmishes between
the Qin and Wei armies

236
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,500
were still breaking out
in Lijing, near Shanyang.

237
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,416
[QIN MESSENGER A]
Urgent message!

238
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,541
The first and second units!
They've been destroyed!

239
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,208
Where are the reinforcements?

240
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,375
They-They are here!
It's them!

241
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,708
It's "them"?

242
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,291
Yes! The 1,000-man
indie reserves

243
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,750
that did so splendidly in
the Shanyang Offensive!

244
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,458
[QIN MESSENGER B]
The Fei Xin Force!

245
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,583
[XIN]
Yah!

246
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,125
Let's go! Come on, guys!

247
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:07,750
[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,583
[LU XIAN]
Meng Tian, sir!

249
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,958
Hey, you're back now
again, good work!

250
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,541
How'd it go?

251
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,541
Same as always, we just shoved
them back into the mountains.

252
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,000
That is my
good commander!

253
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,083
Can I ask you
something, Lu Xian?

254
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:32,208
Don't the women of Wei have
a certain glamour to them?

255
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,125
Every one of them
a real beauty!

256
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,500
If I may sir,

257
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,666
there's a strange rumor
going around town right now.

258
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,750
[MENG TIAN hums]

259
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,416
The base on the
front lines of Lijing--

260
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,291
Yeah, where the
Fei Xin Force is now.

261
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,208
They must be riding high

262
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,666
now that they are
a 1,000-man unit.

263
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,500
Those poor Wei troops!

264
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,625
Yes Sir. Precisely,
it's about the Fei Xin Force.

265
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,875
[MENG TIAN]
Hm?

266
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,958
[LU XIAN] Word is
they're on a losing streak

267
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,333
and their commander Xin

268
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,000
is in danger of having
his rank stripped from him.

269
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,625
Huh?

270
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,083
We lost again.

271
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,958
We lost again!

272
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:18,958
Why?!

273
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,333
[FEI XIN FORCE gasps]

274
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,916
What in the world
is going on?

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,416
Ever since we became
the new Fei Xin Force,

276
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,375
we haven't won
a single battle!

277
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,041
Are these battles not
big enough for any of you

278
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,708
to take seriously or what?

279
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,166
Um... Of course
that's not it!

280
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,708
Whoa, Xin.
Don't take it out on us!

281
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,166
Shut it, Wei Ping!

282
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,916
This is what happens when
you guys get fancy new armor

283
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,541
and now you think
you're great stuff!

284
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,458
Please, Xin,
calm down!

285
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,458
Seriously though, guys,

286
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,583
why can't we ever win
all of a sudden, then?

287
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:53,291
The 1,000-man commanders
that we're up against

288
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,083
are not well-known, too.

289
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,958
Maybe Lieutenant
Qiang Lei's leaving

290
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,083
was a really big blow
after all, right?

291
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,166
[SOLDIERS gasp]

292
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,958
Don't say that, Mao.

293
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,208
Qiang Lei didn't win
all of those battles

294
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,458
single-handedly, you know.

295
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,625
Losing just one person
wouldn't make us

296
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,125
this incredibly weak.

297
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,166
[MAO]
It's not just that--

298
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,458
I'm really talking about
the tactics that we're using.

299
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,208
[XIN]
Huh?

300
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,791
Which tactics?

301
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,416
I mean Lieutenant Qiang Lei was
really the one who came up with

302
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,083
absolutely all of the
strategies we've used.

303
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,208
[SOLDIERS gasp]

304
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,833
Oh, now that you mention it.

305
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,375
But at the moment,
Lieutenant Chu Shui's

306
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,958
taken over that same position.

307
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,500
He's not doing it.

308
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,958
Chu Shui's too busy
to be handing supplies

309
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,458
and stuff like that right now.

310
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:43,125
So, who's doing our strategies
if he's not doing them?

311
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,416
It's me and Yuan.

312
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,750
[FEI XIN FORCE gasp]

313
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,791
[FEI XIN FORCE]
That's it?!

314
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,250
Do you jokers realize
what you've done?

315
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,166
How many injuries
have we suffered

316
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,500
because of the two of you?

317

Now wait just
a minute, here!

Suddenly you're blaming our
strategies for all our losses?

blame at, you big fool?

Enough already
with this, Xin!

You do realize

322
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,833
you're only barely smarter
than a rock, right?

323
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,750
Yeah Xin,
this is too much!

[XIN grunts]

325
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,666

Oh, Meng Tian!

328
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,750
Um, hi guys.

329
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,000
[XIN]
So, you see?

330
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,958
I say we charge in like, tada!

331
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,416
And then we go all kaboom,

332
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,625
and then the cavalry's all
like kapow, right over here,

333
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,916
and then we win!

You see? Not half bad,
am I right?

335
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,333
Uh, did you seriously fight
with that very strategy

336
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,291
you just said?

337
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,666
[XIN]
Well, sure.

338
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,541
But how were you
not all wiped out?

339
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,708
[WEI PING]
You see? You see?

340
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,875
[QU HAI] I knew our
strategies were bad!

341
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,041
[MENG TIAN] Doesn't anyone else
have a knack for tactics here?

342
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,166
[QU HAI]
No, not really.

343
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,125
I mean we all started out as
country soldiers, you see.

344
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,833
How about on
Guo Bei's squad?

345
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,541
Because surely they must have
had a tactician on hand

346
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,875
that they could spare.

347
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,000
No way! We were all about
the brawn here, you see.

348
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,875
We left all of the strategizing
to Guo Bei himself!

349
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,666
You see? So clearly
we gotta keep up with-- Ah!

350
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,750
[FEI XIN FORCE]
Enough!

Hey, this is serious!

I'm... being serious, too!

353
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,875
[MENG TIAN]
Listen up,

354
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,541
right now the Fei Xin Force
is in a really bad spot.

355
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,750
We can't have the reinforcements
losing to everyone all the time.

356
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,375
And these rumors about
you being demoted.

357
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,000
Honestly they do have the
ring of truth to them, Xin.

358
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,583
[WEI PING]
S-Seriously?

359
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,625
[MENG TIAN] But there's
no good way to fix this

360
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,791
within your unit.

361
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,250
You've had relatively
few casualties

362
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,875
because your foes
haven't been that tough.

363
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,416
So you know,

364
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,750
right now, the 300 members
of the Le Hua Force

365
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,916
could wipe the floor with you.

366
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,708
Aahh! That's super bad news!

367
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,458
But what do we do?

368
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,583
Guess it's come to this.

369
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,666
We have to try to get Lieutenant
Qiang Lei back quickly--

370
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,833
[XIN]
No way!

[WEI PING]
Uh, but it's--

372
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,958
No way that's happening.

[sighs]

374
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,916
Well all right, then.

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,708
You did help us out greatly back
at Grandpa's main camp before.

00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,375
Then I'll take this chance
to return you the favor.

377
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,541
Uh, how exactly?

378
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,916
I'll call in an excellent
tactician I know

379
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,416
to serve the Fei Xin Force.

380
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
A-A tactician?

381
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,166
[MENG TIAN] Well, he's my
little brother, but still.

382
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,416

Cut it out!

[MENG TIAN] Look, just listen
to what I'm saying here!

385
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,250
A 1.000-man unit is
really too big to fight

386
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,958
on momentum alone.

387
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:47,250
You absolutely need someone who
could put together strategies!

come to boss us around

to be a tactician?

out of nowhere?

Nope! I don't like this!

Hey Xin, you know we're in
no position to complain at all!

Since Meng Tian had
that talk with us,

399
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,625
we haven't won
a single battle!

400

That's five losses
in a row, five!

401

mean we have to rely

on outsiders now?

right here, Meng Tian's brother?

often have strong bonds

among their members,

411
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,000
but can feel just as strongly

412
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,666
about not letting
outsiders in as well.

413
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,875
Even the Fei Xin Force, which
started with only 100 men,

414
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,458
showed signs of this fact.

415
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,708
I can't entrust their lives
to orders from someone

However, come their next battle,

the Fei Xin Force
lost yet again.

419
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,458
Qin lost a crucial bridge,
and Lijing's defense

was forced back onto
the far bank of the river.

their new tactician
