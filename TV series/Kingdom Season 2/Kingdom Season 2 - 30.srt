00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,083
[NARRATOR]
In the middle of a fierce battle

2
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,041
between Qin and Wei,
they meet again:

3
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,958
Xin and Lun Hu.

4
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,166
Which of them will be
able to overcome his limits

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,708
and have his own way
in the end?

6
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:53,750
Their blistering-hot emotions
truly are making sparks fly!

7
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,541
[XIN 'Cause right now,
he won't get up again.

8
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:04,541
No way could he get... up...

9
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:19,333
Lun Hu, you rat!

10
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:24,500
Well, my lord is
waiting for me.

11
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:29,083
I can't possibly
lose here now.

12
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,333
I simply cannot lose now.

13
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:54,500
Because I am the heaven-sent
Sword of Lian Po, you see.

14
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,583
[XIN gasps]

15
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,041
[XIN]
Heaven--

16
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,041
[LUN HU]
Only a handful of generals.

17
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,833
are adored by the heavens.

18
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,916
It was destiny.

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,375
For my lord to have
rescued me like he did,

20
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,958
from the very brink of death.

21
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,541
It was written in the stars.

22
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,375
[XIN]
Rescued? By Lian Po?

23
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,541
[LUN HU] It started as an
all-too-common tale.

24
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,708
A tiny village, caught up
in the horrors of war.

25
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,833
Its inhabitants all dead.

26
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:35,375
But my little sister and I
managed to survive, somehow,

27
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,500
Only to wait
death by starvation.

28
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,875
[LUN HU] I honestly don't recall
how many days went by.

29
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,583
[LUN HU]
And then,

30
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,458
I met him.

31
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,875
There's a little boy survivor.

32
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,083
Give him water and
something to eat.

33
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,541
[LIAN PO UNDERLING A]
Sir.

34
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:10,000
I am grateful, but please,
first, my little sister.

35
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,333
Help her please, sir.

36
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,125
I can't help her.

37
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,583
[gasps]

38
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,125
[LUN HU] Heaven help me,
I hadn't noticed until then:

39
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:32,166
My sister had long since
passed away next to me.

40
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,875
[LUN HU laughs]

41
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,875
[LUN HU] That part about my
sister wasn't relevant.

42
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,333
Still, the great
general Lian Po

43
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,291
had saved my life.

44
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,125
Do you think
it was coincidence?

45
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,541
Someone like me, with my
innate talent for warfare

46
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,791
in that setting of need,
and Lian Po?

47
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:59,583
A genius that is then saved
by a great military genius?

48
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,083
It's like Xuan Feng
always used to say,

49
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:10,125
only a handful of generals are
adored by the heavens, you see.

50
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,833
Lian Po truly
was one of them,

51
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,083
and the heavens
introduced him to me,

52
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,333
his very own sword.

53
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,000
Therefore, I--

54
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,125
I cannot lose, not here
and not right now--

55
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,541
[XIN]
It's all lies!

56
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,750
To hear you say that everything
simply comes down

57
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,833
to something as
intangible as fate!

58
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,583
That isn't it!

59
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,666
We're fighting here!
All of us, on our own two feet!

60
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,791
Even the person you are today is
the result of risking your life

61
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,291
and fighting your butt off
to be Lian Po's sword!

62
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:55,750
But, I know how important
chance encounters can be.

63
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,583
I mean, you ran into
Lian Po and I, later on,

64
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,541
I met and grew up
with a man who,

65
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,708
without a shadow of a doubt,
would've been even greater

66
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:05,791
than Lian Po.

67
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,000
[gasping]

68
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,958
Wei Ping!

69
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,291
Uh-huh.

70
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,083
[WEI PING]
Piao!

71
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,416
I'm lucky that he
gave me a dream.

72
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,708
And he died way too soon.

73
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:33,125
Instead, I met someone else,
someone even more incredible.

74
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,583
[XIN]
Then, absolutely every single

75
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:41,083
of my irreplaceable allies,
who'd come and gone.

76
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,625
And the person

77
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,583
who'd be the sensible
guidepost along my path.

78
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,041
Maybe you'd say
that isn't coincidence,

79
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,500
and maybe you're correct.

80
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,958
But I can't see some
fickle heaven and hand it in!

81
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,916
I'm simply carrying my
memories of all those people

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,916
along with me in my path!

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,416
Lun Hu!

84
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,000
Fighting you has given me
the strength to keep going on!

85
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,708
[laughs]

86
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,333
Well said.

87
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,500
So, since you're the
one who's going to die.

88
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
[grunting]

89
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,500
[LUN HU]
You are definitely right, Xin.

90
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,791
That first meeting is
down to fate.

91
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,083
But the rest is up to us.

92
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,375
[LUN HU] However, heaven does
make miracles happen, sometimes.

93
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,416
[LUN HU]
My lord...

94
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,500
[LUN HU]
Wang Yi has died,

95
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,333
then the formidable
Li Mu appeared,

96
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,541
and a youthful power
is coming into bud

97
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,708
in the Qin army right now.

98
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:02,416
I suppose this age is moving
into the next war-torn era.

99
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,708
[LUN HU]
In fact,

100
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,750
my duties perhaps may have
come to an end, finally,

101
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:15,541
when my lord went into exile
and left the front lines.

102
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,041
[LUN HU] But still,
my fighting here today

103
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,208
may well be according
to divine plan.

104
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,583
You really were strong,
Xin of the Fei Xin Force.

105
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,041
[XIN growls]

106
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,958
[LUN HU]
Xin.

107
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,291
[LUN HU]
In time, you too...

108
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,208
[LUN HU screams]

109
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:18,916
Lun Hu, you were one
incredibly tricky enemy,

110
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,375
set for death a
thousand times.

111
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,000
[FEI XIN FORCE yells]

112
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,791
Finally! He won!

113
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,291
He defeated Lun Hu!

114
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,916
One of Lian Po's
Big Four is no more!

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,458
So that means--

116
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,625
Right!

117
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,458
We got the general's
head that we needed,

118
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,166
that miserable little rat!

119
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,041
[FEI XIN FORCE cheers]

120
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,791
Wang Ben, sir, it's--

121
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,666
[WANG BEN]
I hear it.

122
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,083
[LUN HU SOLDIER A]
Lun Hu, sir!

123

[LUN HU SOLDIER B]
Darn!

124
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,708
The enemy--Lun Hu's troops!

125
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,250
[FORMER GUO BEI SOLDIER A]
Leave them to us, now!

126
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,625
[FORMER GUO BEI SOLDIER B]
Guo Bei's men

127
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,083
will most definitely give them a
heck of a send-off!

128
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,916
[gasps] Xin! Hurry please,
and take his head!

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,625
You've got to parade it
right here so people know!

130
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,625
[XIN]
Lun Hu.

131
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,500
[YUAN]
Xin.

132
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,541
There's no need for that now!
The truth will just get out!

133
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,625
Spread the word that
Commander Xin

134
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,208
has defeated the enemy
general Lun Hu!

135
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,083
[FEI XIN FORCE yelling]

136
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,750
[YUAN]
How's Lieutenant Chu Shui?

137
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,125
I believe his wound
doesn't look fatal!

138
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,500
We just need to stop
the bleeding now!

139
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,958
That's good!

140
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,208
Hey, Wei Ping?

141
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,541
Yeah.

142
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,291
It does looks like
everything worked out

143
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,458
all right for us, anyway.

144
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,666
Huh? What is wrong,
Long Chuan?

145
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,166
Something's a little off.

146
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,666
Back where we left Lieutenant
Qiang Lei and the others--

147
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,833
there's no sign of anyone.

148
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,750
[WEI SOLDIER B laughs]

149
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,416
Did you honestly
think this was over?!

150
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,375
You bunch of simpletons!

151
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,583
General Lun Hu had a
separate army of reserves,

152
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,625
that was moving
alongside this main unit!

153
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,500
That way we could strike
where there were fewer troops

154
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,958
while you were all concentrated
here, you naive idiots!

155
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,916
Huh? What's that?

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,083
If that's where you
left your little buddies,

157
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:49,000
they are all definitely being
wiped out right about now!

158
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,083
[laughs]

159
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,000
Those reserves
are the private army of

160
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,500
General Jie Zifang,

161
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,250
and as you know,
they're 500 strong!

162
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,375
[laughs]

163
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,916
I have had enough of
this foolishness now!

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,166
Long Chuan! Look for them!

165
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,666
You can't see them?

166
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,333
I-In this rain,
this far away?

167
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,583
No, Xin!

168
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,291
[SONG ZUO]
We're coming too!

169
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,666
[FEI XIN FORCE yells]

170
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,250
You dumb invaders.
Serves you right!

171
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,250
[XIN]
Qiang Lei.

172
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,166
I'll see you later.

173
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,625
Yeah.

174
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,041
Qiang Lei!

175
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,458
[NARRATOR] At this time,
it was about one hour

176
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,750
before Xin claimed
Lun Hu's head.

177
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:50,833
Qiang Lei and 200 soldiers
had been left at the rear.

178
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,625
What's up
with the commander?

179
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,458
I think he's going
one-on-one with Lun Hu,

180
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,333
but it's hard
to tell from here.

181
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,833
Huh?

182
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,791
[SOLDIERS yelling]

183
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,583
[QIANG LEI]
What is that about?

184
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,333
A-A wave of foes!

185
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,916
And they're huge!

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,708
The infantry's scattering
like so many twigs!

187
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,958
Incoming!

188
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,625
[FOOT SOLDIER B]
What's the hold up, reserves?

189
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,291
Get in here and help us!

190
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,625
Hurry up!

191
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,583
But we don't have a remote
chance at stopping that!

192
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,041
You fool! What are you saying?

193
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,958
That's exactly what
us reserves are here for!

194
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,250
[WOUNDED SOLDIER C]
B-but.

195
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,000
[WOUNDED SOLDIER D]
Let's go!

196
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,416
[QIANG LEI]
We shouldn't be going.

197
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,375
With these troops,
and me like this...

198
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,916
...we can't stop them.

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,333
Hurry up now, Fei Xin Force!

200
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,583
Lieutenant!

201
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:50,000
[WOUNDED SOLDIERS yelling]

202
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,333
[QIANG LEI]
Xiang...

203
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,875
[QIANG LEI] I won't be able to
avenge my sister if I'm dead.

204
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,666
If we go through,
we're just as good as dead!

205
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,083
Shouldn't we just--

206
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,458
Don't say that nonsense!
You're from the Fei Xin Force!

207
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:09,000
Our beloved commander is risking
his life in battle as we speak!

208
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,458
[QIANG LEI gasps]

209
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,541
[QIANG LEI]
I'm sorry, Xiang.

210
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,541
Right now, I'm a lieutenant
of the Fei Xin Force.

211
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,666
Come on!

212
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,291
[WOUNDED SOLDIERS shouting]

213
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,958
[QIANG LEI] Darn it!
Have I always been this stupid?

214
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,333
[QIANG XIANG]
You must be careful, Qiang Lei.

215
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,750
Spend time with fools and
you'll wind up one yourself.

216
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,166
[QIANG LEI]
That explains it.

217
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,625
[WOUNDED SOLDIER A]
Lieutenant Qiang Lei...

218
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,833
...is smiling?

219
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:51,291
[yelling, screaming]

220
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,500
[WEI PING]
They're all... dead now...

221
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,666
[TIAN YONG]
Darnit!

222
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,375
Where's Lieutenant
Qiang Lei and the rest?

223
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,666
[QU HAI]
Commander!

224
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,041
[XIN]
Huh?

225
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,416
He's still got life in him!
He's from my old squad!

226
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,333
So what happened here?

227
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:29,000
I-I'm sorry.
They were much too strong.

228
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,916
We were helpless.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,666
But...

230
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,666
Lieutenant Qiang Lei, in spite
of his own deep pain, he...

231
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,583
...he alone did...

232
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,250
Qiang Lei, you say?

233
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,791
[TAI GUAN] Apologies.
We were utterly useless.

234
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,791
They were just... too terrible.

235
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,125
The lieutenant, the lieutenant--

236
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,958
[QIANG LEI
This is... the only home I have.

237
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,833
To go back to now...

238
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,250
That's why...
I'm leaving when this battle--

239
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,000
[QIANG LEI]
--is finally over and done with.

240
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:07,250
I don't know how many months,
how many years it will take,

241
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,541
but I will have my revenge.

242
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,541
[QIANG LEI] And once I have,

243
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,500
when I come back
here, finally then...

244
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:20,208
[XIN] Cut it out.
This isn't funny Qiang Lei.

245
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,500
[QIANG LEI]
...I think I should be

246
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,333
able to move forward,
with you guys

247
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,291
in the Fei Xin Force,
you'll all be my home.

248
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:37,583
[XIN] What is she doing?
That colossal idiot!

249
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,875
Where are you, Qiang Lei?!

250
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,333
[XIN gasps]

251
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:49,083
Oh no! A bunch of
massive soldiers over here.

252
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,458
Are these Jie
Zifang's men, then?

253
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,750
[WEI PING]
And all of 'em wiped out.

254
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,541
What on earth?

255
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,916
Not... human...

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,750
[gasps]

257
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,916
Th-That thing is not human.

258
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,416
[QIANG LEI]
Oh.

259
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,333
It's just you.

260
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,750
[XIN]
Qiang Lei!

261
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,041
[XIN]
What are you, nuts?!

262
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,958
How could you let things
get this bad?!

263
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,791
How are you going to
avenge your sister

264
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,916
if you're just dead?

265
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,083
How mean. I did
the best that I could.

266
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,416
Are you done... with your thing?

267
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,750
[XIN]
It's done.

268
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,083
I killed Lun Hu and everything.

269
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,625
[QIANG LEI]
I see...

270
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,333
Xin?

271
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,500
[QIANG LEI]
Let me go. Your stupid spreads.

272
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,166
[XIN]
Be quiet!

273
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,750
[FOOT SOLDIER C] Is Lieutenant
Qiang Lei really all right?

274
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,583
Yeah, he's over here!

275
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,333
You mean to say that he
killed these brutes alone?

276
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,708
He is certainly not a human.

277
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:32,958
There he is!

278
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,416
[FOOT SOLDIER D] What are the
sergeant and the rest

279
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,875
doing over there?

280
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,000
[TIAN YONG]
No way...

281
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,791
[YUAN]
It can't be...

282
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,875
[WEI PING]
Q-Qiang Lei...

283
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,541
...is a woman?

284
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,291
What is the meaning of this?

285
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:03,333
Don't tell us that you knew
that Qiang Lei was a woman!

286
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,666
[TIAN YONG]
Did the cat get your tongue?

287
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,958
[WEI PING]
How long did you know?

288
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,750
[FEI XIN FORCE yelling]

289
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,583
[QU HAI]
You need to explain!

290
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,833
[TIAN YQU]
Quit your yelping, everyone!

291
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,500
[gasping]

292
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,291
[TIAN YQU] How many times did
Qiang Lei save your skins, huh?

293
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,250
What could it possibly matter
at this stage if she's a woman?!

294
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,750
Think about it for a minute,

295
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,458
mastering such sword
skills with her female body,

296
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,666
mingling with men on
the battlefield.

297
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,833
What a massive burden
she must bear!

298
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,208
[XIN]
You got it backwards.

299
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:46,333
Turns out she's
empty inside, you see.

300
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:50,708
There was a real harsh rule,
back where she grew up.

301
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,708
And under that rule,

302
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:57,375
she fully intended to die for
the big sister she grew up with.

303
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,791
[XIN] But in the end,
her sister was killed,

304
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,791
and she survived
through real adversity.

305
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,166
[XIN] Ever since then,
she's been on a journey

306
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,666
to avenge her sister.

307
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,125
For someone like her,
that's all there is.

308
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,916
Getting revenge was
her only purpose in life.

309
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:24,458
Certainly, she might've
planned on dying

310
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,291
as soon as she got that
revenge of hers.

311
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:35,666
Lately, she really had been
changing, little by little.

312
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,125
Moving from the revenge.
Beyond it, even.

313
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,208
Finding a place where
she could be at last:

314
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,708
[XIN]
The Fei Xin Force.

315
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,833
[XIN] Now I'm not going to
tell you to pretend

316
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,916
you didn't notice.

317
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,708
Just treat her the same
as always, okay?

318
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,291
After all,

319
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,291
she's a really
amazing friend to have.

320
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,041
It's gonna be
all right, Xin, sir.

321
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,083
Tian YRu is quite right:

322
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,333
Qiang Lei is Qiang Lei,
like always.

323
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,083
This doesn't change anything.

324
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,500
[WEI PING]
But something has to change!

325
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,250
Wei Ping.

326
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,875
One day the enemy is bound to
find out she's really a woman!

327
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,916
Soon, there will be guys
starting to come after her,

328
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,750
and if they capture her,
they'll do awful things to her!

329
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,000
We gotta make sure
that doesn't happen.

330
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,000
We are definitely major
weaklings compared to Qiang Lei,

331
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,333
but we gotta start keeping
her safe from harm,

332
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,125
little by little, you guys!

333
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,000
That about sums it up.

334
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,708
Ha! Since when did
Wei Ping make any sense?

335
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,083
Heck, I think you are the one

336
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,916
who needed the
most saving of all!

337
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,958
[WEI PING gasps]

338
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,541
You and your posing!

339
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,166
[WEI PING]
Oh, be quiet!

340
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,333
[FEI XIN FORCE laughs]

341
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,416
[LONG YQU]
Toughen up, will you, Wei Ping?

342
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,083
[WEI PING]
Be quiet, I said!

343
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,333
[XIN]
Glad you're here, Qiang Lei.

344
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,541
[LU YAN] Us old-timers will tend
to Lieutenant Qiang Lei

345
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,458
and her needs from now on,
don't you worry.

346
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,625
[XIN]
Thanks, Lu Yan.

347
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,625
[WEI PING] You'll need
some attention too, Xin.

348
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,000
[XIN]
Yeah.

349
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,625
--Ow!
--Can you stand?

350
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,041
Just stop the bleeding on
my leg right now.

351
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,416
And bring me a horse,
immediately.

352
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,791
Hey, Yuan!

353
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,583
How's their army look?

354
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,500
Sir, their momentum
has slowed down now,

355
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,583
with word of Lun Hu's death,

356
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,291
but they haven't fallen
completely yet.

357
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,333
probably because Lun Hu
was just not a native born

358
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:54,750
Wei general, and because an
invaded people's morale

359
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,291
is not easily broken.

360
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,416
But we do have the upper hand.

361
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,208
[YUAN]
For now.

362
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,250
[XIN] Sorry Yuan,
can you take over for me?

363
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,583
[YUAN gasps]

364
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,500
Xin, you can't mean...

365
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,125
Yeah.

366
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,958
There's one last place
I got to go now.
