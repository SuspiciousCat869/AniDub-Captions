00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,000
[NARRATOR] 262 BC:
the era of King Zhao of Qin,

2
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,166
the dreaded "God of Battle."

3
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,500
The kingdoms of
Qin and Zhao clashed

4
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:51,375
in the former Han lands
of Shangdang.

5
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,791
Their deciding battle
was in Changping.

6
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,833
Qin's commanding
general was Bai Ki,

7
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,166
Zhao's was Lian Po.

8
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,958
But both kingdoms were evenly
matched in this great battle,

9
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,416
and it went on for two years
with no end in sight.

10
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,250
[NARRATOR]
Having run out of patience

11
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,125
with this stagnant situation,

12
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,250
the King of Zhao made
a most foolish decision,

13
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,833
replacing commanding
general Lian Po

14
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,458
with the hot-blooded
young general Zhao Kuo.

15
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:32,208
After two years of deadlock,
the floodgates opened wide.

[ZHAO SOLDIERS groan, yell]

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,291
[ZHAO KUO]
An ambush!

19
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,125
So they've sniffed out
our suicide force?

20
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,000
[ZHAO KUO grunts]

21
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,500
That's the
Qin army lieutenant!

22
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,958
I am the Zhao army
commanding general, Zhao Kuo!

23
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,958
I have no business
with a mere lieutenant!

24
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,083
[WANG YI] Two years of
intense war are now ruined,

25
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,916
all because of you.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,291
May death give you a
fresh start, you silly man.

27
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,791
[NARRATOR]
In the ninth month of 260 BC,

28
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,666
the opposing army
under the defeated

29
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,333
commanding general Zhao Kuo,
raised the white flag,

30
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,041
with 400,000
troops surrendering.

31
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:43,041
However, here Bai Ki
issued a fearsome command.

32
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,125
[NARRATOR]
He ordered every last one

33
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:00,416
of the surrendering Zhao
troops to be buried alive.

34
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
[NARRATOR]
All 400,000 of them!

35
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,291
[NARRATOR] How deep the sorrow
and anger of the families

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,750
of those 400,000
slain must run!

37
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,791
[NARRATOR] How intense
and deep the curses

38
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,541
the Zhao people wished
upon the Qin people were!

39

[baby cries]

40
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,375
[NARRATOR] But... some months
after this atrocity,

41
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:38,125
a child of Qin royalty was born
in the Zhao capital of Handan.

42
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,625
That small infant was me.

43
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,958
My father, his name was
Zi Chu at the time, you see,

44
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,750
he had been handed over to
Zhao as a hostage back then.

45
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,958
And yet,
our King Zhao was still

46
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,625
preparing for battle with Zhao.

47
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,666
[gasps]

48
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't be surprised.

49
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,666
That is just
politics for you, Xiang.

50
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,791
[XIANG]
Um. But he survived.

51
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,666
[ZHENG] Yes, but Zhao was
planning to assassinate him.

52
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,916
However, a man
paid off the killer

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,750
and freed my father afterwards.

54
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,916
And so, how did Your Highness
return with him then after?

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,541
No.

56
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:28,291
My mother and I
were left behind in Zhao.

[ZHENG] Hm. Mmm.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,958
Why is it ever
since seeing my mother,

62
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,333
that this wound's
been throbbing?

Do you think so?

Yes. Usually Your Highness
reads so hungrily

but that's just
not the case tonight.

voracious, you think?

I-I didn't mean it like that.

[XIANG] Zi Xia?

[ZHENG] You mentioned
a Hika earlier today

109

but her name is Zi Xia.

110

[gasps] So what, um,
what kind of person is she?

111
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:39,083
[ZHENG] She was the head of
Handan's black marketeers

112
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:45,166
when I became indebted
to her... for saving my life.

What's this "under
consideration" you said?

120
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,666
Aren't you here in Handan

121
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,875
because you've accepted
the task already?

122
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,666
Not quite.
We've come here to decide

123
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,666
whether we should
accept or not.

124
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,416
So why not just tell us
the plan already then?

125
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,666
You black marketeers
shouldn't press your luck.

126
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,125
This plan is quite crucial
to our kingdom--

127
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,083
we won't reveal it so readily.

128

And if we ever do
decide to tell you, somehow,

129
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,083
we will have to
kill you swiftly after.

130
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,541
Now look who's actually
pressing his luck?

Don't you get it yet?

This is Handan, my old friend!

you're really from Qin,

00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,666
when you look up at it right
from the very depths of sorrow.

316
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,666
Almost as if it's laughing at
you from up above in the skies.

317
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,208
"Don't give me that!"

318
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,750
That's how I used to
gaze at the moon

319
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,791
once upon a time, you see.

320
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,500
But then someone showed me

321
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,000
that wasn't how it was at all.

322
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:21,416
My adopted father,
a wandering peddler.

323
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:27,208
We--I mean, me and Ya Men,
and Jiang Zhang too,

324
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,125
the guys from earlier today--

325
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:33,083
my father saved all us once,
from the brink of starvation.

326
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,791
These are the words
he left me with then:

327
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,333
"The moon shines
brighter than usual

328
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:45,583
just to cheer you up,
and carry you onward."

329
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,416
[ZHENG gasps]

330
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,416
[ZHENG]
I'm going out, Mother.

331
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,833
[TOWNSMAN 207C]
It's Zheng! There he is again!

332
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,208
--[TOWNSMEN shouting]
--[ZHENG panting]

333
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,041
[ZHENG]
Uh!

334
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,625
[ZHENG]
Uh. Hello?

335
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,833
I'm back. Mother?

336
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,458
[ZHENG gasps]

337
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,041
[ZHENG]
More men again?

338
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,541
[DAO JIAN]
Wait Zheng, my lord!

339
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,375
We have come here for you!

340
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,916
[ZHENG gasps]

341
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,333
[DAO JIAN] We deeply regret
your long years of suffering!

342
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,666
My lord Zheng!

343
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,083
The time has come for you
to return to Qin again!

344
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,958
You are going
back to Qin now!

345
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,583
[ZHENG]
To... Qin?

346
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,250
[DAO JIAN] King Zhao has
passed away, and your father

347
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,416
has become the crown prince.

348
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,208
That means he will
be the next king,

349
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:34,041
and after him, the next
king will be you, Zheng!

350
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,916
[ZHENG gasps]
Me, King?

351
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,291
[screaming]

352
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,333
[DAO JIAN]
Lord Zheng?

353
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,291
What is the matter,
Lord Zheng?

354
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,958
[TIAN CI] Oh no!
Quickly take him to the cart!

355
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,000
[YA MEN] Those old fellows
are planning on

356
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,958
doing it all themselves!

357
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,583
[JIANG ZHANG]
It won't work.

358
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,500
Those two can't
even leave Handan.

359
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,666
Hey Zi Xia!
They're heading out!

360
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,708
What's up?
You've been awfully quiet.

361
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,125
[ZI XIA]
Hmmm.

362
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,541
Having second thoughts?

363
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,583
[ZI XIA]
Not at all guys.

364
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,750
Jiang Zhang. Ya Men.

365
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,500
Have you both forgotten
about our adopted father?

366
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,166
Have you both forgotten
the hand that rescued us

367
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,750
from a certain death?

368
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,666
Wait, what is all of this?

369
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,916
Of course we haven't
forgotten, Zi Xia.

370
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,875
[ZI XIA]
Then you'll understand.

371
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:31,291
Standing before us now
is one young boy.

372
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,625
A boy who will likely
be killed at once

373
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,708
if no one offers him a hand.

374
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:41,666
[ZI XIA] So then, what second
thoughts could we have?

375
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,958
Our choice is crystal clear.
Wouldn't you say, guys?

376
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,541
[DAN YUAN] Are you sure
we can get him out of here

377
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,208
on our own, Dao Jian sir?

378
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,791
We have no choice!

379
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,625
There's absolutely no time to
revise the plan at this stage!

380
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,000
--[TIAN CI] L-Lord Dao Jian!
--[DAO JIAN] Aah!

381
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,083
[ZI XIA] You'll need
some real preparation

382
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,166
to slip through the gates
this late at night.

383
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,125
Ugh! It's you again!

384
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,000
We accept the job.

385
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:16,833
By the name of Zi Xia,
the black marketeer,

386
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,833
I'll deliver Lord Zheng
to the Kingdom of Qin.
